Following morning \nbusiness, we will consider S. 15, the bioshield bill. Last night we \nreached agreement to allow for up to 2 hours of debate and a vote on \npassage of this important piece of legislation. We have been working on \nbringing the bioshield bill to the Senate floor for quite some time. I \nam pleased we are finally able to vote on passage on this measure.\n  Following passage of Project Bioshield, we will resume consideration \nof the Department of Defense authorization. Pending is the Lautenberg \namendment on sanctions. That amendment has been under review, and \nMembers may well want to speak on that issue.\n  Yesterday Chairman Warner indicated it was his desire to reach \nagreement for an amendment filing deadline. I hope that is possible. We \nshould set a time certain for Senators to file their defense amendments \nto the bill so the two managers may begin to try to clear amendments on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  Finally, I remind everyone we will be scheduling votes on judicial \nnominations as we go forward, and rollcall votes will be anticipated \nthroughout the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/19/senate-section/article/S5729-6", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, very briefly, I want to comment on what has \nbeen a real focus for the Senate and our various committees; that is, \nthe revelations of abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. It has been \na shock to the Nation and indeed to the world. The photographs we \nreviewed last week are appalling to all of us. America is clearly \noutraged at the scandal, ashamed, as we all should be. But it all \ncenters on the fact that a very few have tarnished the reputations and \nthe honor of a great many people representing the United States of \nAmerica.\n  That is why this body, the Senate, has and must continue to act \nswiftly and fully investigate, to the best of our ability, the \nincidents of abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison and hold accountable those \nresponsible and take bold corrective actions where necessary to ensure \nthat those incidents never occur again.\n  This body has acted in a quick and deliberate manner to get to the \nbottom of this matter. Over the past 2 weeks, we have had a series of \nhearings. There is a hearing going on in Armed Services now, the second \nday the Senate Armed Services Committee has held a meeting. The \nIntelligence Committee held their hearings. The Appropriations \nCommittee has continued to hear from the Defense Department and other \nagencies on the matter. Our committees are working aggressively in \nterms of oversight, taking very appropriate action. We have received \nhours of testimony from administration officials and senior military \nofficers. Members have had the opportunity to review the photos that \ndepict some of the offensive acts.\n  This morning, for the last hour, the Armed Services Committee has \nbeen holding a hearing. The witnesses include General Abizaid, \nCommander of Central Command; Lieutenant General Sanchez, Commander of \nthe coalition\n\n[[Page S5730]]\n\nforces in Iraq; and Major General Miller, who is now in charge of the \nAbu Ghraib prison.\n  I mention all of this because we are aggressively investigating and \nthe Defense Department is cooperating fully in these inquiries and has \nbeen responsive to all of our requests. I am confident the Defense \nDepartment is investigating this matter thoroughly, both within and its \nrelationships to other agencies as well. I am confident they are taking \nactions to ensure these acts never occur again. This is all essential \nif we will be successful, which I know we can be, in bringing democracy \nand the rule of law to Iraq and restoring the respect and confidence \nmany people have historically had in our military.\n  Last week Secretary Rumsfeld's trip with General Myers occurred. That \nwas a very important trip. It was a boost to the morale of the \nthousands and thousands of Americans who are serving so nobly in Iraq, \nour men and women who are fighting for democracy and freedom. I commend \nthe Secretary and General Myers for making the trip.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld has demonstrated tremendous leadership throughout \nthe last several weeks and months and tremendous character in his \npresentations, helping us to understand what happened there so we can \nall take corrective action. I commend Secretary Rumsfeld for his \ntremendous leadership and courage in addressing this matter of prisoner \nabuse, but also his leadership in the global war on terrorism. He has \nbeen a superb Secretary of Defense who really deserves the thanks of a \ngrateful Nation, and we are thankful for his leadership in these very \ndifficult times.\n  While I know there are going to be many more difficult days ahead on \nthe prisoner abuse scandal, I am confident the Senate will continue to \ndo what is right and necessary to ensure that justice prevails and such \nterrible acts never happen again.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/19/senate-section/article/S5730-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, first, I wish to indicate that I share \nmuch of the sentiment expressed by the distinguished majority leader \nabout the importance of the oversight responsibilities that we hold to \nbe very critical in this difficult and challenging time. I want to \nsingle out, in particular, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee \nfor his valiant effort in trying to establish just what went wrong, why \nit went wrong, and how we can prevent it from occurring again. He has \nbeen criticized, in some cases, by members of his own party. I think \nthat is very unfortunate. I think we have a role and that role ought \nnot to be minimized at times of crises.\n  I think we ought to take these investigations where the facts lead \nus. I do believe other committees ought to be involved as well, and in \nsome cases they are.\n  I also compliment the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senator Lugar, who always seems to be as engaged, in a \nconstructive way, as anyone can be given his responsibilities. I think \nhe ought to be recognized as well.\n  There is work that should be done on the Judiciary Committee, \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, and other committees that I think have \nyet to pursue the responsibilities they have for oversight as fully and \ncompletely as perhaps they should. But certainly one would not have to \nlook beyond the Armed Services Committee and Foreign Relations \nCommittee for models. We can all be very proud and appreciative of the \njob they currently are doing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/19/senate-section/article/S5730-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5730-S5733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH EQUITABLE TREATMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this past Saturday, thousands of people \nin Sioux Falls, SD, and 35 other cities across America, took part in \nwalks to raise public awareness of mental health. The walks were \nsponsored by the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill.\n  In Sioux Falls, more than 300 people dodged rain showers to walk \nthrough Falls Park. They were different ages, with different \nbackgrounds. But most shared at least one important distinction: They, \nor someone close to them, has a mental illness.\n  The same is true of nearly all Americans. A 1999 report by the \nSurgeon General found that more than 50 million Americans--one in \nfive--suffer from mental illness each year. Many Members of this \nSenate--Republicans and Democrats--have spoken bravely and movingly \nabout how mental illness has devastated their own parents, children or \nsiblings.\n  No Senator who is with us today has demonstrated greater leadership \non issues involving mental health than our distinguished colleague from \nNew Mexico, Senator Domenici. He knows--from watching a daughter he \nloves very much struggle with schizophrenia--that mental illnesses \ndon't affect just one person; they affect whole families.\n  Senator Domenici also knows about the stigma attached to mental \nillness, and the discrimination and suffering that people with mental \nhealth problems suffer as a result of that stigma.\n  Almost a decade ago, this proud conservative Republican found a proud \nliberal Democratic ally in the Senate. Like Pete Domenici, Paul \nWellstone had seen someone he loved battle a serious mental illness. In \nPaul's case, it was his older brother. Pete Domenici and Paul Wellstone \nwere an ``odd couple.'' But they were fiercely united in their \ndetermination to end discrimination against people with mental illness.\n  In 1996--thanks to their leadership--Congress passed the Mental \nHealth Parity Act. The law--for the first time--prevented private \nhealth insurance plans that offer mental health coverage from setting \nannual or lifetime limits that are lower than those set for other \nillnesses. It was an important step forward. But it left a loophole. It \nallowed companies to set much higher deductibles and co-payments for \nmental health coverage. It also allowed insurers to set lower limits \nfor outpatient visits or the number of days of inpatient treatment for \nmental illness. As a result, effective, affordable mental health \ntreatment remains unaffordable for millions of Americans who need it.\n  The General Accounting Office estimates that nearly 90 percent of the \nNation's health plans engage in legal discrimination based on mental \nhealth diagnoses. The results can be devastating: unemployment, broken \nhomes, shattered lives, poverty, poor school performance--even suicide.\n  In 2000, Senator Domenici and Senator Wellstone introduced a new \nbill--the Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act--to close the \nloopholes. It is a modest proposal. It does not require employers to \nprovide health insurance. It does not require employers that provide \nhealth insurance to offer mental health coverage. It simply says that, \nfor employers that choose to offer mental health benefits, insurers \ncannot provide more restrictive coverage for mental health benefits \nthan they do for other medical and surgical benefits.\n  In late Fall 2001, the Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act was \nunanimously added to the Senate version of the FY 2002 Labor HHS \nAppropriations bill. But it was stripped out of the final conference \nreport at the insistence of the White House and the House Republican \nleadership.\n  More than two years ago, in April 2002, President Bush traveled to \nNew Mexico with Senator Domenici and announced that he supports ``full \nmental health parity.'' After listening to families talk about their \nmental health horror stories, the President said, ``Americans with \nmental illness deserve our understanding and they deserve excellent \ncare. They deserve a health care system that treats their illness with \nthe same urgency as physical illness.''\n  Months later, in late October 2002, Paul Wellstone died in a plane \ncrash, along with his wife, Sheila, their daughter, Marcia, and four \nothers. At a memorial service for them in Washington, Senator Domenici \ndelivered a beautiful eulogy to his friend; he announced that he was \nrenaming the bill ``The Senator Paul Wellstone Mental Health Equitable \nTreatment Act,'' and vowed to pass it.\n  Despite having 69 Senate co-sponsors, more than a year-and-a-half \nafter it was re-introduced in this Congress, the Wellstone bill--S. \n486--remains stuck in the HELP Committee.\n  Wellstone Action, the grassroots organization frmed by Paul and \nSheila\n\n[[Page S5731]]\n\nWellstone's two sons to continue their parents' work, has set passage \nof the Wellstone mental health bill as its only legislative goal this \nyear. Over the last several months, Wellstone Action members have sent \nmore than 32,000 faxes and letters to Congress asking us to pass the \nWellstone bill.\n  Bernie Cameron is one of these letter writers. She lives in \nDeerfield, NH. Her brother Joe was diagnosed with schizophrenia 50 \nyears ago, when he was just 12. By the age of 14, Joe was living in a \nState hospital for children. He has spent a total of only about 5 years \noutside of institutions since then.\n  Bernie Cameron's parents were both Portuguese immigrants who came to \nthis country when they were 16 years old. Her father worked as a \nfurniture refinisher. Her mother worked at a shoe store. They had 6 \nchildren and never had much money. They visited Joe at least three \ntimes a week.\n  ``Can you imagine visiting your child in a place that smells of \nurine, where people are screaming,'' Bernie asks. ``It was so \nfrustrating to them that they couldn't afford a better place for Joe.''\n  The powerful medications Joe was prescribed gave him tremors and \nother health problems.\n  In 1983, after Joe's father died, his mother sold the family home. \nWith the proceeds of the sale, the family sent Joe to McLean's, a very \ngood private psychiatric hospital in Boston. He was then in his late \n40s. The hospital changed Joe's medication, which finally brought his \nseizures under control. But, after a year, they told his family there \nwas nothing else they could do that would make a real difference in the \nquality of his life; to much time had been lost.\n  Before Joe got sick, he was a straight A student. Today, he lives in \na sheltered halfway house. He still has flashes of unusual intellect \nand wit. When that happens, his sister wonders, ``If we could have \ngotten him into a place like McLean's early on, would it have made a \ndifference?''\n  Bernie Cameron calls her brother's story ``a perfect illustration of \nthe 2-tier health care system in this country.'' If you have insurance \nand your illness involves a part of your body other than your brain, \nyou get health care. But if your brain is affected--even if you have \ninsurance--there's a good chance you won't get the health care you \nneed.\n  A new poll by the Coalition for Fairness in Mental Health Coverage \nshows that 83 percent of Americans surveyed support mental health \nparity in insurance. When asked whether they would support parity if it \nraised the premiums one percent--the high-end cost estimated for the \nWellstone bill--66 percent of Americans continued to say yes.\n  The Wellstone bill, as I said, has 69 co-sponsors in the Senate, and \n245 co-sponsors in the House. It is also supported by more than 360 \nnational organizations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the complete list be \nprinted in the Record at the close of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yet the Wellstone bill remains stuck in the HELP \nCommittee because of fierce opposition from the insurance industry and \nits allies.\n  Opponents of mental health parity claim it will drive up the cost of \nhealth coverage, which will result in more people losing their \ninsurance.\n  Let me be clear. Their claims are not true. They are scare tactics. \nWe have heard them all before.\n  To begin with, small businesses with fewer than 50 employees would be \ntotally exempt.\n  In addition, two highly respected organizations have analyzed the \nWellstone bill. The private accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers \npredicts it would increase health insurance premiums by 1 percent. That \nis it, 1 percent. That works out to $1.32 per month.\n  The Congressional Budget Office predicts an even smaller average \nincrease, nine-tenths of 1 percent. I think most families would think \nthat is a pretty good deal.\n  Senators Domenici and Wellstone modeled their bill on the mental \nhealth parity provisions in the Federal Employees Health Benefits \nProgram. According to the Office of Personnel Management, those \nprovisions have increased FEHB premiums only 1.3 percent, and that \nincludes treatment for substance abuse which is not part of the \nWellstone bill.\n  Even these very small cost estimates are probably high because they \ndo not factor in the cost savings resulting from parity.\n  The National Institute of Mental Health estimates the cost of \nuntreated mental illness, including criminal justice and social welfare \ncosts, at about $300 billion a year.\n  A 1999 Surgeon General report on mental illness estimates the direct \nbusiness costs of lack of parity at $70 billion a year, mostly in \nreduced productivity and increased use of sick leave.\n  By comparison, when workers with depression were treated with \nprescription medications, medical costs declined by $882 per employee \nper year, and absenteeism dropped by 9 days, according to a study \npublished in the Health Economics journal.\n  Why single out people with mental illness to hold down health care \ncosts? Why not deny treatment for heart disease or diabetes or cancer? \nPsychiatric treatment does cost money, but so do heart surgeries, \nkidney dialysis, and chemotherapy.\n  Health insurers are using incorrect and outdated ideas about the \nnature and causes of mental illness to deny millions of Americans \nessential health care and maximize their profits.\n  Thirty-four States already have mental health parity laws on the \nbooks, but the laws vary widely. Many cover only a handful of \nillnesses, and they cannot cover large, multistate employers or \nemployers who self-insure. Only a Federal law can guarantee real mental \nhealth parity for all Americans.\n  Last October, on the first anniversary of the plane crash that killed \nPaul and Sheila, their daughter Marcia and four others, I asked \nunanimous consent that the Senate take up and pass the Wellstone Mental \nHealth Equitable Treatment Act. It would have been a perfect tribute to \nPaul.\n  The Republican leadership blocked that request, but they gave us \ntheir word that the Senate would consider the Wellstone mental health \nbill early this year. We are now closing in on the Memorial Day recess. \nTime is fast running out on this Congress, too. We have been waiting \nmonths now to see a proposed amendment from Senator Gregg and the scope \nof the bill.\n  On June 10, people are coming to Washington from all over America for \na mental health rally to urge passage of the Wellstone bill.\n  Two years ago in New Mexico, the President said he would work with \nCongress to help press a mental health parity bill. The true test of \nthe President's leadership is not what the President says; it is his \nability to convince Republican leaders in the House and Senate to allow \nvotes on the bill.\n  Congress can pass this bill quickly, if the President will help. We \ncannot do this alone; we need his help. What we cannot do is allow \nmental health benefits to be a luxury only for the very wealthy or the \nvery fortunate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator yields the floor, I would \nlike to ask him a question through the Chair.\n  I am happy to hear the statement of the Senator from South Dakota \nabout the need for mental health parity. One part of me is sad because \nwhen he mentions the name of Paul Wellstone, that presents to me a void \nin my life because it seems only yesterday he was back here walking \naround with his microphone.\n  He was a champion of many causes. He worked so hard because he knew I \nwas interested in the subject of suicide and what causes it and how we \ncan prevent it.\n  Even though I know how important this issue is, and we have to do \nsomething about it, I feel--like, I am sure, a lot of his friends who \nserved in the Senate with him--a real void whenever his name is \nmentioned because he truly was one of the most remarkable people I have \nmet in my life.\n  I applaud and compliment the leader for his statement on mental \nhealth parity. For this man, it is long overdue to recognize him being \na great Senator.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for his \neloquent comments regarding our deceased colleague. I share his \nadmiration for our departed colleague. He was\n\n[[Page S5732]]\n\na man who had passion, conviction, and yet a good sense of humor that \nallowed that passion and conviction to be embraced by even those who \nmay not have agreed with him on every issue. But his passion about \nmental health, his conviction that it was the right thing for us to do, \nto pass mental health parity, lasts way beyond his life. It is not only \nin tribute to Paul, but I think in recognition of the appropriateness \nof his conviction and his passion that we remind our colleagues of the \ndebt we owe to him and to our country in passing meaningful legislation \nat long last to address this embarrassment and this extraordinary \ndeficiency in society today.\n  I again thank the Senator from Nevada and yield the floor.\n\n

Mr. President, 24 years ago, Ronald Reagan was running \nfor President and he asked each of us as Americans a question: Are you \nbetter off than you were 4 years ago?\n  It was the right question then, and it is the right question now. Are \nwe better off than we were 4 years ago? This is a very important \nquestion. Unfortunately, for most middle-income Americans in 2004, the \nanswer is clearly no.\n  What has happened in the last 4 years while wages have been flat, gas \nprices, college tuition, health care costs have skyrocketed, millions \nof jobs have been lost, poverty is on the rise, the budget surplus has \nbeen squandered, the Social Security trust fund has been raided, State \ntaxes have risen, household debt has gone way up, consumer confidence \nhas dropped, and the stock market has gone down.\n  We can look at a few of these areas with average weekly earnings flat \nat slightly over 1 percent; gas prices certainly in Michigan and around \nthe country skyrocketing, going up and up; college tuition; family \nhealth care premiums--these are just three measures of what is \nhappening to our families and what is commonly called the middle-class \nsqueeze where families are not seeing their incomes go up, and yet all \nof the costs of providing opportunity for their children, of being able \nto meet the daily costs of living are going up and up.\n  Today I want to talk specifically about just one of those, and that \nis the family health care premiums. Since President Bush took office, \nfamily health care premiums have risen more than $2,700. The average \ncost of a family plan is now above $9,000. Workers have to pay about \n$2,400 of that premium out of their own pockets, in addition to paying \ndeductibles and copays.\n  That is a tremendous amount of money for most families, especially at \na time when they are facing higher costs in so many other areas. Much \nof this increase has to do with the soaring cost of prescription drugs, \nwhich I have come to the Senate floor to speak about on many occasions. \nThe cost of prescription drugs--and this is brand-name drugs--is rising \nat about three and a half times the rate of inflation. In fact, we know \nthat for some of the top name- brand drugs we see advertised on \ntelevision every day, they are actually rising anywhere from 8 to 10 to \n12 percent faster than the rate of inflation, which is extraordinary.\n  The health care system and the business community paying the costs of \nhealth care premiums cannot continue to absorb that, and the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit does next to nothing to rein in escalating \ncosts. In fact, researchers have suggested that the new Medicare law \nwill actually result in new profits for the drug companies of $139 \nbillion over the next 8 years.\n  So here we are supposedly passing a bill to help seniors that one \nwould hope would lower prices, but instead, because it does not allow \nMedicare to negotiate group discounts, it locks in up to 40 million \npeople forced to pay the highest possible prices in the country,\n\n[[Page S5734]]\n\nresulting in $139 billion in new profits over the next 8 years for the \npharmaceutical industries and continual struggles for our seniors who \nliterally are choosing between food and medicine.\n  When President Bush took office, the number of uninsured Americans \nhad actually decreased for 2 straight years. The number of uninsured \nAmericans had actually gone down for 2 straight years. But the dramatic \nincrease in premiums during the Bush administration, combined with the \nloss of so many jobs, has left 3.8 million more Americans without \nhealth insurance. There are now nearly 44 million uninsured Americans, \nand the consequences are dire for these families and, I would argue, \nfor communities and for businesses as well that end up seeing their \nhealth care premium dollars go up every time someone walks into the \nemergency room sicker than they should be, receiving inappropriate care \nand having the community hospital have to absorb and transfer that to \nthe folks with insurance.\n  People without health insurance do not receive the care they need, as \nI indicated, to prevent or detect or treat serious medical problems. As \na result, they are forced to live their lives in poorer health and die \nyounger. Approximately 18,000 people die prematurely each year because \nthey do not have health insurance.\n  We are the greatest country in the world. Shame on us if we cannot \nfix this. And we can fix it. It is just a matter of will. It is a \nmatter of values and priorities. We need to turn things around and get \nthis right.\n  So we come back again to President Reagan's famous question: Are you \nbetter off than you were 4 years ago? What has happened in the last 4 \nyears? Again, wages have been flat, if not going down. In my State many \nfolks are losing their jobs, and wages that are being replaced are \nactually lower. Gas prices are skyrocketing out of sight. College \ntuition, access to college and the American dream that we all want for \nour children, has gone up tremendously. Health care costs have \nskyrocketed, as I mentioned. As a result, our middle-income families \nare feeling squeezed more and more every day, and Americans are not \nbetter off. But we can be better off. We are the United States of \nAmerica. We are the can-do country, and I know we can get back on \ntrack. With a few changes, with the right priorities, with the right \nvalues, we can turn this around. We have done it before and we can do \nit again.\n\n  With strong leadership and a real commitment to confronting the \nproblems that families face, we can do better. We can provide our \nschools and teachers with the support they deserve. We can ensure that \nevery qualified student has the opportunity to attend college. We can \nbuild a stronger America so every worker has access to health care and \nour seniors and the disabled truly have access to their prescription \ndrugs that they need at the lowest possible prices. We can restore the \nconfidence of Americans that our better days are still ahead.\n  We have much to do. All of these facts, all of these issues, relate \nto choices, the choices we make as we govern about who we want to make \nsure is doing better in this country. We can choose between focusing on \nthose things that help Americans, help the public to do better, or the \nspecial interests of this country. We need to turn it around so we are \nputting people first and we are addressing those things that allow each \nof us to have the opportunity for the great American dream. We are all \nabout working hard, playing by the rules, and being able to go as far \nas one can possibly go in this great country if they are willing to do \nthe work.\n  Too many folks are working hard and finding themselves more and more \nwith costs and burdens that are stopping them from being able to fully \nobtain the American dream for themselves and their families. We are not \nbetter off right now, but we can be, and I am hopeful with the right \nkind of changes that we will be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/19/senate-section/article/S5734-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5734-S5735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STATE OF EDUCATION\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Michigan for \nher excellent statement. I rise today to talk about the state of \neducation in America today, and I want to pose a simple question, as my \ncolleague from Michigan did: Are we better off than we were 4 years \nago?\n  Let us look at the facts. Four years ago, we were making record \ninvestments in education. We were giving students, parents, and \nteachers the tools they needed to succeed. We focused on results and we \ngot them. We focused on our classrooms and improved them. We focused on \nour students and we helped them on a path to lifetime learning.\n  Today, we find ourselves in very different circumstances. Today, the \nfocus is on process, not on results. Today, the focus is on \ncentralizing authority instead of the classroom. Instead of focusing on \nour students, the current administration is simply passing the buck.\n  During the Clinton administration, we focused on improving the \neconomy and giving every American the tools they needed to succeed. We \nrecorded the longest uninterrupted growth period in our Nation's \nhistory, and we helped the American people by getting the education, \ntraining, skills, and experience they needed to compete in a global \neconomy. We created 26 million American jobs.\n  Today, it is a very different story. We are facing dismal budgets, \nunfunded mandates for our schools, and constant attacks on the programs \nthat disadvantaged families rely on. Instead of helping students, the \nadministration has broken promises and failed to pay the Federal share \nfor education. Let us start by looking at how this administration has \nunderfunded the No Child Left Behind Act and the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act.\n  We have seen programs that help students turn into unfunded mandates \nthat burden our States. Over the past 4 years, States spent $72 billion \nto cover the unfunded mandates in IDEA and No Child Left Behind. In my \nhome State of Washington, IDEA is underfunded by $746 million. No Child \nLeft Behind is underfunded by $408 million. That makes a difference in \nevery classroom and in every child's life.\n  Two years ago, when we passed the No Child Left Behind Act, I voted \nfor it. Most of us in Congress agreed that accountability is important \nand that we need to make sure our kids are learning the things they \nneed to succeed, like reading, math, writing, and science. But the No \nChild Left Behind Act said in exchange for that new accountability, \nschools would get the funding they needed. Today the accountability has \nbeen imposed but the funding has not. In fact, Federal funding for the \nNo Child Left Behind Act has fallen $32 billion below the authorized \nlevels since this act was signed into law.\n\n  I have visited schools in every corner of Washington State and I know \nfirsthand that educators are working harder than ever to help their \nstudents meet these new accountability requirements. But today, as we \nall know, our State and local budgets are stretched so thin our local \ncommunities cannot afford to make up the differences between what our \nschools were promised and what this administration's budget proposal \nactually provides.\n  This year, the President's budget fell $9.4 billion short of fully \nfunding this law. President Bush has proposed the smallest increase for \neducation funding in 9 years and he even proposed eliminating \ncommonsense initiatives like dropout prevention. In Washington State \nalone, the difference between the President's request and the promise \nof No Child Left Behind means nearly 28,000 low-income students will be \nleft behind. That number skyrockets to 4.6 million nationwide.\n  We can do better. That is why in fact I offered an amendment to the \nSenate budget resolution to fully fund that act. Regrettably my \namendment failed on party-line votes.\n  When we passed the No Child Left Behind Act, Congress and the \nadministration sidestepped the issues affecting our high schools. Our \nnational high school graduation rate is an abysmal 69 percent. That \nnumber is even worse for students of color. Do you know roughly half of \nour minority students are graduating from high school? That means \nnearly half are dropping out. We need to keep better track of how \nminority students are doing by tracking dropout rates carefully. But \ntoday this Department of Education is not requiring\n\n[[Page S5735]]\n\ndisaggregation of data on dropouts. That would make it much harder for \nus to help vulnerable students or even to discover which students need \nhelp. With the right policies we can reduce the dropout rate. In fact, \nthat is why last summer I introduced S. 1554, the Pathways for All \nStudents to Succeed, or the PASS Act. This bill will reduce dropouts \nand help us close that achievement gap.\n  My bill, the PASS Act, does three things. First of all, it will help \nstudents to learn to read and write by providing $1 billion to help our \nschools hire literacy coaches. Second, my bill ensures our students are \ntaking the classes and getting the support they need to finish high \nschool, and it provides $2 billion for academic and career counselors \nto ensure all of our students have a personalized plan for completing \nhigh school and then going on to college.\n  Finally, my bill provides extra help to schools that need it the most \nby providing $500 million in grants to help improve our low-performing \nschools.\n  I hope the Senate will pass the bill this year. These are critical \nsteps we could be taking if this Congress were to finally focus on \nimproving the lives of our students.\n  Let me turn to the Federal role in the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act. Nearly 30 years ago, the Federal Government made a \ncommitment of equal opportunity to our Nation's children with \ndisabilities. With that commitment, again we gave the promise the \nFederal Government would pay 40 percent of the average per-student cost \nfor every special education student. Today, however, the Federal \nGovernment is paying less than 19 percent of the costs. Over the past 4 \nyears of fiscal crisis, Federal funding has fallen $40 billion short of \nthat 40-percent promise. This hole in special education funding not \nonly hurts our disabled students, it also hurts all of their classmates \nbecause in order to make up for Federal funding shortfalls, many \ndistricts have been forced to take money from their general education \nbudgets and that affects all students.\n\n  Over the past couple of years, IDEA has received increases in Federal \nfunding levels. However, according to the Congressional Research \nService, at increases of $1 billion each year the Federal Government \nwill never fulfill the promise of funding at 40 percent. And even if \nincreases were $1 billion plus inflation, we would not reach the \npromised level of 40 percent until 2035. That is another 30 years from \nnow.\n  Last week the Senate passed a reauthorized version of IDEA. Yet, \ndespite clear support, the Senate did not pass an amendment by Senators \nHagel and Harkin to fully fund IDEA through mandatory funding.\n  Education must be a priority for our country if we want a stable \neconomy and a brighter future. We need to focus not only on funding \nFederal mandates but on access to quality early childhood education and \npostsecondary education.\n  This year, Congress is working on reauthorizing the Head Start law. I \ncan tell you as a former preschool teacher, I know firsthand how these \ncritical first early years are for our children's future learning, yet \nthis year the President's budget barely allows Head Start to keep up \nwith inflation. That amount is not nearly enough, especially in a year \nwhere we are examining new requirements for this program. Without a \nsubstantial increase in funding, these programs will have to shut the \ndoor to needy at-risk children who will then fall further behind before \nthey even reach kindergarten.\n  What troubles me more is this President's clear intention is to end \nthis critical program. We all know proposals to block grant programs \nwill eventually lead to decreased funding for the program. Block \ngranting Head Start is not only supported and pushed by the President \nbut also by the House of Representatives. I know I will continue \nfighting to protect this very critical Head Start Program that has made \nsuch a huge difference in the lives of millions of low-income children.\n  Public education is the bedrock of our democracy. It helps create \ngood, active citizens and it gives our families the tools they need to \nput food on the table and a roof over their heads. It also ensures each \ngeneration of Americans will have more opportunities than their parents \nand their grandparents did. There is so much at stake in making sure we \nare moving education forward for all of America's students.\n  I turn back to the question I posed at the start of my remarks. Are \nwe better off than we were 4 years ago? Sadly, the answer is no. Our \nstudents deserve better. Our country deserves better. I am going to \nkeep fighting here in the Senate to ensure that all of America's \nchildren get a good education.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/19/senate-section/article/S5735-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5735-S5736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nher statement relative to education. I believe the theme, the question \nshe has led off with, is one we will be returning to over and over \nagain.\n  I know how much the Presiding Officer respects Ronald Reagan and how \nmuch he looks back on his Presidency and even candidacy as defining \nmoments in the history of our Nation. President Reagan, despite my \ndifferences with him politically, had a way of saying things very \ndirectly. He was one of the best communicators we have ever had in the \nWhite House. He could, in a few words, convey a message so directly and \nso simply.\n  This statement of candidate Reagan is one that is a hallmark now of \nAmerican politics. Not a campaign goes by that someone doesn't say:\n\n       Well, as Ronald Reagan once said, ``Are you better off than \n     you were 4 years ago?''\n\n  It is a very simple question. It is a question that must be asked \neach time the American people face an important election, and this may \nbe one of the most important in history.\n  What we hear back from the American people when we ask this question \nis a resounding no. They say in overwhelming numbers, America is going \nin the wrong direction. We need a new direction in this country. We \nneed a strong leadership that not only protects America but also \ncreates opportunity in America. You have heard repeatedly from my \ncolleague from Michigan how this has a direct impact when it comes to \nthe health care costs of families; how it has a direct impact--the \nSenator from Washington made this point--when it comes to educational \ncosts. I think honestly what they have said is demonstrated by a few \ncharts I have here.\n  This is one that I think tells the whole story about the last 4 years \nof the Bush administration. During this period of time, average weekly \nearnings for families have gone up 1 percent. President Bush can point \nto the fact that over 4 years, average income for Americans has barely \nincreased. But what has happened to the expenses faced by Americans in \nthe same period of time? The cost of gasoline, up 25 percent. My \nfriend, Senator Wyden of Oregon, will address that, as he has time and \nagain on the floor of the Senate in the next part of this morning \nbusiness time.\n  Look at the cost of college tuition. It has gone up 28 percent in the \n4 years President Bush has been in office; the cost of family health \ncare premiums; some 36 percent.\n\n  Now we will take a closer look at the family health care premiums as \nan illustration. When the President took office, the average health \ncare premium paid on an annual basis was $6,348. Now look at the \nnumber: $9,068. The President can send out a check for $100, $200, or \n$300 and say to middle America: Here is your tax cut; go out and go \ncrazy. Then take a look at this and say: Wait a minute, that tax cut \njust disappeared. More and more workers and families are paying more \nand more for health care premiums.\n  Take a look at this chart. Who really is better off? The average \nweekly earnings show no increase over the same period of time.\n  Look at the HMO profits. The profits of the health insurance \ncompanies have gone up 50 percent in terms of growth. The CEO \ncompensation for the people who run the HMOs and other corporations is \nup 61 percent.\n  Working families, struggling to get by, have seen little or no \nincrease in their income, while those who are profiting from HMOs and \nfrom other corporations are doing quite well, thank you.\n  I remember when Warren Buffett came to say hello to us. He is one of\n\n[[Page S5736]]\n\nmy favorites. His annual report is a must-read for anyone who follows \ncommon sense in American business. Warren Buffett, the second \nwealthiest man in America, said to some Senators: Many people say our \npolicies are class warfare in America today. He said: I have news for \nyou, my class is winning.\n  He is right, because, quite honestly, the disparity of income in \nAmerica is worse than it has ever been. This President, with his tax \ncuts and his policies, has made it worse.\n  So 4 years later we go back to the same basic Ronald Reagan question: \nAre you better off now than you were 4 years ago? The answer, quite \nhonestly, for most working Americans, is a resounding no.\n  Let me address two particular issues that hit most families. I talked \nabout the increase in college tuition costs. You do not need to remind \nfamilies that if their son or daughter is lucky enough to get into a \ngood school, they will probably be in a position 4 or 5 years later \nwhere they are deeply in debt. I have seen it in my family and many \nothers have seen it in theirs. Young people starting out not only have \na challenge of finding a good job and a career opportunity but are \nchallenged by what to do with this mountain of debt.\n  There was a time when the Federal Government helped. There was a time \nwhen we had scholarships and loans and grants to help students along so \nthey would not end up more deeply in debt when they graduate from \ncollege than many of us were when we bought our first home many years \nago.\n  Over the course of higher education and its cost, we see the gap \nbetween the haves and the have-nots is increasing. Over the course of \ntheir career, the difference in income between an 18-year-old high \nschool graduate and a 24-year-old college graduate is now more than a \nmillion, so it is certainly worth going to school, but college tuition \nis out of reach for too many American students.\n  According to the College Board, the 13-percent inflation-adjusted \nreal increase in tuition at public colleges last year was the highest \nin 30 years. In my State, it is going up. With the weak economy, with \nthe limited resources coming from Washington, with the struggle that \nmany States are having with this recession, which continues to linger, \nfewer and fewer dollars go into State treasuries and fewer and fewer \ndollars go from those treasuries to colleges and universities, so they \nraise tuition.\n\n  We are in a recession, losing jobs. Real income is going down and the \ncost of education is going up. That is a fact. Private school tuition \nhas gone up even higher. Federal assistance has fallen far behind.\n  In the 1970s, the maximum Pell grant for low-income and working-class \nfamilies covered about 40 percent of the average cost of going to \nschool. In the 1970s, Pell grants and others helped cover 40 percent. \nToday, it covers 15 percent. So even the most deserving students from \nlow-income families find the Federal programs are a shadow of what they \nused to be. They do not provide them the help they need. That means \nthat 48 percent of low-income high school graduates who qualify for \ncollege do not go to a 4-year school because they simply do not have \nthe money.\n  From 1987 to 1999, completion rates on college prep courses for the \nNation's poorest students grew by 20 percent. So it means more students \nare ready for school; they just cannot afford to go to school.\n  When you look at what we have done on a Federal level time and again, \nthis administration has not provided the helping hand to college \nstudents and their families. This President proposed to freeze Pell \ngrants at $4,050 a year for the third year in a row, even though we \nknow the cost of education continues to go up in a double-digit pace. \nHis budget calls for a $823 million increase that merely holds the line \non existing grant award levels. He proposes to freeze campus-based aid, \ncut Perkins loans, and eliminate the LEAP grants. In total, 78,000 \nstudents in America will lose grants because of the Bush budget \npolicies, meaning the cost of education is higher and the helping hand \nfrom the Federal Government is not going to be there.\n  Are those families better off today than they were 4 years ago? Is \nthe Bush policy, the budget policy on financing and education, for \nstruggling students, from lower income families, better than it was 4 \nyears ago? By almost every measure, the answer is a resounding no.\n  We need to get our priorities straight in this country. If we are \ngoing to have an American century in the 21st century, as we did in the \n20th century, we better focus on students and education. We better make \nsure that deserving students who want to realize the American dream, \nmany of them the first in their family to be able to go to college, \nhave that chance. They cannot have a chance when the college education \nhas been priced at a level where they cannot afford it, or even worse, \ngraduating with heavy debt. Many of these students cannot pursue the \ncareer choice they really want.\n  How many students graduate wanting to be teachers, good teachers in \ngrade schools and high schools, will be able to realize that dream if \nthey face a mountain of debt? Starting off as a high school or grade \nschool teacher at $30,000 a year, with a pretty limited take home pay, \nis almost impossible if you have to pay back a mountain of student \nloans in the process. So they try other things that might make more \nmoney and we lose the teacher we need to inspire the next generation.\n  So when the President makes a decision on budgets to cut back in \nhelping students pay for a college education, it has a ripple effect \nall the way down the line in terms of new jobs and opportunity, in \nterms of tomorrow's teachers and nurses, in terms of those who we need \nto make America the strong nation it needs to be.\n  Let me also address an issue which is hitting Americans in the \npocketbook. Take a look at what has happened to the price of gasoline \nbetween when President Bush took office and what it is today. A gallon \nwas $1.47 in 2001 when President Bush came to office. Now it is up to \nan average of $2.01.\n  Now look at what is happening with the oil companies that are selling \nthe gasoline. It has been a pretty good year for the oil companies. If \nyou think you are getting pinched at the pump, take a look at what is \nhappening here: For British Petroleum, a 165-percent profit increase; \nChevron Texaco, 294 percent; ConcoPhilips--what has happened here--only \na 44-percent profit increase. They are falling behind; Exxon Mobil, 125 \npercent.\n  Take a look at gas prices in the city of Chicago, which I am proud to \nrepresent. They are well over $2 a gallon in downtown Chicago. In \nCalifornia, I understand they are bumping up against $3 a gallon.\n  So you ask yourself: What can we do?\n  First--and Senator Wyden will spend some time on this issue--why are \nwe filling this Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a faster clip now than \never when the price of petroleum that we are putting into it is at \nrecord levels? The second question I need to ask, obviously, is, When \nis this President going to confront these oil companies about their \nrecord profits at the expense of families and businesses? The third and \nobvious question is, Candidate Bush, candidate George W. Bush, said if \nhe ever faced this, he would get on the phone to OPEC and tell them to \nstop squeezing American consumers and families and businesses. I guess \nthe telephone line is dead between the White House and Riyadh. He is \nnot calling Saudi Arabia to tell them they have to release more oil to \nthe United States. The President as candidate said he would do it. The \nPresident as President refuses to do it. Why? Haven't we done enough \nfor the Middle Eastern nations and the OPEC countries, putting hundreds \nof thousands of American lives at risk for stability and security in \nthe Middle East? And the President will not pick up the phone to say to \nthem, for goodness' sake, you put our economy at risk when you hold \nback oil. And that is exactly what they are doing. We need Presidential \nleadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/19/senate-section/article/S5736-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5736-S5738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            GASOLINE PRICING\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor this \nmorning to state, in accord with my policy of publicly announcing any \nhold that I\n\n[[Page S5737]]\n\nplace on a nominee or a piece of legislation, that I will object to any \nunanimous consent request for the Senate to take up the President's \nnominee, Deborah Majoras, to head the Federal Trade Commission.\n  Gasoline pricing is, of course, one of the most important consumer \nprotection issues that the Federal Trade Commission is responsible for \noverseeing. The prices for gasoline, of course, are soaring. For years \nnow, the Federal Trade Commission has been waging a campaign of \ninaction. In three specific areas--increased oil company mergers, \nrefinery shutdowns, and anti-competitive practices--the Federal Trade \nCommission has simply been AWOL.\n  Yesterday, after writing to Ms. Majoras, to make sure she knew \nspecifically of my concerns, I met with the nominee to head the Federal \nTrade Commission. I asked repeatedly if there was even one area--even \none area--where she would change existing Federal Trade Commission \npolicy with respect to these practices that are sucking the competitive \njuices out of gasoline markets across the country. During that \nconversation not even one example was given of an area that the nominee \nto head the Federal Trade Commission would change in the gasoline \npricing area. It is for that reason that I publicly state today that I \nam placing a hold on this nominee.\n  To me, it is absolutely unacceptable for a nominee to chair the \nFederal Trade Commission to not want to make one specific change in \ngasoline pricing policy. It is certainly unacceptable to me as a \nSenator from a State where the average price of gas is now $2.25 a \ngallon, but it ought to be unacceptable to Senators from every area of \nthe country.\n  Here are three examples of the record at the Federal Trade Commission \nthat I wish to change:\n  First, since taking office, the Bush administration has allowed 33 \noil industry mergers, totaling $19.5 billion to go through. Not only \nhas the administration not tried to block any of these mergers, they \nsimply have taken a pass in every respect. To be fair, the Clinton \nAdministration also sat on its hands allowing 21 oil mergers to go \nthrough while challenging only one.\n  The Bloomberg News service recently reported on this issue. It is my \nown view that unchecked oil company mergers are a significant factor in \nthe rising price of gasoline in the country. But the Federal Trade \nCommission, in the face of this huge wave of mergers, has simply been \nsitting on their hands, and yesterday, the nominee to head the Federal \nTrade Commission gave me no indication there would be a change in the \npolicy of the Federal Trade Commission on the merger issue.\n  Second, a handful of refiners now control most of the gasoline in our \nmarkets. The concentration is especially serious on the west and east \ncoasts. Mr. President, 67 percent of the west coast market and 77 \npercent of the east coast market is controlled by a handful of \nrefiners--just four companies. Along with this increased concentration \nof refiners, we have seen a drop in the number of refineries at a \ncritical time when clearly we need more refinery capacity, not less.\n  Now, I have documented evidence--it is up on my Web site--that \nrefinery shutdowns have been implemented not because of competition but \nto boost profit. Certainly, in my view, the nominee to head the Federal \nTrade Commission ought to be looking at this issue of refinery \ncapacity. But yet again, the nominee that I met with yesterday was \nunwilling to state what, if anything, would change with respect to \nrefinery practices.\n  Third, the Federal Trade Commission has been unwilling to move \nagainst anti-competitive practices that the agency has even documented. \nHere I am talking about redlining, a tool that is used to wall off a \ncommunity from competition. So, again, as we have seen in the case of \noil company mergers, as we have seen in the case of refinery shutdowns, \nin this third area, anti-competitive practices such as redlining, the \nFederal Trade Commission is going to stay on the sidelines, apparently, \nwith a new chair.\n\n  Most recently, the Federal Trade Commission, through their general \ncounsel, has essentially said that oil companies can price gouge with \nimpunity. It is an extraordinary statement. It was made in the \nBloomberg News service, again. But the general counsel of the Federal \nTrade Commission has basically said oil companies can do whatever they \nwant. They can move unilaterally, raise prices to essentially any level \nthey would want in certain markets.\n  So this is what I am concerned about: these questions that are \nspecifically under the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission \nwith respect to mergers, with respect to refinery shutdowns, with \nrespect to anti-competitive practices, such as redlining.\n  I had hoped that the nominee to chair the agency would be willing to \nmake changes. I provided the nominee in advance--in advance of our \nmeeting--the key questions that I went through with her. Yet, despite \nthat, and despite the fact that I asked for even one example of a \npolicy she would change at the Federal Trade Commission, I was given \nnothing to indicate that the nominee to head the Federal Trade \nCommission would buck the pernicious trend across this country that is \ndraining the competition out of gasoline markets across America.\n  For example, I asked Ms. Majoras about the Federal Trade Commission's \nlack of response to letters I have sent to the Chair requesting the \nFederal Trade Commission to investigate Shell Oil's plan to close a \n70,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Bakersfield, CA. The Federal Trade \nCommission sent me a two-paragraph response saying they would seriously \nconsider it.\n  This is an enormously important issue for those of us on the west \ncoast. I see my friend from Nevada on the Senate floor, who has been \neloquent with respect to trying to stand up for the consumer on the \ngasoline issue. The Presiding Officer, who I have the privilege of \nserving with, has been long concerned about gasoline prices. This \nBakersfield shutdown will have enormous and negative ramifications for \nthe people on the west coast.\n  But while I have heard repeatedly from the agency--and I heard \nyesterday from the nominee that this ``sounds like a serious issue''--\nthere was no commitment, none, just like the current FTC Chair, to take \nany specific action. In addition, the nominee pointed out there may \neven be a potential conflict of interest with respect to the \nBakersfield shutdown because of her current law firm responsibilities \nand the fact that her current firm represents Chevron.\n  So, Mr. President, I will say, as I have done in the past, that I am \ngoing to keep my door open. I am hopeful, in the course of hearings and \ndebates about the future direction of the Federal Trade Commission, \nthat the nominee will shift course from what I heard yesterday. But I \nwill tell you, it is not enough for the agency to continue to say they \nare ``seriously concerned'' or they are ``monitoring the situation'' or \n``they are troubled by the high prices our constituents are paying.'' \nThat is not enough.\n  When people up and down the west coast of the United States and \nacross the country are getting shellacked by these gasoline prices, in \neffect, we are seeing consumers clobbered at the pump with dollars from \ntheir own pockets, and then taxpayer dollars are used to fill the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve at record prices when it is essentially \nfilled.\n  We need some changes, and we need changes at the top with respect to \ngasoline pricing policy in this country. That means the Federal Trade \nCommission has to get off the sidelines. They have to zero in on the \nthree specific areas I mentioned this morning: oil company mergers; \nrefinery shutdowns; and anti-competitive practices, such as redlining.\n  For far too many years, Federal Trade Commission political appointees \nhave sat on their hands while the anti-competitive practices of the oil \nindustry gouge American consumers at the gas pump. I have given Ms. \nMajoras a number of opportunities to explain to me what she plans to do \ndifferently as a Commissioner, and she has made it abundantly clear \nthat she has no specific plan to energize the FTC to begin fighting for \nconsumers. I don't intend to allow yet another FTC Commissioner collect \na $145,00 salary to do nothing while unnaturally high gas prices \njeopardize American jobs and American families.\n  It is my intention to continue to object to Senate consideration of \nthe\n\n[[Page S5738]]\n\nnominee to head the Federal Trade Commission until that agency is \nwilling to tell the people of our State and the people of this country \nthat there are going to be some changes and there is going to be some \ncompetition again in the gasoline markets of our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/19/senate-section/article/S5738-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, we have people from the majority coming out \nhere occasionally talking about how important it would be to pass an \nenergy bill. I listened to the President's press secretary yesterday \nsaying: Well, the reason we are not having lower gas prices is because \nthe Democrats won't help with the Energy bill.\n  This is simply talk. It has absolutely has no merit. All we need to \nlook at is what the administration itself says about the Energy bill. \nThe Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration studied \nthis question and concludes the legislation's incentives to reduce our \nreliance on foreign oil sources will have a negligible success. The \nreport, prepared by the administration for a Republican Senator, \nstates:\n\n       On a fuel-specific basis, proposals in the [conference \n     report] including changes to production, consumption, \n     imports, and prices are deemed to be negligible.\n\n  The bill won't address our energy needs in the future. It won't \nprotect middle-class families who are being gouged with the gas prices \nwe see today. Nevada has the second or third highest gas prices in the \ncountry. Gas prices across the Nation have reached alarming levels, \nespecially in Nevada and California. A regular, unleaded gallon of \ngasoline costs $2.22 in Las Vegas, $2.29 in Reno, while higher blend \nfuels are at about $2.50 a gallon. I have to say, this was written on \nMonday. This is 2 days later. I don't know what it is today. But it has \ngone up.\n  Since the first of the year, the price of gasoline has increased more \nthan 58 cents a gallon in Nevada. There is no doubt the price of crude \noil has contributed to higher gasoline prices, but this outrageous 58-\ncent increase in Nevada since January has not been driven by the rising \ncost of crude oil but by corporate greed and the never-ending quest for \nprofits, no matter what it does to the consumer.\n  Big oil companies and refiners are getting rich. Middle-class \nfamilies are getting gouged. I had in my office last week a wholesale \ndistributor from Las Vegas and Reno. If a service station wants some \noil products, gasoline, that is where they get it. These companies are \ngoing broke because they can't pay for the huge cost of fuel. The \nmarkup they get is 2 or 3 cents a gallon. They make 2 or 3 cents a \ngallon on the fuel they sell. So it is not the service station \noperators making the money. It is not the person who gives them the \nfuel. It is the big suppliers. Big oil companies and refiners are \ngetting rich. Middle-class families are getting gouged.\n  I am not making this up. It is documented. Refiner margins have \ndoubled and tripled. Oil companies weren't content to make 25 cents for \nevery gallon of gasoline.\n  They now make up to 75 cents for every gallon of gasoline sold.\n  Look at this. Who is better off? Oil companies report record profit \nincreases. British Petroleum did OK last year, a 165-percent increase \nin their profits. Chevron-Texaco are the record holders, a 294-percent \nprofit. Exxon-Mobil, a 125-percent profit. Conoco-Phillips, I don't \nknow what happened to this company; they only made a 44-percent \nincrease in profit last year. That is all. Conoco-Phillips is down at \nthe bottom. They made a profit before, but now they had an additional \n44-percent increase in profit. I repeat, British Petroleum had a 165-\npercent increase in profit compared to the previous year; Chevron, a \n294-percent increase in profit compared to the preceding year; and \nExxon-Mobil, a 125-percent increase in profit. I am not making this up. \nThese companies are gouging.\n  We have all received letters from our constituents. I have received \nthem from Nevadans whose budgets are stretched. They have to make a \nchoice between food, a place to live, and medicine. This is the way it \nis. It is too bad. Gasoline is not a luxury; it is a necessity. \nFamilies have to put gas in their vehicles so they can drive to work, \ntake the children to school, and go to the grocery store.\n\n  Big oil companies control it all. British Petroleum, Chevron-Texaco, \nConoco-Phillips, Exxon-Mobil, they make the money. And as long as they \ncan show their shareholders they are doing great, it doesn't matter \nwhat is happening to the country or the people who work for these \ncompanies. They control the supply. They know families have little \nchoice in the matter. They literally have consumers over a barrel of \noil.\n  While consumers are paying record prices, the oil companies are \nreaping record profits. These profits are outrageous. I believe in the \nfree enterprise system, but if you carry this to its extreme, there \nisn't much left for the consumer.\n  Major California refineries owned by Valero and Tesoro that supply \nthe Las Vegas-Reno area have reported record profits and project even \nbigger gains in the months ahead. Record profits for big oil; record \nprices for American families.\n  I have asked the Federal Trade Commission to stop this price gouging, \nbut they won't act. The FTC continues to study the problem while gas \nprices skyrocket. We all agree something must be done. It is a simple \nfact that we can't drill our way out of the problem. We are sitting on \nless than 3 percent of the oil reserves of the world. This includes \nANWR. We consume 25 percent of the oil that is produced, and 97-plus \npercent of the oil reserves in the world are someplace else.\n  We need to find an innovative new solution, but this administration's \nenergy policy is stuck in the past. It is slanted toward big oil and \nspecial interests generally. This is a policy that was hatched in \nsecret 3 years ago by the Vice President's energy task force. This is \nthe task force that refuses to produce the records of who met, where \nthey met, what they talked about. This has gone to court. They have \nstalled it for almost 4 years.\n  This past Sunday the Washington Post reported on the influence that \nhas been wielded in this administration by the people who raised large \namounts of money for President Bush's campaign. One of the four people \nwho organized the entire fundraising apparatus was Donald Evans, a \nTexas oil man. The article also noted the influence of Enron CEO Ken \nLay--``Kenny boy,'' as he was called by the President--who served on \nthe Energy Department transition team and recommended two of the \nappointees to the five-member Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Is \nit any wonder nothing is being done?\n  When it comes to national energy policy, this administration is \ntaking care of the Enrons, the big oil companies, while middle-class \nfamilies and other families are gouged. Our Nation must promote the \nresponsible production of oil and gas, but that doesn't mean we should \nroll back environmental protections of our priceless public lands to \nallow drilling. Remember, we cannot produce our way out of this \nproblem.\n  If we allow drilling in ANWR, with all the roads and other support \nstructures that would be required, we would despoil a national treasure \nfor little long-term gain in energy security.\n  Instead of squandering our children's birthright for a temporary \nsupply of oil, we should do a better job of conserving.\n  If all our cars, trucks and sport utility vehicles got an average of \n27.5 miles per gallon, we would save more oil in 3 years than could be \nrecovered economically from the entire Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  I know we can do it because we did it once before.\n  After the 1973 Arab oil embargo, when Americans were forced to wait \nin\n\n[[Page S5739]]\n\nlong lines to buy gasoline, we realized that our dependence on oil from \nthe Middle East was compromising our national security.\n  So we dedicated ourselves to building vehicles that were more fuel-\nefficient. And by 1990, the average American vehicle got 40 percent \nmore miles per gallon than in 1973.\n  That is an American success story, a triumph of good old American \ningenuity.\n  We need to redouble our efforts to conserve oil.\n  We also need the President to stop filling the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve.\n  It is more than 90 percent full. How much is enough?\n  There have been two major releases of oil from the SPR. Crude oil \nprices fell sharply each time.\n  The first SPR release occurred as the U.S. began bombing Iraq on \nJanuary 16, 1991. The next day crude oil prices fell from $32 to $21 \nper barrel.\n  The second release occurred in September 2000. Crude oil prices \nimmediately fell from $37 to $31 per barrel after this release was \nannounced.\n  The President also needs to pressure OPEC to significantly increase \nits production quotas to lower the price of oil on world markets.\n  These are some immediate steps we can take to help middle class \nfamilies.\n  But to meet our energy needs over the long term, we need an energy \npolicy that looks to the future.\n  I have already talked about the need to conserve oil.\n  Conserving would protect consumers, and it would make our country \nstronger.\n  Thomas Friedman, who covers the Middle East for the New York Times, \nwrote last week that we must renew our efforts to free ourselves from \nour dependence on oil from that region.\n  He suggested an effort modeled after the Manhattan Project. That, of \ncourse, was our extraordinary race to develop a nuclear weapon during \nWorld War II.\n  The Manhattan Project was a success. It helped keep the world free.\n  And we can do it again.\n  We are going to be spending a lot of time this week talking about \nnational defense, about ways to make our country stronger.\n  Well, we can make our country stronger by finding an efficient and \nenvironmentally sound way to produce hydrogen fuel.\n  We can find a way to produce hydrogen fuel by harnessing our abundant \nrenewable energy sources--the power of the wind, the warmth of the sun, \nand the heat within the earth.\n  We need to break this bill apart and extract what is good.\n  Let's take elements of this energy legislation that enjoy broad, \nbipartisan support, and move them forward to the President's desk.\n  I was encouraged that the FSC/ETI bill passed by the Senate last week \ncontains the Energy Tax Incentives.\n  I applaud Senators Grassley, Baucus, and Domenici for the provision \nthat expands and extends the production tax credit for wind, \ngeothermal, solar, and biomass energy.\n  The FSC/ETI bill also guarantees a commodity floor price for the \nAlaskan Natural Gas Pipeline.\n  I strongly support a price floor and loan guarantees to build an \nAlaska Natural Gas Pipeline, but this supply won't enter the market for \nanother 10 years.\n  Senator Cantwell has introduced a standalone bipartisan bill to \nimprove the reliability of our Nation's electric transmission system.\n  This bill is noncontroversial and can pass both Houses of Congress.\n  We can pass meaningful parts of this energy legislation, and begin to \nimplement a strategy that looks toward the future.\n  We need to act now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, can the Chair advise where we are in the \nbusiness of the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to spend time talking about the \nDefense authorization bill. Before I do, I want to respond to this \nquestion, are we better off? I think it is a good question.\n  But the question has to be phrased: Are we better off today than we \nwere after the impact of September 11? My colleagues across the aisle \ncontinually block out of their minds the impact of the devastating \nattack on American soil of September 11 and the challenges this country \nfaced--both emotional, from the scars of the terrible loss of life, as \nwell as the economic impact. That is the question.\n  Are we better off today with the Taliban not operating freely in \nAfghanistan? Are we better off today with Saddam Hussein no longer \nsupporting Hamas and Hezbollah, no longer operating the torture and \nrape chambers?\n  Are we better off today fighting terrorism in Iraq rather than again \nback on our shores? Are we better off economically?\n  Mr. President, I have in front of me an article in today's \nMinneapolis Star Tribune, and I will refer to a couple sections. It \nsays, in April, Minnesota broke all kinds of job records, led by the \nState's largest drop in unemployment, to 4.1 percent from 4.8 percent. \nEconomists used words such as ``spectacular'' and ``breathless'' to \ndescribe the job gains they say were part of the national turnaround.\n  The U.S. economy added 625,000 jobs in March and April, a turnaround, \nI note, that was fueled by tax cuts, was fueled by bonus depreciation, \nwas fueled by increasing expansion, fueled by lowering the top rate to \ngive small business a tax break. The article notes that the 0.7-percent \ndrop in the unemployment rate was the biggest since the State started \nkeeping records in the late 1970s.\n  Are we better off economically today than we were after the impact of \n9/11? Absolutely. With the $18,000 job decline and the number of \nunemployed people, also going back to the 1970s, that was 13 percent \nfewer than the 140,000 unemployed in March. The 4,500 new manufacturing \njobs is the biggest monthly increase since the State started tracking \nthe statistic in 1992.\n  Are we better off today, post-9/11, than we were right after that \nattack? Absolutely. Completing Tuesday's figures, success in more \nhiring suggests fewer firings. New unemployment claims dropped 14.1 \npercent in April. They talk about in this article the manufacturing \nsector.\n  We would be better off if we didn't have the other side filibustering \nan energy bill. We would grow more jobs. We would be better off if my \ncolleagues on the other side were not blocking asbestos reform, if my \ncolleagues were not blocking class action reform, so that we could grow \nmore jobs. We would be better off if my colleagues on the other side \nwere not blocking the appointing of conferees to the highway bill. That \nis a jobs bill. Have we moved forward? Absolutely. Have we recovered \nfrom 9/11? Absolutely. But rather than criticize, my colleagues should \ncome together and stop the obstruction and blocking and let's move \nAmerica forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/19/senate-section/article/S5739-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5739-S5740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, we spend a fair amount of time on this \nfloor discussing priorities for our people and our Government. As far \nas I am concerned, all that talk is about what comes in second to the \nsubject we are on today: national security.\n  Our first obligation is to defend the American people and our \ninterests abroad. If we don't do that with thoroughness and excellence, \nnothing else is going to matter for long.\n  September 11 was a tragic day. It was also the end of a period of \ndenial. For generations, we believed that we could sit here safely, \nprotected by our oceans. But 2 world wars in the last century and the \ncoming of the nuclear age changed that. But when the Berlin Wall fell \ndown and the Soviet Union collapsed, perhaps some lapsed into a false \nsense of security. September 11th changed that forever.\n  This bill--the Defense authorization bill--is an attempt to respond \nto the defense of American interests in the world as it is, now and for \nthe foreseeable future. Failure to be prepared invites the threats we \nfear. Peace through strength must remain the governing doctrine of \nAmerican national security.\n  I support the work of the Chairman, Senator Warner, on this bill. \nWhat a\n\n[[Page S5740]]\n\ntremendous asset it is to the Senate and Nation to have his expertise \nand experience. The fact that he served at the Pentagon, and has \nparticipated in this bill through numerous administrations gives us \nconfidence in this work product.\n  It has been said that the key to leadership is maintaining order in \nthe midst of change, and change in the midst of order. With the \ndistinguished Chairman, we have that balance.\n  Mr. President, for a moment, I want to discuss recent developments in \nIraq.\n  You would never try to time a foot race with a sun dial. Likewise, it \nmakes no sense to judge the progress of the war in Iraq by the top of \nthe hour news.\n  We are at war. That is a sentence fraught with meaning. War is by \ndefinition unpredictable. It involves a struggle against a dedicated \nfoe, and constantly shifting conditions. Depending on your point of \nview, a single event for one part will be an ``ebb'', while for another \nit is a ``flow.'' With a short term perspective, you never know whether \nsomething is a trend or an isolated, irrelevant occurrence.\n  One of the lessons we learned from the Vietnam era is that when the \nUnited States of America commits troops to battle, we should only do so \nif we are committed and confident of victory. The angst of so many \nVietnam veterans is not the sacrifice they were called to make, but the \nbetrayal of their cause and the anger of the American people at them \nfor doing what their country asked them to do.\n  The decision to go to war in Iraq was not a snap judgment. It was \nthoroughly debated here on this floor. The vote to authorize the use of \nforce was not unanimous, but it was bipartisan. We crossed a threshold \nwhen we made that decision, and when combat began.\n  A decision to go to war is not a stock you buy or sell depending on \nhow it is doing. We are in this war until we finish it successfully.\n  Is there room for debate on how the war is to be conducted? \nCertainly. But only to a point. We don't need 535 commanders in chief.\n  In a world of instantaneous global communication, we need to be very \nsensitive to what we say on the public record, and how our words can be \ninterpreted by those who wish to destroy us. War is a matter of \narmaments and troops and battle plans. But is also a matter of \npsychology and spirit. We should be very careful not to encourage our \nenemies. When Congressman Murtha made his comments last week, I \nvehemently disagreed with them. This war is certainly ``winnable'' but \nif insurgents heard his words, it was harder to win than before he \nspoke.\n  I reiterate that it would be foolish to try to run this war based on \npublic opinion. We have no General Gallup Poll. The circumstances we \nhave learned about Abu Ghraib are very disturbing to us all. Looking at \nthe polls, it had a short term effect on support for the war effort. \nBut we must maintain the perspective that these are actions we are \nashamed of and are working to prevent from ever re-occurring. Compare \nthat to the villains who beheaded Mr. Berg. They reveled in the act of \nhis murder. It was a picture of what we are there to fight against.\n  Progress is being made. The influential Shia cleric Al-Sistani has \ncalled for people like Al Sadr to lay down their arms.\n  The President has made it clear what to expect as the June 30 \ndeadline approaches. Terrorists like Al Zarqawi know what the prospect \nof a free Iraq means, and they will do anything to stop it. We cannot \nlet them succeed. We need to be more committed to our noble ideals than \nthe terrorists are to their evil plans. Despite all the attempts to \ndistract us or deter us, we need to stay focused on the transition to \nIraqi sovereignty. If we fail, the fall out will be far worse than that \nfrom an artillery shell filled with sarin gas.\n  Mr. President, our history tells us that war is hell. But it also \ntells us that there are some things worth fighting for.\n  The battle is engaged. The war on terrorism is being fought in \nBaghdad, in the Sunni Triangle, not here. Better to fight the battle \nthere than here. Have no doubt, if we were not fighting it there, it \nwould be fought right here. Its poison and death would spew forth upon \nus.\n  Removing Saddam Hussein from the world stage was worth fighting for. \nFreeing the people of Iraq from tyranny and deprivation is worth \nfighting for. Planting an Arab democracy in the Middle East is an \nhistoric opportunity for freedom in this world.\n  We are committed, Mr. President. Our only option is to persevere to \nvictory. With all people, I hope and pray it will be soon.\n  I thank the committee for the bill they have brought here to the \nSenate floor to give the President the tools he needs to protect our \nsecurity. I look forward to our consideration and passage of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate today \nto share with my colleagues and the American people a genuine success \nstory coming out of Iraq. It is a story that demonstrates how American \ningenuity, coupled with common sense and commitment, is leading to \nimmediate, visible and valuable improvements in the lives of the Iraqi \npeople.\n  I am speaking of the Commander's Emergency Response Program. This is \na program that allows our troops on the ground to fund low-cost, high-\nimpact humanitarian and small reconstruction projects that benefit the \nquality of life of the Iraqi people and contribute to our country's \nstabilization efforts in Iraq.\n  The Commander's Emergency Response Program, or CERP, is a program \nthat has generated significant success and one that deserves to be told \nand told and told.\n  With the wave of bad news coming out of Iraq in recent weeks, it is \neasy to lose sight of the progress we have made in that country and of \nthe many accomplishments our Armed Forces have already reached.\n  Our men and women in uniform have performed magnificently, and the \nCommander's Emergency Response Program gives them a tool to fund small-\nscale projects that have an immediate, visible, and high-value impact \non the lives of the Iraqi people. We are literally talking about \nrepairing homes, painting schools, restocking hospitals, and restoring \nfreshwater supplies to villages. No project is too small; no task is \ntoo trivial.\n  To date, our commanders on the ground have spent over $250 million \nthrough the Commander's Emergency Response Program, funding over 21,000 \nprojects at an average cost of less than $7,000. That is right, $7,000.\n  Our local commanders have used the CERP to reopen hospitals and \nclinics all across Iraq to administer over 22 million vaccinations. \nThey have distributed new textbooks to 5.9 million students who are \nattending school, some for the first time. Our commanders have funded \nover 1,000 water and sewer projects, bringing clean water to farmers \nand to villages.\n  In Rutba, CERP funds were used for electrical and plumbing repairs to \nthe local youth center. The repairs, which cost less than $9,000, were \ncompleted within 10 days.\n  In Baghdad, the 30th Medical Brigade used the CERP funds to purchase \ninspection equipment for seven slaughterhouses.\n  The list of small, yet meaningful, projects could go on and on. Most \nimportantly, the CERP lets our troops act quickly without becoming \nentangled in redtape or bureaucracy.\n  Individually, these small-scale projects contribute to the \nimprovement in the daily lives of Iraqi citizens step by step. \nCollectively, these thousands of projects become something larger, like \npieces of a puzzle that join together to reveal a larger picture--a \ngood picture.\n  Collectively, these projects illustrate the concern of the U.S. \nmilitary for the Iraqi people, the commitment that our men and women in \nuniform bring to improving the lives of Iraqis every single day, and \nthe creativity in our approach to ensuring security and stability in \nIraq.\n  We do not read much about these kinds of activities, but collectively \nthese projects give our troops on the ground an opportunity to reach \nout to Iraqi citizens and to build a bond of mutual trust and good \nwill.\n  BG David Blackledge, the commander of the 352nd Civil Affairs Command \nin Iraq, said one of the reasons\n\n[[Page S5741]]\n\nthe Commander's Emergency Response Program has been so successful is \nthat it is administered by the local battalion or brigade commander on \nthe ground who is living and interacting with the citizens of his or \nher area of responsibility on a daily basis.\n  Who can better identify the immediate needs that can be addressed \nthrough low-cost, high-impact projects than the soldiers right there on \nthe ground?\n  With all due respect for the policy people here in Washington, they \ncannot see the potholes in the roads, they cannot see the dilapidated \nbuildings and infrastructure that has degenerated for years under the \ntyrannical dictatorship of Saddam Hussein. Our troops on the ground see \nthese obstacles every day, and the Commander's Emergency Response \nProgram lets them address these problems immediately and effectively \nwith the cooperation and assistance of the Iraqi people.\n\n  Let me be clear--very clear: In most cases, the actual work is done \nby Iraqis themselves, so that in addition to yielding immediate and \nvisible results, projects funded from the CERP provide jobs to Iraqis \nwho are eager to rebuild their country and to stimulate the Iraqi \neconomy.\n  Some people might be concerned that our commanders are walking around \nIraq and Afghanistan with thousands of dollars of cash in their \npockets, spending it without congressional oversight. Let me assure \nthose people that is not so. The coalition has instituted strict \ncontrols to ensure complete accountability of the funds from the \nCommander's Emergency Response Program.\n  The Commander's Emergency Response Program is a low-cost, high-impact \nprogram, the effects of which will be felt throughout Iraq. It has been \ninstrumental in gaining the confidence of the Iraqi people and in \ngenerating a tremendous amount of good will toward our troops on the \nground.\n  Sometimes all it takes to improve the lives of Iraqi citizens and to \nbuild relationships is to repair a door that was damaged in a raid, or \nto provide a power generator to a factory so its Iraqi employees can \nget back to work. These are the types of small, yet meaningful, \nprojects our commanders can tackle with the Commander's Emergency \nResponse Program. These projects do not cost much in terms of dollars, \nbut the return is tremendous. It is critical we continue to incorporate \nthis approach into our reconstruction efforts in Iraq. Our commanders \nneed reasonable, sound financial flexibility to match the speed of \ntheir operations and the dynamic nature of our battlefields.\n  The Commander's Emergency Response Program provides our commanders \nwith a flexible tool to respond quickly and decisively to humanitarian \nproblems. If fixing a well quickly solves a local problem and shows a \nneighborhood the coalition is improving their lives, then that is an \nimportant tool for our troops to have.\n  Initially, this program was funded from seized Iraqi assets. I am \nproud to say we gave the Department of Defense the authority to \ncontinue the Commander's Emergency Response Program in the current \nfiscal year 2004 supplemental appropriations bill. I look forward to \nagain supporting the Department as we pass the fiscal year 2005 \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill.\n  I close with a final thought. Our men and women in uniform liberated \n25 million Iraqi people in a military campaign with swiftness, \nprecision, and success--success unparalleled in history. We can \nattribute this success to the foresight and creativity that allowed us \nto prepare and equip a total force the world has never seen. Now we are \napplying that same foresight and creativity as we tackle the difficult \ntask of reconstructing and stabilizing Iraq.\n  The Commander's Emergency Response Program provides visible, high-\nimpact support to the Iraqi people so they can create a foundation for \na free and stable society. It is a true success story in Iraq. I am \nproud of the troops who use it to help the Iraqi people every day, and \nI am proud to support this very important program.\n  Kate Kaufer and Sid Ashworth of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nDefense prepared these remarks for my presentation.\n  I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/19/senate-section/article/S5741-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5741-S5743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PENTAGON RESPONSE TO IRAQI PRISONER ABUSE\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, last week, along with a number of my \ncolleagues, I went up into the room on the fourth floor in the Capitol \nwhere the Defense Department, the State Department, and the CIA come to \nbrief us on classified information. I sat in a darkened room where we \nsaw a slide show of the photographs that had been taken of Americans \ninflicting abuse on Iraqi prisoners. The pictures were revolting, they \nwere disgusting, and they left us all with a sense of outrage that this \nhad gone on, outrage that Americans had been involved in anything such \nas this.\n  I did not look forward to the experience. Indeed, I made the initial \ndecision not to go. Then I decided: No, if I am going to be involved in \nexamining what is here, I have to see the evidence, as revolting as it \nmay be.\n  The sense of outrage that I and my colleagues felt about this was \nshared by all Americans, but in one sector of American society it seems \nto be even greater than anyplace else. There are some in this society \nwho might not be able to guess what that sector is. But I would say the \noutrage that has been the strongest has come from those who serve in \nthe American military.\n  Duty, honor, country--these are the watch words of the American \nmilitary, and they were violated by those who took those actions in the \nprison in Baghdad. They did not do their duty. They dishonored the \nuniforms they wore as they abused those prisoners, and they brought \ndisgrace on the country whose Constitution they had taken an oath to \nuphold and defend.\n  The sense of outrage is nationwide, but it is particularly focused \namong those who have sworn to uphold duty, honor, and country and saw \ntheir fellows in uniform violate those principles.\n  I rise to discuss this today because today is the first court-martial \ncoming as a result of the investigations that have been conducted into \nthis activity. This morning in Baghdad, Army SPC Jeremy Sivits pled \nguilty, was convicted, and sentenced to a 1-year imprisonment, \nreduction in rank, and a bad conduct discharge.\n  Now, there are those in our society who have less faith in the \nmilitary, who say: These courts-martial are a part of a coverup; this \nis an attempt to gloss over what has happened; one cannot trust the \nmilitary to investigate themselves; and we need a whole series of \ninvestigations by outside groups.\n  I believe the facts are that we will find out more what happened from \nthe courts-martial than we would find out from any degree of \ninvestigation conducted elsewhere. I offer as a demonstration of the \nfact that the military can be trusted to act in matters of this kind \nthe following chronology of what has happened with respect to this \nincident.\n  We now know that the abuse of the prisoners took place in the last \nquarter of 2003. We do not know the exact dates, but sometime toward \nthe end of that year the alleged detainee abuse occurred. On January \n13, 2004, SPC Joseph Darby opened an e-mail thinking he was going to \nsee pictures that he described as a travelogue; a history of the \nperformance of a particular unit. Instead, what had been downloaded on \nhis computer were the photographs that my colleagues and I saw in room \n407 of this building.\n  Specialist Darby was absolutely stunned. What did he do? Here were \nhis fellow soldiers engaged in activity that was clearly in violation \nof everything he had been taught, people he wanted to feel close with \nand identified with, people who, perhaps, were his friends. What would \nhe do? He did his duty, and he provided a CD of the abuse photos to the \nArmy Criminal Investigation Command, or the CID, on January 13, 2004. \nOn January 14, the CID began its investigation--no attempt to cover up. \nNo attempt to hide or turn away from the fact that there was a \npotential difficulty. They began the next day, and they notified people \nup the chain of command of what they were doing.\n  On January 16, just 2 days later, Brigadier General Kimmitt announced \nthat there would be an investigation by\n\n[[Page S5742]]\n\nCentral Command. It had gone up all that way, that quickly. In just 3 \ndays they were at the top levels of Central Command.\n  Two days after that, BG Janis Karpinski, who was the commander at Abu \nGhraib prison, was admonished and suspended from her command. She was \nrelieved just 2 days after this reached the attention of Central \nCommand.\n  Additionally, the Abu Ghraib chain of command was suspended, from the \nbattalion commander, a lieutenant colonel, all the way down. Just 2 \ndays after this was brought to the attention of Central Command, the \nentire group was relieved.\n  Now, on January 19, a combined joint task force requested that \nCentral Command appoint an investigating officer, and on January 31, \nMajor General Taguba was appointed to conduct the investigation.\n  On February 10, the Secretary of the Army tasks the inspector general \nto conduct an analysis of the internment detention policies, practices, \nand procedures. It goes beyond just the prison: Look at the whole Army \nand our procedures to see what can be done to prevent this from \nhappening again.\n  On March 12, General Taguba completed his investigation and briefed \nthe commander of joint task force 7, Lieutenant General Sanchez. Also \non March 12, Lieutenant General Helmly, who was the commander of the \nU.S. Army Reserve Command, directed that Command's inspector general to \nconduct an assessment of training for Reserve personnel on the issues \nof detainee treatment, ethics, and leadership to see if the training \nhad broken down in a way that would cause this to happen. All of this \nwas going on--the military acting on its own.\n  On March 20, the first charges were preferred against six accused and \nannounced by Brigadier General Kimmitt at a press conference. This is \nnot something that got discovered by some investigative reporter \ndigging in behind the scenes. This was something that was announced by \nthe military after they had done a careful examination and moved in a \nway to protect the rights of every individual.\n\n  At that announcement, no names or units were identified so that they \nwould not compromise the due process of those who were being accused.\n  On April 15, Major General Fay, the Army Deputy Chief of Staff for \nIntelligence, appointed an investigative officer to examine the \ncircumstances with respect to the 205th Military Intelligence Brigade. \nThat is the group where the commander was relieved within 2 days of \ndiscovering that there was an allegation of a problem.\n  On May 1, Lieutenant General Sanchez issued a memorandum of reprimand \nto six general officers and one letter of admonition to a member of the \n800th Military Police Brigade as recommended by Major General Taguba. \nThis is not something that they passed off to the GIs, the sergeants, \nthe corporals, and the privates. This is something they took care of at \nthe general officer level. Six general officers received a memorandum \nof reprimand. That is a career-ending experience for a general officer.\n  Then on May 7, Secretary Rumsfeld announced the independent review \npanel headed by former Defense Secretary Jim Schlessinger, including \nretired Air Force General Chuck Horner, former Representative Tillie \nFowler, and former Defense Secretary Harold Brown. And then, today, on \nMay 19, the first court-martial has taken place and Specialist Sivits \nwas found guilty and sentenced.\n  The lesson that comes from this list of actions is a lesson that the \nworld should heed. The lesson for Iraqis and other nations is that this \nis how democracies handle their problems. This is how Americans face \nthe difficulties that arise when there is a breakdown that occurs \nwithin our military. We do not hide it. We do not pretend it did not \nhappen. We do not strive to find excuses. We act in the way consistent \nwith the rule of law.\n  I hope everyone in the world would recognize the difference between \nthe way we have responded to this and the way al-Qaida has responded to \nthis. We have responded to it by exercising the rule of law and seeking \nthose responsible. They have responded by taking an innocent American \ncivilian, who had nothing whatever to do with any of this, and cutting \noff his head, live and in color on international television. That is \nthe difference between Americans and al-Qaida when faced with a \nproblem.\n  So that is the first lesson I hope the world will take from the way \nwe are handling this. The lesson that the military should take from \nthis is that the rules are there to be obeyed. The lesson that should \ngo forward from Specialist Sivits' court-martial, from the six general \nofficers who got the memorandum of reprimand and from the \ninvestigations that are still going forward is that if the rules are \nbroken, you end up in Fort Leavenworth. That is the lesson that should \ncome out of this for the American military, and I believe it is being \nreceived there.\n\n  The lesson for the commanders, those who are now responsible and who \nhave taken over to replace those who were relieved, is this. It comes \nfrom a statement by General Eisenhower, who knew something about \nmilitary discipline. He said: ``Areas that are not inspected \ndeteriorate.''\n  Let's go back to Specialist Sivits for a moment and find out from his \nstatements relating to his court-martial what really happened. I am \nquoting now from the Washington Post:\n\n       Sivits told investigators that the abuse would not have \n     happened had higher-ranking members been present. ``Our \n     command would have slammed us,'' he said. ``They believe in \n     doing the right thing. If they saw what was going on, there \n     would be hell to pay.''\n       That statement echoes testimony given by one of the initial \n     investigators on the case. During a session similar to a \n     grand jury proceeding, Tyler Pieron, an Army criminal \n     investigator, said the abuses occurred, ``after the chain of \n     command had changed shifts and gone home.''\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Sivits said he did not report the abuse to his commanders \n     because [he was told not to by a friend] ``and I try to be \n     friends with everyone. I see now where trying to be friends \n     with everyone can cost you.''\n\n  I spoke with Secretary Rumsfeld this morning about this lesson, the \nlesson of command. It is fine to change the command, but we must \nexamine what caused the problem and change the procedures. Even though \nthe rules were there, the procedures broke down. There was not a duty \nofficer on duty. We have been told that this abuse took place between 2 \nand 4 in the morning when no one was around. I raised with Secretary \nRumsfeld the importance of seeing to it from now on that the new \ncommanders of the prison make sure there is a duty officer there all \nnight long.\n  Back to Eisenhower's dictum, there should be snap, surprise \ninspections. People in the prisons should never know when someone might \ndrop in, unexpected and unannounced, to see what is going on. Secretary \nRumsfeld concurred. I believe that is the lesson that command should \nreceive from this experience, and I believe it is the lesson they will \nlearn and they will follow.\n  As sorry as this chapter is in our proud military history and as deep \nas this stain has become upon America's honor, it is not the first time \nwe have seen such chapters. It is not the first time we have endured \nsuch stains. I wish I could say it is the last time this will happen, \nbut even in this morning's news we are hearing that there are more \npictures, that it may have been more widespread than we thought. With \nhuman beings as imperfect as they are, it is inevitable that at some \npoint in the future someone else will break the rules, violate his \noath, and take actions that will cause all Americans to mourn, as we do \nover these actions.\n  Given that history, that it has happened before and perhaps will \nhappen again, we should remember what we did as a nation when it \nhappened before and what we are doing now. We dealt with it. We went \nafter those who were responsible, discovered who they were, gave them \ntheir full due process, but when they were convicted, they were \npunished. They were dealt with. Then we made the changes that were \nnecessary to see to it that it wouldn't happen again. Then we got past \nit.\n  We have not allowed those past chapters in our history to deter us \nfrom our destiny as a nation. We should do the same thing now. We are \nin the process of discovering who the guilty are. We are in the process \nof conducting courts- martial. Specialist Sivits is just the first. \nCharges have been proffered against others and additional courts-\n\n[[Page S5743]]\n\nmartial will be forthcoming. We are in the process of making the \nchanges--not just the change of command but the change in procedures to \nsee to it that this will not happen again.\n\n  As we have done in the past, we must get through this and not let it \ndeter us from our overall goal of why we are in Iraq. We must not \nfixate on this stain on our honor to the point that we become so \nmuscle-bound that we cannot proceed forward in our mission.\n  What is our mission? Speakers who have addressed this before me have \nmade that clear. Our mission is to provide freedom and security for the \npeople of Iraq. I believe that means freedom and security for the \nMiddle East generally. I believe that means transforming the world in \nwhich Americans live and an increase of freedom and security for our \nNation as well. These are worthy, indeed noble goals, and we must not \nbe deterred from seeking them by preoccupation with this particular \noutrage.\n  I close with a conversation I had over the weekend. Like many of us \nover the weekend, I went home to Utah and I participated in Armed \nForces Day. It was a poignant Armed Forces Day for a variety of \nreasons, because many of the people who were there were families of \nthose in the military who were there without their family member--that \nis, children, husbands, wives, mothers and fathers of Utahns who are \nserving in this war and who are not home with their families to enjoy \nthe delightful spring day at Murray City Park where everyone was having \na picnic and a good time. Set up in that area was a series of flags, \none flag for each individual who had fallen in either Iraq or \nAfghanistan. Of course, the majority of flags were American flags, but \nI was struck by the number of British flags, Italian flags, Polish \nflags, Spanish flags--one I did not recognize, an Ukrainian flag, an \nEstonian flag. We are providing the leadership, but many countries in \nthe world are responding to us as we launch on this mission.\n  On Armed Forces Day I sat next to a colonel. He was not a Utahn; he \nhad come to participate in the activities. We visited over lunch. With \nthe Army, he has been in Kosovo, he has been in Bosnia, he has been in \nAfghanistan, he has been in Iraq, and he was on his way back to Iraq.\n  I said to him: Colonel, tell me what it is like. You have been there, \nyou have been on the ground. Tell me what it is like. He gave me an \nanswer we hear a lot. Indeed, it was the first sentence out of his \nmouth that comes out the same as many others. He said: Well, things are \nnot nearly as bad as the U.S. press would have you believe. Things are \nreally going fairly well in many parts of the country. But we have \nproblems.\n  We talked about some of the problems. He made this observation that I \nthink should keep us thoughtful as we address our mission in Iraq. He \nsaid: You know, whether it is Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, or Iraq, the \nsame thing is true: Those people are just like us in that all they want \nis to have their children be able to walk out of the door and be safe \non the street, to be able to go to school without intimidation and \nlearn what they need to learn to get a decent job and live a decent \nlife. That is all they want in Kosovo, Bosnia, Afghanistan, or Iraq--\njust like us. That is what we want in America. To bring that to Iraq \nand give the people of Iraq that opportunity, with their wives and \ntheir children and their grandchildren, unfortunately requires force of \narms. Americans, British, Italians, Poles, Spaniards, Ukrainians, \nEstonians, are willing to risk their lives to bring about that goal. We \nmust never lose sight of the importance of that mission or of the \nsacrifice that has gone into achieving it. We must never turn back \nsimply because there are those who have put a stain on American honor \nby the way they have behaved.\n\n  I pay tribute to the Armed Forces. I pay tribute to the chain of \ncommand that is dealing with these challenges. I pay tribute to those \nwho are willing to face the problems and not back away from them or \ncover them up. We must support them in their efforts. We must not smear \nthe entire establishment because of the actions of a few.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/19/senate-section/article/S5743-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5743-S5744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            OREGON'S ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, yesterday I had the privilege to sit in \nthat chair during much of the morning hour and I heard many of the \nspeeches of our colleagues and friends on the other side. The theme of \nthe day was, Are you better off today than you were 4 years ago? Those \nare the words of Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter. Now they are being \napplied to George W. Bush. I can say as an Oregonian that the answer in \nmy State is yes, we are now better off than we were 4 years ago.\n  When I watched George W. Bush take his oath of office on a cold and \nrainy January day 3\\1/2\\ years ago, I was very mindful that Oregon was \nnot going into recession; we were deep into recession. We had spent 8 \nyears of the Clinton administration watching the dismantling of 70,000 \nfamily-wage jobs in many of the natural resource industries in my \nState, specifically, timber industry, fishing, farming, and others.\n  We were told we did not need low tech, we had high tech. But the \nbubble of high tech had already popped in Oregon. Billions of high-tech \nvalues, equities, were disappearing because they were no more than the \nblue sky in the end than they were in the beginning.\n  Then we should have known it, but the tourism industry that we were \ntold would take the place of our basic industries was in risk of peril \nthat maybe we could not have imagined. When September 11 occurred, \ntourism evaporated, as well. And my State, because of the policy of the \n1990s, coupled with the incredible shocks of the high-tech bubble \npopping, September 11, corporate scandals, began to register some of \nthe highest unemployment rates in America.\n\n  Today those rates are falling and falling fast in Oregon. They are \nnowhere near as good as they ought to be, but with lower taxes, healthy \nforest initiative, an effort to preserve our hydroelectric dams in the \nPacific Northwest, Oregon is coming back, tourists are coming back, \nhigh-tech is being restabilized, and trade is being advanced. These are \nall issues that will be and are part of the Presidential election.\n  As one Oregonian, I ask, Are we better off than we were 4 years ago? \nBy most indicators, the answer is emphatically, yes. The rule of thumb \nis it takes 6 months between the kind of economic news we are beginning \nto enjoy now before that news is fully understood by the American \npeople. If that holds true this time, a majority of Oregonians will be \nable to answer with me that, yes, we are better off now than we were 4 \nyears ago.\n  It is not perfect. Gas prices, as my colleague from Oregon, Ron \nWyden, pointed out, are too high. There are many reasons for that. I \ndon't know that they will ever come down to what they were. But I do \nknow the contender for the Presidency does not have the answer on this. \nThe truth is, we have to explore for more and we have to conserve more. \nIt is not all one and it is not all the other. It is both.\n  I understand he is complaining he does not see the President \njawboning down the prices. Yet I think what Mr. Woodward said, that the \nPresident was talking to Prince Bandar, the men and women would not \nstand for it. You cannot have it both ways all the time.\n  The other half of the equation of, Are you better off now than you \nwere 4 years ago, is the whole issue of our foreign policy and our \ndomestic security. Having spent 6 years on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, I watched President Clinton, well motivated in foreign \npolicy, trying to reconcile what to do with American power in a world \nin which we were the only superpower.\n  I learned a great lesson from him as it relates to Kosovo. I was one \nof the few Republican Senators who voted with him on Kosovo, \nconsistently believing it was in American interests because it was \nconsistent with an American value that we end genocide in Europe's back \ndoor. But for our intervention, at the urging and pleading of our NATO \nallies, they would have lost Kosovo to Mr. Milosevic without American \npower, President Clinton's leadership, and the support of this Congress\n\n[[Page S5744]]\n\nthat ultimately turned around that policy of genocide toward a European \nMuslim majority.\n  I remember asking President Clinton, Mr. President, can't you go get \na Security Council resolution in support of this? He responded, \nSenator, I cannot because Russia and China have promised to veto.\n  I learned then how wise is now-President Bush's policy that you do \nnot go to the Security Council of the United Nations in pursuit of the \nsecurity of the American people. You do not get a permission slip from \nan institution that in its very makeup is not democratic.\n  It is a very interesting and historical observation that of the 191 \ncountries of the U.N. members, only 89 would be described today as free \nand democratic countries. I guess a little more than half of them would \nbe counted as liberal democratic democracies that ensure political \ncompetition, respect for civil liberties, significant independence, \ncivic life, and independent medias. This is the same institution that \nputs Cuba at the head of its human rights commission and Iran at the \nhead of its disarmament commission.\n  I say we should stay in it in a realistic way, even a skeptical way, \nusing it as it serves America's interests because that is how other \nmembers of the U.N. use the U.N. But do not subject our security to a \nveto by the Security Council.\n  So when I hear our colleague on the other side run television ads in \nmy State saying the first thing he will do as President of the United \nStates is to return American foreign policy to the international \ncommunity, I wonder what he means. And then he clarifies, he will go \nback to the Security Council.\n  I want the American people to know--I plead with Oregonians to know--\nthat there is no security in that. Understand that permanent members of \nthe Council--France in particular; Russia as well; China; occasionally \nGermany is a member--these were the primary creditors of Saddam \nHussein, and they were also significant beneficiaries of the food for \nfraud--I am sorry--the Food for Oil Program which enabled Saddam \nHussein to rearm and to execute tens of thousands of his countrymen and \nto build palaces of great austerity and wastefulness.\n  Regardless of the motives of other countries, the President did the \nright thing by going into Iraq and removing Saddam's murderous regime \nfrom power. We must remember that. He did the right thing for the \npeople of Iraq, and he did the right thing for the American people as \nwell.\n  By liberating the Iraqi people, we have provided hope to people not \nonly in Iraq, but throughout the Middle East, that democracy is an \noption available to them. Civic movements throughout the region have \nemerged calling for political change, even in countries such as Egypt \nand Saudi Arabia. The Washington Post has reported that the individuals \ninvolved in these movements have widely credited President Bush's \ndemocratization policy for allowing them the opportunity to operate in \na climate that, up to now, has been unfriendly to their aspirations. \nThis is a real accomplishment, one that is not often touted, but that \nserves as a harbinger of what is to come if the United States continues \nto press for democratic change in the Middle East.\n  Unfortunately, the shameful images being broadcast around the world \nof a few American soldiers abusing Iraqi prisoners undermine the hard \nwork and dedication of so many Americans who are serving honorably in \nIraq. These abuses are abhorrent, and those who are responsible for \nthem must be punished.\n  But in no way should we equate the actions of a few Americans with \nthe widespread, government-endorsed terror inflicted by Saddam upon his \nown people. The prisoner abuse was wrong, but the United States has \nlaws and military codes that these soldiers violated--and under which \nthey will be held accountable. You can hardly say the same thing about \nSaddam's Iraq.\n  The tragic murder of Nick Berg should remind the American people of \nthe kind of world in which we are living. People who are willing to \nbrutally decapitate an innocent man for the crime of being an American \ncitizen are not individuals who respect international law, or the \nfounding principles of the United Nations. They respect force, and \npower, and resolve, and determination. President Bush understands this \ncritical fact, and is willing to deal with these evil men in those \nterms, not under conditions that we wish existed but do not.\n  I understand that to some, the burden of responsibility we have in \nthe world may seem too much to bear. ``Internationalizing'' conflicts \nseems, on the surface, to be an appropriate way to reduce our \ncommitments abroad. I disagree. The answer is not to abdicate our \nresponsibilities, but to embrace them.\n  Next week I am traveling to Madrid, Athens, and Bratislava to discuss \nthese very issues with our NATO allies. It is my preference that we act \nin conjunction with them, but let me reiterate, we should act \nconsistent with our principles. If in doing so we are at odds with our \nallies, that is a price I am willing to pay.\n  I would simply say, as the Presiding Officer has noted, there is bad \nnews, but there is much good news, and many of us would sure like a \nlittle equality of treatment because our goals in Iraq, our goals in \nthe war on terrorism, are noble. Short of those goals, we are left with \na more moderate tyrant in the Middle East governing Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nhours of debate equally divided on the measure.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, agents of bioterror are potentially the \nmost powerful and devastating weapons of mass destruction that are \nknown to man. Bioterror agents are more powerful than traditional \nweapons of mass destruction, are more powerful than chemical weapons, \nare more powerful than nuclear weapons.\n  When I say that, people oftentimes say: How can you say that? And it \nreally comes down to one simple concern: that many of the bioterror \nagents are and can be infectious. They are agents of virus, of \nbacteria, of another living organism that cannot be seen, that cannot \nbe touched, that cannot be smelled or heard. Yet they are deadly. They \nknow no borders. There are no geographic borders. They attack \nindiscriminately, and they can travel through a school, they can travel \nthrough a community, they can travel through a State, they can travel \nthrough a country, and they can travel, indeed, through a continent. \nThey are powerful, powerful agents.\n  The United States is less than adequately prepared today in terms of \ndefense against these agents of bioterror. Over the next 2 hours, we \nwill be talking about a bill--and ultimately will pass a bill--that is \nlong overdue, legislation that bolsters, that strengthens our Nation's \ndefenses against threats from bioterrorism.\n  I applaud the leadership of Senator Judd Gregg, the distinguished \nchairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. He \nhas done a tremendous service to this Nation by bringing this \nlegislation through his committee and to the floor of the Senate today \nfor passage.\n  We absolutely must--we absolutely must--strengthen our defenses \nagainst the threats of biological weapons which I just referred to. But \nalso covered in this bill are other weapons of mass destruction, \nincluding nuclear, including chemical, and including radiological \nweapons.\n  I also commend the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKennedy, for his efforts to achieve a bipartisan consensus on the \nbioshield legislation we are now considering on the Senate floor.\n  This legislation has been a priority for President Bush. I \ncongratulate him. He first outlined his bold initiative in his State of \nthe Union Address in January 2003. Since then, we have worked closely \nwith the administration and with our colleagues here in Congress to \npass this critical legislation.\n  What the legislation allows us to do is be proactive in developing a \nbroad range of countermeasures to combat biological, chemical, \nradiological, and nuclear threats.\n  It was just several months ago in my own office that there was a \nbioterror attack and ricin was sent. It is a deadly agent. It is an \ninteresting agent to think about because it is deadly. It is ricin. It \nwas here in our Nation's capital city, in an adjacent building. There \nis no antidote. We do not have a medicine that can counteract the \neffects of ricin today.\n  It is now 3, almost 4 years ago that anthrax hit this same capital. \nIt was deadly. With ricin, thank goodness, nobody was hurt and injured. \nWith the anthrax, 3 years ago, the reality was being demonstrated that \nbioterror is here, it is on our own soil. It hit this Nation. It hit \nthis Capitol. It hit the entire east coast. Indeed, it was deadly, that \nlittle anthrax bacteria that you cannot see.\n\n  This legislation allows us to further our response to such agents, \nboth here on our soil, which exist and are being used today, as well as \ninternationally.\n  It was just 2 days ago that a canister of sarin gas--it shifted just \na little bit, with a mixing of two other chemicals, to become sarin \ngas--began to leak through that canister, again reminding us of the \nimpact that chemical weapons can have today.\n  So whether it is domestically or internationally, this piece of \nlegislation will bolster and strengthen our defenses to fight, to use \ncountermeasures that will prevent, hopefully, the use of and have an \nappropriate response to the use of these biological and chemical \nweapons.\n  The bioshield legislation really does do just that. It improves our \nability to investigate, to develop, and to produce these new such \ncountermeasures. For the first time, we have well defined\n\n[[Page S5761]]\n\nthis new paradigm of a public and private partnership working together \nto develop these countermeasures in our Nation's interests.\n  While maintaining high standards of scientific excellence, the bill \nstreamlines the ability of agencies and entities, such as the National \nInstitutes of Health, to rapidly advance research into these much \nneeded countermeasures, countermeasures to the realities of biological \nweapons today.\n  The bill provides the private sector with new incentives to invest in \nresearch and development of biomedical countermeasures that otherwise \nsimply would not have the business potential. We need to give those \nappropriate incentives to the private sector, to use its ingenuity, to \nuse its innovation, to use its capitalism, to use its knowledge to \nrespond to the realities, these real threats that are out there today.\n  The legislation is critical to our efforts to protect our citizens. \nThere is a whole series of biological threats that are categorized by \ncategories 1, 2, and 3. For the category 1 list, we have vaccines for \nonly two, one being anthrax and the other being smallpox. Both of those \nvaccines need continued research and refinement in order to minimize \nthose side effects and to make sure we can improve the ease of delivery \nso that in the event we need to respond, we can respond quickly, \nefficiently, and safely, whether it be for our soldiers or for citizens \nthroughout America.\n  This bill also is a major component of our overall much larger \nstrategy to improve our overall biodefense.\n  There are other initiatives such as strengthening our public health \nsystem. Our public health system has been neglected over the last 25 or \n30 years. That public health system, that public health infrastructure, \nis the frontline in response to these agents.\n  Another component I hope we will be able to address in the future, \nwhich is important as we develop this broad strategy against \nbioterrorism, is this whole element of vaccine liability. Clearly, our \nvaccine liability system needs reform.\n  We have the latest public health challenges, things such as SARS, \nsudden acute respiratory syndrome--a year and a half ago that virus \ncame, and nobody knew what it was, and the terror it created--West Nile \nvirus, and vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. All of those \nhave taught us the danger of sitting back and being too complacent and \nnot being proactive. In this bill we are being proactive.\n  I commend especially Chairman Gregg, the President of the United \nStates for his bold leadership, Senator Kennedy, and all of our \ncolleagues who have worked to craft this legislation to see that we \nrespond to a clearly identifiable need. Passage of this legislation, \nindeed, is a major step forward in strengthening our national security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I thank the majority leader for his kind \nstatements. I certainly want to recognize the fact that without the \nmajority leader's very strong and thoughtful leadership in this area, \nwe would not have gotten this far. He is obviously an expert in the \narea of health care and especially sensitive to the need to do \nsomething in the area of fighting those agents which might be used \nagainst us as biological agents. His leadership and knowledge have made \na significant difference in our ability to be successful with this \nbill. I thank him for that leadership.\n  I join him in thanking the President. Obviously, this is an \ninitiative high on the President's agenda and the people at NIH, Dr. \nZerhouni and Dr. Fauci, who understand the threat and understand the \nneed to address the threat.\n  We have to put the threat in context, and, regrettably, the context \nis serious. Were this 1950, 1960, were this any time prior to the \nlatter part of last century and the beginning of our century, and we \nhad terrorists out there who wanted to do us harm, who were as \nfanatical as are the people who wish to do us harm, the Islamic \nfundamentalist movement, we would fight them and we would be concerned \nabout them. But our concerns and our ability to handle their threat \nwould be proportional. We would have been able to manage it at that \ntime in an effective and rather contained way.\n  The problem today is that when you have a fanatical group, a group \nwilling to not only pursue its purposes without limitation and as part \nof that to be willing to kill innocent individuals, and when you have a \ngroup such as that that is also able to get or potentially take \npossession of weapons of mass destruction, you have created a whole new \nissue, a whole new threat, a threat of massive proportions. Because if \nindividuals are willing to use weapons of mass destruction--biological, \nchemical, or nuclear--and they have no compunction about killing \ninnocents--and in fact the purpose of Islamic fundamentalism is \nspecifically to kill Western individuals, people who subscribe to the \nAmerican philosophy, to our Nation--and their purpose is to undermine \nour country, to destroy our culture because they deem Western culture \nto be a threat to them, when you have people like that and they have \nthe ability to possess weapons of mass destruction and the delivery \nsystems to get those weapons into places where they could do massive \nharm, then you have a problem of immense proportion. The Nation must \nprotect itself from that type of threat. That is what this bioshield \ninitiative is an attempt to do.\n\n  We recognize, as the majority leader stated, that probably the single \nmost threatening weapon which these individuals can get their hands on \neasily and disperse easily--it is not the single most threatening \nweapon overall; I suspect a nuclear device, were they able to produce \none, would be more threatening--the type of weaponry which they most \nlikely can get their hands on which has the potential to do the most \nharm to the most innocent individuals is a biological weapon or \npotentially a chemical weapon, but more likely a biological weapon. \nBecause if they were able, for example, as was seen in a small \ncontained area in the Capitol, to spread anthrax or to spread smallpox \nor to spread botulism, Ebola, or any other agents which would be a \ndisease which would be carried, as the majority leader mentioned, \nwithout sight, without sound, without smell, without noise, across a \nlarge dispersal area, they could literally harm tens of thousands, \npotentially even more, Americans.\n  There is no question but if these fundamentalist terrorists, Islamic \nfundamentalists, get their hands on that type of weapon, get their \nhands on a biological weapon, come into possession of an anthrax \ncapability or a smallpox capability, they will use it. There is no \nquestion about that. They will use it in a place where people gather \nwho are gathering simply to go through their daily lives, whether it is \nin a subway system as occurred in Japan, or whether it is in a building \nas occurred here in the Capitol, or whether it is in some other area \nwhere people congregate.\n  So we as a nation--and the President has made this very clear--have a \nresponsibility to try to defend ourselves from that type of a threat. \nIt is not an inexpensive responsibility. It is going to cost us a lot \nof money. Regrettably, it is a complex responsibility. There is no \nmagic wand you can wave that will inoculate the American public against \nthese threats. But we understand there is a procedure to go as far down \nthe road as we can possibly go to accomplish that sort of an \ninoculation or have the capacity to defend our people from that type of \na threat.\n  One of the great advantages we have in fighting Islamic \nfundamentalism is that we are a sophisticated society which has \ntechnical capabilities which we can bring to bear in this war--and it \nis a war--and bring it to bear in a manner which allows us to take the \nposition that gives us self-defense and also the capacity to carry the \nbattle to them rather than have them carry the battle to us.\n\n  This bioshield bill grew out of an initiative that the President \nsuggested, which was that in the case of a series of agents which are \nbiologically driven, which we know can do the most harm, the top seven \nor eight agents which we know can do the most harm--six or seven \nagents--we are going to initiate an effort to try to develop the \nscience necessary to develop ways to interdict, to stop, to cure, to \nmake the attacks that use those types of agents less harmful to our \npeople. But in order to accomplish that, we had to recognize as a \ngovernment--and the administration certainly did--that there is no \ncommercial applicability for this type\n\n[[Page S5762]]\n\nof research. There is no commercial demand for this type of a \ncommodity.\n  A vaccine for anthrax is not in great commercial demand. People are \nnot just going to go out and buy it or take it for the purposes of \ngoing through their daily lives. It is not like some other cure to some \nother sickness, and, therefore, we had to set up a structure where we \nmake it viable for our private sector pharmaceutical industry and \nbiotechnology industry to invest the extraordinary amount of money it \ntakes to invest in the production of this type of response capability. \nThat is essentially what bioshield does. It puts in place a regime \nwhich accomplishes three things.\n  First, it creates a research and development initiative which is \npublic and private, using the great strength of NIH, which is refocused \nunder the leadership of Dr. Zerhouni and Dr. Fauci, which has refocused \na large amount of their energy, time, and expertise on this issue. It \ncombines that public effort, which is aggressive, with a private \ninitiative.\n  In order to get the private initiative going, it sets up a funding \nstream which makes it clear to the private sector that should they \npursue development of vaccines or other ways to treat these agents \nwhich we see as the most threatening, whether it be anthrax, plague, \nsmallpox, viral hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola, or botulism, when \nthey set up processes to address those diseases, whether it is a \nvaccine or whether it is something else, they will know there are going \nto be dollars in the pipeline to support that research and, more \nimportantly, to purchase their product once they have produced it. And \nit will be purchased by the Government, obviously, because there is no \nmarket in the private sector for that.\n\n  So along with the research component of having NIH focused on this \nand the private sector focused on this, this bill sets up a stockpiling \nand procurement procedure to make it clear that, first, once we develop \nthese types of vaccines, we are going to have enough of them to be able \nto deal with a major attack. Second, the producers of these vaccines or \nother treatment processes developed--it might be a pharmaceutical--are \ngoing to be able to have adequate return on their investment so they \ncan pay the cost of producing that and still make a reasonable return. \nThird, the bill sets up a process where, should the event occur, should \nwe be attacked with some sort of an agent that we do not yet have the \nactual approved response to--don't have an approved vaccine--and it has \nnot received all of the FDA clearing that vaccines must go through, \nwhich is a long, complicated process in order to approve a vaccine for \nhuman use, or approve a pharmaceutical, but should there be somewhere \nin the pipeline a vaccine which appears to have some success in \nremediating damage caused by one of these biological attacks, or a \npharmaceutical which remediates that, and it is in the pipeline, we set \nup a procedure that allows, under certain very limited situations where \nthere is a clear and obvious emergency, the administration to use that \ntreatment that is in development for human consumption in order to \nconfront an emergency situation where specifically we have been \nattacked.\n  So that is the basic theme of the way this bill works. It creates the \nresearch component, the stockpiling and purchasing component, and \ncreates an emergency outlet valve, if you will, for addressing a \nsituation where we are attacked and we don't have a finalized product \nto address it.\n  As the majority leader mentioned, of the six major areas of threat \nthat we see in the biological area, today we only have vaccines to \naddress two of them. One of the vaccine regimes is sort of difficult to \ndeliver. That, of course, is in the anthrax area. We have, obviously, a \nvery strong vaccine capability, and we are getting the production of \nnew vaccines in the area of smallpox. Hopefully, people will get back \nto being vaccinated for smallpox because this is a legitimate threat. \nBut in the area of plague, viral hemorrhagic fever, and botulism, there \nare no vaccines yet. That is why it is very important that we focus the \nresources, energy, and the genius of the American health community on \nmaking sure that we try to develop these types of responses.\n  We are, regrettably, living in a world that has people who would do \nharm, who would pursue a course of inflicting massive harm for the \npurpose of making their political and quasi-religious point. It is an \nunfortunate fact. We need look no further than 9/11 to recognize that \nthe killing of innocent people by the thousands is something that \nfundamentalist Islamic people, who ascribe to that belief, who are \nterrorists, basically are willing to pursue. We know that, regrettably, \nthese biologic agents exist. Anthrax can be produced probably fairly \neasily if they have a chemistry background. We know it can be delivered \nand, regrettably, it was in the Capitol Building.\n  We know that other types of agents can also be produced. Regrettably, \nthere may even be a vial of smallpox somewhere out there that could be \nused. So it is critical, as the President has so appropriately stated, \nthat we put into place the process for trying to, in this area, reduce \nthe threat, and hopefully someday be able to totally mute the threat. \nObviously, if we are capable as a culture of developing a vaccine or \nsome other treatment that will neutralize the effect of these types of \nbiological agents, then they will not be used against us because the \nharm they would cause would not be worth the risk of developing and \nspreading of the agent. So it is definitely in our interest to pursue \nthis course.\n\n  It is regrettable that it has taken us this long to get to this point \nfrom a legislative standpoint. But I congratulate the administration \nbecause they have not waited on us, the Congress. They have gone down \nthe road as far as they think they can go toward letting contracts and \nputting into place the processes necessary to begin the development of \nthese various vaccines and regimes necessary to address these risks. \nThey have sort of come to a dead end, where they need this \nauthorization in order to take the next steps necessary in the process \nof developing and expediting the process of getting these cures in \nplace and the regimes in place.\n  So this bill remains critical to our efforts in the fight on the war \nagainst terrorism. Therefore, it is good that we have finally been able \nto reach a consensus in the Senate, where we will be able to pass this \nbill later today. It is my understanding that the House of \nRepresentatives is likely to accept this bill as it passes the Senate. \nHopefully, that will be the case, and we can move it down to the \nPresident, who I know has been waiting anxiously. He has talked to us \nmany times about the need for this piece of legislation. This will be a \ngood way, obviously, to complete this week.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3178\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I send to the desk a substitute \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], for himself and \n     Mr. Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered 3178.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I thank the staff of the HELP Committee, \nVincent Ventimiglia and Sharon Soderstrom, Steve Irizarry, and the \nother members of the staff who have done a great job in pulling this \nlegislation together and following it through the process.\n  It has been a complicated, tortured, difficult exercise. It would not \nhave gotten to this point without strong and effective staff work. The \ncountry owes them a debt of gratitude.\n  In the end, this bill is going to be one of the major components of \nour ability to protect ourselves as we move through this world that has \nsuch fundamentally evil individuals in it who might actually use this \ntype of weapon against us or anyone else.\n  There will also be some side benefits to this initiative. I honestly \nbelieve as we evolve various vaccines and initiate this research effort \nin trying to address issues such as anthrax and botulism and plague, we \nwill actually have some spinoffs that will be positive in other health \nareas, and specifically in ways to deliver these types of vaccines in a\n\n[[Page S5763]]\n\nless intrusive way. For example, anthrax has already gone from a six-\nshot series down to a three-shot series. I understand there is \nsignificant progress being made toward having a single vaccination \nevent, potentially, in the anthrax area. There is great progress being \nmade that I think may pay dividends to the American people beyond just \nthe fight on terrorism but in addressing other types of agents which \nneed and require vaccines or pharmaceuticals.\n  So this is a bill that not only is going to be a plus from the \nstandpoint of fighting the war on terrorism but will be a plus from the \nstandpoint of improving the health care delivery system in the United \nStates, and specifically giving Americans better and more effective \npharmaceuticals and vaccines.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion or \nyielding back of time on S. 15, the bill be temporarily set aside, and \nthe Senate then vote on passage at 2 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask that if we proceed to a quorum \ncall, the time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on \nthe side of the proponent, Senator Gregg, for up to 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am here to address the Bioshield Act \nand particularly section 3 of that bill that directs the Secretary of \nHomeland Security on an ongoing basis to assess threats of use of \nchemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear agents and determine \nwhich threats pose a material risk of use against the U.S. population.\n  I draw my colleagues' particular attention to what has recently been \nreported in the newspaper about one of the most recent uses of sarin \ngas that has occurred and its possibility of being used in the United \nStates.\n  I commend my colleagues for bringing this bill to the Senate, for a \nchance to talk about it. It is a very important issue. I see in this \nparticular section our need to assess this. The discovery and \nconfirmation of sarin gas in artillery shells in Iraq highlights \nevidence that Saddam Hussein had a weapons of mass destruction program \nthat was not only fully operational but ready for use against U.S. \ntroops.\n  I raise this for two reasons. One, the argument that we have not been \nable to find WMD in Iraq is ongoing. I hope we will not dismiss the \nlack of any findings in the past and what we are finding now, the \nactual use of sarin gas against our troops. That should continue to be \na focus that we hunt for, and we should be vigilant in looking for \nweapons of mass destruction, particularly chemicals such as sarin gas. \nBut more importantly, Iraq had told the U.N. weapons inspection team \nthey had produced tons of sarin gas and other chemical weapons. We \nshould be concerned about where those are today and whether some of \nthem may have found their way into Syria or other countries.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a news story \nthat appeared today from Fox News.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Fox News, May 19, 2004]\n\n              Tests Confirm Sarin in Iraqi Artillery Shell\n\n                           (By Liza Porteus)\n\n       New York.--Tests on an artillery shell that blew up in Iraq \n     on Saturday confirm that it did contain an estimated three or \n     four liters of the deadly nerve agent sarin (search), Defense \n     Department officials told Fox News Tuesday.\n       The artillery shell was being used as an improvised \n     roadside bomb, the U.S. military said Monday. The 155-mm \n     shell exploded before it could be rendered inoperable, and \n     two U.S. soldiers were treated for minor exposure to the \n     nerve agent.\n       Three liters is about three-quarters of a gallon; four \n     liters is a little more than a gallon.\n       ``A little drop on your skin will kill you'' in the binary \n     form, said Ret. Air Force Col. Randall Larsen, founder of \n     Homeland Security Associates. ``So for those in immediate \n     proximity, three liters is a lot,'' but he added that from a \n     military standpoint, a barrage of shells with that much sarin \n     in them would more likely be used as a weapon than one single \n     shell.\n       The soldiers displayed ``classic'' symptoms of sarin \n     exposure, most notably dilated pupils and nausea, officials \n     said. The symptoms ran their course fairly quickly, however, \n     and as of Tuesday the two had returned to duty.\n       The munition found was a binary chemical shell, meaning it \n     featured two chambers, each containing separate chemical \n     compounds. Upon impact with the ground after the shell is \n     fired, the barrier between the chambers is broken, the \n     chemicals mix and sarin is created and dispersed.\n       Intelligence officials stressed that the compounds did not \n     mix effectively on Saturday. Due to the detonation, burn-off \n     and resulting spillage, it was not clear exactly how much \n     harmful material was inside the shell.\n       A 155-mm shell can hold two to five liters of sarin; three \n     to four liters is likely the right number, intelligence \n     officials said.\n       Another shell filled with mustard gas (search), possibly \n     also part of an improvised explosive device (IED) was \n     discovered on May 2, Defense Dept. officials said.\n       The second shell was found by passing soldiers in a median \n     on a thoroughfare west of Baghdad. It probably was simply \n     left there by someone, officials said, and it was unclear \n     whether it was meant to be used as a bomb.\n       Testing done by the Iraqi Survey Group (search)--a U.S.-\n     organized group of weapons inspectors who have been searching \n     for weapons of mass destruction (search) since the ouster of \n     Saddam Hussein--concluded that the mustard gas was ``stored \n     improperly'' and was thus ``ineffective.''\n       ``It's not out of the ordinary or unusual that you would \n     find something [like these weapons] in a haphazard fashion'' \n     in Iraq, Edward Turzanski, a political and national security \n     analyst, told Fox News on Tuesday.\n       But ``you have to be very careful not to be entirely \n     dismissive of it,'' he added. ``It remains to be seen whether \n     they have more shells like this.''\n\n\n                     Iraq: A ``Bazaar of Weapons''\n\n       New weapons caches are being found every day, experts said, \n     including ``hundreds of thousands'' of rocket-propelled \n     grenades and portable anti-aircraft weapons.\n       ``Clearly, if we're gonna find one or two of these every so \n     often--used as an IED or some other way--the threat is not \n     all that high, but it does confirm suspicion that he [Saddam] \n     did have this stuff,'' said Ret. U.S. Army Col. Robert \n     Maginnis.\n       ``It is a bazaar of weapons that are available on every \n     marketplace throughout that country,'' Maginnis added. \n     ``We're doing everything we can to aggressively disarm these \n     people, but there were so many things that were stored away \n     by Saddam Hussein in that country . . . it's a huge job that \n     we're tackling.''\n       Some experts were concerned that enemy fighters with access \n     to potential weapons of mass destruction in a country full of \n     stockpiles could mean more risk to coalition forces and \n     Iraqis.\n       ``What we don't know is if there are other shells, which \n     there certainly could be,'' said Dennis Ross, a former \n     ambassador and special Middle East coordinator and a Fox News \n     foreign affairs analyst. ``We also don't know whether or not \n     these kind of shells could be used as explosives, which could \n     have a more devastating effect on our troops.''\n       Other experts said the individual shells themselves don't \n     pose a threat to the masses.\n       ``I'm not as concerned they're going to use a lot of \n     chemical munitions,'' Maginnis said. ``They're not gonna use \n     these as improvised explosive devices because they don't have \n     a big blast associated with them, but they do combine those \n     two compounds into the noxious sarin gas. But they can't do \n     it all that well with a small explosive charge.''\n       ``The reality is, they'd have to have a whole bunch of \n     these things,'' he added, ``have to find some way of blowing \n     them with a large charge to even create a cloud.''\n       That doesn't mean insurgents couldn't find a better way to \n     make the devices to create a more ``terrorist-type of \n     attack'' against U.S. forces, Maginnis continued.\n       The task of military analysts in Baghdad will be determine \n     how old the sarin shells is. A final determination will have \n     a significant effect on how weapons researchers and \n     inspectors proceed.\n       Some experts suggested that the two shells, which were \n     unmarked, date back to the first Persian Gulf War. The \n     mustard gas shell may have been one of 550 projectiles that \n     Saddam failed to account for in his weapons declaration \n     shortly before Operation Iraqi Freedom began. Iraq also \n     failed to account for 450 aerial bombs containing mustard \n     gas.\n       It's not clear if enemy fighters simply found an old \n     stockpile of weapons, or if they even knew what was inside.\n       Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld reacted cautiously to the \n     news of the discoveries.\n\n[[Page S5764]]\n\n       ``What we have to then do is to try to track down and \n     figure out how it might be there, what caused that to be \n     there in this improvised explosive device, and what might it \n     mean in terms of the risks to our forces,'' Rumsfeld said \n     Monday.\n\n\n                     Kurds: We Have Evidence of WMD\n\n       An Iraqi Kurdish official had no doubt similar substances \n     will be found as the weapons hunt continues.\n       ``We don't know where they are, but we suspect they are \n     hidden in many locations in Iraq,'' Howar Ziad, the Kurdish \n     representatives to the United Nations, told Fox News on \n     Tuesday. ``It's quite possible that even the neighboring \n     states who are against the reform of Iraq . . . are helping \n     the Saddamites in hiding.''\n       ``As we know, the Baathist regime had a track record of \n     using'' these chemicals against people in Iraq, such as the \n     Kurds, Ziad continued. ``He's [Saddam] never kept any \n     commitment he's ever made to the international committee nor \n     to the people'' to not use such deadly materials.\n       Saddam's regime used sarin in mass amounts during an air \n     attack on the Kurdish town of Halabja (search) in 1988, \n     toward the end of the Iran-Iraq War. More than 5,000 people \n     are believed to have died in Halabja and surrounding \n     villages, where more than 65,000 were injured.\n       Both Iraq and Iran used chemical weapons during the 1980-88 \n     war.\n       Ziad said the United Nations, the World Health Organization \n     and others had not ``bothered'' to travel to the Iraqi \n     Kurdistan to see the firsthand effects sarin and other \n     chemical weapons had on people and to get proof that Saddam \n     did in fact possess such weapons.\n       ``We have evidence--we have victims of the use of those \n     agents, and we're still waiting for WHO and the U.N. to come \n     investigate,'' Ziad said.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I will read portions of this news story, dated today, \nFox News:\n\n       Tests on an artillery shell that blew up in Iraq on \n     Saturday confirmed that it did contain an estimated three or \n     four liters of the deadly nerve agent sarin.\n\n  This has been confirmed by Defense Department officials. This is \nobviously a danger to our troops. It is obviously of great concern to \nus if this were to find its way into the United States.\n  I will read from retired United States Army COL Robert Maginnis:\n\n       Clearly, if we're gonna find one or two of these every so \n     often--used as an IED or some other way--the threat is not \n     all that high, but it does confirm suspicion that he [Saddam] \n     did have this stuff.\n\n  He goes on to say this:\n\n       It is a bazaar of weapons that are available on every \n     market place through that country. We're doing everything we \n     can to aggressively disarm these people but there are so many \n     things that were stored away by Saddam Hussein in that \n     country . . . it's a huge job that we're tackling.\n\n  This next quote is from Dennis Ross, the former Ambassador, special \nenvoy to the Middle East, a well-known figure on Middle East peace \nnegotiations that took place:\n\n       What we don't know is if there are other shells which there \n     certainly could be.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       We also don't know whether or not these kinds of shells \n     could be used as explosives, which could have a more \n     devastating effect on our troops.\n\n  A final quote for the Record from this story:\n\n       Saddam's regime used sarin gas in mass amounts during an \n     air attack on the Kurdish town of Halabja in 1988, toward the \n     end of the Iran-Iraq War. More than 5,000 people are believed \n     to have died in Halabja and surrounding villages, with more \n     than 65,000 injured.\n\n  This is deadly stuff. It exists. We are now finding it. We need to be \naware of that as we move forward with this bioshield bill.\n  Earlier this week the Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. \ninspectors found within the last few months ``warehouses full of \ncommercial and agricultural chemicals'' which, if mixed and packaged \nproperly, ``could quickly become chemical weapons.'' U.S. forces in \nKarbala have uncovered 55-gallon drums loaded with chemicals that were \nsaid to be ``pesticides,'' some of which were stored in what military \nsources described as a camouflaged bunker complex. Why would anyone \ncamouflage insecticide?\n  According to another article, the alleged agricultural site just \nhappened to be located alongside a military ammunition dump. Why are we \nstoring insecticide by a military ammunition dump?\n  According to the Journal, the Iraq Survey Group, headed by Charles \nDuelfer, recently told Congress that some of Saddam's WMD facilities \nwere newly built and contained stockpiled raw materials that would have \nallowed them to ``produce such weapons on a moment's notice.''\n  If I recall, in early April, Jordanian authorities foiled an al-Qaida \nplot to kill 80,000 people in a chemical weapons attack in Amman.\n  According to one of the conspirators whose confession was broadcast \non Jordanian TV, al-Qaida WMD specialist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who was \nlast seen in that chilling video beheading Nick Berg, trained and \noutfitted the WMD attackers in prewar Iraq. Like notorious terrorists \nAbu Nidal and Abu Abi Abbas, Zarqawi enjoyed sanctuary in Baghdad, \ncourtesy of Saddam Hussein. Jordanian coverage of the plot included \nfootage of 100-gallon jugs containing chemical weapons that had been \nintercepted 75 miles from the Syrian border where much of Saddam \nHussein's prewar WMD stockpiles are believed to be hidden.\n\n  The Zarqawi revelation comes on the heels of the April 26 explosion \nat a suspected chemical weapons factory in Baghdad just as a U.S. \nweapons team arrived to inspect its contents. This was disguised as ``a \nperfume factory,'' and the facility was boobytrapped to destroy \nevidence, investigators believe, of whatever was inside.\n  We should not be surprised if, within the coming weeks, more sarin-\nladen shells are uncovered in Iraq. In the meantime, we should focus on \nthis and get coverage on what is taking place and what has been found \nof this deadly sarin gas.\n  I note that Secretary Ridge, Homeland Security Department, has been \nwarning of an increased risk of attack in coming months. In light of \nwhat we found in Iraq, it would not be farfetched to say if al-Qaida \nwants to strike on U.S. soil, it would likely be with a chemical or \nbiological weapon, something other than a conventional explosive.\n  In a recent interview with the Associated Press, retired LTG Patrick \nHughes said that America has gotten better at predicting and \nsafeguarding itself against attacks since September 11, but still \nLieutenant General Hughes indicated that significant threats remain, \nespecially now as high ``background noise'' from terrorists and \nheightened sensitivity during the election year has officials on guard \nfor a possible attack whose nature they cannot quite pin down.\n  Based on captured material, interviews, and other sources of \ninformation, Lieutenant General Hughes believes that al-Qaida will \nlikely strike with something other than a conventional explosive \ndevice. He is particularly worried about chemical and biological \nattacks, including a dirty bomb, and particularly points to the \npossibility of another anthrax biological attack following the one that \nwreaked havoc on the postal system, closed a Senate office building for \n3 months, and killed five people in 2001.\n  We first heard about sarin gas in an attack at a Japanese subway \nwhere twelve people died. It is a potent weapon in which a little drop \non your skin will kill you. Sarin gas was confirmed in the 155-mm shell \nand contained an estimated 3 or 4 liters. Fortunately, the two soldiers \nwho may have been exposed are now safe and are returned to duty. They \ndid show signs of being hit by chemical weapons, but it was a mild case \nand they are back on duty. This could have ended in tragedy had our \nsoldiers not been more vigilant.\n  I hope we will continue to be focused on finding these weapons of \nmass destruction, particularly before they find their way to our shores \nso we can make sure our troops are safe and that such weapons do not \nfind their way here to the United States. I believe my colleagues' bill \nwill go a long way toward securing that goal. I urge its immediate \npassage.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Project Bioshield \nAct. It is an essential part of our Nation's ability to respond \neffectively to the threat of terrorist attacks that use biological or \nchemical weapons.\n\n[[Page S5765]]\n\n  I commend Senators Gregg, Frist, Reed, and other members of our HELP \nCommittee for their efficient and effective bipartisan work on this \nbill, and I thank Senator Levin for his expertise and thoughtful \nconsiderations.\n  I also commend our colleagues on the Appropriations Committee, and \nespecially the chairman, Senator Stevens, and the ranking member, \nSenator Byrd, for already providing the funding that Project Bioshield \nneeds to be effective. Their leadership is essential in protecting the \nNation.\n  We have worked closely, too, with Secretary Tommy Thompson and CMS \nAdministrator Mark McClellan on this important legislation. They \ndeserve great credit for their leadership as well.\n  The Project Bioshield Act is an important addition to the Public \nHealth Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act that we \npassed 2 years ago. Since that major legislation was enacted, we have \nseen new examples of the vicious impact of terrorism around the world. \nThe brutal pictures from the appalling bomb attack in Madrid and the \nhorrifying images of other terror attacks around the world are savage \nreminders that we must never let down our guard.\n  The will to protect the Nation from terrorism is not enough. We must \nalso provide the resources and the means. Bioshield is a major step \ntoward giving the Nation's health care professionals the support they \nneed to respond to attacks of biological, chemical, and nuclear \nweapons.\n  A terrorist armed with a vial of a deadly pathogen could inflict pain \nand death on a vast scale. For too many of the weapons we face, our \ndefenses are inadequate. The Nation needs better vaccines and drugs to \nfight ancient enemies such as smallpox or new plagues launched by \ngenetically modified disease bacteria.\n  The members of our HELP Committee have worked together to help \nAmerica's skilled physicians and scientists develop the vaccines, the \ndiagnostic tests, and treatments needed to meet these disease \nchallenges. Clearly, new legislation is needed to improve America's \ndefensive arsenal against these threats.\n  The current bill will help guide the talents of America's medical \nresearchers and biotechnology industry in building the stronger medical \ndefenses we need to keep families safe from bioterrorism.\n  I am proud that Boston is, once again, leading the way in developing \npioneering new biodefense countermeasures. We have taken steps to \nexpedite the discovery of new vaccines and cures needed to protect the \nNation.\n  This chart is a statement about this overall legislation:\n\n       Bioshield will accelerate the development of new vaccines, \n     treatments and diagnostics to keep America safe from \n     biological, chemical and radiological weapons.\n\n  The fact remains that there is little commercial interest in the \ndevelopment of countermeasures, because they will only be used in the \nevent of some kind of assault or attack on the United States. \nNonetheless, we need to develop these vaccines and the various \ntreatments for treating these kinds of dangers because we may very well \nface them. If we are going to be serious about dealing with biodefense \nand bioterrorism, this is a very important part of the whole process.\n  Harvard Medical School has worked with other academic centers to \ncreate a New England Regional Center for Excellence for Biodefense. The \nnew center will be the incubator for innovative ideas for treatments of \nthe future. The Boston University Medical Center is building a major \nnew laboratory to enable these pioneering new treatments be tested in a \nsafe and secure research facility.\n  At the new laboratory, researchers from across America will be able \nto help turn promising new ideas into treatments to help patients. NIH \nhas recognized the excellence of the center and the laboratory by \nmaking substantial investments in their development. The Project \nBioshield will help complete this pipeline of discovery by harnessing \nthe creativity and the skill of the flourishing biotechnology industry.\n  The legislation will ensure companies know that investing in new \nresponses for bioterrorist attacks is a risk worth taking. The bill \nbefore the Senate guarantees that any company which develops a \nsuccessful new product for these threats will find a willing buyer in \nthe Federal Government. With that guarantee, companies will make the \ninvestments needed to prepare for any attack. Without that guarantee, \nthey will not. It is as simple as that.\n  The act will accomplish several other important goals. It will \nstreamline and accelerate the research at NIH on bioterrorism and other \nweapons of mass destruction. The most effective weapons in the war \nagainst biological and chemical attacks are often the skills of our \nhealth professionals and the ingenuity of our scientists. The new \nflexibility for NIH under this legislation will help use these \nextraordinary talents in the search for new responses.\n  The act will also encourage the biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and \nmedical device industries to use their creativity to develop \ncountermeasures against the dangerous pathogens and chemical or \nradioactive agents. In addition, it authorizes the Food and Drug \nAdministration to allow the emergency use of unapproved medicines when \nneeded to deal with such attacks.\n  The authorization for the emergency use of unapproved products also \nincludes strong provisions on informed consent for patients and limits \nthe scope of products that can qualify for emergency authorization. The \nFDA must carefully monitor adverse reactions to unapproved products and \nmust require the recordkeeping and studies necessary to assure the \nsafest possible use of these products.\n  The enactment of the Project BioShield Act is a significant \naccomplishment, but there is much more work to be done.\n  This is a brief outline of what this legislation is all about. It \nestablishes the $5.6 billion fund as a guaranteed market for the new \nbiodefense products, and it ensures that the Departments of Homeland \nSecurity and HHS set priorities in developing medicines for the threats \nthat America faces. So you combine intelligence about the nature of the \nthreat with expertise from HHS to set the priorities in developing \nmedicines.\n  It gives NIH, the gold standard in terms of research throughout the \nworld, much needed flexibility to ensure promising research areas can \nadvance quickly. Finally, it allows the FDA to authorize the emergency \nuse of medicines under the tightly controlled conditions outlined in \nthis legislation.\n  The most sophisticated disease monitoring system will be of little \nuse if public health agencies are so starved of funds that they cannot \nkeep our communities safe.\n  I want to take a few moments of the Senate's time to look at the \nprogress for bioterror preparedness.\n  This is taken from a GAO study from February 10 of this year. It \nsays:\n\n       No State reported meeting what they call the third \n     benchmark, a plan for the hospitals in the State to respond \n     to an epidemic involving at least 500 patients.\n\n  This is extraordinary. On the one hand, dealing with bioterrorism we \nhave to be able to detect and contain it, and then we have to be able \nto treat people. That is where BioShield can be enormously effective. \nBut if we are going to be able to contain and treat a bioterror attack, \nwe must be able to deal with it in our medical centers. What we are \nfinding out now, as we review our preparedness, is that we are not \nmaking the progress that is absolutely essential to protect \ncommunities.\n  Report after report shows that we are falling short in preparing our \ndefenses against the threat of bioterrorism. The GAO conducted a \ndetailed analysis of the readiness of hospitals for such attacks. How \nmany communities do you think have plans--just plans to be able to \ntreat a surge of 500 additional patients in a terrorism emergency? \nWould you say 75 percent? 50 percent? Only 25 percent? No, you would be \nwrong. The correct answer is none. Zero! Not a single community in the \nGAO survey had a plan to treat an additional 500 patients. That is \nbasic--and none of the communities in the GAO survey could do it. That \nis a situation that has to be remedied.\n  An expert panel assembled by the Trust for America's Health conducted \nan analysis of the readiness for bioterrorism of public health agencies \nin all 50 States. They examined 10 key indicators of readiness, such as \nadequate laboratory capacity to respond to bioterrorism emergencies. \nHow many\n\n[[Page S5766]]\n\nStates do you think were fully prepared? The answer, again, shockingly, \nis none.\n  This chart shows the different grades of States in bioterror \npreparedness. The highest we find is 7 out of 10. That would be the \ngreen. That includes California, Florida, Tennessee, and Maryland. But \nif you look at most of this chart you will see it is red or pink, which \nmeans they have only 2 or 3 of the 10 required actions necessary to be \nsuccessful in dealing with bioterrorism. You need to have laboratories, \nhospital capacity and, as mentioned before in Bioshield, the basic \nmedicines to treat the victims.\n  The Institute of Medicine in 2003 found that America's health \nagencies have ``vulnerable and outdated health information systems and \ntechnologies, an insufficient and inadequately trained public health \nworkforce, antiquated laboratory capacity, a lack of realtime \nsurveillance in epidemiological systems, an ineffective and fragmented \ncommunications network, incomplete domestic preparedness and emergency \nresponse capabilities, and communities without access to essential \npublic health services.''\n  That is really the challenge. If we talk about homeland security, \nthis is a key aspect in ensuring homeland security. It is a challenge \nwe have to address. That puts the Project BioShield Act in an ominous \nperspective. It is a large step in the right direction, but without a \ncommitment to adequately fund our hospitals and our health agencies, \ngenuine preparedness and effective homeland security will still be far \nfrom what is needed.\n  I urge my colleagues in approving this important bipartisan \nlegislation to also do what it takes to see that our hospitals and \nhealth agencies have the resources they need to use the new tools that \nBioShield gives them. We don't know how much time we have, but we do \nknow we have to get the job done and do it as quickly as we can.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a moment to thank a number of our \ncolleagues' staffs who have worked tirelessly in this endeavor over the \nperiod of these last 2 years. This has been an enormous effort on the \npart of many of them. They have done an extraordinary job working this \nthrough.\n  The passage of the BioShield legislation owes much to the hard work \nand skill of dedicated staff members on both sides of the aisle in the \nSenate and the House of Representatives, and in the administration too.\n  I would like to take a moment to thank the effective and skillful \nwork of Senator Gregg's staff, particularly Vince Ventimiglia and Steve \nIrizarry. Their expertise was helpful in so many ways. I also want to \nthank Craig Burton of Senator Frist's staff for his effective work on \nthe legislation.\n  Our Republican colleagues on the House Commerce and Homeland Security \ncommittees were ably assisted by Tom DiLenge and Nandan Kenkeremath. \nJohn Ford worked tirelessly on behalf of the many Democratic Members \nwith an interest in this legislation.\n  I also commend many senior staff in the Department of Health and \nHuman Services for their work in seeing this important legislation \nenacted. We owe particular thanks to Stewart Simonsen, the Assistant \nSecretary for Public Health Preparedness, as well as Raissa Downs, Ken \nBernard and Scott Whitaker from the Office of the Secretary, and Amit \nSachdev of the FDA.\n  Staff members from many Democratic Senators made numerous helpful \ncontributions to the success of this legislation. I would like to thank \nPeter Levine and Gary Leeling from Senator Levin's staff, as well as \nLisa German from Senator Reed's staff. I would also like to thank my \nhealth staff, particularly David Nexon, David Bowen, David Dorsey and \nPaul Kim for their excellent work on this legislation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask that my substitute amendment be \naccepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3178) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the committee \nsubstitute amendment, as amended, is agreed to.\n  The committee amendment, in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n\n\n                           bioshield funding\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the hard work and cooperation \nof many of my colleagues to build a program to protect Americans from \nbioterrorism. I am grateful to Senator Cochran for his work last year \nto ensure that adequate funds were provided in advance to incentivize \nthe immediate development of countermeasures. I also commend Senator \nNickles for his efforts to safeguard these funds and ensure that they \nremain available solely for the intended purpose of protecting our \ncitizens from biological attack.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I was pleased to work with the administration and my \ncolleagues on the Appropriations Committee to secure funding for the \nprogram. It is my intention that any unobligated balances of funds \nappropriated for project BioShield remain available until expended, as \nthe law requires, to ensure that the program has adequate resources in \nfiscal year 2005 to continue developing necessary countermeasures.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate the leadership of my colleague from \nMississippi in this effort, and agree that the funds should remain \ndedicated to the rapid development of effective countermeasures against \nemerging threats.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I commend Senators Gregg and Kennedy for \ntheir hard work in bringing this important legislation to the floor. I \nshare in their commitment to protect Americans from bio-terrorism. Last \nyear, I worked with Senator Cochran, the chairman of the Homeland \nSecurity Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee, to \ndevelop an extraordinary funding mechanism for the funding of Project \nBioshield. The Congress approved $5.6 billion of advanced \nappropriations to create incentives for the development of vaccines, \npharmaceuticals and other countermeasures for responding to a potential \nterrorist attack. This funding demonstrated a strong commitment to \nimplementing this important program.\n  During debate on the budget resolution, the Senate approved an \namendment offered by Senator Cochran and myself that struck from the \nresolution a provision that would have established different rules in \nthe House and Senate for the treatment of Project Bioshield funding. I \nbelieve such a provision would have created confusion and potentially \nundermined future funding for homeland security programs.\n  Is it the understanding of the Senator from New Hampshire that no \nsuch provision will be included in the final version of this \nlegislation that will be presented to the President?\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his cooperation \nand appreciate his efforts to help secure funding for this important \nprogram. While I am unable to guarantee an outcome in conference, I \nhave no intention of including this provision and I will work to ensure \nthat no such provision will be included in the bill presented to the \nPresident.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is it also his understanding that no such provision, which \nis in neither the House nor Senate-passed budget resolutions, will be \nincluded in a conference report on the budget resolution?\n  Mr. GREGG. I have discussed this with the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee and the Senator's understanding is correct that no such \nprovision will be included.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the chairman for his assurances and cooperation in \nthis matter and I commend both he and Senator Kennedy for their \ncooperation in bringing to the Senate this important legislation.\n\n\n                          purchase of vaccines\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to clarify the understanding \nof the managers of this bill with regard to the restriction in section \n319F-2(c)(9), as amended by the Gregg-Kennedy amendment, on the use of \nBioshield funds from paying the costs for purchase of vaccines under \nprocurement contracts\n\n[[Page S5767]]\n\nentered into before the date of enactment. Is it the understanding of \nthe bill's managers that this restriction would not apply to the \npurchase of additional doses of vaccines otherwise qualifying as \nsecurity countermeasures if they are acquired under either new \ncontracts or modifications to existing contracts to increase the \nnumbers of doses to be procured for the Strategic National Stockpile?\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator for his question. That is my \nunderstanding.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I agree with the Senator from Michigan and the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire that that is my understanding of the provision. \nHowever, it is also my understanding that the primary intent of the \nBioshield program is to accelerate the development of new products \nrather than providing an additional funding source to pay for products \ndeveloped prior to the enactment of the legislation.\n\n\n                          special reserve fund\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend the leadership of our \ndistinguished chairman in bringing the Bioshield legislation to the \nSenate floor. I am optimistic that our colleagues will approve this \nurgently needed legislation. I would like to clarify with the chairman \nthe intent behind one of the key provisions in the legislation.\n  Would the chairman agree that as we have considered this legislation \nduring our bipartisan and bicameral negotiations, it has been clear \nthat the congressional intent is for the Bioshield special reserve fund \nto be one option for the Secretary with respect to procuring \ncountermeasures against chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear \nagents. A second option is ordinary appropriations for the stockpile \noutside of the special reserve fund. It is clear though that we expect \nthat the Secretary will endeavor not to use the Bioshield special \nreserve fund as a substitute for the commercial market in procuring \nsuch countermeasures.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for his comments. \nI agree that his statements reflect the intent of Congress regarding \nthe use of the Bioshield special reserve fund.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my \nsupport for the Project Bioshield legislation. This bill will make an \nimportant contribution to our Nation's preparedness by authorizing the \nexpenditure of $5.6 billion from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2013 \nfor the procurement of biomedical countermeasures for inclusion in a \nStrategic National Stockpile. Project Bioshield will bolster the \nNation's ability to provide protections and countermeasures against \nbiological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear agents that may be used \nin a terrorist attack. It includes provisions to facilitate research \nand development of biomedical countermeasures by the National \nInstitutes of Health; to provide for procurement of needed \ncountermeasures through a special reserve fund and to authorize, under \nlimited circumstances, the emergency use of medical products that have \nnot been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n  I am pleased that the final version of the bill requires that any \nbioshield contract be awarded pursuant to full and open competition \nunless the Secretary determines that the mission of the bioshield \nprogram would be seriously impaired by this requirement. This provision \nensures that the bioshield program, like other Federal programs, will \nbe subject to governmentwide competition requirements.\n  I am also pleased that the final version of the bill will not make it \nmore likely that military personnel will be required to take unapproved \nproducts without their consent. This subject has been addressed in an \nappropriate manner in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 2005, which is being debated on the Senate floor right now.\n  This legislation will help to better prepare our Nation and bolster \nour critical infrastructure to help us deal effectively with terrorist \nattacks. The mailing of anthrax and ricin tainted letters to Capitol \nHill and other locations in 2001 and 2004, respectively, have \nhighlighted our Nation's weaknesses in this area of biodefense. Now \nProject Bioshield will help give us the tools we need to develop \nappropriate countermeasures and combat bioterrorism more effectively.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the \nbill, as amended, pass?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I pose an inquiry. I am prepared to discuss \nthis amendment and move forward with it. I was advised that possibly \nthe Senator from West Virginia wishes to use this time to make some \nremarks. I say to the Senator, if he wishes to do that, I would be \nhappy to defer.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is correct. I thank the Senator from \nArizona.

The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3151, As Modified\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I send a modification to my original \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 184, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n\n          Subtitle F--Provisions Relating To Certain Sanctions\n\n     SEC. 856. CLARIFICATION OF CERTAIN SANCTIONS.\n\n       (a) Clarification of Certain Actions Under IEEPA.--In any \n     case in which the President takes action under the \n     International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 \n     et seq.) to prohibit a United States person from engaging in \n     transactions with a foreign country, where a determination \n     has been made by the Secretary of State that the government \n     of that country has repeatedly provided support for acts of \n     international terrorism, such action shall apply to any \n     foreign subsidiaries or affiliate, including any permanent \n     foreign establishment of that United States person, that is \n     controlled in fact by that United States person.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Controlled in fact.--The term ``controlled in fact'' \n     means--\n       (A) in the case of a corporation, holds at least 50 percent \n     (by vote or value) of the capital structure of the \n     corporation; and\n       (B) in the case of any other kind of legal entity, holds \n     interests representing at least 50 percent of the capital \n     structure of the entity.\n       (2) United states person.--The term ``United States \n     person'' means any United States citizen, permanent resident \n     alien, entity organized under the law of the United States \n     (including foreign branches) or any person in the United \n     States.\n       (c) Applicability.--\n       (1) In general.--In any case in which the President has \n     taken action under the International Emergency Economic \n     Powers Act and such action is in effect on the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the provisions of subsection (a) shall \n     not apply to a United States person (or other person) if such \n     person divests or terminates its business with the government \n     or person identified by such action within 90 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Actions after date of enactment.--In any case in which \n     the President takes action under the International Emergency \n     Economic Powers Act on or after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the provisions of subsection (a) shall not apply to a \n     United States person (or other person) if such person divests \n     or terminates its business with the government or person \n     identified by such action within 90 days after the date of \n     such action.\n\n      SEC. 857 NOTIFICATION OF CONGRESS OF TERMINATION OF \n                   INVESTIGATION BY OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS \n                   CONTROL.\n\n       (a) Notification Requirement.--The Office of Federal \n     Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403 et seq.) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new section:\n\n``Sec. 42.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of Senator Byrd's remarks, I be recognized to get back on my \namendment. Also, I inquire of the Senator approximately how long he \nwishes to take.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in response to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona, I expect to take 15 to 18 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                Commending the Armed Services Committee\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank all Senators for their courtesies. I \nespecially want to take this moment to thank the chairman of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee and the ranking member for the splendid \nhearings they have been conducting.\n  I have never sat on a committee through such a series of hearings \nthat have been so well ordered and so well chaired by both Members, the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia and the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan, as I have experienced in these few days as this committee has \nbeen conducting its hearings into the serious matters that have \nconfronted us in the Middle East. I just want to take this occasion to \nsay I could never ask for a chairman to be more fair, more just, more \nreasonable than the Senator from Virginia.\n  I marvel at his equanimity, at his good nature. He is always, always \na man of good will. I count it a great privilege to serve on his \ncommittee.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished colleague. \nSenator Levin and I have had 26 years on that committee, and we work \nside by side for the highest degree of bipartisanship achievable.\n  I want to say to all members of the committee--and the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia knows this--this is the third hearing, and \nit has been 100-percent attendance, except for one individual who is \nout of town, in each of the hearings, showing the intensity of the \nsubject, the solemnity of the proceeding. I believe all members of our \ncommittee, both sides, comported themselves in the finest traditions of \nthe Senate, given the seriousness of this problem. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield for a thank-you from me for his \nnice comments.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As always, the Senator from Virginia shares the kudos \nwhich properly belong to him. I am grateful to the Senator from West \nVirginia for bringing to the attention of this body the extraordinary \nchairman we have on the Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. I have \nsaid along this line that it was a great pleasure serving on this \ncommittee with Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia. I thought he was a great \nchairman. He was. When he left the committee, I felt it would certainly \nbe a long time before his shoes and his chair would be as well filled \nas one could hope.\n  I find that the distinguished Senator from Michigan has done a \nsplendid job. He handles himself preeminently well on television, and \nhe approaches each problem on the committee in a very studious fashion. \nWhen he reads a bill, one can say that bill has been read. When he \nwrites a bill, one can say it has been written well--every period, \ncomma, semicolon, colon, en dash, em dash, whatever it is. He would \nhave gone over it thoroughly. I thank him. He has certainly stepped \ninto the shoes of Sam Nunn very ably. I have every confidence in him.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we wish to restore the time the Senator \nasked for, but I want to say I share that about Senator Levin. Senator \nLevin and I and Senator Nunn were taught by some of the greatest \nteachers in the Senate, foremost the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. \nByrd, John Stennis, John Tower, Barry Goldwater, and Scoop Jackson.\n  As I look back on my quarter of a century in the Senate, those were \nthe teachers who set the course and speed of that committee, and the \nSenator from Michigan and I do our best to do that with the help of the \nSenator from West Virginia. We thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. Among those giants who walked these \nhalls, may I add one name: the name of the illustrious Richard Brevard \nRussell of Winder, GA, who was chairman of that committee when I first \ncame to the Senate.\n\n[[Page S5769]]\n\n               Securing Our Energy Future: A New Strategy\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on another matter, a perfect storm has been \nbrewing. Americans have already felt the leading edge of the \napproaching squalls. Today, we are more dependent upon imported oil \nthan ever before. More than 54 percent of the oil that Americans \nconsume comes from foreign countries, especially OPEC-producing \nnations. Instead of striving to disentangle ourselves from this foreign \noil dependency, the Bush administration seems intent on sinking our \nmilitary and energy fortunes deeper and deeper into the sands of the \nMiddle East.\n  Last week, gas prices in many regions of West Virginia were above $2 \nper gallon. Within days, these prices could easily exceed the $2 per \ngallon average nationwide. The price of natural gas is at a historic \nhigh, and consumers and manufacturers in West Virginia and across the \ncountry are struggling to pay their bills. Though some advocate \nreducing this pressure by importing liquified natural gas in the \nfuture, we must also recognize that this will create a new and growing \nresource dependency. It is hard to believe that the energy and foreign \npolicy decisions made in places elsewhere in the world are having such \na dramatic impact on the lives and pocketbooks of our citizens, but \nthat is today's reality.\n  Another aspect of that gathering storm is the poor state of our \nelectricity grid, the lifeline of our economy. However, decade-long \nefforts to deregulate electricity markets have, in some cases, led to \nmarket manipulation and fracturing rather than producing a more \nintegrated, reliable system. Given the blackout last summer, few \nobservers would doubt that our electric transmission system needs to be \nmade more robust. Furthermore, economic and environmental regulations \ngoverning energy production and use are often in conflict with our \ndisjointed energy policies. Continued uncertainties make investment \ndecisions difficult and clearly demonstrate that these ongoing debates \nmust be resolved. Due to the lack of political will, special interest \nentrenchment, and other constraints, policymakers have been unable to \nuntangle this Gordian knot.\n  These concerns are central to the long-term interests of our Nation, \nand they represent very ominous clouds on the horizon. Sadly, our \nenergy problems are being addressed with Band-Aid solutions. In recent \nyears, we have witnessed attempts to put a moratorium on Federal gas \ntaxes, to tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and to make secretive \ndeals with Saudi Arabia to produce more oil. We have unnecessarily \nendeavored to treat the symptoms and not the core problem for far too \nlong. Instead, our Nation needs to begin defining alternative pathways \nand new approaches that go beyond the extremist debates and simplistic \nsolutions that define our very demanding energy and environmental \nchallenges.\n  Three years ago this week, the Bush administration released the \nNational Energy Policy report. Unfortunately, Americans have yet to \nreceive the benefits that this energy plan promised to provide. Given \nthe plan's 3 year anniversary, I am announcing that I, along with other \nSenators, have asked the General Accounting Office to undertake a broad \nand comprehensive review of the Federal Government's energy funding, \npolicies, and overall goals to determine whether the U.S. does, in \nfact, have strategic plan in place.\n  The U.S. is without a serious energy policy, and no energy bill \ncurrently before this Congress can adequately rectify that problem. The \nU.S. faces the simultaneous challenges of an expanding energy appetite, \na need to reduce its dependence on imported resources, and a decreasing \ntolerance for environmental impacts. Sadly, policymakers have time and \ntime again failed to craft a comprehensive approach--a failure which \ncontinues to jeopardize our Nation's security, economic health, and \nenvironment. Too much is at stake to continue to ignore these looming \nproblems.\n  America's energy policies have been driven primarily by a reaction to \nsupply shortages and crises. The energy policy approaches of numerous \nadministrations are littered with false starts and abrupt shifts--\nlurching first in one direction then in another. When it comes to \nsecuring America's energy future, the Bush White House is stuck in \nshort-sighted, high-risk initiatives which seem largely guided by big \ndollar campaign contributors. Despite its rhetoric, this White House's \nlipservice and corporate coddling have been the sum total of its energy \npolicy. It began with the Vice President's national energy policy task \nforce and concluded with the exclusion of Democrats from the energy \nconference. As a result, the Bush administration appears to see energy \npolicy as a way to reward its friends while sidestepping the serious, \nlingering challenges that face this country and, in fact, the world.\n  In spite of our Nation's herky-jerky responses to energy policy, \nthere have been some successful energy policy initiatives. Surely, the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve, the Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act, \nand the clean coal technology program have proved invaluable. However, \nfor the most part, there has been little foresight, no coherent \nframework, and no clear objectives on which to base future decisions. \nThe Nation needs a long-term energy plan that includes criteria and \nbenchmarks by which to measure progress. In short, it requires a more \nintegrated, cohesive roadmap.\n  Now is the time for the cornerstones of our Nation's energy strategy \nto be solidly established. Opportunities exist for entrenched parties \nto come together on a more comprehensive and cohesive approach. This \napproach must integrate four fundamental principles: Diversity of \nenergy sources to protect our Nation's security; fiscal soundness to \nensure stakeholder support and increase economic growth; consumer \nprotections to guard against fraud and manipulation; and safeguards to \nminimize energy's environmental footprint.\n  A serious energy efficiency program, bolstered by the promotion of \nrenewable energy and other clean home-grown energy sources, provides a \ncompass point for a U.S. energy strategy. At its core, we must rely on \nour Nation's domestic energy assets, especially coal. Coal must become \na primary fuel source for new energy demands into the 21st century. \nHowever, to do so requires that we think differently about coal. We \nmust accelerate the deployment of commercial-scale technologies that \nmove us away from simply burning coal toward the enhanced ability to \ntransform coal into a variety of energy products. We can begin to meet \nthis challenge by deploying advanced power generation and carbon \nsequestration technologies as well as by producing hydrogen and \nsynthetic fuels for use in other sectors of the economy. Parallel \nefforts must also be initiated to resolve the outstanding environmental \nand regulatory issues attendant to coal production and reclamation. \nThis broad approach also requires sending strong and clear regulatory \nand market signals which can significantly reconcile numerous \nenvironmental and climate change concerns, stimulate technology \ndeployment, and set the stage for a renewed era for coal.\n  Furthermore, our Nation must recognize the incredible impact that \nU.S. technologies and ideas can have in helping to meet other nations' \nenergy needs in a more sustainable way. We must work to open and expand \ninternational markets for a range of U.S. clean energy technologies and \nsimultaneously address global energy security, economic, trade, and \nenvironmental objectives.\n  The path that I am proposing here today goes far beyond the so-called \ncomprehensive energy legislation currently before us. Pursuing this \ncourse will take steadfast leadership, hard work, and American \ningenuity to move forward in a responsible, balanced, and intelligent \nway. It is time for industry, labor, academic, environmental, and \ncommunity interests to work with policymakers to find common ground. \nCommonsense market-based and regulatory approaches, emerging technology \nplatforms, and new policy perspectives can bring these divergent groups \ntogether. By doing so, we can champion a new energy and environmental \nlegacy that will benefit all the world's citizens.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S5770]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the distinguished ranking member, Senator \nLevin, and myself, together with Senator Lautenberg and Senator Kyl, \nare endeavoring to structure a program for the next 2 or 3 hours, \nhopefully.\n  In the meantime, our distinguished colleague, the Senator from New \nMexico, would like to respond to some earlier remarks made in the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, I thank the chairman for \naccommodating me and I thank the Senate for listening for a few \nminutes.\n  I was not here in person when Senator Byrd spoke about the need for \nan energy policy but I heard most of it. I will share with the Senate \nthe reality of the energy problem in the United States.\n  I heard the distinguished Senator from West Virginia speak about \nissues such as electricity, the blackout that occurred, the shortage of \ncrude oil that we have to import, natural gas problems, and all of \nthose kinds of issues. I suggest it is wonderful to have somebody come \nto the Senate, especially from that side of the aisle, and talk about \nthese problems and the need to do something about it, because the truth \nis, they have prevented the Senate from doing it. The very things he \nspoke of are in one or the other of the Energy bills we have put before \nthe Senate and been denied. Most of the time the denial was because \nvery few Democrats would support it.\n  So we did not get alternative fuels, so we did not get a fix to \nelectricity blackout potential, we did not get a bill that produces \nhuge quantities of American natural gas, we did not get a bill that \nfixed electricity so we would not have blackouts--on and on and on, all \nthe issues and more that were spoken of by the distinguished Senator \nByrd.\n  To talk about the fact that our country needs them or that the \nPresident did not do them is to forget, in a short period of time--it \ndid not take long to forget--that all of these proposals have been \nvoted down by the Democrats in this Senate.\n  Maybe there were other things in the bill they did not like, but I \nhave never had anyone propose that if we change this and added that \nfrom that side of the aisle we could get a major energy bill. All we \nhave heard is a filibuster and a vote against it.\n  One time they claimed there was a provision that was onerous to them \nand we got 58 votes and lost a filibuster. We removed that provision \nwhich they said was onerous. We then tried the bill without it.\n  And let's go again on the issues: huge production of American natural \ngas, some quick, some over time; a fix to the blackout problem; \nincentives for the electric grid to grow and prosper; incentives so we \nwill have wind, which is right on the verge of becoming a major \nsource--wind electricity--solar energy; and on and on. There are \nincentives for all those.\n\n  When you add them up, it was a comprehensive bill that fixed what was \nbroken, added things we needed, and ultimately said to the world: \nAmerica is ready to do something. They have finally stood up. And where \nthere are no solutions, they did not find them. Anybody who thinks we \ncould have a solution to produce more crude oil, step up. The only way \nwe know is to tell Americans to use small cars. That would save \ngasoline. We tried it. The Senate is not for it. The House is not for \nit. I tried it in crowds. People are not for it. So that is the only \none. It is out of the way.\n  So what can we do? We have to take care of the other energy sources. \nWe have to make sure we do not get natural gas dependent, which we are \nabout to be. We should tell the world we have alternatives to produce \nelectricity. And we do, if we pass one of these bills. The problem is \nnot that the President took too long, not that the President did not \nsend us a proposal or that he did something in secret. We did our bill \nin public. So regardless of what you claim about him, we had an energy \nbill. We have an energy bill. As a matter of fact, I will offer it \nagain before this session is out.\n  I understand somebody wants to put energy on this Armed Services \nauthorization bill. Have at it. We will let you vote on the Energy bill \nat the same time. We will let you do that, and we will stand up and \nsay: Are you ready or do you want to talk? Do you want to increase \nnatural gas or do you want to blame somebody? Do you want to increase \nwind energy in America or do you want to complain?\n  I understand somebody around here wants to offer an amendment that we \nought to fix this oil problem with the SPR, Strategic Petroleum \nReserve. I was talking about that with my staff--and I would not do \nthis, at least as of now--but I am thinking about it.\n  I say to the Senator, Jon, what we ought to do is we ought to offer \nan amendment, when they offer that, and say that we want bin Laden to \nturn himself in; a resolution: We resolve that--after this, that, and \nthe other--he ought to turn himself in to America. Why would I do that? \nBecause that is about as apt to happen as we are apt to save anything \non the price of gasoline with an amendment that says: Use SPR. We tried \nit once. It saved 1 cent.\n  It is there because we are in jeopardy. If somebody has a major \nexplosion, a terrorist action, we need that SPR to take care of us. \nThat is what it is for. That is why it ought to stay there. That is why \nit ought to be filled.\n  So if I sound like I am concerned, I am, because I get tired of \npeople saying we need an energy policy and then voting against the very \nthings they talk about.\n  I understand some Senators are opposed to specific pieces. We are \nopen minded and ready to talk. If there are people who say, the way to \nget what we are talking about and complaining about is this, that, and \nthe other, we listen. But until they have one, we want to continue to \nask them to vote for an energy bill that is almost the same as their \nrhetoric, that almost does as much as their rhetoric asks for.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Every time this comes up, I will come down here and go \nthrough this laundry list, and ask them where they have been.\n  I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Is the Senator aware in the committee that I chair, the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, we have held several hearings: \none on natural gas and the prices being spiked, one on fuel that we \nburn in our automobiles. We have had witnesses who have documented that \nwe have two primary causes. One is all of these unreasonable \nenvironmental regulations these refiners are exposed to, and it \ndirectly relates to the cost of energy in this case. And the other is \nthe Energy bill.\n\n  I say to the Senator, as you point out, we had a good energy bill. \nThe House has a good energy bill. In that energy bill we had the \nability to drill for oil in places where we cannot right now that would \nopen up ANWR. If you look at the production in States, such as my State \nof Oklahoma and your State of New Mexico, the marginal wells--those are \nwells that produce 15 barrels a day or less--the statistic has never \nbeen refuted that if we had all of the marginal wells that have been \nplugged in the last 10 years flowing today, that would equal more than \nwe are currently importing from Saudi Arabia.\n  So we have a solution to the problem. With all those people crying \nabout the high prices, those are the major reasons we have high prices. \nI say to the Senator, you are right, we are going to have to have an \nenergy bill to correct this situation. Do you agree?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I agree.\n  I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  Let me say again, for purposes of discussion, I think we ought to \nhave a resolution--if the Democrats offer a resolution regarding SPR--\nthat says two things. I think the resolution ought to say: We think and \nwe direct that Saudi Arabia pump more oil and sell more oil. The Senate \nsays we resolve that they ought to do that. And, second, we think the \nterrorist we have been looking all over Afghanistan for should turn \nhimself in. That should be the second part of our resolution.\n  Why I say that is because we would do as much for the energy crisis \nwith that resolution as we will with one that tries to convince the \nAmerican\n\n[[Page S5771]]\n\npeople that the way to do this is to play around with the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves, I say to the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico, we are prepared to accept, on \nboth sides, the important amendment you had yesterday.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me get it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Actually, it is at the desk. We could ask for its \nadoption, to meet your convenience.\n  Mr. President, I offered an amendment yesterday. Somebody said it had \nbeen withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has been withdrawn.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. But does that mean it still might be up there?\n  Mr. WARNER. Here we are.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think the Senator has his amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is it in order?\n  Mr. LEVIN. You have to set aside the Lautenberg amendment \ntemporarily.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3192\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so that I can offer this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am shortly going to send the amendment \nto the desk. It has about 15 cosponsors from both sides of the aisle. \nThis amendment has to do with accelerating internationally the removal \nof fissile materials; that is, insecure radiological material and \nrelated equipment that cause us to be vulnerable to proliferation.\n  Many of us have worked very hard to put together a program where we \nand other nations will go to work at ridding the world of proliferation \nof nuclear products from the nuclear age. We think it is an exciting \napproach. Eventually, we have to fund it and Presidents have to \nimplement it. But the Senate would be saying today it is good policy to \nget the world concerned about getting rid of radioactive material that \ncame from the nuclear age.\n  My principal cosponsors are Senators Feinstein, Lugar, Biden, \nBingaman, and a whole array of Senators. I send the amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for himself, \n     Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Biden, Mr. Alexander, Mr. \n     Bingaman, Mr. Reed, and Mr. Akaka, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3192.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To accelerate the removal or security of fissile materials, \n   radiological materials, and related equipment at vulnerable sites \n                               worldwide)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title XXXI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3132.

Mr. President, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, \nI have recognized the danger posed by the potential risk of \nproliferation of materials or expertise from that nation. Through work \nwith Senators Nunn and Lugar for the original Nunn-Lugar Cooperative \nThreat Reduction legislation, and later with the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici \nDefense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act, I have worked to \nminimize this risk. Through these bills, and through several other \ninitiatives, we have made progress on the nonproliferation front. But \nthese are complex and difficult programs, success is measured in small \nsteps. While we have come a long ways, we still have a long ways to go.\n  Some of the programs we have established, such as materials \nprotection control and accounting, the initiatives for proliferation \nprevention, and the nuclear cities initiative, are working fairly well \nto address some of the major threat issues.\n  The HEU Deal is working to reduce stockpiles of highly enriched \nuranium, a prime concern for proliferation, although it has needed \ncongressional help at times to keep it alive. The plutonium disposition \ndeal is seriously stalled and needs attention at the highest levels in \nboth the United States and Russia.\n  Even though we are making progress, the focus on terrorism over the \nlast few years has substantially amplified the level of our concerns. \nIn the process, we have learned more about the complicated routes \nthrough which important equipment technologies, such as enrichment \ncapabilities, have moved to unfortunate destinations.\n  Our focus on Russia was appropriate a decade ago. But it is very \nclear today that proliferation must be viewed as a global problem. We \nmust broaden our programs so that they have a global impact, not only \nfocused on the former Soviet Union.\n  The increased threat of terrorism should encourage us to seek new \nways to expedite the management, security, and disposition of materials \nthat could be dangerous to our national security if they were to fall \ninto the wrong hands. These materials include a range of fissile \nmaterials, with highly enriched uranium and plutonium being the ones of \ngreatest concern.\n  Fissile materials and the specialized equipment to produce them \naren't the only concerns. We have also heard concerns about \nradiological dispersion devices, or ``dirty bombs'' as they are usually \ncalled. Materials that would be useful in dirty bombs also need to be \nunder far better control all around the world.\n  The amendment I am offering today is aimed at expediting global \ncleanout of nuclear materials and equipment that could represent \nproliferation risks. It includes in one package a range of \nauthorizations, all of which need acceleration toward the overall goal.\n  Of greatest importance, it provides authorization for global \nactivities, not only for activities focused on the former Soviet Union. \nAnd it encourages that we act in partnership with other governments, \nnongovernmental organizations, and other international groups that can \nassist us in this undertaking.\n  Fissile materials are targeted no matter where they are located, from \nexisting vulnerable storage sites to research reactors to other reactor \nsystems. The highly enriched uranium that fuels many of these research \nreactors, including those supplied by both the United States and \nRussia, represents a major concern for proliferation. Recent operations \nhave led to removal of some of these materials, but many more reactors \nneed attention.\n  As one example of a potential concern beyond the research reactors, \nthe Russian ice breakers are powered with nuclear reactors using highly \nenriched uranium. I hope we can help to convert those reactors in the \ncourse of this program.\n  Authorities are provided to transport materials to secure storage, \neither here or abroad, along with provision of improved security at \nvulnerable sites. In addition, attention is paid to the operation of \nimproved security systems once they are installed.\n  Technical support is authorized for the International Atomic Energy \nAgency or other countries to help in removal of material or upgrading \nof security. In addition, several initiatives address some of the \ncurrent uses of highly enriched uranium.\n  New fuels are to be developed to replace fuels that use highly \nenriched uranium. New reactor targets are to be developed to replace \ntargets that involve highly enriched uranium. And assistance with \nconversion of both reactors and targets to these new alternatives is \nprovided.\n  Faster blend-down of highly enriched uranium is included in the new \nprovisions. It is vital to get more of this material out of a weapons-\nready form more quickly than only relying on the rates of blend-down \nestablished in the existing HEU deal.\n  The amendment also authorizes assistance in closure and \ndecommissioning of sites of proliferation concern. In addition, \nprograms are authorized for helping displaced employees from such sites \nand converting these sites to other uses. We have had similar programs \nin place for the former Soviet Union for years, but now with this \namendment we can extend these programs to other countries as well.\n  With this global cleanout amendment, we will take a giant step toward \nproviding the Department of Energy, in coordination with other Federal \nagencies, with the tools they need to minimize proliferation risks from \nnuclear materials wherever they are found around the world. In the \nprocess, we can help to make this world a safer place.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nNew Mexico, Senator Domenici, to introduce an amendment to address one \nof the critical security issues in the post-9/11 world: the existence \nof weapons-usable nuclear materials at hundreds of vulnerable \nfacilities around the world.\n  President Bush has singled out terrorist nuclear attacks on the \nUnited States as the defining threat our Nation will face in the \nfuture.\n  In making the case against Saddam Hussein, he argued: ``If the Iraqi \nregime is able to produce, buy, or steal an amount of uranium a little \nbigger than a softball, it could have a nuclear weapon in less than a \nyear.''\n  What he did not mention is that with the same amount of uranium, al-\nQaida, Hezbollah, Hamas, or any terrorist organization could do the \nsame and smuggle a weapon across U.S. borders.\n  And the fact that Pakistani nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan's network put \nactual bomb designs on the black market only heightens the need to make \nsure these materials are not available.\n  Nonetheless, there are hundreds of vulnerable facilities around the \nworld that store from kilograms to tons of plutonium or highly enriched \nuranium. The State Department has identified 24 of these locations as \nhigh priority sites.\n  In response to this threat, the administration has focused its \nefforts on removing vulnerable international nuclear materials through \nfour projects: the take-back by Russia of highly enriched uranium fuels \nfrom Soviet-supplied reactors; the ongoing effort to convert Soviet-\ndesigned research reactors from using highly enriched uranium to using \nnon-bomb-grade fuels; the decades-long effort to convert U.S.-supplied \nresearch reactors from highly enriched uranium to low enriched uranium \nand the on-going effort to take back U.S.-supplied uranium.\n  These are important steps, but I am deeply concerned that these \nefforts are\n\n[[Page S5773]]\n\nnot sufficient and do not adequately address the seriousness of the \nissue. For example, the current approach will take 10-20 years to \ncomplete at the current rate of about 1 facility per year. This time \nframe ignores the near-term dangers we face.\n  Under the current approach to the take-back of Soviet-supplied \nuranium, there have been only two successful removals of highly-\nenriched uranium in more than two years, at Vinca and at Pitesti. But \nthe Vinca operation also required the additional contribution of $5 \nmillion from the Nuclear Threat Initiative to complete, because of the \nBush administration's claim of inadequate authority to pursue various \nactions to facilitate Serbian cooperation.\n  The U.S.-Russian bilateral agreement on a broader take-back effort \nhas taken years to complete--and even once final Russian government \napproval is secured, many obstacles remain. Indeed, Russia has never \nprepared certain types of environmental assessments related to these \nweapons. To move forward with this agreement, it will require \nsustained, high-level pressure.\n\n  U.S. efforts to convert highly enriched uranium-fueled reactors \nwithin Russia are still moving slowly on the technical front, in part \nbecause of insufficient funding. And we are only now beginning to take \nthe first steps toward providing incentives directly to facilities to \ngive up their highly enriched uranium.\n  The scope of the conversion effort in Russia is inadequate. It covers \nonly research reactors, ignoring critical assemblies, pulsed powered \nreactors, and civilian and military naval fuels. This leaves numerous \nvulnerable HEU stockpiles scattered across the former Soviet Union.\n  Under the current U.S. uranium take-back effort, if no new incentives \nare offered, tons of U.S.-supplied nuclear materials will remain abroad \nwhen the program is complete. And scores of U.S.-supplied reactors may \ncontinue to use highly enriched uranium indefinitely.\n  If weapons of mass destruction, WMD, out of the hands of terrorists \nis the defining threat to our Nation, then removing weapons-usable \nmaterial from facilities susceptible to terrorist theft should be a top \npriority for U.S. national security policy.\n  Yet, currently there is no single, integrated U.S. government program \nto facilitate the removal of these materials. To address this problem, \nSenator Domenici and I have offered this amendment to: urge the \nPresident to establish a task force within the Department of Energy on \nnuclear removal; provide a specific mandate for a program to remove \nnuclear material from vulnerable sites around the world as quickly as \npossible, whether the material was supplied by the U.S. or the Soviet \nUnion; provide flexible approaches, tailored to each site, to encourage \nfacilities to give up their nuclear material, and; authorize funding to \nbegin these efforts.\n  Osama bin Laden has declared the acquisition of weapons of mass \ndestruction a ``religious duty.'' After the Taliban was defeated, \nblueprints for a crude nuclear weapon were found in a deserted al-Qaida \nheadquarters in Afghanistan. It is clear that obtaining a nuclear \nweapon is a top priority of al-Qaida.\n  And a report released last year by the John F. Kennedy School of \nGovernment at Harvard University demonstrated the severity of the \nthreat posed by a nuclear weapon in the hands of terrorists.\n  The report described a scenario in which a 10-kiloton nuclear bomb is \nsmuggled into Manhattan and detonated, resulting in the deaths of \n500,000 people and causing $1 trillion in direct economic damage.\n  We must do everything in our power to prevent this from ever \nhappening.\n  This amendment will give our Government the direction and resources \nnecessary to remove nuclear materials from vulnerable sites around the \nworld in an expeditious manner.\n  We have little time to spare. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am proud to co-sponsor the amendment \noffered by my colleagues, Senator Domenici and Senator Feinstein, which \nauthorizes a program to accelerate U.S. efforts to remove, secure, \nstore, or destroy fissile and radiological material that might \notherwise be accessible to rogue states or terrorists.\n  There could hardly be a higher priority--it is clear that terrorists \nseek to acquire materials to make a nuclear bomb. Many experts believe \nthat terrorists would be capable of creating a nuclear weapon if they \ntook possession of fissile material. Even the simpler, gun-type design, \nthe type of bomb exploded at Hiroshima, could kill from tens of \nthousands to a million people if detonated in a large city.\n  Terrorists are also known to be interested in radiological material \nfor a so-called ``dirty bomb,'' also known as a radiological dispersion \ndevice. While an attack with a dirty bomb would not cause many \nfatalities, it could render large areas uninhabitable and cause long-\nterm economic devastation and psychological damage.\n  I thank Senator Domenici, and Senator Feinstein for their work and \nleadership on this issue. Senator Domenici, in his role as Chairman of \nthe Appropriations Energy and Water Subcommittee, has done much to \nshape the nuclear non-proliferation programs at the Department of \nEnergy. Senator Feinstein, also a member of that subcommittee, \nintroduced legislation to facilitate the removal of nuclear material \nfrom vulnerable sites around the world. They have worked together to \ncraft the bipartisan amendment before us today.\n  While many raised the alarm about the possibility of terrorists using \nweapons of mass destruction before September 11, 2001, the events of \nthat day made clear to all what devastation could have been wrought had \nthe terrorists attacked with weapons of mass destruction.\n  Witnesses at a hearing I chaired before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee on March 6, 2002, emphasized the need for multiple layers of \ndefense against nuclear terrorism and said that the very first priority \nmust be controlling fissile and radioactive material in the United \nStates and abroad.\n  Since that time, there has been progress in securing, storing and \ndestroying fissile and radiological material. But much more needs to be \ndone.\n  The Department of Energy's International Materials Protection, \nControl, and Cooperation Program and its Radiological Dispersion \nDevices Program seek to secure nuclear weapons, weapons-usable nuclear \nmaterials, and radiological sources by upgrading security and \nconsolidating these materials.\n  From fiscal year 1993 through this fiscal year, 2004, Congress has \nappropriated $1.58 billion for these Department of Energy programs, \nmostly to secure nuclear weapons and nuclear material in Russia. \nBecause of them, and the related Cooperative Threat Reduction programs \nat the Department of Defense, hundreds of tons of bomb material is more \nsecure and the nuclear material that could have been made into \nthousands of nuclear weapons has been destroyed.\n\n  Why, when so much has been accomplished, is this amendment necessary?\n  One answer is that while much has indeed been accomplished in Russia, \nhighly enriched uranium, or HEU, and plutonium exist in many countries \nand in both military and civilian sites. There are 345 operational or \nshut research reactors that used HEU in 58 countries. Many of these \ncountries have inadequate resources to operate or clean up these \nreactors. Few of them can afford to convert their HEU-fueled reactors, \nor their HEU targets used to produce medical isotopes, without outside \nassistance.\n  Another answer is that even in Russia, only a fraction of its highly \nenriched uranium has been destroyed. Many experts, including those \ninvolved with the Project on Managing the Atom at Harvard University, \nhave urged that efforts be accelerated to ``blend down'' highly \nenriched uranium to low-enriched uranium, which is usable for nuclear \npower, but not readily for weapons. At current rates, it could take \ndecades to blend down Russia's excess HEU. The urgency of the potential \nthreat from the tons of HEU in Russia argues for a more robust program \nthat would blend down HEU in years, not decades. The amendment before \nus today wisely authorizes an acceleration of our HEU blend-down \nprograms.\n\n[[Page S5774]]\n\n  In addition to authorizing accelerated HEU recovery and blend-down \nprograms, this amendment would accelerate our efforts to help move \nnuclear facilities away from the use of HEU in nuclear reactor fuel and \nmedical isotope production. It will also encourage increased efforts to \nrecover and secure plutonium and radiological sources that might \notherwise be accessible to terrorists.\n  The Domenici-Feinstein amendment provides for a comprehensive program \nto: securely ship at-risk fissile and radiological materials; raise \nprocessing and packing standards; provide interim security upgrades and \nimprove management of vulnerable sites; manage materials at secure \nfacilities; provide technical assistance to the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency, as well as to countries; and provide assistance in the \nclosure of risky sites.\n  This amendment will also improve our efforts to convert risky sites \nto, and place displaced nuclear workers in, activities that do not \nrepresent a proliferation threat. Both the Department of Energy and the \nDepartment of State have programs to help displaced workers, but there \nmany worthy projects in this area go unfunded each year. We can and we \nmust do more to ensure that nuclear weapons scientists and technical \npersonnel are not left prey to the lures of contracts in rogue states \nor sales to terrorists.\n  The Domenici-Feinstein amendment will not solve all the problems that \nour non-proliferation programs face. We also need sustained attention \nby the President to removing roadblocks that have hindered our existing \nprograms in Russia. Whether the question is access to sites, or \nimmunity from taxation, or immunity from liability for U.S. persons \ninvolved in these programs, we need effective intervention at the \nhighest level to solve those problems. It would be ironic, indeed, if \nour authorization of accelerated efforts were to be undone by the \ninability of President Bush and Putin to work out the implementation of \nthose programs.\n  This amendment must do more than spur the Department of Energy to put \nmore resources into our non-proliferation programs. It must galvanize \nthe government at the highest levels to do more and do it quickly, \nbefore some terrorist group gains access to fissile our radiological \nmaterial and uses it against us.\n  I commend Senators Domenici and Feinstein for their important \namendment and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend our distinguished colleague. \nThis is a very important, innovative approach to one of the serious \nproblems facing the world. I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I believe my distinguished colleague from Michigan has \ncleared it on his side and we are ready for action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend Senator Domenici. He has worked \nlong and hard on this issue. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the \namendment. The bottom line is there are a number of instances where the \nDepartment of Energy has run into situations where it does not have, \nnor do other agencies have, the authorities which are necessary to \nremove or otherwise deal with this nuclear material which is at risk. \nThe Domenici amendment will provide those essential authorities in \norder to take some very strong antiproliferation steps. It is a very \ngood amendment. We support it on this side of the aisle.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3192.\n  The amendment (No. 3192) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the managers for their \ncooperation and their statements. I am not sure Senator Levin is \npresently a cosponsor. I ask unanimous consent that he be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And Senator Warner has already asked.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, I have.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I see a Senator seeking recognition, so we will withhold \na quorum call. My understanding is the Senator from Arizona wishes to \ntalk about the proposal now under consideration, if that is agreeable.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Of course. If I may ask the chairman a question, I have no \nproblem with that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it still our intention to try to order the sequencing \nof two votes on these amendments?\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct. We have under consideration by \nour respective leadership at this time a program you and I have put to \nthem to continue debate this afternoon on the Lautenberg amendment and \nthe second degree by my colleague from Arizona at which time votes will \nbe scheduled in the 5 to 6 timeframe.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3191\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nArizona has been recognized to speak on his second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield to the Senator from New Jersey for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If the Senator from Arizona will yield for a \nquestion, is a second-degree amendment still the proposal?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the terminology is being worked on right \nnow. Nothing is agreed upon at the moment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, what we have pending right now is a second-\ndegree amendment to the Lautenberg amendment, and there will be \ndiscussions about precisely how that will be treated when this \namendment and the Lautenberg amendment are voted on at the end of the \nafternoon.\n  Let me begin by noting what some of my objections are to the \nLautenberg amendment. Then I will speak to the second-degree amendment \nwhich I have offered. The point of the Lautenberg amendment is to \nchange the way in which sanctions are put on companies doing business \nabroad. The State Department has issued some objections to this \namendment which I will speak to later. To summarize: That it would \ninterfere with the President's discretion in conducting foreign \naffairs; that it would lead to a number of foreign policy problems for \nthe United States; that it is unnecessary because the President \nexercises authority with respect to these foreign subsidiaries today.\n  To be precise about a particular concern the State Department \nexpresses, the amendment would actually only focus on ownership, which \nis a standard that could easily be circumvented by these companies \nagainst whom we would all want sanctions to apply, and would be less \neffective than the administration's current approach utilized by the \nPresident. By defining this under the definition of control to mean \nowning at least 50 percent of the capital structure of the entity, the \ntest could easily be circumvented by manipulating the percentage of \nownership so that it remains under 50 percent, but at the same time \nmaintaining control in fact.\n  Under current law, the U.S. Treasury Department considers both \nownership and control so the President has the ability to exert this \nkind of sanction authority in a much more flexible way than would be \nthe case under the amendment offered by the Senator from New Jersey. \nThe Lautenberg amendment diminishes the President's authority and \nreduces the scope of the sanctions.\n  Finally, its impact on existing sanction programs is unclear. The \nauthority exists already. The Lautenberg amendment would raise \nquestions, complications, and reduce the President's flexibility in \nways we don't\n\n[[Page S5775]]\n\nthink would be appropriate. That is one of the reasons we are offering \nthis alternative, this substitute or second-degree amendment, depending \nupon how we agree to characterize it.\n  This is an amendment which has been offered as a way to raise \nrevenues for different purposes, but the revenues--perhaps $9 billion \nin revenues generated here, but in any event some amount, substantial \nbillions of dollars--would be available for expenditures by the \nSecretary of Defense on a variety of equipment such as replacement of \nequipment lost in combat, ammunition, and selected items of high \npriority such as vehicles or night vision devices, Javelin missiles, \nsensors, unmanned aerial vehicles. In fact, to the degree that we would \nwant to expand the existing program, which will be completed shortly \nfor our own troops for additional add-on protection for shoulder and \nside-body areas or interceptor body armor for Iraqi troops, for \nexample, or additional add-on ballistic protection for medium and heavy \nwheeled vehicles or multipurpose wheeled vehicles, all of those things \ncould be paid for with the fees that would be generated out of this \nparticular amendment.\n  What is this amendment? I had actually offered versions of this \nbefore. The point was to try to prevent the tobacco settlement of 1998 \nfrom resulting in a windfall to certain of the trial lawyers who were \ninvolved in that settlement. What we did is to utilize an existing Tax \nCode provision which says in cases of trusts, for example, where the \ntrustee pays himself too much or an unreasonable fee, the IRS can \nimpose an excessive tax. I say excessive because it is 200 percent of \nincome. The purpose of it is to discourage the behavior of a trustee \nwho would bilk the trust in effect by charging himself fees that are \nnot deemed reasonable. And we utilize that same concept here, adding a \nsecond section immediately following that section of the Internal \nRevenue Code to provide similar treatment with respect to these \nunreasonable lawyer fees. So the concept is already in the Tax Code. We \nwould simply apply it to the master settlement agreement for lawyer \nfees as well.\n  I make it very clear that, first of all, the amendment does not apply \nto any fees that have already been judicially reviewed and approved by \ncourts under appropriate standards. It does not apply retroactively. It \nis only prospectively, to fees paid in the future out of the tobacco \nsettlement on which taxes have yet to be collected. And by the way, \nthere are about $100 million in fees paid out of this settlement every \nyear. The trial lawyers will still receive billions of dollars in fees \nunder this amendment, far more than their actual legal work would \njustify.\n  What we have done is to say that the cap on fees we had suggested \nbefore of $2,000 an hour--if you stop and think about it, that is a lot \nof money--we have scrapped that. Some people said, no, some lawyers \nmight actually have been worth $2,000 an hour. Think about your plumber \nand what he charges per hour.\n  But we said, OK, how about $10,000 an hour. And they said, no, that \nis still not enough. These lawyers need more than $10,000 an hour. So \nwhat we have done in this amendment is to say: OK, we will bend over \nbackward here, be fair to these poor trial lawyers. We are going to let \nthem earn $20,000 an hour for every hour they put in. I think that is \nenough.\n  I am not sure that would meet most people's definition of reasonable, \nbut we are going to say that that is reasonable, that they can earn \n$20,000 an hour. But that isn't enough. Some people have said this is \nthe ``one yacht per lawyer rule.'' I am not sure what a yacht goes for.\n\n  The bottom line is that there is a point at which the fees are \nobscene and unreasonable and unethical, and under the existing IRS \nCode, this kind of conduct is taken care of by a special tax that is \nimposed of 200 percent. The same thing would be true here. Obviously, \nwhat the lawyer would do is to limit his fee to $20,000 an hour and \nthen return anything in excess of that, so he would not be taxed at 200 \npercent--returning that money, in this case, to the Treasury of the \nUnited States of America.\n  So the tobacco companies are still going to pay every dime they \ncommitted to pay in lawyer fees. But the money, instead of going to the \ntrial lawyers, after they have collected $20,000 an hour, will go to \nthe U.S. Treasury to pay for the military equipment that is the subject \nof the bill before us right now.\n  Now, let me make a point about these fees being excessive. Some may \ndispute this, although, in view of the history, I cannot imagine \nanybody seriously disputing it. Let me give you some examples. I will \nstart with reminding my colleagues exactly how the tobacco fees were \nawarded.\n  In the State of Texas, for example, trial lawyers were awarded $3.3 \nbillion for their legal work--work that amounted in this case to filing \na copycat lawsuit. The fee would amount to an effective hourly rate for \nthese lawyers of over $100,000 an hour. Most people don't make $100,000 \nin a year. I don't even know how many hours there are in a year, but it \nis a lot. This is $100,000 an hour. That is wrong. I don't think they \nwould suffer too much if we cut them down to $20,000 an hour.\n  My colleague from Texas, Senator Cornyn, was attorney general of the \nState of Texas and he had a firsthand relationship with this issue. In \nfact, it was a pretty difficult situation. Let me read to you some of \nthe things he described about what happened in Texas. I am quoting the \njunior Senator from Texas:\n\n       In my home State of Texas, trial lawyers have accused the \n     then Attorney General of demanding $1 million in campaign \n     contributions in exchange for their being included on the \n     State's tobacco litigation team. One prominent lawyer--a \n     former President of the Texas Trial Lawyers Association--has \n     since said that the attorney general's solicitation was so \n     blatant that ``I knew that instant . . . that I could not be \n     involved in the matter,'' and he even later wondered if the \n     meeting had been a ``sting operation.'' Another lawyer simply \n     characterized his encounter with the attorney general as a \n     bribery solicitation.\n\n  He describes the rewards these trial lawyers reaped for their \npolitical investment:\n\n       As for the five law firms that actually did represent Texas \n     in the tobacco litigation, they filed relatively late \n     lawsuits based on other lawyers' work--and were awarded $3.3 \n     billion in attorneys fees. This award amounts to compensation \n     that, even had these attorneys worked all day, every day \n     during the entire period of the litigation, is well in excess \n     of $100,000 an hour. As one newspaper editorial has noted, \n     for the amount of money that these lawyers were awarded, \n     Texas could hire 10,000 additional teachers or policemen for \n     ten years.\n\n  Senator Cornyn also described how these excessive and, I suggest, \nclearly unethical fees were obtained by lawyers in other States:\n\n       In Maryland, [a tort lawyer, a billionaire] demanded a $1 \n     billion fee for his work on that State's case, even though, \n     according to the State senate President, the State \n     legislature had retroactively ``changed centuries of \n     precedent to ensure [his] win in the case. [He] ultimately \n     received an accelerated $150 million payment for this no-risk \n     lawsuit.\n       In Massachusetts, according to other tobacco plaintiffs' \n     lawyers, Massachusetts' suit piggybacked on the work of other \n     lawyers and was not pivotal to the outcome of the tobacco \n     litigation. Result: $775 million was awarded to the \n     Massachusetts lawyers in that [State's arbitration on the \n     tobacco case.]\n       In Missouri, a State supreme court justice in Missouri \n     resigned his post in order to join one of the private law \n     firms expected to receive a portion of the [tobacco fee \n     award.] Ultimately, the firms representing the State spent \n     just 5 months on the State's lawsuit. They received a fee \n     award of $111 million. One State leader has described the \n     award as ``the biggest rip-off in the 180-year history of the \n     State.'' The law firms receiving these fees had donated more \n     than $500,000 to State politicians and parties in the years \n     leading up to their selection as the State's outside counsel.\n\n  As I mentioned earlier, these fee contracts were awarded in a variety \nof ways, including through political cronyism, and really resulted in \nvery little original legal work. That is my assertion to you. Don't \ntake my word for it. On this tort reform issue, even many of the trial \nbar lawyers are in full agreement that the lawyers' fees here were \nexcessive. They certainly should know; they are experts in this area. \nThis is what some folks, including some tobacco lawyers, had to say:\n  Michael Ciresi, a pioneer in tobacco litigation who represented the \nState of Minnesota in its lawsuit, and who is very familiar with these \nlawsuits, has said that the Texas, Florida, and Mississippi lawyers' \nfees awards ``are far in excess of these lawyers' contribution to any \nof the State results.''\n\n[[Page S5776]]\n\n  Washington, DC lawyer and tobacco industry opponent, John Coale, has \ndenounced the fee awards as ``beyond human comprehension'' and stated \nthat ``the work does not justify them.''\n  Even the Association of American Trial Lawyers, the Nation's premier \nrepresentative of the plaintiffs bar, has condemned attorneys' fees \nrequested in the State tobacco settlement. The President of ATLA \nstated:\n\n       Common sense suggests that a $1 billion fee is excessive \n     and unreasonable and certainly should invite the scrutiny [of \n     the courts.] [ATLA] generally refrains from expressing an \n     institutional opinion regarding a particular fee in a \n     particular case, but we have a strong negative reaction to \n     reports that at least one attorney on behalf of the \n     plaintiffs in the Florida case is seeking a fee in excess of \n     $1 billion.\n\n  Perhaps the best gloss on the tobacco fee awards is that provided by \nProfessor Lester Brickman, a professor of law at Cardozo Law School, a \nnoted authority on legal ethics and attorney fees:\n\n       Under the rules of legal ethics, promulgated partly as a \n     justification for the legal profession's self-governance, \n     fees cannot be ``clearly excessive.'' Indeed, that standard \n     has now been superseded in most States by an even more \n     rigorous standard: Fees have to be ``reasonable.'' Are these \n     fees, which in many cases amount to effective hourly rates of \n     return of tens of thousands--and even hundreds of thousands--\n     of dollars an hour, reasonable? I think to ask the question \n     is to answer it.\n\n  Let me emphasize one more point. Lawyers are universally held in the \nlaw to be fiduciaries. That is, they owe a duty of trust to their \nclients, a special duty of trust. One can easily understand why that is \nso. As such, as a fiduciary, under the legal ethics that apply to every \nlawyer, lawyers are not allowed to take advantage of their clients with \nregard to their fees. A contract for an unreasonable or unethical fee, \nfor example, is unenforceable in the courts, and the excessive portion \nof the fee must be returned to the client. Numerous legal authorities \nconfirm that lawyers are fiduciaries whose fees have always been \nsubject to enforceable reasonableness requirements. I say this because, \nof course, that is what we are doing right here.\n  We have done that with respect to other fiduciaries in the Tax Code--\nthe trustees I spoke of earlier--and we can obviously do it here also. \nOne court said:\n\n       We realize that business contracts may be enforced between \n     those in equal bargaining capacities, even though they turn \n     out to be unfair, inequitable, or harsh. However, a fee \n     agreement between lawyer and client is not an ordinary \n     business contract. The profession has both an obligation of \n     public service and duties to clients which transcend ordinary \n     business relationships and prohibit the lawyer from taking \n     advantage of the client.\n\n  I will tell you what another court said:\n\n       An attorney is only entitled to fees which are fair and \n     just and which adequately compensate him for his services. \n     This is true no matter what fee is specified in the contract, \n     because an attorney, as a fiduciary, cannot bind his client \n     to pay a greater compensation for his services than the \n     attorney would have a right to demand if no contract had been \n     made. Therefore, as a matter of public policy, reasonableness \n     is an implied term in every contract for attorney's fees.\n\n  So the choice before the Senate is either to allow the tobacco \nsettlements to be diverted to self-dealing billionaire tobacco lawyers, \nor to provide our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan with additional combat \nequipment to help them perform their missions.\n  The choice could not be more clear: We can either allow the de facto \ntaxes imposed by the tobacco settlement to continue to be diverted to \npay $100,000-an-hour fees to these politically connected billionaire \nlawyers or we can put those taxes to use providing our troops with \nadditional equipment.\n  We already have the precedent of doing this with respect to other \nfiduciaries in the Tax Code, specifically section 4958. This adds a new \nsection immediately following, section 4959, that applies the very same \nconcept to these particular fees. It is prospective only. It does not \napply to anything that the court has already approved.\n  I cannot imagine how this would not be a good idea. The amendment is \na sense of the Senate to pass this proposition. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it, assuming we have a vote on this perhaps in an hour and a \nhalf or so this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, if there is no one else seeking recognition, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we have had some discussion about what \nwe can do to help raise the funds to finance our fight against \nterrorism. At this point, we are spending $5 billion a month in Iraq. I \nthink if we wanted to really get some money raised to continue that \nassignment, which we must, then perhaps we ought to consider repealing \nthe top tax rate cut for all millionaires and raise even more money for \nour troops than what has been offered.\n  I have an amendment. It has been modified. It is fairly obvious that \nwe are talking around the issue. It is surprising that we cannot get \ntogether in an effort to dissuade companies, to prevent companies that \nare doing business with terrorist states from continuing to do that. My \namendment says if a U.S. company owns 50 percent or more of a \ncorporation, that it would be a violation of law for them to continue \nto do business with terrorist states.\n  I do not know what the concerns are about this amendment. It is \nfairly clear we are spending so much money, so much effort, and so many \nlives to fight terrorism. When we register concern about American \ncompanies doing business with these terrorist states, we seem to have \ncreated a climate that has people objecting and, frankly, I don't \nunderstand why.\n  When we talk about supplying revenue opportunities to Iran, we have \nto remember that they funded the 1983 terror attack in Beirut, killing \n240 U.S. marines. We are talking about an Iranian Government that funds \nHamas, Islamic jihad, and Hezbollah. I ask my colleagues whether there \nis anyone here who would stand up and tell the American people why we \nshould be helping Iran. Is there anyone here who can explain how it \nhelps our soldiers to make sure that funds and potential profits are \nfunneled to Iran? How does it help our troops to make sure Iran has \nmore money to pass on to terrorists? We want to shut that down.\n  My amendment offers a simple proposition: You are either with us or \nagainst us, and if we are serious about the war on terror, then we have \nto cut off every revenue source we can of those sponsors of terror. \nPresident Bush said himself, ``Money is the lifeblood of terrorist \noperations.'' He is right. We know that terrorist groups, such as Hamas \nand Islamic jihad, are funded by Iran and other rogue states, and we \nneed to cut off that funding opportunity.\n  Terrorist operations cannot survive without funds, and that is why \nour sanctions program is so critical. No American business should \nprovide revenues to state sponsors of terror, and the nations that \nsponsor terrorism need to learn they will be denied business \nopportunities as long as they are funding terror groups.\n  Right now, American companies are doing business with terrorist \nstates through foreign subsidiaries, and we must stop this practice. As \nlong as this loophole is in place, our sanctions laws have no teeth.\n  We know that many companies find tax loopholes or regulatory \nloopholes that they exploit from time to time, but in this case, we are \ntalking about companies exploiting loopholes just so they can do \nbusiness with terrorists--sham corporations.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at this chart because it demonstrates \nhow companies utilize this loophole.\n  If a U.S. corporation has a foreign subsidiary, they can send money \nto Iran. Iran can then send money to support Hezbollah or Hamas in \ntheir terror, suicide bombings, with their interests in developing \nweapons of mass destruction. We all believe that is in the works now. \nWe should not in any way permit these companies--American companies \ncreated here, earning their living here, the executives earning their \nbonuses here--to be able to get some of that money as a result of \nsending funds to places such as Iran and other terrorist states.\n  U.S. companies often have several subsidiaries, and most U.S. \ncompanies\n\n[[Page S5777]]\n\nand their subsidiaries do not cross the line that prevents business \nwith terrorist states, but some do.\n  President Bush also has declared that Iran is part of the ``axis of \nevil,'' and he couldn't be more right. My amendment says that if we are \ngoing to impose sanctions on rogue nations such as Iran, then let's be \nserious about it. Let's make sure Iran is isolated for their \nsponsorship of terrorism.\n  In addition to the 240 marines who were brutally murdered in their \nsleep in 1983 in Beirut, Iranian-backed terror killed these 2 young \nAmerican women, 22-year-old Sara Duker and 14-year-old Abigail Litle. \nThey were traveling in Israel. Sarah Duker was a constituent of mine \nfrom Teaneck, NJ. A summa cum laude graduate of Barnard College, Sara \nwas killed with her fiance when the bus she was riding on in Jerusalem \nwas blown up in 1996 by Hamas. Again, Hamas receives funding and \nsupport from the Iranian Government.\n  Last year, 14-year-old Abigail, originally from New Hampshire, was \nriding home from school in Haifa when her bus exploded as a result of a \nsuicide bombing. That attack killed 15 people and was directly linked \nto terrorists funded by Syria and Iran.\n  Iran sponsors terrorism, and they glow in that relationship. They \nlove to let the world know they are out to harm Americans. The terror \nthey help fund has killed hundreds of Americans and yet American \ncompanies are utilizing a loophole in order to do business with the \nIranian Government. I want to close the loophole.\n  It is inexcusable for U.S. companies to engage in any business \npractices that provide revenue for terrorism. The bottom line is that \nbig businesses, even those with financial ties to the top members of \nour Government, do not get a free pass in this war on terrorism.\n  I hope that when my amendment comes up for a vote later on that all \nof my colleagues will step up and ask the questions of themselves: Why \ndo we want to promote anything that would send funds to Iran or other \nrogue terrorist nations? I cannot understand why that would be.\n  There are laws that say it should not happen, but they lack teeth. \nThe process does not work. So I urge my colleagues, when the \nopportunity comes a little later in the day, to pass this amendment to \nclose a terrorist funding loophole.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I join Senators Lautenberg and \nFeingold in cosponsoring an amendment to the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  This amendment will close loopholes that have allowed some American \ncompanies to skirt U.S. law by working with and operating in countries \nthat have been identified by the President as supporters of terrorism.\n  Although Federal law prohibits U.S. companies from conducting \nbusiness with nations that sponsor terrorism, a few firms have \nexploited a loophole in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act \nand are doing business through foreign subsidiaries, thereby providing \nterrorist states with revenue and other potentially important benefits.\n  Under the amendment we are introducing today, foreign subsidiaries \nare barred from engaging in commercial transactions with terrorist-\nsponsoring states under the same standards and under the same \ncircumstances as their parent companies.\n  The definition of corporate entity would include not only U.S. \ncompanies and all foreign branches, but also foreign subsidiaries.\n  Subsidiaries of certain companies have been using foreign \nsubsidiaries to conduct business in countries such as Iran.\n  Many of these foreign subsidiaries are often formed and incorporated \noverseas for the specific purpose of bypassing U.S. sanctions laws.\n  This amendment does not change which countries are subject to U.S. \nsanctions or interfere with the President's ability to invoke the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act; and it does not change the \nsanctions under the act in anyway.\n  It simply clarifies who is subject to the sanctions when and if they \nare invoked by the President.\n  Currently Iran, North Korea, Cuba, and Libya have been targeted by \nthe President under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, \nall countries that we can agree deserve to be on the list.\n  Despite the tens of billions of dollars that we are spending on the \ndefense of our homeland, we still have a law on our books that allows \nU.S. companies to assist the very nations that support terrorist \nactivities aimed at us. This is unconscionable.\n  I want to applaud the efforts of New York City Comptroller, the New \nYork Police Department, and the New York Fire Department to bring this \nproblem to the Nation's attention.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on behalf of the leadership, and working \nwith my ranking member, the Senator from Michigan, I make the following \nunanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time until 5:30 be divided between \nthe chairman and ranking member or their designees as follows: 55 \nminutes to Senator Levin, 30 minutes to the Senator from Virginia; \nprovided further that the Senate vote in relation to the Kyl amendment, \nwhich is to be drafted as a first-degree, to be followed by a vote in \nrelation to the Lautenberg amendment; provided further that no second-\ndegree amendment be in order to either amendment prior to the votes. \nFinally, I ask unanimous consent that following the votes the Senator \nfrom Virginia or his designee be recognized in order to offer the next \namendment, and following that, that the Senator from Michigan be \nrecognized in order to offer the sequential amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, using what the Senator, the distinguished \nchairman outlined, we would vote at 5:30 or thereabouts; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about the \nunderlying amendment. In the opinion of the Senator from Virginia, the \namendment would make it more difficult for the President to impose \nsanctions on states that support terrorism. At present, the President \nmust weigh the benefits of imposing sanctions against the costs of such \nsanctions, including costs to U.S. businesses that may be affected. \nSecond, the amendment will introduce a new factor into this balance, \nweighing against the imposition of sanctions: the objections of foreign \ncountries to the extension of U.S. sanctions laws to reach companies \norganized under their jurisdiction. European countries in particular \nhave strenuously objected to U.S. actions they perceive to involve the \nextraterritorial application of U.S. law.\n  Because the amendment leaves the President no discretion not to cover \ncompanies organized under the laws of other countries, and thus avoid \nsuch objections, the amendment introduces a new cost the President must \novercome in any decision to use sanctions to fight terrorism.\n  The amendment is unnecessary because existing law already provides \nthe President the ability to prevent U.S. companies from evading U.S. \nsanctions through the use of foreign subsidiaries. Existing U.S. \nsanctions regulations prohibit actions by U.S. companies to evade or \navoid U.S. sanctions. U.S. companies that create foreign subsidiaries \nfor the purpose of evading U.S. sanctions laws may be prosecuted for \nsuch evasions. Existing U.S. sanctions regulations also prohibit U.S. \ncompanies from approving or facilitating actions by their foreign \nsubsidiaries that would constitute violations of U.S. sanctions laws if \nundertaken by a U.S. company. Similarly, U.S. sanctions regulations \nprohibit any U.S. citizen employed by a foreign company from taking \nactions in violation of relevant U.S. sanctions.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S5778]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield such time as the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky may wish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I commend my friend from Arizona, \nSenator Kyl, for offering his important amendment. It seeks to remedy \nan unethical fee schedule and provide a way for us to protect the \nsoldiers, the taxpayers, and the public treasury all at the same time.\n  Lawyers, of course, have a fiduciary duty to their clients and one \ncomponent of that duty is, to put it plainly, not to rip them off. But \nin the tobacco cases, as my friend noted, plaintiffs' lawyers got as \nmuch as $100,000 an hour for providing ``legal services,'' and I use \nthe term ``services'' loosely. Their efforts were often duplicative of \nlegal work others had done.\n  I think the notion that those who file what are in large part copycat \nlawsuits should get paid as much as $100,000 per hour for such work is \nabsurd on its face. Absolutely absurd.\n\n  If anyone does not believe me, let's look at what some of the lawyers \nthemselves have said about the situation I have described. Michael \nCerisi, who pioneered the tobacco litigation and who represented the \nState of Minnesota in its lawsuit against the tobacco industry, said \nthe fees of the lawyers who brought the lawsuits on behalf of Texas, \nFlorida, and Mississippi ``are far in excess of these lawyers' \ncontribution to any of the state results.''\n  John Coale, Washington, DC, lawyer and noted opponent of the tobacco \nindustry, has denounced the fee awards as ``beyond human \ncomprehension'' and stated that ``the work does not justify them.''\n  Even our friends at the American Trial Lawyers Association have found \nit very difficult to defend this practice. The past president of ATLA \nhas said:\n\n       Common sense suggests that a one billion dollar fee is \n     excessive and unreasonable and certainly should invite. . . . \n     scrutiny.\n\n  That is the past president of ATLA. He goes on to say that ATLA:\n\n       . . . generally refrains from expressing an institutional \n     opinion regarding a particular fee in a particular case, but \n     we have a strong negative reaction to reports that at least \n     one attorney . . . is seeking a fee in excess of one billion \n     dollars.\n\n  The Tax Code already provides a remedy for abuses by certain \nfiduciaries. It requires trustees to disgorge themselves of ill-gotten \ngains that are due to the violation of their duty as fiduciaries. The \nKyl amendment simply expresses the sense of the Senate that we ought to \namend this section of the Tax Code so that it encompasses other \nimportant fiduciaries--namely, personal injury lawyers in mass tort \ncases. I would be shocked if my colleagues opposed it. If they do, they \nwould be saying it is more important for personal injury lawyers to \nreceive more than $20,000 an hour than it is to use excessive fees to \nprotect our troops.\n  The Kyl amendment notes some of the things that could be purchased by \nrequiring the disgorgement of these ill-gotten gains: up-armored high-\nmobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles; add-on ballistic missile \nprotection for medium and heavy wheeled vehicles; interceptor body \narmor including add-on protection for the shoulder and side body areas; \nunmanned aerial vehicles; ammunition; night-vision devices; sensors; \nJavelin missiles; and replacement of equipment lost in combat.\n  This amendment does not turn personal injury lawyers into paupers. It \nonly applies in mass tort cases where the judgment is over $100 \nmillion, and it merely ensures that lawyers do not take advantage of \ntheir own clients.\n  With respect to the tobacco litigation in particular, it provides \nthat plaintiffs' lawyers are guaranteed to make no less than $20,000 an \nhour. That is right--not $20,000 a week, not $20,000 a day, but $20,000 \nan hour. In short, it guarantees plaintiffs' lawyers a minimum wage of \n$20,000 per hour. If they can show somehow that it is appropriate for \nthem to be paid more, then I suppose they could even get more than \n$20,000 per hour. What it will prevent, however, is personal injury \nlawyers being able to get, as a matter of course, unjustified and \nexcessive fees from their clients to the tune of $100,000 per hour or \neven more. My friend from Arizona has referred to this as the ``one \nyacht per lawyer'' rule. With a minimum wage of $20,000 per hour, I \nthink it is more appropriate to term it the ``one yacht per lawyer per \nweek'' rule.\n  I hope my colleagues will not choose trial lawyers over the troops.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask my friend to yield whatever time I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to do that.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been called upon in the past, as have \nother Members of this body, to interfere with what goes on in \ncorporations--that is, to tell corporations they are limited in what \nthey can pay their corporate executives. I have chosen not to become \ninvolved in that. I truly believe, even though some of these \ncompensation packages are outlandish, in my opinion, it is not up to \nme. In our free enterprise system, it is up to the board of the \ndirectors of those corporations to determine what someone is worth. It \nis inappropriate, in this free enterprise system in which we are \nliving, we take away the ability of corporations to run corporations.\n  I have always looked at the salaries of ballplayers. We have a 14-\nyear-old boy named Freddie Adu, who is the highest paid player in the \nAmerican Soccer League. Now, are they paying a 14-year-old boy too much \nmoney? He is making more than people who have played soccer for 20 and \n25 years. It is kind of up to them to determine how much money he \nshould get.\n  The average salary of a professional Major League baseball player in \nAmerica today is around $2 million a year. That is a lot of money for a \nperson who bats a ball, throws a ball, catches a ball, and runs around \nthe bases, but that is what they get in our free market system. They \nget a lot of money.\n  My friend Greg Maddux from Las Vegas made $15 million last year. He \npitched about 30 times. I don't know how much that amounts to, but that \nis a lot of money he makes. This year he has taken a tremendous cut in \npay. He is only making $8 million a year. However, Greg Maddux is being \npaid what the market determined he was worth. He was released by the \nAtlanta Braves and he shopped around. The Mets wanted him, the \nBaltimore Orioles looked at him, and he determined, rather than go with \nSan Diego and the other teams I mentioned, he would play in Chicago for \n$7 million or $8 million a year. That is what America is all about, the \nfree enterprise system.\n  If we want to be picky and talk about how much is too much, we might \nwant to take a look at a man by the name of Reuben Mark--Colgate-\nPalmolive--who in 2003 was paid $149,970,000. That is a lot of money. \nThat does not take into consideration a lot of the stock options he \ncould have exercised if he had wanted to. I have the amount of money he \ncould make from the stock options he could exercise if he chose to. It \nis, again, in the tens of millions of dollars. I cannot find it right \nnow. Let's see if I can flip over to that. But it is a lot of money.\n\n  George David, of United Technologies, last year made almost $71 \nmillion. Again, it does not take into consideration the other money he \ncould have made had he wanted to. Is United Technologies paying him too \nmuch money? It is none of my business, I believe, as a Member of \nCongress to tell United Technologies how much money they can pay George \nDavid.\n  Is it my business to determine how much Lehman Brothers can pay \nRichard S. Fuld, Jr? Last year he made almost $68 million. I do not \nthink so. I think it is up to this company. Even though I think this is \na huge figure to be paid, and I think it is unfair to the stockholders, \nI am not on the board of directors, and they may know things I do not \nknow. And, in fact, they do.\n  Henry R. Silverman, with a company called Cendant, made over $60 \nmillion last year. Should we interfere with this? The answer is no.\n  Right here in the Washington, DC, area, there is a man by the name of \nDwight Schar. I wish I had known this guy was as rich as he was. Or \nmaybe I do not wish that. When we moved here 22 years ago, we bought \nthe home that he lived in. He was living there. I went and met Dwight \nSchar, kind of a quiet guy. He did not say much. I understand now why \nhe was unwilling to negotiate\n\n[[Page S5779]]\n\nthe price of that home. He said that is what he wanted, and he was \nunwilling to change that. Obviously, he is a good negotiator because \nlast year he made over $58 million from NVR. They build homes.\n  Oracle Company paid Lawrence Ellison almost $41 million last year. \nAnd on and on, with these huge corporate salaries.\n  Using the logic of my friend, the distinguished junior Senator from \nArizona--a fine man; I have great respect for him, but using the logic \nhe used today, then, the free enterprise system really must not apply \nto everybody, only to some. We know there are companies that are well \nknown around here. As I indicated, Reuben Mark of Colgate-Palmolive was \nthe champion last year, that we know of at least, at $148 million. He \ndid quite well. He had, just from stock alone, $131 million last year. \nAnd he is just one of a number of people.\n  But we have others who did quite well last year who are almost \nhousehold names around here--not because they are known as good \nbusinesspeople, as are those people I have mentioned to this point; \nevery one of these men I have talked to, Dwight Schar and all the rest, \nare known as extremely good businesspeople. But as we get down to some \nof these corporations, for example, we could take a look at David \nLesar, who is the chairman and president of the Halliburton Company. \nLast year he did not do as well probably as some. He only made about $8 \nmillion last year from Halliburton. But he has, of course, $26 million \nin unexercised stock options that he could have used. But I guess with \nall that is going on with Halliburton--and that, of course, is the \nbasis for this amendment that has been offered by my distinguished \nfriend from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg.\n  We do not, as Members of Congress, have the right, in my opinion, to \ninterfere with the private sector. I have no right to say that Freddie \nAdu is making too much money playing soccer as a 14-year-old boy, or \nthat Barry Bonds is making too much money, or that some guy who is \nbatting .220 playing in the Major Leagues is making too much money \nbeing paid $15 million a year. Should we in Congress say that because \nhe is not batting more than .240, his salary should not be more than $6 \nmillion? I do not think so.\n\n  Do we have any right to tell these companies that I have mentioned \nhere that they are paying their people too much money and that Congress \nshould step in and stop them from doing so? I do not think so. I have \nnever felt that way.\n  We have here before us now a situation where we have a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution. It was filed in that sense because had it been filed \nany other way there would be technical objections to it. So this is a \nso-called message amendment. It has no real impact. Even if it passed, \nit does not mean anything. But it is an attempt to embarrass people. It \nwas offered because people are very uncomfortable with the amendment \noffered by my friend from New Jersey.\n  The distinguished Senator from New Jersey has offered an amendment \nthat directs attention to some of the things that are going on with \nAmerican companies, saying their foreign subsidiaries should not be \nable to do business with terrorist organizations and countries that \nwork with terrorist organizations.\n  Mr. President, I was a lawyer. I am not ashamed, embarrassed, or \nconcerned that in the past I have taken cases on contingent fees. What \ndoes that mean? It means someone came to me, and they had no money to \nprosecute their own case, and they said: Mr. Reid, here is what has \nhappened to me.\n  I can give you a couple examples that come to my mind. I can remember \na woman by the name of Billie Robinson who came to me. I mentioned her \nname once before on this floor several months ago. Billie Robinson came \nto me. She was from Searchlight, NV, where I was born and raised. When \nshe came to see me, I did not know her. I, of course, had been gone \nfrom Searchlight since I was a little boy. But she knew my mother who \nlived in Searchlight.\n  She could not talk very well. I proceeded to visit with her, and her \nproblem was this: Billie Robinson had headaches, and she would come \nover to Searchlight to see various doctors. They told her: The only \nthing wrong with you, Billie, is you need to sober up. You are a drunk.\n  What they did not know and she tried to explain to these people is \nher headaches were so bad she drank a lot. By the time they realized, \nafter about a year and a half, that she was having headaches because \nshe had a tumor--they had misdiagnosed her condition--they operated. \nThat is when it affected her a lot. She was not the same person after \nthe surgery.\n  So she came to me and said: What should I do? So I represented her. I \ntook that case on a contingent fee. For every dollar I got for Billie \nRobinson, I got a third of it. That was a standard fee. It still is a \nfairly standard fee. I did not know if I was going to be able to \nrecover anything because when you go against doctors sometimes these \ncases are very complicated and involve expert witnesses. They fought \nthis case for a while. Finally, I was able to arrive at an agreement, \nand we settled the lawsuit for Billie Robinson. I got a third of what \nwe recovered.\n  Now, how much was I paid an hour? I really do not know. I was \nprobably paid pretty good by the hour. But it was a case that she had \nshopped around, and other people would not take her case. I took a \nchance. I advanced fees for Billie Robinson, and I got her enough money \nthat she led a comfortable life. She bought a new mobile home that she \nparked there in Searchlight. She had someone who could come in and help \nher. Now, does this Congress have the right to come in and say that the \nagreement she made with me was a bad deal, that I was paid too much \nmoney? I do not think so.\n\n  I remember a woman by the name of Joyce Martinez who came to see me. \nShe was a really nice woman. She had been all over town trying to find \na lawyer to take her case. This woman was a cocktail waitress at the \nHacienda Hotel on the Strip in Las Vegas. She was there in her little \nskimpy gown they have, serving drinks to people, and the Las Vegas \nPolice Department came and arrested her, took her off to jail because \nof her having written bad checks. She had not written any bad checks.\n  So I filed a lawsuit against Safeway Stores, and people, including \nthe judge, said: What are you doing taking our time on this case? I \ndemanded a jury. And I got a lot of money for Joyce Martinez. That was \non a contingent fee. I took a chance on that case, and I won the case. \nI was paid pretty good by the hour. I do not have any reservations \nabout having been paid a pretty good sum by the hour.\n  This Congress has no right in our free enterprise system to second-\nguess what Joyce Martinez did. What we are doing here is saying that \nattorneys, who entered into contracts to represent people--and \nsometimes not contracts, sometimes the State came in later and looked \nat the good works that they did--I do not know all the facts of this \ntobacco stuff, but I do know there were a number of lawyers, a handful \nof lawyers, in America who decided they would take on the tobacco \nindustry.\n  It took a lot of money to fight one of the biggest businesses in the \nworld, tobacco. And after many years, they won. It is a benefit to \neveryone in America that they won because now they cannot at will go \nout and solicit young children to smoke cigarettes and to become sick \nand addicted to tobacco. We owe those lawyers a debt of gratitude, not \nto say they are making too much money. Had it not been for those \nlawyers, we would still be having children openly and notoriously being \nattacked by advertising and other means to start smoking. That is what \nthey did. The lawsuits uncovered the fact that they knew how much \ntobacco was addictive, and they went after these children. These \nchildren now are dying of emphysema.\n  I don't know for sure, but Smarty Jones' owner, I will bet, was a big \nsmoker, and I bet he started as a kid. That is why you see him now \nbeing wheeled around and trying to breathe through that apparatus.\n  At my home in Searchlight, Fritz Hahn had a place there and watched \nmy home for 15 years. He started smoking as a teenager. He is dead now, \nhaving died within the past 6 weeks as a result of tobacco, cancer of \nthe throat. He suffered and suffered, and he is\n\n[[Page S5780]]\n\ndead. Now as a result of the work of these tobacco lawyers, there are \ngoing to be fewer Fritz Hahns in the world. I don't apologize for how \nmuch money these lawyers made. They did me, my children, my \ngrandchildren, and my children's children a favor.\n  I also believe the pending amendment is discriminatory, \nunprecedented, unconstitutional, and just plain bad policy. This \namendment endorses the idea that Congress should fix the rates \nattorneys are allowed to charge for providing services, not for \neverybody but certain types of clients. If a lawyer earns more than \nCongress allows, that person will have to pay back the extra or pay a \n200-percent penalty. A 200-percent tax on income is unprecedented in \nthis great Nation. Our Nation's tax system has never had this before. \nNever in the history of this Nation have we assessed a 200-percent tax \non income that is legally earned that I have heard of.\n  Justice Marshall said it best when, in the infancy of this country, \nhe declared the power to tax is the power to destroy. There could be no \nbetter illustration of that concept than this amendment.\n  In this Congress, my friends on the other side pay a lot of \nlipservice to the free market. But they don't like the free market very \nmuch now in this case with this amendment. First of all, this amendment \nwould interfere with legal private contracts just like the one I had \nwith Joyce Martinez, just like the one I had with Billy Robinson. Legal \nfees are not assessed taxes. They are not assessed out of the control \nof the clients. When someone wants to hire a lawyer, they can generally \nchoose from a variety of attorneys who will perform the necessary \nservices.\n  I gave two examples where these women couldn't find anybody else to \nrepresent them. I have taken a lot of cases, I am sorry to say--I am \nnot sorry to say, it is part of the system. I have taken cases where I \ndidn't get anything back, but I thought I was doing the right thing by \ntaking them. I can remember a case where a little girl stepped off a \nschoolbus and was hit by a car on Russell Road in Las Vegas. I tried \nthat case to a jury. I thought I deserved to win that case. I lost it. \nI felt bad about that. But that is what our free enterprise system is \nall about, the free market system.\n\n  This amendment would interfere with legal private contracts. Clients \ndon't have the power to negotiate rates with attorneys they retain all \nthe time. If a client feels a rate is unfair, there is nothing to \nprevent that client from taking the business elsewhere.\n  Beyond being bad policy, I oppose this amendment because it \nencourages constitutional taking of private property. By forcing \nattorneys to return their fees or suffer a 200-percent penalty without \nany semblance of legal process, this amendment demands these \nprofessionals simply hand over to others income they have lawfully \nearned.\n  There may be some who believe a tobacco lawyer earned too much money, \njust as I feel Reuben Mark made too much money, just as I feel George \nDavid made too much money, Richard Fuld made too much money, Henry \nSilverman made too much money, and Dwight Schar made too much money. \nBut it is not my right as a Member of this Congress to tell them they \ncan't make that much money.\n  It is no secret why Members of the other side of the aisle, in my \nopinion, are interested in passing this kind of amendment. This \namendment uses the Tax Code and the full power of big Government to \npunish one particular kind of lawyer, the kind who tries to protect \nconsumers from big corporations.\n  A Republican governor in the State of Nevada, Kenny Guinn, my friend, \nestablished what is called in Nevada the millennial scholarships, \ngiving scholarships to large numbers of children who have a B average \nwhen they graduate from high school. With what are those scholarships \npaid? Tobacco money. From where did the tobacco money come? From these \nlawyers who went to court and took a chance. That is where the money \ncomes from.\n  In Nevada, as in many other States, there are programs similar to \nthat. We are saying, what did these lawyers do to earn their money? Ask \na kid going to college in Nevada who wouldn't have the opportunity to \ngo to college but for Kenny Guinn's millennial scholarships.\n  These lawyers, the ones they are trying to castigate and punish here, \nare the lawyers who try to protect consumers from big corporations. \nThese tobacco companies are big corporations, and due to the lawyers \nthey are getting smaller all the time. The same people who want to cut \ntaxes for the wealthiest corporations in our country now want to impose \nan unprecedented 200-percent tax on attorneys who hold these powerful \ncompanies accountable when they cause injury to ordinary Americans and \ntheir families.\n  This amendment sets a terrible, horrible precedent that next we are \ngoing to be looking at these salaries. Next we are going to be looking \nat Freddie Adu's salary to see if he is making too much money or that \nman who plays baseball who is batting .210 and getting paid $18 million \na year.\n  If we look back, it is a dark chapter in the history of our Federal \nGovernment, but one of the articles of impeachment against President \nNixon dealt with his abusive and discriminatory use of tax laws to \nharass his political enemies. I don't compare this to that, but I think \nit is something that draws reference, that what we have here is an \neffort to punish and use discriminatory tax laws to harass someone you \ndon't like, the tobacco lawyers.\n  This is a bad amendment. I am confident people of goodwill will join \ntogether, Democrats and Republicans, and resoundingly defeat this very \nun-American amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to respond to the comments of my \nfriend from Nevada. He had five basic arguments. I think they could all \nbe dispensed with fairly quickly.\n  His first argument is there are a lot of people who make money in \nthis country, a lot of money, CEOs of businesses, sports figures, and \nothers who receive very large salaries. He wondered if there is any \ndifference between that and the tobacco lawyers who are billionaires \nbecause of the money they have made off the tobacco settlement. The \nanswer is, yes, there is a huge difference. The CEOs and the sports \nfigures are not fiduciaries. They are not in a trust relationship with \nthe people who pay their salary. A sports figure, for example, uses a \nrepresentative of the union and negotiates a fee with the baseball \nteam, and they do pretty well. But it is all a contract negotiation.\n  If George Steinbrenner is willing to take any New York Yankee player, \nwhatever he is willing to pay him, that is what he thinks he is worth, \nthat is what he brings in the gate, that player is not taking advantage \nof George Steinbrenner or the New York Yankee fans based upon any \nfiduciary responsibility.\n  It is the same thing with respect to the boards of directors who set \nthe salaries of CEOs of major corporations. What I quoted before from \nprofessors of law and others is that there is a special category of \npeople who are in a fiduciary relationship. I know my friend from \nNevada, as a good lawyer, knows this concept. Lawyers owe their clients \na very special duty, a duty far and above what normal contract law is. \nYou cannot take advantage of your client. Even if you can get your \nclient to sign an agreement regarding fees, that agreement will be \nthrown out of court if the court determines it is unfair.\n  That doesn't apply with the rich CEOs or the rich sports figures, but \nit applies in the case, for example, of lawyers, of fiduciaries who are \ntrustees of a trust.\n  That gets to the second argument--that this is unprecedented. No, it \nis not. I refer my colleague to section 4958 of the Tax Code. The \nsection deals with an intermediate sanctions tax on fiduciaries, \ntrustees who pay themselves too much money out of a trust. They are \nheld to a standard of a reasonable fee. If they exceed that fee, they \npay what? A 200-percent tax.\n  We got the idea from the Tax Code. We didn't make this up. It is not \nunprecedented. So our section follows that section; it is 4959. So \n4958, existing law, says if you are a fiduciary, a trustee, and you \ncharge your trust too much money for your salary so that the \nbeneficiary is being hurt and it is unfair, then you are going to pay a \n200-percent tax to the IRS unless, of course, you give the excessive \npart back and the tax is waived. That is the whole idea. We never \ncollect the 200-percent tax because nobody is foolish enough to take\n\n[[Page S5781]]\n\nthe money and pay twice as much back.\n  They just don't take the money in excess of what is fair. It is in \nthe code and it applies to fiduciaries, people in this special trust \nrelationship.\n  The third argument was that the tobacco settlement was good, and it \nis good. There were scholarships, and a lot of people benefited from \nit. What bothers me is the fact that lawyers benefited unreasonably \nfrom it--not all lawyers; a lot of tobacco lawyers did a lot of work \nand got paid a lot for it, but they put the work in. Others rode along \non the work of others and charged far in excess of what any reasonable \nfee would be.\n  That gets to the next argument. My friend from Nevada talked about \ncases he took on a contingency fee, a one-third fee. He is correct. \nThat is common for plaintiffs' lawyers. When they win, they get a third \nof the settlement. In many cases, that is a totally fair and reasonable \nfee. I know in the case of my colleague of Nevada, it was fair and \nreasonable because that is exactly the kind of person he is. If for \nsome reason it would not have been, the court would not have allowed it \nbecause of this special fiduciary relationship with his clients. The \ncourt would not have allowed it if it exceeded that amount. I am sure--\nand I would not ask my colleague--that none of those fees topped \n$20,000 an hour. That is the amount we have set forth in this bill.\n  Again, these are not my words. I will quote a couple of people. John \nCoale, who is a big tobacco industry opponent in Washington, DC, \ndenounced these fee awards as ``beyond human comprehension'' and stated \nthat ``the work does not justify them.''\n  The president of the organization to which these lawyers belong, the \nAssociation of American Trial Lawyers, said:\n\n       Common sense suggests that a $1 billion fee is excessive \n     and unreasonable and certainly should invite the scrutiny [of \n     the courts.]\n\n  The point is, a one-third contingency fee in a typical case is \nperfectly fine. But a one-third contingency fee in tobacco litigation--\nthe kind of reward these lawyers are receiving--is totally unreasonable \nby any standard, including that of the president of the organization to \nwhich these few lawyers belong. These lawyers have already received \nabout $4 billion in awards. None of that will be touched. They are \ngoing to get another $\\1/2\\ billion a year under the settlement.\n  All we are saying is that a reasonableness test has to apply, just as \nit does to other fiduciaries under the Tax Code. The excess refers to \nthe Treasury so we can pay for things the Defense Department needs.\n  Another argument was this would interfere with private contracts. No, \nit doesn't. It has no applicability between lawyers and clients--none. \nAll this applies to is this master settlement agreement that \nautomatically pays out a $\\1/2\\ billion in fees per year to these \nlawyers. It doesn't apply retroactively; it only applies if and when \nthe collection by the lawyer gets to the point that it represents more \nthan $20,000 an hour. These lawyers can be paid until the cows come \nhome at $19,999 an hour. But when the level finally gets to $20,000, we \nsay that is enough. Just as the Tax Code today makes the trustee pay \nthe rest of it back, we say the rest of it gets paid back. It doesn't \nhurt the plaintiffs at all. The plaintiffs have received what they are \ngoing to receive out of the settlement. It doesn't help the tobacco \ncompanies. They still have to pay the money. But the tax--in effect, \nthe money the tobacco companies pay goes partially to the trial \nlawyers, and the rest goes to the U.S. Treasury, rather than all of it \ngoing to the trial lawyers. So the tobacco lawyers get paid what is \nfair--more than fair--and the plaintiffs have already received their \nreward. The tobacco companies still have to pay what they had to pay \noriginally. The benefit is to the U.S. Treasury, Department of Defense, \nand the people we put in harm's way to carry out their missions.\n  The final argument made was one that I am not sure why it was made. \nMy colleague acknowledged he knew this wasn't my motivation. Since I \noffered the amendment, it is unclear whose motivation therefore it \nwould be--that it was a discriminatory tax policy to get at political \nenemies. This is what Nixon is alleged to have done. Of course, that is \nnot the case here. I don't even know who these people are. I could not \ngive you the name of one of them. I don't know how many there are. I \ndon't know their politics or anything else. All I know is what others \nhave said about them, which is that their fees are unconscionable, \nbeyond human comprehension, that the work doesn't justify them, that \nthe fees are excessive and unreasonable and should invite scrutiny, and \nso on and so on.\n  The question the law professor asked after going through the ethics \nrules about lawyers fees always having to be reasonable, the kind of \nfee contracts that my colleague from Nevada had with his clients--he \ngoes through that and says fees cannot be clearly excessive. The fees \nhave to be reasonable. Then he asked:\n\n       Are these fees, which in many cases amount to effective \nhourly rates of return of tens of thousands--and even hundreds of \nthousands--of dollars an hour, reasonable? I think to ask the question \nis to answer it.\n\n  At the end of the day, the arguments raised against this amendment, \nfrankly, are all fallacious. There is no relationship to CEOs or other \npeople who make a lot of money. They don't have the same fiduciary \nrelationship that a lawyer has to his client. A one-third contingency \nfee is a good thing. We all stipulate to that. But it still cannot be \nunreasonable.\n  In this case, the amounts are so egregious that they go far beyond \nwhat the Senator from Nevada was talking about. Unprecedented? No. It \nis in the Tax Code today--the same 200-percent tax, the same \napplication to the fiduciaries who charge more than reasonable fees.\n  By the way, that also applies to another kind of fiduciaries--these \nparticular tobacco lawyers. It would not interfere with other private \ncontracts. By its terms, it doesn't apply to that.\n  I think the bottom line here is that we are faced with the same \nchoice we had before. We have an opportunity to generate some funds to \npay for the things our troops need. We are on the Defense authorization \nbill. We are trying to authorize a lot of programs. Eventually, we are \ngoing to have to appropriate money for them. This amendment provides \nadditional funds of, by my calculation, something on the order of about \n$9 billion, that we can apply toward the acquisition of this important \nequipment and the other things needed in our Defense bill.\n  I suggest we need to give that stuff to our troops, that this is a \nway to pay for it, and that we have the added benefit of conforming our \nTax Code to a situation here that is totally unreasonable and \nunconscionable, in the words of many, and that is that some of the \ntobacco lawyers are reaping a windfall.\n  Money that is paid by the tobacco companies instead would be paid to \nthe Treasury because it is far in excess of what is a reasonable fee. \nWe have said, OK, we will not limit it at $2,000. Some people said a \nreasonable fee might be more than that. We said, how about $10,000 an \nhour? No, that might be a reasonable fee someplace. We said $20,000. I \nhave not found anybody who can come on this floor and say to me that a \nlegal fee, even in this case, of $20,000 an hour for all of these hours \nof work is reasonable and will meet the laugh test or the \nreasonableness test, which is the test all lawyers must meet and the \ntest of the IRS Code with respect to fiduciary duties in the trustee \ncontext.\n\n  It seems to me we have a great opportunity to help our troops. We are \nnot hurting anybody by this amendment. I do not even think we can argue \nwe are hurting these billionaire lawyers. I think it would be hard for \nthem to spend all they have, and the little bit they are going to be \ndenied here can do a whole lot more good in equipment in the hands of \nour troops. They cannot justify those fees coming to them in a \nprospective way under the settlement agreement they are taking \nadvantage of today.\n  This is the amendment we will vote on first. I urge my colleagues to \nvote for it.\n  Then I urge my colleagues to vote against the underlying Lautenberg \namendment. The easiest way to summarize the Lautenberg amendment--the \nSenator from New Jersey presented photographs and told some very \ndisheartening stories of people who had been taken advantage of by \nother countries that harbor terrorists and that\n\n[[Page S5782]]\n\nthe United States does not consider places where American companies \nshould do business.\n  I totally agree with the Senator from New Jersey. We need to have a \nprovision for sanctions in a case such as that. If it were not for the \nfact we already have one, I would be supportive of the Senator's \namendment. But we do already have a provision. It is being applied by \nthe President of the United States.\n  The point I tried to make earlier is that--and I am sure he did not \nmean to do it this way, but the language of the amendment of the \nSenator from New Jersey is even more restrictive than current law \nbecause it talks about ownership and control and defines it as at least \n50 percent when, in fact, you can keep the ownership under the 50 \npercent and still have effective control of the corporation.\n  In the case of the application of sanctions the way the President \ndoes it, he takes into account both factors so that a company that \nkeeps the ownership at that level, under 50 percent, is not at all \nexempt from the application of sanctions imposed by the President of \nthe United States because we also take into account the element of \ncontrol.\n  The Treasury Department and the State Department oppose the \nLautenberg amendment because it restricts the President's authority in \nways it is not restricted today.\n  If there are any situations in which we need to apply these sanctions \nto countries where they are not applied today, I am perfectly willing \nto discuss that with anybody and urge the administration to do so. We \nhave the authority today. The President is utilizing it. It does not \nseem to me, therefore, that the amendment of the Senator from New \nJersey should be supported.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Kyl amendment, which will be \nvoted on first, and oppose the Lautenberg amendment. That vote, I \nunderstand, will begin at 5:30 this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada, the Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Levin is in the Chamber. I asked \nthat he allow me to speak again, which he indicated he will.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am happy to yield time to the Senator \nfrom Nevada. I do not know if we have other speakers. How much time \nremains?\n  Mr. REID. There is 32 minutes left; is that right, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, will the Senator from Nevada yield for a \nquestion? Is there a division of time for both sides? Has the Chair \nannounced how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 8 minutes remaining on the majority \nside; 31\\1/2\\ minutes on the minority side.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, a great book, certainly a classic, was \nwritten in 1776 by Adam Smith called ``The Wealth Of Nations.'' This \nwas the first time it was put down on paper that someone understood, \nfrom an economist's point of view, what the free enterprise system was \nand could be, and that is the basis for our country, this free \nenterprise system we hear so much about, capitalism, free markets. That \nis, in effect, what this debate is all about.\n  It is about free markets; what people have the right to do and not \ndo. We have given an illustration of baseball players and other court \ncases. The top 10 executives, as far as compensation in 2003, made \nabout $14.6 million a month. That is what they made. I think my math is \nright. No, the top 10 executives made last year about $600 million. \nThat is a whole lot of money, as we know. Is that too much money, more \nthan half a billion dollars for the top 10 corporate executives in \nAmerica to make?\n  As I said before, I think so, but what right do I have to go to \nNevada businesspeople--take, for example, the MGM corporation. MGM \ncorporation, the vast majority of stock is owned by one of my former \nclients, Kirk Kerkorian, a great businessman, a wonderful human being. \nI have no idea how much Kirk Kerkorian makes, but he does not pay \nhimself much money. He drives a relatively small car. He has a few \nthings that appear to be luxurious, but not too many. He pays his \ncorporate executives lots of money. Why? Because they deserve it.\n  His No. 1 executive is a man by the name of Terry Lanny. Terry Lanny \nmakes lots of money. According to the figures here, he did not make the \ntop 10, but he is way up at the top. Why? Because the marketplace \nindicates that is what Terry Lanny is worth. It is no different than \nthese lawyers. Terry Lanny has a contract. I have not seen it, but it \ncalls for compensation today, next year, and I am sure years after \nthat. If he left today, Kirk Kerkorian's company would keep paying him \ndeferred compensation. That is what it is all about. That is what these \nlawyers have. We have no right to interfere.\n  We are talking about some law professor. I have the highest respect \nfor law professors, but they are some of the most underpaid people in \nAmerica, and I bet they are so jealous of people making money that they \ncould hardly wait to run to tell somebody they are being paid too much. \nWindfall--anything to a law professor is a windfall. So I am not \nimpressed with a law professor saying some lawyer is making too much \nmoney.\n\n  What I would like to say is that law professor should be out seeing \nhow much money he can make, but I am not going to say that. What he is \ndoing is second-guessing what the free market does.\n  I understand the examples my friend from Arizona has given, how he \nthinks my argument is distinctive from the facts, but I think it is \npretty clear what I am talking about, the points I have made.\n  The example he has given with the fiduciary trust relationship is a \ntotally different situation. The distinguished Presiding Officer is a \nlawyer who is certainly qualified to discuss legal matters, having been \nthe attorney general of one of the most populated States in America. We \nknow problems arise with people who have trust agreements. Many of them \nare not lawyers, and there has to be some control set because they do \nhave a fiduciary relationship. Many of the people they represent are \nbabes in the woods, so to speak, and there has to be some oversight \nthere, and I agree with that. But I am not here to say corporate \nexecutives make too much money, or, I repeat, ballplayers make too much \nmoney, and lawyers make too much money. I think we should let the \nmarket control this situation.\n  I hope this Congress, which talks so much about our capitalistic form \nof Government, this Senate which talks about it, I hope they will put \ntheir votes where their mouths have been in the past.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the time run against \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished Senator from \nNevada, Mr. Ensign, be allowed to speak as in morning business and the \ntime that he uses run equally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Nevada.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I rise to speak for a few minutes about \nthe men and women in uniform who are serving this Nation in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and around the world.\n  I know the recent news has focused on the actions of a few of our \nservice men and women, but I rise today because they truly are the \nexception.\n  I want to thank the members of our armed services who continue to \nexhibit extraordinary bravery, integrity, and commitment. I want to \nremind them we are grateful for them each and every day as they defend \nour freedom and our security.\n  My State of Nevada is proud and blessed to have many sons and \ndaughters among the ranks of those on the front lines of our war on \nterrorism, people such as Jon Carpenter. Jon Carpenter is a 42-year-old \nmarine reservist on his second tour in Iraq. Back in Las Vegas he has a \nwife and five children, and a proud community.\n\n[[Page S5783]]\n\n  Jon wrote a letter earlier this year to his friends and family \nexplaining why he would return to Iraq with the First Marine Division.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Why is Jon going back to Iraq?\n       It is a question my wife and I have heard from quite a few \n     people recently after announcing that I am getting orders to \n     return to Iraq with the 1st Marine Division.\n       Some have asked with a quizzical tone, assuming that I had \n     already done my duty for the country with my first trip to \n     Iraq last spring.\n       Some have asked with expressed concern that I have a good \n     wife, five good kids, a good church and a good job here at \n     home that all need me, and that I should let the younger men \n     and women run off to war and serve their country.\n       When people ask why I am going back to Iraq, I say \n     ``Because the country has asked.''\n       Our country is at war, and even though the battlefields are \n     different than those of WWII, the dangers of not winning this \n     war are at least as great as those of our country's previous \n     wars.\n       It is very easy to forget that we are at war, due to the \n     level of prosperity we have here and the lack of terrorists \n     attacks we have had since the beginning of this war on \n     terror. But we are at war, and during times of war, men and \n     women must make sacrifices.\n       I look at the sacrifices that our fellow countrymen have \n     made during the world wars; and my previous deployments pale \n     in comparison.\n       When people ask why I am going back to war, to fight on \n     foreign soil, to prevent the war from being fought on our \n     soil, endangering my family and friends, I say, ``Because I \n     can.''\n       The next question is usually, ``What will Jon be doing \n     there?''\n       I will be deployed with 1st Marine Division (Forward), when \n     they go back to an area near Baghdad. I will be part of the \n     Government Support Team, and assigned to the Police Training \n     team, responsible for retraining the Iraqi Police to retake \n     control of law enforcement functions and maintaining the \n     peace.\n       The next question is usually ``How can we help you or your \n     family?''\n       I usually say to pray regularly for my wife, family and I, \n     and to be supportive of the President and his policies in \n     Iraq. Both of these are extremely important, especially in \n     light of the relentless attack on the President, during a \n     time of war, by our country's own extremist citizens; i.e. \n     the liberals and media elite who hate that another socialist \n     country has fallen (Iraq), and that conservatives can take \n     credit for the tremendous successes we have had in the war on \n     terrorism.\n       From experience, I can tell you how demoralizing all of the \n     criticism of the military and the dissension in the country \n     is on the troops in Iraq. It also encourages the radical \n     criminals and terrorists we are fighting over there to \n     continue fighting in hopes we will pull out.\n       We are doing the right thing there, we are winning, and the \n     majority of the Iraqi citizens truly appreciate what we are \n     doing for them.\n       So, thank you for your past support and thank you for your \n     future support of this next mission in Iraq.\n       Sincerely--Jon Carpenter.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. He states:\n\n       When people ask why I am going back to Iraq, I say, \n     ``Because the country has asked.'' Our country is at war, and \n     even though battlefields are different than those of WWI, the \n     dangers of not winning this war are at least as great as \n     those of our country's previous wars.\n\n  He continues on to write:\n\n       But we are at war, and during times of war, men and women \n     must make sacrifices.\n\n  Jon was wounded a few weeks ago when he was shot through the neck. He \nhas recovered now, pinned with a Purple Heart, has returned to his work \ntraining Iraqi police officers. Actually, he could not wait to get back \nto his fellow troops.\n  It is commendably common for our wounded troops to return to the \nfront lines when given the option. That is because they are focused on \nthe mission and determined to get the job done.\n  Army PFC Sean Freeman, Sparks, NV, is another example of a determined \nsoldier. He was wounded in a June 22 ambush last year in Baghdad where \nhe was stationed as an artillery crewman. Sean suffered back, shoulder, \nand arm wounds and is stationed in Germany while he recovers. He is \nmotivated to do so, so he can return to Iraq.\n  The stories of bravery and heroism are truly inspiring and there is \nno shortage.\n  Dr. Thom Merry in Douglas County, NV, volunteered for duty in Iraq as \na flight surgeon and has since been decorated with a Bronze Star for \nentering a minefield, without regard for his own personal safety, to \nrescue a severely injured marine.\n  TSgt William Kudzia, stationed at Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas, \nwas engaged in ground operations against an opposing armed force in \nIraq and hand-excavated 226,000 pounds of high explosive bombs buried \nby fleeing Iraqi forces.\n  With disregard for his own personal safety, he hand-removed a burning \nprojectile, saving the lives of his team members and averting a \ncatastrophic detonation. He was also awarded the Bronze Star with \nValor.\n  As brave as our men and women are, I think there is an equal amount \nof emotional bravery exhibited by the spouses, parents, and children \nleft behind to wait for their loved one's safe return. Nevada Highway \nPatrol Trooper SGT Jim Olschlager's son, James Jr., is on an aircraft \ncarrier. His daughter Laurie is in the Army and will be sent to Iraq in \nSeptember, and his son-in-law Kendall is currently serving in Karbala, \nnear Baghdad.\n  In Fallon, NV, Juanita and Kevin Porteous got to visit with their son \nJon for only a few days before his leave was cut short and he had to \nreturn to Iraq. I had looked forward to meeting and thanking Jon on a \nrecent trip to Fallon, but was honored to deliver my appreciation via \nhis parents. They are extremely proud of him, but that does not make \nthe waiting or the worrying any easier.\n  My prayers are with the Olschlager and Porteous families and every \nother family which is anxiously awaiting the return of a loved one. We \nall thank them for the sacrifices they have made to keep this Nation \nsafe. The men and women of our Armed Forces are truly defending our \nsecurity. Our missions in Iraq and Afghanistan are critical to the \ncontinued ability to fight terrorism on foreign soil rather than on our \nshores.\n  Make no mistake about it, a war on our homeland would be devastating. \nThat is why it is so important for us to continue steadfastly \nsupporting our troops. Although we cherish our freedom of speech and \nthe opportunity to debate, our united voice of support is essential if \nwe want our troops to continue giving 110 percent to the mission.\n  It is easy to pretend what we as elected officials say is not heard \nby the men and women on the front lines, or for that matter by our \nenemies, but listen to what Jon Carpenter, the marine I talked about \nearlier, wrote before heading back to Iraq:\n\n       From experience, I can tell you how demoralizing all the \n     criticism of the military and the dissension in the country \n     is on the troops in Iraq. It also encourages the radical \n     criminals and terrorists we are fighting over there to \n     continue fighting in hopes we will pull out. We are doing the \n     right thing there, we are winning, and the majority of the \n     Iraqi citizens truly appreciate what we are doing for them.\n\n  God bless Jon Carpenter and all of the men and women who are willing \nto lay their lives down for this Nation. Our prayers are with you and \nyour families. God bless America, truly the home of the brave.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to express my unwavering support \nfor the men and women who wear this country's uniform and who are so \nbravely serving in dangerous areas throughout the world on our behalf. \nI have strongly supported and will continue to strongly support efforts \nto ensure that these courageous men and women continue to receive all \nof the resources they need to perform their duties. This is a serious \nissue that deserves serious focus. It should not be a part of gimmickry \nor a political sideshow and for that reason I oppose the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Senator Kyl has offered an amendment \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that an excise tax should be imposed \non any lawyer's contingency fees in tobacco cases when those fees \nexceed the equivalent of $20,000 per hour.\n  I oppose this amendment because it singles out only one group of \npeople who will be subjected to a government-\n\n[[Page S5784]]\n\nimposed salary cap--lawyers who go after the tobacco companies.\n  The Kyl amendment does not apply to the CEO of Halliburton or Enron. \nIt does not apply to the CEO of an HMO or a drug company. It does not \neven apply to lawyers who defend tobacco companies.\n  I would be happy to consider a fair and balanced amendment. But this \none-sided amendment that goes after lawyers because they go after the \ntobacco companies should be defeated.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I understand the vote is set for 5:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I see the distinguished Senator from Alabama, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, how much time is left on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time left on the majority side. \nThere is 3\\1/2\\ minutes left on the minority side.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, is the Senator from Alabama speaking in \nopposition or in support of the amendment?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I am speaking in opposition to the Lautenberg amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There is a chance Senator Lautenberg may be returning. If \nso, he would have wanted time. I have no problem agreeing to that.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. If Senator Lautenberg wants to come, he can come.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We ask unanimous consent, if Senator Lautenberg does \nreturn after Senator Shelby is finished, that Senator Lautenberg be \nrecognized for 3 minutes immediately prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the motion \nto table the amendment of the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg.\n  As chairman of the Banking Committee which has jurisdiction over \nlegislation pertaining to U.S. economic sanctions, I am more than a \nlittle familiar with the issue addressed by the amendment of the \nSenator from New Jersey. While his intent may be laudatory, the \nlanguage of his amendment and the manner in which it has been proposed \nare not.\n  There is a reason all administrations oppose legislation such as this \namendment. Not only do they argue that it infringes on their \nconstitutional right to conduct foreign policy--an argument we \nadmittedly employ or ignore as the need arises--but, more importantly, \nthe White House invariably recognizes the potential for the law of \nunintended consequences to come into play. There has been no \nopportunity for those consequences to be considered in a truly \ndeliberative manner because the legislation has not been brought before \nthe Banking Committee for any type of hearing.\n  I take a backseat to no Member in this body in my support of strong \neconomic sanctions as a vital tool in our foreign policy and national \nsecurity arsenal, and I have been a strong advocate of closing \nloopholes that weaken those sanctions. My support for the Helms-Burton \nlegislation was a case in point.\n  In addition, as one of the few Members of the Senate who opposes \nweakening the Government's ability to prevent the flow of military-\nsensitive technologies to countries with poor records in the areas of \nproliferation and support for terrorists, I believe my credentials in \nthis area are quite strong.\n  The intent, as I understand it, behind the amendment of the Senator \nfrom New Jersey is certainly meritorious. We all support the war \nagainst terrorism and the need to staunch the flow of dollars to \nterrorist organizations. Under my chairmanship, the Banking Committee \nhas been investigating the issue of terrorist financing for over a \nyear, and has additional hearings scheduled on the subject in the weeks \nahead.\n  We are taking this issue very seriously. We are examining the \nstructure of the Federal Government to stem the flow of dollars to \nterrorist organizations. We work very closely with the Treasury \nDepartment Office of Foreign Assets and Control which is the \nGovernment's vehicle for enforcing U.S. economic sanctions to further \nprevent these organizations from gaining access to sources of revenue \nwith which to fund their operation. OFAC, the Federal office \nresponsible for enforcing sanctions, opposes the Lautenberg \nlegislation.\n  I stand ready to work with the Senator from New Jersey to ensure U.S. \neconomic sanctions have the requisite team to accomplish the objective \nfor which they are imposed. But this amendment is not the way to go.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the motion to table.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that after we vote on the Kyl \namendment, there be 4 minutes equally divided prior to the vote on the \nLautenberg amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, I will not object, but \nthat does not preclude a motion to table.\n  Mr. REID. That is right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment offered by Senator Kyl, \nas modified.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3151\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Parliamentary inquiry, Madam President: Is not the \nLautenberg amendment the pending amendment?\n\n[[Page S5785]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 4 minutes equally divided prior to \nthe vote on the amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think Senator Lautenberg has 2 minutes, and Senator Kyl \nhas 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues please to permit \nus to have order in the Senate. We don't have much time to talk about \nthis. I would appreciate the opportunity to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, please try to help us maintain order.\n  This is very quick, very simple. My amendment is straightforward. \nCurrent sanctions law has a loophole that permits foreign subsidiaries \nof U.S. companies to do business with nations that sponsor terrorism, \nsuch as Iraq. My amendment closes the loophole. It is that simple. It \nonly applies to foreign subsidiaries in which U.S. parent companies \nhave a majority interest.\n  The question is, do we want U.S. companies to sell oilfield equipment \nthrough a sham foreign subsidiary to a country such as Iran--which the \nPresident has rightly called the axis of evil--so Iran can sell its oil \nat greater profits and funnel those profits to Hezbollah, Hamas, or \nIslamic Jihad, terrorist groups that killed 240 marines in Beirut, \nLebanon.\n  These two young women in this photo, from New Jersey and New \nHampshire, were killed in Israel by terrorist activities sponsored by \nIran. It is very simple. The amendment says: Are you with us or against \nus? If you are with us and want them to stop killing our kids in Iraq, \nthen you have to stand up and say, yes, this amendment counts, and, \nyes, we want to close this loophole. We just had a vote relating \nsomewhat to my amendment. I hope my colleagues will stand up and say \nclose the door.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield our time to Senator Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the State Department and Treasury Department \nstrongly oppose this amendment because it is more restrictive than the \ncurrent authority exercised by the President under IEEPA. The amendment \nwould focus solely on ownership, which is a standard that can easily be \ncircumvented and would be less effective than the administration's \napproach, which applies not only to ownership but also to control.\n  It is very easy for a company to get just under 50-percent ownership \nbut still control the subsidiary. Under the Senator's amendment, no \nsanction would be permitted in that circumstance. So rather than \nbroadening the authority and making it more capable of adding sanctions \nto what we already have, it would actually restrict the authority the \nPresident currently has.\n  That is why both Treasury and the State Department say let the \nPresident exert the current authority he has, which is broader. It is \nnot a choice between helping people such as the Senator alluded to. \nThis President is applying sanctions in those countries precisely where \nthis condition exists.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Lautenberg amendment and \ndon't weaken the provisions already existing. Allow the President the \nflexibility he needs.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

But I \nwant everybody to remember that this vote that was just taken said it \nis all right to do business with Iran. Look at the list of the dead and \nmissing and see whether it is all right to vote for companies that sell \nto Iran. When we had a chance to close the loophole, the party lines \nwere clear. No, stick with the companies. Forget about those who are \nserving in Iraq. Forget about those kids who want to come home in one \npiece. That is the kind of vote that just took place, and I hope the \nconstituents back home will note it and remember it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Michigan, \nthe ranking member on the committee, Mr. Levin, and I will momentarily \nprocess a number of agreed-upon amendments.

Mr. President, it's difficult to imagine a subject that is \nmore obscure and more arcane than the federal procurement process. At \ntimes, it seems as though an impenetrable fog hangs over government \ncontractors, clouding the process by which taxpayer funds are awarded \nand spent.\n  Nowhere is the issue of federal procurement more clouded, more \nobscured from public scrutiny than in the Defense Department.\n  What little information makes it into the mainstream media usually \nreinforces the worst cliches about government waste. The stories are \nfamiliar. We have all heard them. They are a grotesque litany of \nnegligence and greed.\n  We read that the Pentagon has awarded billions of dollars to a \ncontractor to produce a new supersonic stealth fighter. Twenty aircraft \ncome off the production line and hundreds more are planned--only then \ndo we find out that nobody has tested the new fighter to see if it \nactually works.\n  We read of how a contractor has charged the Federal Government for \nproducts and services never provided, and then of how the government \nmust engage in lengthy, costly efforts to get the taxpayers' money \nback.\n  And then there is the over-billing.\n  We read about Defense Department officials who must wrestle with \ncontractors over inflated pricing of spare parts. A disputed bill for \nairplane parts in 1999 includes: $2,522 for a 4\\1/2\\-inch metal sleeve, \n$744 for a washer, $714 for a rivet, and $5,217 for a 1-inch metal \nbracket.\n  Whatever the excuses--and I am sure there are legions of them--it is \nunfathomable to me that, year after year, administration after \nadministration, our Government continues to endure the waste of \nbillions and billions of taxpayer dollars on incompetent and negligent \ndefense contractors who continually fail to deliver products and \nservices on time and at a cost commensurate with what they promised.\n  Even with our troops overseas in Iraq--where, in too many cases, some \nof their most basic needs for armor and food are going unaddressed--the \nDefense Department continues to tolerate enormous waste from its \ncontractors. Not enough questions asked, not enough accountability \nrequired.\n  In March, the new inspector general of the U.S.-led authority in \nIraq, with\n\n[[Page S5788]]\n\ncolossal understatement, identified ``improper procedures and limited \ncompetition'' as ``issues of concern'' with regard to contractors in \nIraq.\n  The Inspector General reported only 20 percent of the 1,500 contracts \nawarded last fiscal year--about $2 billion of the $10 billion in \ntaxpayer funds awarded to defense contractors in Iraq--has been awarded \nthrough full and open competition.\n  The Inspector General noted that the Defense Contract Audit Agency \nhas issued more than 187 audit reports related to nearly $7 billion in \nreconstruction work. These audits have found $133 million in \nquestionable costs and $307 million in unsupported costs and have led \nto $176.5 million in suspended billings.\n  The Inspector General reported that the Defense Criminal \nInvestigative Service has opened four bribery and corruption cases, \nfour theft cases, two false claims cases, three weapons recovery cases, \nfour counterfeit cases, and one conflict of interest case.\n  The Inspector General's report is the tip of an enormous and largely \nhidden iceberg. The Defense Department's contract oversight system is a \nsloppy, incomprehensible mess, and it has left the Defense Department \nwith the unfortunate reputation of ignoring contractor rip-offs.\n  Procurement managers must be held accountable. Agency heads must be \nheld accountable. Contracting officers must be held accountable. And, \nyet, they are not. The abuse and waste of the taxpayers' dollars is \nsomehow allowed to continue.\n  The problem is attributable, in part, to the draconian staff cuts in \nthe federal acquisition workforce. These are the civil servants who \nanalyze proposed prices on bids, who keep tabs on cost overruns, who \ncommit contractual fine print to memory so they can make sure \nrequirements and standards are met. Since 1989, the number of these \ncivil servants has been cut in half--one of the most dramatic \nreductions in the entire federal workforce since the end of the cold \nwar.\n  Meanwhile, as procurement and contract oversight staffs have been \nshrinking, Defense's contracting activity has soared. It is now routine \nfor the Pentagon to award multi-billion dollar contracts for logistics \nsupport for an entire weapon system or a host of support services for \nU.S. troops deployed in an overseas operation. These are the contracts \nthe American public reads about most in the newspapers, where companies \nare alleged to have overcharged the taxpayers for fuel and meals \nsupplied to U.S. troops in Iraq.\n  The Pentagon's Inspector General has rightly urged more vigilance by \nDefense auditors. But the Defense Department hasn't the staff or the \nresources to do it. Understaffed auditing agencies must pick and choose \nwhere to focus their resources. Likewise, the Congress remains woefully \nunprepared to oversee how taxpayer funds are being spent on defense \ncontracts in Iraq and elsewhere. Congressional committees, along with \nthe Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Inspector Generals' offices, and \nthe Justice Department, do catch abuses, but not all of them.\n  All of this makes it increasingly tempting for companies to inflate \ntheir prices and to hide the real costs behind impenetrable contractual \njargon.\n  Contractors have no incentive to contain costs. The more a contractor \nbills, the more money the contractor makes.\n  This is the dark side of acquisition. For all of the benefits and \ncontributions provided by defense contractors--and there have been many \ncontributions over the years--the lack of oversight makes it impossible \nfor any Member of Congress to vote for additional defense dollars and \nhonestly tell their constituents that those taxpayer funds will be well \nspent.\n  Every acquisition dollar frittered away on negligent contractors is \none less taxpayer dollar available to support our troops. It is one \nmore dollar that will be taken from our domestic needs here at home.\n  The American people should demand more from their Congress. They \nshould demand better from their President.\n  We are asking men and women to make the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq \nand around the world. The food that nourishes them and the armor that \nshields them should not provide a blank check for avarice and \nimprudence.\n  I intend to offer an amendment that would require the Secretary of \nDefense to increase the size of the Pentagon's acquisition workforce. \nUnder my amendment, the Secretary of Defense would be allowed to waive \nthis required increase, but only if the Secretary can certify to the \nCongress that such an increase in the workforce would not yield \nsufficient savings to offset the cost of the additional personnel.\n  I recognize that the scope of the problems with the Pentagon's \nprocurement system is larger than this amendment.\n  Gross waste, negligent oversight, and rampant abuse are embedded deep \nwithin our federal procurement system.\n  The procurement abuses that have been widely reported in Iraq--the \nallegations of favoritism, the lack of oversight, the fraudulent \ncharges, the rampant waste--are common to other departments and \nagencies of the federal government.\n  Recently, far too much of the contracting debate has focused on \nindividual agencies or individual contracts being negotiated by the \nadministration. Many of them are important, but we also need to look at \nthe bigger picture of what is wrong with the overall procurement \nprocess.\n  What is needed are comprehensive hearings by the Committees with \njurisdiction, primarily the Senate Governmental Affairs and the Armed \nServices Committees, to identify the most serious problems and to make \nrecommendations to fix them. Extensive hearings are needed not only to \neducate the Congress, but also the American public about the waste in \nthe procurement system and the statutory changes needed to address \nthem.\n  Comprehensive legislation should be reported to the full Senate, \nwhich should take the time necessary to debate the bill and to consider \namendments.\n  It will require an enormous effort. It will require skilled \nlegislators with an adroit understanding of the issues. At the end of \nthe day, the procurement system should be transparent and open to \npublic scrutiny and understanding it. In the meantime, I offer my \namendment to help the administration better oversee the defense \ncontractors it employs.\n  Each year, the Congress appropriates billions of taxpayer dollars to \nfederal agencies to pay federal contractors with little means of ever \nfully accounting for how those funds are spent. Staff must be properly \ntrained. Resources must be provided. Contractors must be held \naccountable to make sure they do their job right.\n  This is a common sense approach to a problem that has been ignored \nfor far too long.\n  I urge the adoption of my amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER.

LAND EXCHANGE, NAVAL AIR STATION, PATUXENT RIVER, \n                   MARYLAND.\n\n       (a) Conveyance Authorized.--The Secretary of the Navy may \n     convey to the State of Maryland (in this section referred to \n     as ``State''), all right, title, and interest of the United \n     States in and to a parcel of real property, including \n     improvements thereon, consisting of approximately five acres \n     at Naval Air Station, Patuxent River, Maryland, and \n     containing the Point Lookout Lighthouse, other structures \n     related to the lighthouse, and an archaeological site \n     pertaining to the military hospital that was located on the \n     property during the Civil War. The conveyance shall include \n     artifacts pertaining to the military hospital recovered by \n     the Navy and held at the installation.\n       (b) Property Received in Exchange.--As consideration for \n     the conveyance of the real property under subsection (a), the \n     State shall convey to the United States a parcel of real \n     property consisting of approximately five acres located in \n     Point Lookout State Park, St. Mary's County, Maryland.\n       (c) Payment of Costs of Conveyance.--(1) The Secretary may \n     require the State to cover costs to be incurred by the \n     Secretary, or to reimburse the Secretary for costs incurred \n     by the Secretary, to carry out the conveyance under \n     subsection (a), including survey costs, costs related to \n     environmental documentation, relocation expenses incurred \n     under subsection (b), and other administrative costs related \n     to the conveyance. If amounts are collected from the State in \n     advance of the Secretary incurring the actual costs, and the \n     amount collected exceeds the costs actually incurred by the \n     Secretary to carry out the conveyance, the Secretary shall \n     refund the excess amount to State.\n       (2) Amounts received as reimbursement under paragraph (1) \n     shall be credited to the fund or account that was used to \n     cover the costs incurred by the Secretary in carrying out the \n     conveyance. Amounts so credited shall be merged with amounts \n     in such fund or account, and shall be available for the same \n     purposes, and subject to the same conditions and limitations, \n     as amounts in such fund or account.\n       (d) Description of Property.--The exact acreage and legal \n     description of the properties to be conveyed under this \n     section shall be determined by surveys satisfactory to the \n     Secretary.\n       (e) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The Secretary may \n     require such additional terms and conditions in connection \n     with the conveyances under this section as the Secretary \n     considers appropriate to protect the interests of the United \n     States.\n\n                             Amendment 3215\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this amendment would authorize a land \nexchange between the State of Maryland and the Naval Air Station, \nPatuxent River.\n  Specifically, the amendment directs the Secretary of the Navy to \nconvey approximately 5 acres, including the Point Lookout Lighthouse \nand related facilities, as well as an archaeological site and recovered \nartifacts pertaining to the military hospital located on the property \nduring the Civil War. In exchange, the State of Maryland would transfer \na similar parcel to the Navy for the location of the new tracking \nstation.\n  At present, the Navy's Range Theodolite Tracking System is located on \nan historic parcel at the edge of Point Lookout State Park in St. \nMary's County, Maryland. Navy Range Operations operates and maintains \nsupport facilities in historically significant structures formerly \nassociated with the operation Point Lookout Lighthouse. These \nfacilities, which date to the 19th century, now house radio relay, \nrange surveillance radar, and a Remote Emitter System, all of which are \ncontrolled at Cedar Point via fiber optic link. Over the years, the \nfacilities have deteriorated and can no longer meet the critical needs \nof the Navy.\n  This amendment has the support of both the Navy and the State of \nMaryland. In fact, last year, the State made available $450,000 for the \npreservation and restoration of the lighthouse so that it might be \nincorporated into the park and open for public use.\n  In my view, this amendment represents a real win-win for both the \nNavy and the people of the State of Maryland. This transfer will \nultimately result in overall cost-savings for the Navy--and the \npreservation of the structures and the historic site.\n  I am pleased that Senator Mikulski has joined me in cosponsoring the \namendment. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting its adoption.\n  Mr. WARNER. We accept on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3215) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3165\n\n  Mr. WARNER. This is our final amendment. I offer an amendment on \nbehalf of Senator Coleman, which would direct the Secretary of Defense \nto carry out a study on feasibility of the use of Camp Ripley National \nGuard Training Center in Minnesota as a mobilization station for \nReserve components ordered to active duty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for Mr. Coleman, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3165.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require a study of establishment of mobilization station \nat Camp Ripley National Guard Training Center, Little Falls, Minnesota)\n\n       On page 247, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1022. STUDY OF ESTABLISHMENT OF MOBILIZATION STATION AT \n                   CAMP RIPLEY NATIONAL GUARD TRAINING CENTER, \n                   LITTLE FALLS, MINNESOTA.\n\n       Not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall carry out and \n     complete a study on the feasibility of the use of Camp Ripley \n     National Guard Training Center, Little Falls, Minnesota, as a \n     mobilization station for reserve components ordered to active \n     duty under provisions of law referred to in section \n     101(a)(13)(B) of title 10, United States Code.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \namendment offered by Senators Dorgan, Lott, Feinstein and myself to \nrefocus the provisions in the Fiscal Year 2002 Defense Authorization \nBill that authorizes a base closure round in 2005 from our domestic \ninstallations to our overseas military infrastructure. I do so because \nI am firmly convinced that today, in this unprecedented era of our \nglobal war on terrorism, as we continue operations in Afghanistan to \nroot out the seeds of terror, as we are engaged in ensuring a free Iraq \nin the heart of the Middle East, it makes no sense to consider closing \nnearly a quarter of our domestic military infrastructure in addition to \nthe 21 percent already lost over the past 15 years here in America.\n  I arrive at this debate as a veteran of a number of issues key to our \ndeliberations. First, I have been all too intimately acquainted with \nevery base closure round since the first in 1988 as well as the \naccompanying pitfalls, failures and foibles of each--and believe me, \nthere were many. Second, with 12 years as ranking member of the House \nForeign Affairs International Operations Subcommittee, as chair of the \nsubcommittee's Senate counterpart, as a former member of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee and former chair of the Seapower Subcommittee, \nI cannot and will not ignore the pattern I have discerned of a failure \nto ``connect'' critical ``dots'' in the past--and the implications of \nthese shortfalls for our ability to project into the future.\n  For starters, having fought battle after battle after battle to \npreserve the former Loring Air Force Base in Maine, only to have \ncriteria changed and added literally at the 11th hour, you can feel \nfree to label me a ``skeptic'' when it comes to the integrity of the \nprocess. In fact, we had not one but two Air Force generals defending \nLoring\n\n[[Page S5791]]\n\nbefore the BRAC Commission but in a fundamental breach of confidence in \nthe process, when they could not counter our strategic arguments for \nLoring, it was a brand new factor--so-called ``quality of life''--that \ntipped the scales against strategic location and military value at the \nvery last moment when the Air Force claimed its facilities were ``well \nbelow average'' despite the fact that $300 million had been spent there \nover a 10 year period to replace or upgrade nearly everything on the \nbase.\n  To date, 49 bases in the Northeast alone have been lost to BRAC while \nthe region--closest to Europe of anywhere in the United States I might \nadd--has already suffered about a 50 percent reduction in \ninfrastructure under BRAC. And now further cuts are being discussed, \nwhen it was the northeast that suffered the worst attack ever on \nAmerican soil? When 18 percent of America's population lives in that \nregion? And when we know the Department of Homeland Security is not \ngoing to be building any bases--should we be considering closing the \nvery military facilities that are required to protect the Nation?\n  The fact is, once our critical bases are lost, they are lost forever. \nIn that light, given the transformational times in which we live, given \nthe requirement to make fiscal year 2005 BRAC projections 20 years into \nthe future, while the track record of 6 year projections in the past \nhas been so poor, as I will illustrate, given these projections will be \nthe foundation upon which all infrastructure assessments will be built, \nand given that I have never been convinced of the alleged cost savings \nresulting from BRAC--an underpinning of the effort to even have a BRAC \nprocess in the first place--I do not believe this BRAC round should \nproceed at this time.\n  Advocates of BRAC allege that billions of dollars will be saved, \ndespite the fact that there is no consensus on the numbers among \ndifferent sources. These estimates vary because, as the Congressional \nBudget Office explained in 1998, BRAC savings are really ``avoided \ncosts.'' Because these avoided costs are not actual expenditures and \ncannot be recorded and tracked by the Department of Defense accounting \nsystems, they cannot be validated, which has led to inaccurate and \noverinflated estimates of savings.\n  These estimated savings also do not include the very real costs of \neconomic cleanup and financial assistance provided by Federal agencies \nto BRAC-affected communities and individuals. According to a 1998 \nreport by the General Accounting Office, the unaccounted costs for \nenvironmental cleanup beyond the 6-year BRAC implementation period can \nexceed $2.4 billion and an additional $1.1 billion was in community \nassistance--and also not accounted for in the Department's estimated \nsavings that result from BRAC.\n  That same General Accounting Office report also found that land \nsales from the first base closure round in 1988 were estimated by \nPentagon officials to produce $2.4 billion in revenue; however, as of \n1995, the actual revenue generated was only $65.7 million. That's about \n25 percent of the expected value. This type of overly optimistic \naccounting establishes a very poor foundation for initiating a policy \nthat will have a permanent impact on our national defenses, the \nmilitary and the civilian communities surrounding these bases.\n\n  So the bottom line is, no one really knows what the bottom line is. \nBut what most concerns me is the inadequacy of the military's threat \nassessment projections time after time accompanying the requirement \nincluded in the enacting BRAC legislation in 1991, that stipulates that \nthe Secretary:\n\n     shall include a force structure plan for the Armed Forces \n     based on an assessment by the Secretary of the probable \n     threats to the national security during the six-year period \n     beginning with the fiscal year for which the budget request \n     is made.\n\n  I can say this because I have reviewed the military threat \nassessments contained in the force structure plans that the Department \nprovided along with the justifications for the 1991, 1993 and 1995 BRAC \nrounds as well as other key assessments made by the Department during \nthat time such as the 1993 Bottom Up Review, the 1997 Quadrennial \nReview and the 2001 Quadrennial Review. Specifically, I wondered, how \ndid actual events and results match with their expectations? How did \ntheir threat assessments dovetail with new realities like \n``terrorism,'' ``asymmetric threat,'' ``homeland security'' or \n``homeland defense.'' I then went back a little more than 21 years ago \nto the bombing of the U.S. embassy in Beirut and looked at significant \nterrorist events directed against Americans throughout the world as \nchronicled by the State Department.\n  In the 1980's, American interests were clearly and constantly under \nattack--6 months after the embassy bombing in Beirut, we lost 242 brave \nMarines there to a suicide bomber. In 1985, TWA flight 847 was hijacked \nand a U.S. Navy diver, Robert Stethem was killed, and that October, \nfour terrorists seized the Achille Lauro and killed Leon Klinghofer. In \n1986, another two servicemen were killed and 79 American servicemen \ninjured when a Berlin disco was bombed--my colleagues will recall this \naction resulted in President Reagan's launching of Operation El Dorado \nCanyon against Libya--and, tragically, in December of 1988, Pan Am 103 \nwas destroyed over Lockerbie. Those are just a few of the significant \nincidents out of the 17 listed by the State Department in the 1980's in \nwhich Americans were the targets of terror.\n  Yet after all these events, let's look at what the four page 1991 \nBRAC military threat assessment submitted for the years 1992-1997 had \nto say:\n\n       Threats to US interests range from the enmity of nations \n     like North Korea and Cuba, to pressures from friend and foe \n     alike to reduce US presence around the world.\n       The most enduring concern for US leadership is that the \n     Soviet Union remains the one country in the world capable of \n     destroying the US with a single devastating attack.\n       The Soviet state still will have millions of well armed men \n     in uniform and will remain the strongest military force on \n     the Eurasian landmass.\n       While Iraq will require perhaps a decade to rebuild its \n     military capabilities to pre-hostilities levels, Baghdad will \n     likely remain a disruptive political force in the region.\n\n  As for terrorism, there was just a passing mention of the issue as an \nimpediment to regional stability and the enhancement of democracy \nworldwide but no discussion of it in the context as a threat to the \nUnited States.\n  No mention of ``asymmetric threats,'' and no ``homeland security.''\n  Then, on February 26, 1993, the World Trade Center was badly damaged \nwhen a car bomb planted by Islamic terrorists exploded in an \nunderground garage, leaving 6 people dead and 1,000 injured. Yet the \nmilitary threat assessment contained in the 1993 BRAC report told us:\n\n       The vital interests of the United States will be threatened \n     by regional crises between historical antagonists such as \n     North and South Korea, India and Pakistan and Middle East/\n     Persian Gulf states.\n       The future world military situation will be characterized \n     by regional actors with modern destructive weaponry, \n     including chemical and biological weapons, modern ballistic \n     missiles and, in some cases, nuclear weapons.\n       In the Middle East, competition for political influence and \n     natural resources along with weak economies, Islamic \n     fundamentalism and demographic pressures will contribute to \n     deteriorating living standards and encourage social unrest.\n\n  Please note, now, in this report, oddly there is suddenly once again \nno mention of ``terrorism'' at all, and no ``asymmetric threat,'' no \n``homeland security.''\n  Furthermore, the Bottom Up Review, a wide ranging review of strategy, \nprograms and resources to delineate a national defense strategy, signed \nout in October 1993 described four new dangers to U.S. interests after \nthe end of the Cold War:\n\n       No. 1, The proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of \n     mass destruction,\n       No. 2, Aggression by major regional powers or ethnic and \n     religious conflict,\n       No. 3, Potential failure of democratic reform in the former \n     Soviet Union, and\n       No. 4, The potential failure to build a strong and growing \n     US economy.\n\n  This report was issued just 8 months after that 1993 bombing of the \nWorld Trade Center, yet there was still no mention of ``asymmetric \nthreat,'' no ``homeland security'' and just a passing reference to \n``state-sponsored'' terrorism. And even at that, the World Trade Center \nbombing was not conducted by ``state-sponsored'' terrorists but rather \nthe Sheikh Omar Rahman, a non-state-sponsored terrorist.\n  Back to the timeline, in March 1995 we see the Tokyo subway attack by \nthe Aum-Shinrikyo cult using sarin gas, the same gas discovered in Iraq \nthis\n\n[[Page S5792]]\n\nweek, killed 12 and injured 5700 and, a month later, Timothy McVeigh \nand Terry Nichols destroyed the Federal Building in Oklahoma City with \na truck bomb, killing 166 of our fellow citizens.\n  By contrast, I was astounded that the 1995 Force Structure Plan \naddressing threats from 1995 through 2001 was--other than the removal \nof a few sentences--the same as the 1993 BRAC threat assessment--so \nmuch for rigorous analysis. Still no ``terrorism,'' no ``asymmetric \nthreat,'' and no ``homeland security''--and this less than 6 years \nbefore September 11th! Remember this BRAC round requires DoD to look \noutward 20 years!\n  In 1996, a fuel truck carrying a bomb exploded outside the Khobar \nTowers housing facility in Dhahran. The Global Security Environment \npiece of the 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review described the world as a \nhighly dangerous place with a number of ``significant'' challenges \nfacing the U.S. including:\n\n       Foremost among these is the threat of coercion and large-\n     scale, cross-border aggression against U.S. allies and \n     friends in key regions by hostile states with significant \n     military power.\n       Second, despite the best efforts of the international \n     community, states find it increasingly difficult to control \n     the flow of sensitive information and regulate the \n     technologies that can have military or terrorist uses.\n       Third, as the early years of the post-Cold War period \n     portended, U.S. interests will continue to be challenged by a \n     variety of transnational dangers. . . . The illegal drug \n     trade and international organized crime will continue to \n     ignore our borders, attack our society, and threaten our \n     personal liberty and well-being.\n       Fourth, while we are dramatically safer than during the \n     Cold War, the US homeland is not free from external threats. \n     . . . In addition, other unconventional means of attack, such \n     as terrorism, are no longer just threats to our diplomats, \n     military forces, and private Americans overseas, but will \n     threaten Americans at home in the years to come.\n\n  So by 1997, the Department was acknowledging the fact that terrorists \nusing asymmetric means might attack the homeland--again, I might add \nyet it still remained a fourth tier concern for the Pentagon in spite \nof the continuing onslaught of terrorism around the world--and the 1993 \nbombing here at home.\n  Then, in 1998, two bombs exploded almost simultaneously outside US \nembassies in Kenya and Tanzania. In Aden, Yemen 2 years later, a small \ndingy carrying explosives rammed the USS Cole. And then, September \n11th, 2001 changed our lives forever. What did the 2001 Quadrennial \nDefense Review--issued, I might add, 19 days after the attack--find? \nThey found that ``as the September 2001 events have horrifically \ndemonstrated, the geographic position of the United States no longer \nguarantees immunity from direct attack on its population, territory or \ninfrastructure,'' and that ``the United States is likely to be \nchallenged by adversaries who possess a wide range of capabilities, \nincluding asymmetric approaches to warfare, particularly weapons of \nmass destruction.''\n  That was an astute observation considering what happened 19 days \nbefore. And by the way, I also noted in examining the 80 page 2001 \nQuadrennial Defense Review the lack of any mention of al Qaeda by \nname--not once.\n  All this illustrates the significant dose of skepticism with which we \nshould examine the current force structure plan and accompanying threat \nassessment submitted by the Department to justify the BRAC 2005 round--\nagain, considering that we would now base decisions on a 20 year \nassessment, never mind just 6--and even the 6 year projections proved \nspotty at best--and considering the volatile times in which we live. \nAnd I have to say that what we received--over a month later than \nrequired by the BRAC legislation, I might add--is about what I \nexpected--not much. Indeed, my sense is they took the assumptions made \nfor the Future Year Defense Plan and simply extended them out to 2009.\n  Even after 20 years of constant terrorist attacks, the Defense \nDepartment still hasn't matched its force structures with the threats \nto our Nation. In fact, they avoided the entire issue of the threats \nthis Nation will face over the next twenty years by claiming that \ntoday's security environment is ``impossible to predict, with any \nconfidence, which nations, combinations of nations or non-state actors \nmay threaten U.S. interests at home and abroad.''\n  And when the department claims they have adopted an approach to force \ndevelopment based on capabilities rather than threat-based requirements \nand will need a ``flexible, adaptive, and decisive joint capabilities \nthat can operate across the full spectrum of military \ncontingencies.''--what exactly does that mean? Is that the kind of \nbureaucratic ``gobbledygook'' and uncertainty upon which we should be \nconsidering closing our military bases. I do not think so and neither \ndo other Americans. For example, retired Navy captain Ralph Dean \nsuccinctly observed in a recent Maine newspaper column that:\n\n       Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld released his 20-year \n     force structure plan as an input to BRAC. Surprisingly, it \n     showed virtually no changes in overall force structure during \n     that long period. This may indicate that DoD is unable to \n     make projections with any degree of certainty. This \n     uncertainty must be addressed, because BRAC actions are \n     irreversible.\n\n  Let there be no mistake, as the President has said, our global war on \nterror will be a long struggle that is just beginning. These are \nunconventional threats for an unconventional era--how can we possibly \nproject outward 20 years to know our needs? At the same time, we are \nlearning that quantity of troops matters--as DoD was forced to \nrecalibrate and send an additional 20,000 troops to Iraq. Moreover, \nthis very legislation before us would authorize an increase in the \nArmy's end strength of 30,000 soldiers--yet we want to reduce our \nnumber of bases? Indeed, the BRAC 2005 force structure plan addresses \nneither the potential surge requirements we may face in this protracted \nstruggle nor the need for more troops. In its May 2004 report, the GAO \nhas said:\n\n       The department must consider ongoing force transformation \n     initiatives in its BRAC analysis as well as factor in \n     relevant assumptions about the potential for future force \n     structure changes--changes that will likely occur long after \n     the timeframes for the 2005 BRAC round. This includes \n     consideration of future surge requirements.\n\n  Frankly, there is even confusion between DoD and the services. On May \n12, 2004 the Boston Globe reported the Navy is conducting an internal \nstudy and considering slashing its attack submarine force by as much as \na third as they work toward their 2006 budget submission. This despite \nthe fact that information we have been provided by the Navy indicates \nno changes in the Future Year Defense Plan.\n  Where is the coordination in assessing the threat or planning force \nstructure needs? And what of the ``joint'' war-fighting plans that are \nstill being developed? If BRAC decisions are based on untested and \nuntried ``joint'' concepts, then DoD could well face limited options \ndown the line because of limitations of facilities if all the \nanticipated efficiencies are not realized.\n  The Force Structure Plan clearly states the limits of their excess \ncapacity analysis, saying:\n\n       The results presented in this section cannot be used to \n     project the number of potential BRAC closures or realignments \n     that could be achieved in each installation category.\n\n  Without this projection, how are the savings from BRAC being \nestimated and what is driving the scope of BRAC? What is needed is a \nrigorous analysis that determines the number of BRAC closures or \nrealignments that are expected to be achieved for each type of military \ninstallation.\n  Finally, the Pentagon was also instructed to consider the effects of \noverseas bases and joint tenancy in its assessment of excess capacity, \nand while the submitted Force Structure Plan tells us how many \ninstallations the US currently operates overseas, it provides no \ninformation about the number of bases and troops expected to be located \noverseas over the next 20 years or where these bases would be located \nnor does it detail the functions that are being considered for joint \noperations and how much efficiency is expected to be gained by these \nchanges.\n  The amendment proposed by Senators Dorgan, Lott, Feinstein and myself \nensure that Congress is provided with sufficient time to deliberate on \nwhat infrastructure is needed to provide for our Nation's security now \nand well into the future. While I would have preferred to cancel the \nprocess altogether, the amendment offered today ensures that these \nirrevocable decisions are made with sufficient deliberation. The \namendment provides for an\n\n[[Page S5793]]\n\nexpedited consideration by Congress for a domestic base closure round \nin 2007--after the completion of an overseas BRAC action.\n  The amendment is a recognition that the operation, sustainment, and \nrecapitalization of unneeded overseas bases diverts scarce resources \nfrom the nation's defense capabilities and requires the Secretary of \nDefense to establish a management structure and initiate a process for \neliminating excess physical capacity at overseas bases.\n  After conducting this review of overseas facilities, the Secretary \nwould provide to Congress and the BRAC Commission a list of military \ninstallations, a detailing of the reassignments of troops and equipment \nfrom affected bases, and an estimate of the cost savings to be \nachieved. The Secretary would also be required to provide a \ncertification whether a domestic round of BRAC would be necessary.\n  The BRAC Commission would then evaluate the Secretary's \nrecommendations and provide an assessment of the extent that the \nSecretary accounted for the final report of the Commission on the \nReview of the Overseas Military Facility Structure of the United \nStates, whether the Secretary maximized the amount of savings and \nwhether a domestic BRAC round in 2007 is warranted.\n  After the BRAC Commission completes its work, there is a process for \nan expedited consideration of an additional domestic BRAC. The \namendment requires a ``joint resolution'' be introduced within 10 days \nafter the President transmits to Congress an approval and certification \nfor a domestic base closure round. If passed by Congress, then within \n15 days, the Secretary will publish in the Federal Register the \nselection criteria to be used and a schedule for the BRAC round, and \nthe domestic BRAC would proceed as originally planned.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the U.S. military has \napproximately 197,000 active-duty personnel stationed permanently \noutside the United States--that is 14 percent of our active duty \nmilitary and 19 percent of the Army active-duty forces. And, while the \nSecretary of Defense has estimated an excess capacity of 29 percent in \nthe Army domestic infrastructure, the Congressional Budget Office, in a \nMay 2004 report on overseas basing has said:\n\n       Because of the various rounds of base realignment and \n     closure (BRAC) that have occurred since the late 1980s, the \n     Army has little excess capacity at its bases to absorb so \n     many additional troops and units.\n\n  And according to former DoD Comptroller Dov Zakheim:\n\n       BRAC does . . . make it difficult to move our forces \n     directly to where they ought to go if you don't want them to \n     be overseas.\n\n  Most of these overseas troops are stationed in Germany and South \nKorea, where the United States currently maintains 330 bases at an \nestimated cost of $1.2 billion annually. The administration has raised \na number of concerns about these forces, including the fact that Army \nforces in Germany may not be able to deploy quickly to conflicts in \nAfrica or the Caspian Sea region of Central Asia. Additionally, many of \nthe bases in South Korea, which were formerly isolated, are becoming \nincreasingly surrounded by commercial and residential communities, \nleading to greater friction with the local communities and limiting the \ntraining that can be conducted.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has determined that removing the Army \nforces from Germany and South Korea and relocating them in the United \nStates would not affect deployment times, make available 4,000 to \n10,000 more troops for sustained overseas operations, and reduce family \nseparation by 22 percent, improving troop morale and retention rates. \nThese changes would also result in an estimated annual savings of $1.2 \nbillion. More important than financial considerations, today's \nuncertain environment requires our troops to be more agile and mobile \nand the time is long past to reevaluate an overseas base structure that \nwas developed to meet the threats of the Cold War.\n  Some people contend that the overseas basing decisions will be \ncompleted in time to be accounted for by the BRAC process. But the \ncurrent legislation provides for the Commission on Review of Overseas \nMilitary Facility Structure of the United States to report on their \nfindings to Congress no later than December 31, 2004--only 4\\1/2\\ \nmonths before the BRAC decisions are to be completed. This timeline \ndoes not allow the Department of Defense to fully account for these \noverseas facilities in their domestic BRAC analysis nor does it include \nany time to include any of the changes to the report that Congress may \ndetermine are necessary.\n  Significant changes are being considered for our overseas bases and \nforces and these decisions potentially have an enormous impact on our \ndomestic base infrastructure. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice ``the need to house forces in the United States that are now \nstationed overseas could preclude some'' of the closures in the \nupcoming BRAC round.\n  I want to protect the military's critical readiness and operational \nassets. And I want to make absolutely sure that this nation maintains \nthe military infrastructure it will require in the years to come to \nsupport the war on terror and protect our homeland. The amendment my \ncolleagues and I have proposed today will ensure that the evaluation of \nmilitary facilities by the Department of Defense, both overseas and \nwithin the United States, is conducted with rigor and in a \ndeliberative, systematic manner. As Senator Hutchison correctly \nobserved:\n\n       It would be irresponsible to build on an inefficient, \n     obsolete overseas base structure, as we face new strategic \n     threats in the 21st century, taking valuable dollars needed \n     elsewhere.\n\n  Likewise, it would be irresponsible to continue with a domestic BRAC \nwithout a complete understanding and evaluation of our overseas basing \nrequirements. This amendment will allow Congress time to exercise its \noversight responsibilities and ensure that these important decisions--\nwhich cannot be undone--are serving the Nation's interests.\n  In closing, I believe that we must give the Department the time it \nneeds to conduct a legitimate analysis of our security environment and \nthe underpinning force structure and infrastructure requirements. \nTherefore I urge my colleagues to support the amendment before us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/19/senate-section/article/S5793-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Marianne Lamont \nHorinko who currently serves as the Assistant Administrator of the \nOffice of Solid Waste and Emergency Response at the Environmental \nProtection Agency. Marianne has served our Nation in that post since \nOctober 1, 2001, and just a few weeks from now will return to private \nlife and to spend more time with her family.\n  As Assistant Administrator of OSWER, Marianne demonstrated \noutstanding leadership and has met the unprecedented challenges of a \npost September 11th America. Ms. Horinko realized the incredible \nchallenges that lay before her just one month after the horrific \nattacks of that day. Immediately upon assuming office, Marianne \nrefocused the traditional missions of OSWER from waste management and \nrelated reclamation work of contaminated sites to emergency response of \nhistoric proportions. She led the clean-up effort at Ground Zero in New \nYork City and the Pentagon, a mission that no one could have \ncontemplated before then and still haunts us today.\n  While managing the emergency response of the September 11th \ndestruction, Congress itself was the victim of a cowardly anthrax \nbiological attack. Facing yet another unprecedented event, Marianne led \nthe emergency response and clean up effort not of a Superfund site, but \nof the Senate office buildings, and ensured that the Capitol community \nwas safe from harm and helping Congress return to doing the work for \nthe Nation.\n  In 2003, as National Program manager, Ms. Horinko oversaw EPA's \nresponse to the Columbia Space Shuttle Disaster. Again, Marianne \ncharted a new course for OSWER and crafted the groundbreaking National \nApproach to Response.\n  Marianne has accepted challenge after challenge head on as Assistant \nAdministrator of OSWER, and assumed responsibility when called upon. \nNot only did she exceed expectation in that role, but she also \nperformed as acting administrator of the entire Environmental \nProtection Agency after the resignation of Governor Whitman.\n  Marianne has brought dynamic new approaches to environmental \nprotection using partnerships, flexibility and innovation to create \nenvironmental improvements rather than the old command and control \nsystems of the past. The Brownfields program, signed into law by \nPresident Bush in 2002, is just one of the many ways that Marianne's \nresults-based leadership led to environmental protection.\n  Marianne Lamont Horinko proved to be one of the most diligent, \ndynamic, and outstanding leaders in the history of the Environmental \nProtection Agency. We thank her for her service to our Nation, and wish \nher all the best in her future pursuits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/19/senate-section/article/S5794-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ROSIE THE RIVETER\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the famous poster of ``Rosie the \nRiveter,'' created by J. Howard Miller in 1943, was quite well known \nthroughout America during World War II. The slogan on the poster--``WE \nCAN DO IT!''--captured the spirit and dedication of our Nation's women \nduring World War II. ``Rosie the Riveter'' became a nickname for the \nwomen who entered the workforce during the war.\n  World War II profoundly changed the role and status of American \nwomen. During this war, over 6 million women joined the workforce, \nfilling jobs that had been traditionally held by men. For the first \ntime in history, women in large numbers worked to produce ships, \nplanes, tanks, trucks, guns and ammunition that were essential to the \nwar effort. They worked in factories while raising their kids--often by \nthemselves as their husbands were fighting abroad.\n  In California, women worked in factories across the state, from the \nDouglas Aircraft Company plant in Long Beach to the Ford Assembly plant \nin Richmond, CA.\n  These women's contributions on the homefront were invaluable to our \nnation's victory in World War II. As we approach Memorial Day--and the \ndedication of the World War II Memorial--I want to express my gratitude \nto our Nation's ``Rosies'' for their effort in helping America win the \nwar.\n  In 2000, Congress enacted legislation, introduced by Representative \nGeorge Miller, to create the Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front \nNational Historical Park in Richmond, CA. Senator Feinstein and I \nintroduced the Senate companion bill.\n  Richmond, CA was chosen as the site since the city played a \nsignificant role in the World War II effort on the homefront. Fifty-six \nwar industries operated in Richmond, and the Kaiser Shipyards produced \nmore ships than any other shipyard in the United States. The Ford \nAssembly Plant prepared for shipment overseas more than 20 percent of \nall tanks and other combat vehicles used by the United States during \nWorld War II.\n  The Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical \nPark is the first park created to commemorate the contributions of men \nand women on the U.S. home front during World War II and to preserve \nthe historic sites, structures and stories associated with World War \nII.\n  I am so pleased that the park, in partnership with Ford Motor Company \nand the National Park Foundation, has initiated a campaign to find \n``Rosies'' across the country to collect their personal stories and \nmemorabilia to share with future generations. I commend Ford Motor \nCompany and the National Park Foundation for their efforts to preserve \nsuch an important piece of our history.\n  In this historic year--the 60th anniversary of D-Day--while we are \nhonoring the Nation's veterans, let us not forget to honor the women \nwhose contributions were critical to our success in World War II.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/19/senate-section/article/S5794-4", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5794-S5795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN RECOGNITION OF OLDER AMERICANS MONTH\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, in 1963, President Kennedy began an \nimportant tradition of designating a time for our country to honor our \nolder citizens for their many accomplishments and contributions to our \nNation. I rise today to continue that tradition and recognize May as \n``Older Americans Month.'' Those of us who have worked diligently in \nthe U.S. Senate to ensure that older Americans are able to live in \ndignity and independence during their later years welcome this \nopportunity to pause and reflect on the contributions of those \nindividuals who have played such a major role in shaping our great \nNation. We honor them for their hard work and the countless sacrifices \nthey have made throughout their lifetimes, and look forward to their \ncontinued contributions to our country's welfare.\n  In line with the theme of this year's Older Americans Month, ``Aging \nWell, Living Well,'' I want to take this opportunity to highlight the \nimportance of quality and comprehensive health care for our seniors. \nThey deserve nothing less. I have significant concerns about what the \nfuture holds in this regard. I voted against the Medicare Prescription \nDrug and Modernization Act of 2003, which is currently being phased in, \nbecause I believed it would jeopardize promises we as a Nation have \nmade to seniors. Many of the concerns that I shared with a number\n\n[[Page S5795]]\n\nof my colleagues at that time and during the Senate's consideration of \nthis measure are unfortunately now coming to fruition.\n  One of my principal concerns is that the new law will fail to provide \na comprehensive, consistent and affordable prescription drug benefit to \nMedicare beneficiaries. And now as we look at the uncertainty of \nmonthly premiums and incomplete coverage for drug costs under the new \nlaw, it is increasingly clear that corporate interests won out over the \ninterests of the elderly. Indeed, at least 2.7 million retirees are \nexpected to lose their existing retiree prescription drug benefits--\nwhich are of higher quality--and will instead have to use the Medicare \ndrug benefit.\n  Moreover, I continue to be deeply concerned that existing Medicare \nbeneficiaries will be forced into managed care organizations in order \nto receive substantial prescription drug benefits. Because of the \nrecent history with Medicare+Choice plans, it has been suggested that \nrequiring seniors to rely on the private market for coverage represents \na significant threat to the very existence of Medicare as we have known \nit for the last 40 years.\n  On top of all of this, the Medicare trustees have predicted \nexhaustion of the Medicare Trust Fund 7 years earlier than previously \npredicted. With the rising costs of drugs and health care in general, \nand the implicit lack of means to reduce drug costs in the new law, we \nwill be faced with hard decisions sooner than originally anticipated. \nHopefully, the answer will not be to seek to decrease benefits.\n  To address these concerns, I am in favor of proposals to provide \nMedicare beneficiaries with full prescription drug coverage. In fact, a \nnumber of my colleagues and I supported legislation during the Senate's \nconsideration of the Medicare overhaul that would have controlled drug \nprices by allowing our Government to negotiate directly with drug \ncompanies.\n  Unfortunately this amendment was defeated when it came to the Senate \nfor a full vote, but I continue to work with my colleagues on this and \nother proposals in an effort to bring these prices under control.\n  In addition to health care access, our seniors deserve adequate \nprotection through our Social Security Program. There are those who \nhave suggested that to enable the Social Security fund to meet the \nexpanding demand of our growing number of retirees, we should decrease \nbenefits.\n  The key strength of the Social Security system is its guaranteed \nbenefit and we must work to preserve it rather than diminish it. Social \nSecurity has been effective in improving the standard of living and \nreducing poverty among the elderly and disabled by providing an \ninflation-indexed, defined benefit no matter how long an individual \nlives. Throughout their lives, seniors have paid into a system with the \nunderstanding that their benefits will be there for them when they \nretire. We ought to uphold our end of the bargain and ensure that these \nbenefits are available.\n  President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law \nagainst a backdrop of increasing poverty among elderly Americans. \nPresident Roosevelt sought to give ``a measure of protection for the \naverage citizen and to his family against the loss of a job and against \npoverty-ridden old age.'' In my view, the words of President Roosevelt \nshould continue to guide our conscience.\n  America's Older Americans add great value to our Nation. We ought to \ntake this month as an opportunity to show our appreciation for the \nvalue they add and redouble our efforts to support their needs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/19/senate-section/article/S5795-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RETIREMENT OF FRANCES PRESTON\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize \nthe remarkable career of Frances Preston. When Ms. Preston began \nworking for Broadcast Music Incorporated in Nashville in 1958, she had \nonly one assistant and her office was her parents' garage. She soon saw \nthe company grow to more than 400 employees in that city alone. In \n1985, she became Senior Vice President, Performing Rights, and in 1986 \nshe was named President and CEO of BMI.\n  Since 1958 when she joined BMI, Ms. Preston has been an invaluable \nresource to the entire music industry. Her steady and visionary \nleadership has spanned unprecedented industry growth and several \nrevolutions in technology and popular culture. Over that time, she has \noverseen the development of BMI's nearly 4.5 million musical works and \nhas delivered a royalty system that meets the needs of this massive \nrepertoire. Fortune magazine has rightly called her ``one of the true \npowerhouses of the pop music business.''\n  And for more than two decades she has proven herself an equally \ninvaluable resource for those of us in Washington who appreciate the \nunique importance of the community of songwriters, composers and \npublishers. She has testified frequently and has vigilantly defended \nthe rights of these individuals. She has also been a key player in the \ndebates regarding music in the digital age. Her dedication to the many \nparticipants in the music world, and her unfailing willingness to \nassist us in Congress in understating their concerns and issues, made \nher an incomparable asset as we tried to make sound policy and good law \nin the areas that matter most to music.\n  Along with her many professional accomplishments, she has devoted \nherself to a multitude of charitable efforts. Her charitable work \nranges from serving as president of the T.J. Martell Foundation for \nLeukemia, Cancer and AIDS Research, to her work for Goodwill of \nNashville. She has received numerous humanitarian awards, including a \n``Woman of Achievement'' Award from the Society for the Advancement of \nWomen's Health Research, the first Distinguished Service Award from New \nYork's Elaine Kaufman Cultural Center, and the Lester Sill Humanitarian \nAward presented at the Retinitis Pigmentosa International Awards.\n  Ms. Preston's skill and passion will be greatly missed. It is a \ncomfort to know that she will be staying on at BMI in the role of \nPresident Emeritus. I thank her for her efforts and wish her well in \nall her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/19/senate-section/article/S5795-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 TRIBUTE TO DR.

ZELLER\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I wish to pay special tribute to Mr. \nFred F. Zeller, the American Legion District 11 and 12 Legionnaire of \nthe Year. Fred and the millions of other veterans that have served have \nearned our Nation's most sincere thanks for the service and sacrifices \nthey rendered. It is their service that provided the umbrella of \nfreedom under which we live today.\n  Mr. Zeller earned his eligibility to be a member of The American \nLegion by serving in the U.S. Navy in World War II as part of the \ngreatest generation and has enjoyed 57 continuous years in The American \nLegion.\n  After being discharged from the Navy in 1946, Fred joined Post 225 in \nOhio. He was transferred by his company to Minnesota in 1951 where he \njoined Post 257. He served on various committees, the executive board \nand Captain of the Color Guard and the Firing Squad for 8 years. His \njob took him to many places and he landed in Missouri and settled in \nSt. Louis in 1978, becoming a member of Post III where he took part in \nall of the Post activities.\n  Fred is presently serving as Judge Advocate and President of \nG.A.P.L., the building and grounds part of the post. For sharing all of \nhis knowledge, skill and hard work, Mr. Zeller was presented a gold \ncard and life membership in 1999. Fred is a member of The Past \nCommanders Club, having served twice on the Executive board.\n  Fred exemplifies the true meaning of the word service. As you can \nsee, Fred continued to serve long after he was discharged from the \nmilitary and we should all be proud of his many accomplishments. Again, \nI wish to extend my most sincere thanks for Mr. Zeller's service and my \ncongratulations to him on being chosen as Legionnaire of the \nYear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/19/senate-section/article/S5796-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SISTER GERALDINE BERNARDS\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I am proud to pay tribute today to a \nremarkable woman who is one of Oregon's true health care heroes. For \nthe past 40 years, Sister Geraldine Bernards has devoted herself to the \nwork of Maryville Nursing Home in Beaverton, OR. First as a nurse, then \nas director of nurses, and for the last 10 years as Administrator, \nSister Geraldine has made a positive difference in the lives of \ncountless Oregonians. Sister Geraldine will be retiring this summer, \nand before she does, I wanted to take the opportunity to share her \ninspiring story.\n  Founded in 1963, Maryville Nursing Home is owned and operated by the \nSisters of St. Mary of Oregon, and offers ``service with love'' to the \nelderly. During the four decades of Sister Geraldine's service, \nMaryville has expanded to include an Alzheimer's unit, a physical \ntherapy unit, an eye clinic, a dental clinic, an activities center, and \na multi-purpose gathering center.\n  In her 10 years as Maryville's administrator, Sister Geraldine has \ninitiated many valuable programs to guarantee quality health care and \nsafety for the residents. Two courtyards have been enclosed, making \nthem attractive and safe places for the residents to enjoy the outdoors \nwith their families. A wireless phone system was introduced which \nenables nurses to be contacted immediately anywhere in the facility. A \nsecurity system has been installed. New patient lifts were purchased. \nThe volunteer program has seen a tripling in the number of \nparticipants, and a full time director of volunteers has been hired.\n  Some of the most inspiring words about Sister Geraldine come from \nthose who know her best. Activity Director Hilee Jackson says that \nSister Geraldine is ``consumed by making sure that others' needs are \nmet.'' Terry Shrum, Quality Assurance Director, says ``Sister Geraldine \nwould do anything for anyone.''\n  It is a fitting tribute to her lifetime of service that a Sister \nGeraldine Bernards Continuing Education Fund is being established to \nprovide financial resources for on-going career education in the fields \nof health care and early childhood development.\n  I am proud to join with many other Oregonians in saluting the work of \nthis true health care hero, and I wish her many more years of health \nand happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/19/senate-section/article/S5796-4", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING THE WORK OF ARTHUR PRATT\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I want to share with my colleagues a \nfew highlights from the remarkable lifetime of leadership and good \nworks displayed by Mr. Arthur Pratt, the founder and leader of Life \nEffectiveness Training in Indianapolis, IN.\n  Over the past 35 years, Mr. Pratt has been a dedicated leader in \ngoing into prisons around the country and assisting drug addicted men \nand women break their dependence on mind altering substances. His work \nhas improved countless lives and the success is particularly evident in \nthe reduced recidivism rates of the prisoners who have completed his \nprogram. His expertise and active contributions were the impetus behind \nlegislation that I sponsored and passed requiring at least ten percent \nof all money allocated to Residential Substance Abuse Treatment \nprograms to be allocated to programs in the jails.\n  Currently, at the age of 80, Mr. Pratt is a continual voice in \nadvocating proven treatment service for our Nation's state and county \njails. Yearly, his program provides approximately 250 alcoholics and \ndrug addicts 90 days of treatment in Marion County Jails. Of the more \nthan 7,000 people he has treated, over two-thirds have not been \nsubsequently arrested. Through Life Effectiveness Training, he counters \naddiction and recidivism using a tested program that instills strength \nand confidence in their lives.\n  Arthur Pratt has dedicated his life to public service, and I am \npleased to have this opportunity to congratulate him on his many \nworthwhile accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/19/senate-section/article/S5796-5", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5796-S5797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      OUR PRECIOUS GIFT OF FREEDOM\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in a few days, a very special \ndedication will be held a short distance from here. Thanks to the \ndiligence, commitment, and hard work of many people across the United \nStates, our Nation's capital will officially be the proud home to the \nlong-overdue World War II Memorial. It is definitely a time for \ncelebration--a celebration of freedom, life, and honor, a celebration \nof the United States of America. Most of all, it is a celebration of \nall the soldiers and citizens who gave life and limb during the early \nyears of the 1940s.\n  Idaho is home to many World War II veterans. This Memorial Day \nweekend, those veterans, along with veterans from every State and \nothers who helped at home and abroad, can celebrate a very special \nMemorial Day. Many fought and many died to defend the United States in \na war that ended 59 years ago. Sixteen million served, and 400,000 did \nnot return to families and friends. Each one of these lives increased \nthe value of our citizenship exponentially and immeasurably. This \nmemorial, the design of which was selected after careful review of 400 \nsubmissions, stands as a reminder of the\n\n[[Page S5797]]\n\nsacrifice of many. It is a most profound honor to their memory.\n  Watching the evening news is a sobering reminder of what this \nmemorial stands for. It represents freedom from tyranny, peace and \njustice for all people, bravery in the face of terror and death, and \nlove for America that surpasses words while challenging complacency. \nThe World War II Memorial has an important role to play in teaching us \nabout the price of freedom. It reminds each one of us that we cannot \ntake our United States citizenship lightly. It calls on us to be \nvigilant in preserving those freedoms as those who have gone before \nhave done with such conviction and singleness of purpose. Many veterans \nknow all too well the physical and emotional challenges that the \ncurrent generation of military personnel and their families are facing. \nTheir wisdom, insight, and experience will help those who themselves \nare brand new veterans. These young men and women face the same \nchallenges that others did over half a century ago. This memorial \nserves as a reminder of the debt of honor and gratitude we owe all \nveterans. We have a responsibility to care for them and, in our \nnational leadership roles, we must take steps which do the most to \nsupport these brave defenders of our freedom.\n  This memorial represents those who have given life and limb in \nmilitary service, and it also reminds all Americans of the gift of \nimmeasurable cost--the gift of freedom--that the lives of brave men and \nwomen have purchased for all of us. And I can think of no better reason \nto celebrate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/19/senate-section/article/S5797-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING P.J.

In addition, P.J. has 24 \ngrandchildren and one great grandchild.\n  After the death of his wife, Betty, P.J. married Virginia McKee \nKeeley on August 22, 1998.\n  P.J.'s passion is golf. In the course of his golfing career, P.J. \nKeeley won 16 championships at St. Clair Country Club in Belleville, \nIL. He won his first championship in 1958, at the age of 16, and his \nlast championship in 1987 at the age of 58.\n  In addition to being an avid golfer, P.J. is an Army veteran who has \nhonorably served his country.\n  P.J. Keeley served as president of Keeley & Sons, Inc., a well-known \nhighway construction firm, for 23 years, from 1967 through 1989. Keeley \n& Sons was founded in 1947.

A bill to amend title 31, United States Code, to provide \nFederal Government employees with bid protest rights in actions under \nOffice of Management and Budget Circular A-76, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, competitive sourcing is the process by \nwhich the Federal Government conducts a competition to compare the\n\n[[Page S5801]]\n\ncost of obtaining a needed commercial service from a private sector \ncontractor rather than from Federal employees. Properly conducted, \ncompetitive sourcing can be an effective tool to achieve cost savings. \nPoorly utilized, however, it can increase costs and hurt the morale of \nthe Federal workforce.\n  The current guidelines under which agencies conduct these \ncompetitions are contained in the Office of Management and Budget's \n(OMB) Circular A-76 (A-76). To ensure that we maximize the benefit and \nminimize the cost of competitive sourcing, A-76 competition must be \nconducted in a carefully crafted manner. The rules under which they \ntake place must be fair, objective, transparent, and efficient. In one \nparticular regard, I believe the current rules fail to meet these \ncriteria.\n  Specifically, they do not allow Federal employees to protest the \nagency's decisions in an A-76 competition beyond the agency's own \ninternal review processes to the General Accounting Office (GAO). \nCongress has vested in the GAO the jurisdiction to hear and render \nopinions in protests of agency acquisition decisions generally. Private \nsector contractors, in contrast to federal employees, have standing to \nprotest agency procurement decisions, including those in A-76 \ncompetitions, before GAO. Today, along with my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Levin, I am introducing legislation to correct this imbalance \nby providing Federal employees with standing to protest A-76 decisions \nto GAO.\n  The current situation does not arise from any conscious policy \ndecision of Congress, GAO or OMB. Rather, it occurs because the Federal \nstatute that confers protest jurisdiction upon GAO, the Competition in \nContracting Act of 1984 or ``CICA,'' was not drafted to address the \nunique nature of A-76 competitions, in particular, the role of Federal \nemployees in the ``Most Efficient Organization'' or ``MEO,'' which is \nthe in-house side of these competitions. This was not deliberate--this \nparticular circumstance for protest was simply not contemplated by \nCongress when drafting CICA.\n  Recent revisions to A-76 created the potential for GAO to review past \ndecisions by Federal courts and revisit its own opinions to see whether \nthe revisions would merit a determination that Federal employees had \ngained standing to protest adverse A-76 competition decisions. However, \na recent GAO protest decision indicates that GAO has concluded it lacks \nthe authority under CICA to hear protests from Federal employees in the \nMEO in these competitions. As a result, corrective legislative action \nhas become necessary in our view.\n  Our bill would extend GAO protest rights on behalf of the MEO in A-76 \ncompetitions to two individuals. The first is the Agency Tender \nOfficial or ``ATO.'' The ATO is the agency official who is responsible \nfor developing and representing the Federal employees' MEO. The second \nis a representative chosen directly by the Federal employees in the MEO \nfor the purposes of filing a protest with GAO where the ATO does not, \nin the view of a majority of the MEO, fulfill his or her duties in \nregards to a GAO protest.\n  As I mentioned, the rules under which these competitions are run must \nbe fair. In addition to being objectively fair, however, I think they \nmust also be perceived as fair by all parties. If the private sector \nperceives the rules to be unfair, they will decline to participate in \ncompetitive sourcing competitions, and the Federal Government will \nenjoy less competition in its acquisitions. If Federal employees \nperceive the rules to be unfair, there will be less interest in Federal \nemployment at a time when we are all concerned about the Federal \nGovernment's human capital challenges. As the congressionally \nestablished Commercial Activities Panel noted in its report on \ncompetitive sourcing, the lack of GAO protest rights for Federal \nemployees was one of the most often-heard complaints about the A-76 \nrules. Providing them with protest rights that are similar to those \nenjoyed by the private sector is, I think, vital to assuring Federal \nemployees that the rules of the game are fair to them.\n  The rules must also be efficient. There are three interests that are \nserved by A-76 rules that ensure a speedy process with finality. The \nFederal Government benefits by enjoying the benefits and efficiencies \nof competitive sourcing sooner rather than later. Federal workers \nbenefit in that they spend less time having to worry about the outcome \nof these competitions, which can be stressful as they create \nuncertainty about employees' employment situations. Finally, because \ntime is money in the private sector, private contractors will benefit \nby spending less time on competitions as well. In my view, having \nFederal employees vote to choose a representative to protest when they \nare dissatisfied with the ATO should achieve the maximum efficiency \npossible while respecting Federal employees' interests.\n  In the end, our intent is to bolster the A-76 process by providing a \nmechanism for Federal employees to seek redress from GAO, an entity \nthat is well known for its fair, effective and expert handling of \nacquisition protests.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Frist, and Mr. Cornyn):\n  S. 2439. A bill to award a congressional gold medal to Michael Ellis \nDeBakey, M.D.; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the \nlifetime achievements of Dr. Michael Ellis DeBakey, a public servant \nand world-renowned cardiologist, by offering legislation to award him \nthe Congressional Gold Medal.\n  When he was only 23 years of age and still attending medical school, \nDr. DeBakey accomplished what would be the first of many life saving \naccomplishments. He successfully developed a roller pump for blood \ntransfusions--the precursor and major component of the heart-lung \nmachine used in the first open-heart operation. This device later led \nto national recognition for his expertise in vascular disease.\n  Like many Americans of his generation, Dr. DeBakey put his practice \non hold and volunteered for military service during World War II with \nthe Surgeon General's staff. During this time, he received the rank of \nColonel and chief of Surgical Consultants Division.\n  As a result of his military and medical experience, Dr. DeBakey made \nnumerous recommendations to improve the military's medical procedures. \nHis efforts led to the development of mobile army surgical hospitals, \nbetter known as MASH units, which earned him the Legion of Merit in \n1945.\n  Following WWII, Dr. DeBakey continued his hard work by proposing \nnational and specialized medical centers for those soldiers who were \nwounded or needed follow-up treatment. This recommendation evolved into \nthe Veterans Affairs Medical Center System and the establishment of the \ncommission on Veterans Medical Problems of the National Research \nCouncil.\n  In 1948, Dr. DeBakey joined the Baylor University College of \nMedicine, where it started its first surgical residency program and was \nlater elected the first President of Baylor College of Medicine.\n  Adding to his list of accomplishments Dr. DeBakey performed the first \nsuccessful procedure to treat patients with anyeurysms. In 1964, Dr. \nDeBakey performed the first successful coronary bypass surgery, opening \nthe doors for surgeons to perform preventative procedures to save the \nlives of many people with heart disease. He was also the first to \nsuccessfully use a partial artificial heart. Later that same year, \nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Dr. DeBakey as Chairman of the \nPresident's Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer and Stroke, which led \nto the creation of Regional Medical Programs. These programs coordinate \nmedical schools, research institutions and hospitals to enhance \nresearch and training.\n  Dr. DeBakey continued to amaze the medical world when he pioneered \nthe field of telemedicine by performing the first open-heart surgery \ntransmitted over satellite and then supervised the first successful \nmulti-organ transplant, where a heart, both kidneys and a lung were \ntransplanted from a single donor into four separate recipients.\n\n  These accomplishments had led to national recognition. Dr. DeBakey \nhas received both the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction \nfrom President Johnson and the National Medal of Science from President \nRonald Reagan.\n  Recently, Dr. DeBakey worked with NASA engineers to develop the\n\n[[Page S5802]]\n\nDeBakey Ventricular Assist Device, which may eliminate the need for \nsome patients to receive heart transplants.\n  I stand here today to acknowledge Dr. DeBakey's invaluable work and \nsignificant contribution to medicine by offering a bill to award him \nthe Congressional Gold Medal. His efforts and innovative surgical \ntechniques have since saved the lives of thousands, if not millions, of \npeople. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in recognizing the \nprofound impact this man has had on medical advances, the delivery of \nmedicine and how we care for our Veterans. Although, Dr. DeBakey is not \na native of Texas, he has made Texas proud. He has guided the Baylor \nCollege of Medicine and the city of Houston into becoming a world \nleader in medical advancement. On behalf of all Texans, I thank Dr. \nDeBakey for his lifetime of commitment and service not only to the \nmedical community but to the world. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2439\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Michael Ellis DeBakey, M.D., was born on September 7, \n     1908 in Lake Charles, Louisiana, to Shaker and Raheeja \n     DeBakey.\n       (2) Dr. DeBakey, at the age of 23 and still a medical \n     student, reported a major invention, a roller pump for blood \n     transfusions, which later became a major component of the \n     heart-lung machine used in the first successful open-heart \n     operation.\n       (3) Even though Dr. DeBakey had already achieved a national \n     reputation as an authority on vascular disease and had a \n     promising career as a surgeon and teacher, he volunteered for \n     military service during World War II, joining the Surgeon \n     General's staff and rising to the rank of Colonel and Chief \n     of the Surgical Consultants Division.\n       (4) As a result of this first-hand knowledge of military \n     service, Dr. DeBakey made numerous recommendations for the \n     proper staged management of war wounds, which led to the \n     development of mobile army surgical hospitals or MASH units, \n     and earned Dr. DeBakey the Legion of Merit in 1945.\n       (5) After the war, Dr. DeBakey proposed the systematic \n     medical follow-up of veterans and recommended the creation of \n     specialized medical centers in different areas of the United \n     States to treat wounded military personnel returning from \n     war, and from this recommendation evolved the Veterans \n     Affairs Medical Center System and the establishment of the \n     Commission on Veterans Medical Problems of the National \n     Research Council.\n       (6) In 1948, Dr. DeBakey joined the Baylor University \n     College of Medicine, where he developed the first surgical \n     residency program in the City of Houston, and today, guided \n     by Dr. DeBakey's vision, the College is one of the most \n     respected health science centers in the Nation.\n       (7) In 1953, Dr. DeBakey performed the first successful \n     procedures to treat patients who suffered aneurysms leading \n     to severe strokes, and he later developed a series of \n     innovative surgical techniques for the treatment of aneurysms \n     enabling thousands of lives to be saved in the years ahead.\n       (8) In 1964, Dr. DeBakey triggered the most explosive era \n     in modern cardiac surgery, when he performed the first \n     successful coronary bypass, once again paving the way for \n     surgeons world-wide to offer hope to thousands of patients \n     who might otherwise succumb to heart disease.\n       (9) Two years later, Dr. DeBakey made medical history \n     again, when he was the first to successfully use a partial \n     artificial heart to solve the problems of a patient who could \n     not be weaned from a heart-lung machine following open-heart \n     surgery.\n       (10) In 1968, Dr. DeBakey supervised the first successful \n     multi-organ transplant, in which a heart, both kidneys, and \n     lung were transplanted from a single donor into 4 separate \n     recipients.\n       (11) In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Dr. \n     DeBakey to the position of Chairman of the President's \n     Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer and Stroke, leading to \n     the creation of Regional Medical Programs established ``to \n     encourage and assist in the establishment of regional \n     cooperative arrangements among medical schools, research \n     institutions, and hospitals, for research and training''.\n       (12) In the mid-1960's, Dr. DeBakey pioneered the field of \n     telemedicine with the first demonstration of open-heart \n     surgery to be transmitted overseas by satellite.\n       (13) In 1969, Dr. DeBakey was elected the first President \n     of Baylor College of Medicine.\n       (14) In 1969, President Lyndon B. Johnson bestowed on Dr. \n     DeBakey the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction, \n     and in 1985, President Ronald Reagan conferred on him the \n     National Medal of Science.\n       (15) Working with NASA engineers, he refined existing \n     technology to create the DeBakey Ventricular Assist Device, \n     one-tenth the size of current versions, which may eliminate \n     the need for heart transplantation in some patients.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate \n     shall make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on \n     behalf of the Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate \n     design, to Michael Ellis DeBakey, M.D., in recognition of his \n     many outstanding contributions to the Nation.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the presentation \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (referred to in this Act as the ``Secretary'') shall strike a \n     gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and inscriptions \n     to be determined by the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior and the \nSecretary of Agriculture to jointly conduct a study of certain land \nadjacent to the Walnut Canyon National Monument in the State of \nArizona; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nauthorize a special land resource study for the Walnut Canyon National \nMonument in Arizona. The study is intended to evaluate whether Federal \nand State lands adjacent to the monument should be managed as part of \nthe monument, and to provide recommendations for management options.\n  For several years, local communities adjacent to the Walnut Canyon \nNational Monument have debated whether the land surrounding the \nmonument would be best served by protection from future development and \nmanaged by the U.S. Forest Service or the National Park Service. The \nCoconino County Board and the Flagstaff City Council have passed \nresolutions concluding that the preferred method to determine what is \nbest for the land surrounding the Walnut Canyon National Monument is by \nhaving a Federal study conducted. The recommendations from such a study \nwould resolve the question of future management and whether the \nmonument should be expanded.\n  The legislation also directs the Secretary of the Interior and the \nSecretary of Agriculture to provide recommendations for management \noptions for maintenance of the public uses and protection of resources \nof the study area.\n  This legislation would provide a mechanism for determining the \nmanagement options for one of Arizona's high uses scenic areas and \nprotect the natural resources of this incredibly beautiful monument. \nTherefore, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Sessions, and \n        Mr. Chambliss):\n  S. 2443. A bill to reform the judicial review process of orders of \nremoval for purposes of the Immigration and Nationality Act; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fairness in \nImmigration Litigation Act. The purpose of the Fairness in Immigration \nLitigation Act is to reform the statutory scheme governing judicial \nreview of immigration removal orders. Currently, we have an absurd \nsituation in which criminal aliens are entitled to\n\n[[Page S5803]]\n\nmore review and have more opportunities to file frivolous dilatory \nappeals than non-criminal aliens. The legislation which I am \nintroducing will streamline the process of reviewing final \nadministrative immigration orders, thereby eliminating such unfair \nresults under the current statutory scheme.\n  In 1961, Congress amended Section 106 of the Immigration and \nNationality Act, or INA, to specify the circumstances under which final \norders of deportation and exclusion could be reviewed in the federal \ncourts. The statute provided that petitions for review in the circuit \ncourts of appeal were the ``sole and exclusive'' procedure for \nreviewing deportation orders, and that habeas corpus was available only \nto challenge exclusion orders of the custodial aspects of immigration \ndetention. The jurisprudence was settled that there were no alternative \nor additional avenues of judicial review of immigration orders beyond \nthose provided in Section 106.\n  In 1996, seeking to provide for the more efficient and expeditious \nremoval of aliens who commit serious crimes in the United States, \nCongress attempted to streamline the judicial review of immigration \norders against such aliens. Passed by wide, bipartisan margins, the \nIllegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) \neliminated judicial review of immigration orders for most criminals. \nIIRIRA recognized that criminal aliens had already received a full \nmeasure of due process in their criminal cases, as well as in their \nimmigration proceedings, and that additional review typically only \nserved to delay their inevitable removal.\n  However, because the 1996 reforms lacked express language precluding \nhabeas corpus review, the Supreme Court decided in INS v. St. Cyr that \nhabeas review remained available to criminal aliens other than or in \naddition to the review specified in the INA. Consequently, under \ncurrent law, criminal aliens may seek habeas review of their \ndeportation orders in district courts and then appeal adverse decisions \nto the courts of appeals. By contrast, non-criminal aliens are governed \nby INA Sec. 242, and must appeal directly to the court of appeals \nwithout the additional layer of review in the district courts. The \nresult is that criminal aliens who have no claim to relief from \ndeportation file frivolous petitions, causing serious delay in securing \nfinal judgment against them. This is a complete perversion of the \nreforms intended by Congress in 1996, and it must be corrected.\n\n  Let me illustrate the extent of the problem. In 1995, just before \nIIRIRA's enactment, there were 403 immigration habeas petitions filed. \nIn 2003, that number rose to 2,374. Over the same period, the total \nnumber of immigration-related cases in federal courts rose from 1,939 \nto 11,906. This is after Congress passed a law to limit the review for \ncriminal aliens. Clearly, the intent of Congress has been frustrated.\n  Consistent with the settled principled that petitions for review \nshould be the ``sole and exclusive'' means of judicial review for \naliens challenging their removal (as reaffirmed in 8 U.S.C. \nSec. 1252(b)(9) requiring that all issues pertaining to removal orders \nbe brought to the circuit courts of appeal), the Fairness in \nImmigration Litigation Act streamlines immigration review and protects \nan alien's right to review by an independent judiciary. It also ensures \nthat even criminal aliens may receive review of pure questions of law \nand Constitutional claims, as dictated by the Supreme Court in S. Cyr.\n  With the expanded subject matter jurisdiction in the courts of \nappeals, the proposed legislation will eliminate the confusing, and \nindeed inequitable practice of allowing criminal aliens to obtain an \nadditional layer of review through habeas corpus petitions. This \nlegislation is fully consistent with both the Supreme Court's decision \nin S. Cyr and settled jurisprudence regarding the availability of \nhabeas corpus. These reforms will ensure that aliens will have their \nday in court, and ensures that the law does not place criminals in a \nposition that is superior to non-criminals. In sum, the Act restores \norder to the judicial review process in the courts as well as fairness \nfor alien petitioners.\n  Moreover, the deportation proceedings too often are frustrated by \nactivist judges who place unreasonable burdens on the government to \nshow why a lawfully issued deportation order should be enforced, and \nwho stop the lawful execution of deportation orders even though the \naliens have advanced no legal basis to challenge the deportation order. \nSuch activism combined with murkiness in the law have slowed and in \nsome cases halted the government's ability to deport criminal aliens \nand others who have no right to stay. It is time we clarify the law so \nthat the government can effectively deport those who should be \ndeported.\n\n  Often, we hear complaints that the government is not doing enough to \nprotect our borders against illegal entry, and that we need to do more \nto catch and deport the illegal aliens who have made their way into our \ncountry. Without question, sealing our borders and arresting every \nillegal alien is a monumental undertaking. But with this legislation, \nwe can easily address the immediate problem of removing the illegal \naliens that we already have in the system, and sometimes even in our \ncustody.\n  I want to emphasize that the Fairness in Immigration Litigation Act \ndoes not abridge an immigration detainee's right to challenge actual, \nphysical custody through a habeas corpus petition. It is not my \nintention at all to take away the habeas petition as a legitimate way \nto challenge physical custody. Instead, this legislation narrowly \napplies to judicial review of final agency orders of removal, which \ninvolve legal issues that should be reviewed through a petition for \nreview by the court of appeals.\n  I further want to emphasize that nothing in this legislation deprives \ndeportable aliens of all the procedural and substantive due process \nthat the Supreme Court said was required. It simply bars unnecessary \ndelays through collateral attacks. In fact, the only ones who are \naffected by this bill are criminals who have had their review, but who \nwant to avoid enforcement of their deportation orders by initiating \ndilatory, collateral attacks, and perhaps their lawyers who charge \nthousands of dollars to file petitions that they know to be without \nmerit.\n  In sum, the legislation which I am introducing today will expand the \nsubject matter jurisdiction of the court of appeals so that criminal \naliens will receive the judicial review to which they are entitled \naccording to St. Cyr. At the same time, the legislation will streamline \nthe process so that we no longer have the absurd result of criminals \ngetting more protection than non-criminals. The legislation also will \nreduce the possibility that criminals who are without any statutory \nrelief from deportation can abuse the system by filing frivolous \npetitions solely to delay their eventual removal from the United \nStates. Furthermore, the legislation will properly place the burden of \nshowing eligibility for relief from deportation upon the applicants for \nrelief, and will clarify our statute so that the government can more \neffectively execute deportation orders without encountering the \nobstacles that ambiguous statutes have created.\n  I ask for the support of my colleagues in passing the Fairness in \nImmigration Litigation Act, which will restore procedural fairness for \nall immigrants, but will significantly reduce the backlog in our \njudicial system created by frivolous and dilatory appeals.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Santorum, and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 2447. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize \nfunding for the establishment of a program on children and the media \nwithin the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development to \nstudy the role and impact of electronic media in the development of \nchildren; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce, along with \nSenators Brownback, Clinton, Santorum and Landrieu, the Children and \nMedia Research Advancement Act, or CAMRA Act. Mr. President, we believe \nthere is an urgent need to establish a Federal role for targeting \nresearch on the impact of media on children. Almost 5 years ago, the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics recommended no television viewing for \nchildren under the age of 2. They subsequently recommended limiting all \nscreen time exposure, including television, videos, computer and video \ngames, to 1-2 hours per day for\n\n[[Page S5804]]\n\nolder children. The Academy based these decisions on their best sense \nof how to facilitate the healthy development of children. However, not \nenough research had been conducted in this area to know if these \nparticular recommendations were good advice or not. Five years later, \nwe still have very limited information about the role of media, \nparticularly the role of digital media, in very early development. Why \nnot? None of our Federal agencies are charged with ensuring an ongoing \nfunding base for a coherent research agenda about the role of media in \nchildren's lives.\n  From the cradle to the grave, we now live and develop in a world of \nmedia--a world that is increasingly digital, and a world where access \nis at our fingertips. This emerging digital world is well known to our \nchildren, but its effects on their development are not well understood. \nFrom ages 2-18, children are spending an average of 5 and a half hours \nwith media each day. For those who are under age 6, 2 hours of exposure \nto screen media each day is common, even for those who are under age 2. \nThat is about as much time as children under age 6 spend playing \noutdoors, and it is much more time than they spend reading or being \nread to by their parents. How does this investment of time affect their \ndevelopment? We have all wondered about the answer to this question.\n  Take the Columbine incident. After two adolescent boys shot and \nkilled some of their teachers, classmates, and then turned their guns \non themselves at Columbine High School, we asked ourselves if media \nplayed some role in this tragedy. Did these boys learn to kill in part \nfrom playing first-person shooter video games like Doom where they \nacted as a killer? Were they rehearsing criminal activities when \nplaying this game? We looked to the research community for an answer. \nIn the violence and media area, we had invested in research more so \nthan in any other area, and as a result, we knew more. Therefore, some \nanswers were forthcoming about how this tragedy could have taken place \nas well as steps that could be taken, such as media education programs, \nwhich could prevent similar events from happening in the future. Even \nso, there is still a considerable amount of speculation about the more \ncomplex questions. Why did these particular boys, for example, pull the \ntrigger in real life while others who played Doom confine their \naggressive acts to the gaming context?\n  Consider the national health problem of childhood obesity. Does time \nspent viewing screens and its accompanying sedentary life styles \ncontribute to childhood obesity? Or is the constant bombardment of \nadvertisements for sugar-coated cereals, snack foods, and candy that \npervade children's television advertisements the culprit? What will \nhappen when pop-up advertisements begin to appear on children's cell \nphones that specifically target them for the junk food that they like \nbest? The answer to the obesity and media question is also complex. We \nneed more answers.\n  A recent report linked very early television viewing with later \nsymptoms that are common in children who have attention deficit \ndisorders. Does television viewing cause attention deficits, or do \nchildren who have attention deficits find television viewing \nexperiences more engaging than kids who don't have attention problems? \nOr do parents whose children have difficulty sustaining attention let \nthem watch more television to encourage more sitting and less \nhyperactive behavior? How will Internet experiences, particularly those \nwhere children move rapidly across different windows, influence \nattention patterns and attention problems? Once again, we don't know \nthe answer.\n  Many of us find that our children are becoming increasingly \nmaterialistic. Does exposure to commercial advertising and even the \n``good life'' experienced by media characters partly explain \nmaterialistic attitudes? We're not sure. What will happen when our \nchildren will be able to click on their television screen and go \ndirectly to sites that advertise the products that they see in those \nfavorite programs?\n  Many of us believe that time spent with computers is good for our \nchildren, teaching them the skills that they will need for success in \nthe 21st century. Are we right?\n  How is time spent with computers different from time spent with \ntelevision? Is the time spent with media the key to success, or is the \ncontent?\n  The questions about how media affect the development of our children \nare clearly important, abundant, and complex. Unfortunately, the \nanswers to these questions are in short supply. Such gaps in our \nknowledge base limit our ability to make informed decisions about media \npolicy.\n  We know that media are important. Over the years, we have held \nnumerous hearings in these chambers about how exposure to media \nviolence affects childhood aggression. We have passed legislation to \nmaximize the documented benefits of exposure to educational media, such \nas the Children's Television Act which requires broadcasters to provide \neducational and informational television programs for children. We \nacted to protect our children from harm by passing the Children's \nOnline Privacy Protection Act which provides safeguards from commercial \nexploitation for our youth as they explore the Internet, a popular \npastime for them. But there are many areas where our understanding is \npreliminary at best, particularly those that involve the effect of our \nnewer digital media. For example, we have passed numerous laws about \nsexually explicit content, such as the Communications Decency Act, the \nChild Online Protection Act, and the Children's Internet Protection Act \nto shield children from exposure to online content that is deemed \nharmful to minors. However, we know very little about how this kind of \nexposure affects children's development or about how to prevent \nchildren from falling prey to adult strangers who approach them online.\n  In order to ensure that we are doing our very best for our children, \nthe behavioral and health recommendations and public policy decisions \nwe make should be based on objective behavioral, social, and scientific \nresearch. Yet no Federal research agency has responsibility for \noverseeing and setting a coherent media research agenda that can guide \nthese policy decisions. Instead, Federal agencies fund media research \nin a piece meal fashion, resulting in a patch work quilt of findings. \nWe can do better than that.\n  The bill we are introducing today would remedy this problem. The \nCAMRA Act will provide an overarching view of media effects by \nestablishing a program on Children and Media within the National \nInstitute of Child Health and Human Development. This program of \nresearch, to be vetted by the National Academy of Sciences, will fund \nand energize a coherent program of research that illuminates the role \nof media in children's cognitive, social, emotional, physical, and \nbehavioral development. The research will cover all forms of electronic \nmedia, including television, movies, DVDs, interactive video games, and \nthe Internet and will encourage research with children of all ages--\neven babies and toddlers. The bill also calls for a report to Congress \nabout the effectiveness of this research program in filling this void \nin our knowledge base. In order to accomplish these goals, we are \nauthorizing $90 million dollars to be phased in gradually across the \nnext five years. The cost to our budget is minimal. The benefits to our \nyouth and our nation's families are immeasurable.\n  Our children live in the information age. Our nation has one of the \nmost powerful and sophisticated information technology systems in the \nworld. While this system entertains us, it is not harmless \nentertainment. Media have the potential to facilitate the healthy \ngrowth of our children. They also have the potential to harm. We have a \nstake in finding out exactly what that role is. Access to that \nknowledge requires us to make an investment: an investment in research, \nan investment in and for our children, an investment in our collective \nfuture.\n  By passing the Children and Media Research Advancement Act, we can \nadvance knowledge and enhance the constructive effects of media while \nminimizing the negative ones. We can make future media policies that \nare grounded in a solid knowledge base. We can be proactive, rather \nthan reactive. In so doing, we build a better nation for our youth, and \nwe create a better foundation to guide future media policies about the \ndigital experiences that pervade our children's daily lives.\n\n[[Page S5805]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2447\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Children and Media Research \n     Advancement Act'' or the ``CAMRA Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Congress has recognized the important role of \n     electronic media in children's lives when it passed the \n     Children's Television Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-437) and \n     the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-104), both \n     of which documented public concerns about how electronic \n     media products influence children's development.\n       (2) Congress has held hearings over the past several \n     decades to examine the impact of specific types of media \n     products such as violent television, movies, and video games \n     on children's health and development. These hearings and \n     other public discussions about the role of media in \n     children's development require behavioral and social science \n     research to inform the policy deliberations.\n       (3) There are important gaps in our knowledge about the \n     role of electronic media and in particular, the newer \n     interactive digital media, in children's healthy development. \n     The consequences of very early screen usage by babies and \n     toddlers on children's cognitive growth are not yet \n     understood, nor has a research base been established on the \n     psychological consequences of high definition interactive \n     media and other format differences for child viewers.\n       (4) Studies have shown that children who primarily watch \n     educational shows on television during their preschool years \n     are significantly more successful in school 10 years later \n     even when critical contributors to the child's environment \n     are factored in, including their household income, parents \n     education, and intelligence.\n       (5) The early stages of child development are a critical \n     formative period. Virtually every aspect of human development \n     is affected by the environments and experiences that one \n     encounters during his or her early childhood years, and media \n     exposure is an increasing part of every child's social and \n     physical environment.\n       (6) As of the late 1990's, just before the National \n     Institute of Child Health and Human Development funded 5 \n     studies on the role of sexual messages in the media on \n     children and adolescents sexual attitudes and sexual \n     practices, a review of research in this area found only 15 \n     studies ever conducted in the United States on this topic, \n     even during a time of growing concerns about HIV infection.\n       (7) In 2001, a National Academy of Sciences study group \n     charged with finding solutions to Internet pornography \n     exposure on youth found virtually no literature about how \n     much children and adolescents were exposed to Internet \n     pornography or how such content impacts youth.\n       (8) In order to develop strategies that maximize the \n     positive and minimize the negative effects of each medium on \n     children's physical, cognitive, social, and emotional \n     development, it would be beneficial to develop a research \n     program that can track the media habits of young children and \n     their families over time using valid and reliable research \n     methods.\n       (9) Research about the impact of the media on children is \n     not presently supported through one primary programmatic \n     effort. The responsibility for directing the research is \n     distributed across disparate agencies in an uncoordinated \n     fashion, or is overlooked entirely. The lack of any \n     centralized organization for research minimizes the value of \n     the knowledge produced by individual studies. A more \n     productive approach for generating valuable findings about \n     the impact of the media on children would be to establish a \n     single, well-coordinated research effort with primary \n     responsibility for directing the research agenda.\n       (10) Due to the paucity of research about electronic media, \n     educators and others interested in implementing electronic \n     media literacy initiatives do not have the evidence needed to \n     design, implement, or assess the value of these efforts.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to enable the \n     National Institute of Child Health and Human Development to--\n       (1) examine the role and impact of electronic media in \n     children's cognitive, social, emotional, physical, and \n     behavioral development; and\n       (2) provide for a report to Congress containing the \n     empirical evidence and other results produced by the research \n     funded through grants under this Act.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to join my \ncolleagues and support the Children and Media Research Advancement Act \nor CAMRA. The development of our Nation's children is vital and the way \nin which media impacts their ability to grow and develop is imperative. \nFor many years, I have been concerned about the impact media has on our \nchildren.\n  The Kaiser Family Foundation recently released their report on \nelectronic media in the lives of infants, toddlers, and preschoolers--\nages 0 to 6 years old. Not surprisingly, the study found that children \ntoday are reared in a media saturated environment.\n  According to the study, 99 percent of all children live in a home \nwith a TV set and 50 percent of these children live in a home with \nthree or more TVs of which 36 percent have a TV in their bedroom.\n  Perhaps even more startling, 30 percent of children ages zero to \nthree years and 43 percent of four to six year olds have a TV in their \nbedroom. Additionally, 27 percent of children have their own VCR or DVD \nplayer in their rooms and 10 percent have their own video game console \nin their room as well.\n  Further, 73 percent of children ages 0 to 6 have a computer at home, \nand 49 percent of these young people have a video game player.\n  Even more concerning is that the American Academy of Pediatrics \nrecommends that children under two do not watch any television. The \nAcademy further states that all children over two should be limited to \none or two hours of educational screen media a day.\n  However, despite this recommendation, the Kaiser study found that in \na typical day, 68 percent of all children under two use screen media--\n59 percent watch TV, 42 percent watch a video or DVD, five percent use \ncomputers and three percent play video games. The study also found that \n74 percent of all infants and toddlers have watched TV before the age \nof two.\n  Unfortunately, there is a lack of comprehensive research that \nprovides detailed data on the relationship between media and brain \ndevelopment in children. That is why I am pleased to support the \nChildren and Media Research Advancement Act. This will not only \nencourage much needed research in this area, but will also serve to \ncoordinate such research.\n  Providing parents and guardians with the most accurate information \nregarding the impact media has on their children is essential--to do \nanything less would be reprehensible.\n  Already many studies--including ones that followed children from age \n8 until mid-adulthood (age 30 plus years)--have demonstrated a link \nbetween early exposure to entertainment violence and aggressive \nattitudes, values and behaviors, including increased levels of violent \ncrime against others.\n  There are three main effects on children of viewing entertainment \nviolence: aggression more likely to think and behave aggressively, and \nhold attitudes and values favorable to the use of aggression to resolve \nconflicts; desensitization decreased sensitivity to violence and a \ngreater willingness to tolerate increasing levels of violence in \nsociety; fear viewers may develop the ``mean world syndrome'' in which \nthey overestimate their risk of becoming victims of violence.\n  Even in the Kaiser study I referenced earlier, among all parents \nwhose zero to six year olds watched TV, 81 percent said that they saw \ntheir children imitate behaviors from television--36 percent of parents \nreported that their children mimicked aggressive behavior, 78 percent \nmimicked positive behavior. When focusing on the four to six year age \ngroup, mimicking aggressive behaviors increase to nearly half or 47 \npercent, with aggressive behavior being imitated more frequently with \nboys, 59 percent than with girls at 35 percent.\n  Clearly, we must continue to encourage and fund studies that will \nshow the effects media has on the development of the adolescent brain. \nI am pleased that CAMRA will encourage this much-needed research in \nsuch a crucial area.\n  Protecting our nation's children and ensuring that parents have the \nmost accurate and complete information on the effects of media on their \nchildren should remain our top priority. I look forward to working with \nSenators Lieberman and Clinton on an issue that is vital to our \nsociety.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to join with my colleagues \nSenators Lieberman and Brownback in introducing the Children and Media \nResearch Advancement Act (CAMRA).\n  Children today are living in an environment that is saturated with \nelectronic media. Even in the last few years, we've seen a dramatic \nincrease in media targeted directly at children. There's now a booming \nmarket of DVDs and videos for infants and the first TV show \nspecifically for children as young as 12 months was launched a few \nyears back. Kids today even have their own cable TV network.\n  Researchers estimate that children spend an average of five-and-a-\nhalf hours a day using these media--this works out to more than they \nspend doing anything besides sleeping. Even kids under six spend as \nmuch time watching TV and videos, playing video games, and using \ncomputers as they do playing outside. Unfortunately, we don't really \nknow how this trend affects our children. But we do know that a child's \nearly years affect every aspect of his or her development--physical, \nemotional, and cognitive. And therefore, we know that ignorance is not \nbliss.\n  The longer we wait to understand the full impact of media on our \nchildren, the bigger risk we take. And we are gambling with our \nchildren's future. Parents need to know how television, movies, \nadvertisements, video games, and the Internet affect their children so \nthat they can make informed decisions about how much and what kind of \nmedia their children should be exposed to.\n  As parents, we know intuitively that our young children shouldn't be \nwatching television shows with extreme violence or age-inappropriate \ncontent. But there are other issues we aren't so sure about. How much \nvideo game playing is too much? Do advertisements for cereals and junk \nfoods contribute to childhood obesity? How are our very young children \nand infants impacted by media? Right now we have little idea of what it \nmeans for infant development to put babies in front of TVs for hours at \na time, but we know that sometimes popping in a video is the best and \nonly way to calm our children down.\n  Our bill, The Children and Media Research Advancement Act, will help \nanswer these questions by establishing a single, coordinated research \nprogram at the National Institute of Child Health and Human \nDevelopment. This program will study the impact of electronic media on \nchildren's--particularly very young children and infant's--cognitive, \nsocial and physical development.\n  One of the first things the program will do will be to work with the \nNational Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine to establish \nan independent panel of experts to review and synthesize existing \nresearch and to establish research priorities on the impact of the \nmedia on child development. They'll then award grants for research that \naddresses the panel's priorities.\n  If we are truly going to make children a priority, we have to pay \nattention to and take seriously the activities they're engaged in on a \ndaily basis. Watching television, playing video games, and surfing the \nInternet are the things that children are doing more than anything \nelse.

A bill to coordinate rights under the Uniformed Services \nEmployment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 with other Federal laws; \nread the first time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, military action in Afghanistan and Iraq has \nbrought to light yet another example of how outdated and burdensome \ngovernment policies often punish generous employers in America. \nApparently, when it comes to companies showing respect for employees \nwho are called to active duty in the military, there is special meaning \nto the old cliche that ``no good deed goes unpunished.''\n  An arcane IRS interpretation of tax law actually penalizes employers \nthat\n\n[[Page S5807]]\n\nvoluntarily pay their National Guard and reservist employees the \ndifference between these patriots' military stipends and their previous \ncivilian salaries--which appropriately is called ``differential pay.'' \nThe law also penalizes employers that continue making contributions to \nretirement plans for such employees.\n  According to the IRS, members of the Guard and reserves called up for \nactive duty are required to be treated as if they are on a leave of \nabsence by their employers under the Uniformed Services Employment and \nReemployment Rights Act of 1994--USERRA. Therefore, the act does not \nrequire employers to pay workers who are on active duty. However, many \nemployers--out of a sense of civic duty--continue to pay active duty \nGuard members and reservists the difference between their military \nstipends and their regular salaries with some employers providing such \n``differential pay'' for up to three years. In additions, many of these \nremarkable companies go even further and allow their active duty \nemployees to continue making contributions to their 401(k) retirement \nplans via deductions from the ``differential payments.''\n  However, rather than applauding and encouraging such selfless \nbehavior by companies, the IRS's 1969 Revenue Ruling requires that the \nactive duty workers be treated as if they were ``terminated.'' As a \nresult, this law then puts at risk the retirement plan for an \nemployers' entire workforce and could make all amounts in the plan \nimmediately taxable to the plan's participants and the employer. Adding \nto the absurdity of the situation, preventing an employer from treating \n``differential pay'' as wages under the law means employers are \nprohibited from withholding income taxes, which in turn causes their \nactive duty former employees to face large and unexpected tax bills at \nthe end of the year.\n  The Uniformed Services Differential Pay Protection Act simply amends \nUSERRA to clarify that differential payments are to be treated as \n``wages'' to current employees and that retirement plan contributions \nfrom such ``wages'' are permissible. The bill upholds the principle \nthat these patriotic and truly remarkable employers should not be \npenalized for the selfless generosity they provide to our Nation's \nreservists and members of the National Guard.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 2449. A bill to require congressional renewal of trade and travel \nrestrictions with respect to Cuba; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. Baucus. Mr. President, I rise today in disbelief. Yesterday, I \nlearned that a NAFTA panel reviewing the International Trade \nCommission's (ITC) analysis of material inquiry in Softwood Lumber from \nCanada has rejected an ITC request for more time to respond to a panel \nremand. This latest rejection of a reasonable request is simply one \nmore circumstance in which this NAFTA panel has demonstrated its clear \ndisregard of the limits of its own jurisdiction. And it provides \nfurther indication to me that the NAFTA Chapter 19 system is seriously \noff-track and is in need of fundamental reform.\n  After reviewing the ITC's first remand determination, a 114 page long \ndocument that answered all of the Panel's remand issues, the Panel \nyesterday again remanded, and gave the ITC, in effect, seven business \ndays to craft a new remand determination. The ITC filed a motion to \nextend, requesting a reasonable period of time to respond fully to the \nremand determination. The ITC further noted that it would consider \nreopening the record for new evidence and argument. In fact, the \nFederal Circuit just several months ago said that the Commission had \nthe exclusive authority to open its record when it believed it should \ndo so.\n  Outrageously, the NAFTA panel refused to grant the ITC's request, \nagain limiting the ITC to seven business days. Moreover, this runaway \npanel forbade the ITC from reopening the record, concluding that \nbinding Federal Circuit precedent did not apply in the Panel.\n  On top of all of this, I understand that U.S.T.R. suggested to the \nCanadians that there is the appearance of a conflict of interest for \none of the panelists.\n  The NAFTA rules could not be more clear: Chapter 19 Panels must act \nas would a U.S. court and must follow U.S. law. Panelists with a \nconflict of interest must step down. And the Federal Circuit has ruled, \nwithout reservation or qualification, that the question of whether \ncompliance with a remand order requires the reopening of the record \n``is of course solely for the Commission itself to determine.'' Nippon \nSteel Corp. v. Int'l Trade Comm'n, 345 F.3d 1379, 1382 (Fed. Cir. \n2003). It is outrageous that a NAFTA panel would seek to avoid binding \nU.S. law.\n  All I can say to this very sorry state of affairs is that I don't \nthink Congress will long allow a dispute settlement panel to rewrite \nperfectly valid trade laws or preempt the powers delegated to the ITC, \nmuch less tolerate a dispute settlement system in which panels \nwillfully and routinely breach the clear mandate of their authority \nthat is itself the product of careful negotiation. This NAFTA panel has \nshown us that they cannot be trusted to respect the integrity of the \nNAFTA trading system. They have also shown us that the NAFTA panel \nsystem is broken and that it must be fixed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 2450. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to revise the \nrequirements for award of the Combat Infantryman Badge and the Combat \nMedical Badge with respect to service in Korea after July 28, 1953; to \nthe Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Korean \nDefense Service Combat Recognition Act of 2004 which would amend Title \n10, United States Code, to revise the requirements for award of the \nCombat Infantryman Badge and the Combat Medical Badge with respect to \nservice in Korea after July 28, 1953.\n  The Army awards the Combat Infantry Badge (CIB) to recognize members \nof infantry units who have been engaged in ground combat. The Combat \nMedical Badge (CMB) recognizes field medics who accompany infantry \ntroops into battle. A 1968 Army regulation makes it much more difficult \nfor U.S. troops serving in South Korea to be awarded the CIB or CMB \nthan for troops serving almost anywhere else in the world. \nSpecifically, infantrymen stationed in South Korea must be in five \nfirefights in order to qualify for the awards. In other combat zones, \nthe requirement is one firefight.\n  In addition, to be awarded the medals, troops in South Korea must \nalso have served in theater for sixty days in a hostile fire area, be \nauthorized hostile fire pay, and be recommended by each superior up the \nchain-of-command to the division level.\n  My bill normalizes the rules so that all troops, no matter where they \nserve, are subject to the same eligibility requirements for these two \nprestigious medals.\n  Unfortunately, the Army regulation has had the unintended consequence \nof making it extra difficult for infantry and medical units serving \nalong the DMZ in South Korea to earn combat recognition medals. A \nspokesman for the Korean Defense Veterans of America (KDVA) has \ndescribed these requirements as making it nearly impossible to be \nawarded the CIB for infantrymen serving in Korea, short of getting \nkilled in combat. The KDVA is a group of veterans and active soldiers \nwho are serving, or who have served, in South Korea since 1953.\n  This language is supported by the KDVA and the Combat Infantryman's \nAssociation. The Combat Infantryman's Association is a group of Army \ninfantrymen who have been awarded the Combat Infantry Badge.\n  It is unfair and wrong to require five firefights in South Korea, but \nonly one firefight in Grenada, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Laos, \nVietnam, and almost every other location in the world. The Korean \nDefense Service Combat Recognition Act of 2004 normalizes the rules so \nthat all troops, no matter where they serve, are subject to the same \neligibility requirements for these two prestigious medals.\n  I urge my colleagues to support its passage and ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5808]]\n\n                                S. 2450\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 365\n\n       Whereas, for more than 1,000 years, Tibet has maintained a \n     sovereign national identity that is distinct from the \n     national identity of China;\n       Whereas armed forces of the People's Republic of China \n     invaded Tibet in 1949 and 1950, and have occupied it ever \n     since;\n       Whereas, according to the Department of State and \n     international human rights organizations, the Government of \n     the People's Republic of China continues to commit widespread \n     and well-documented human rights abuses in Tibet;\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China has yet to \n     demonstrate its willingness to abide by internationally \n     accepted standards of freedom of belief, expression, and \n     association by repealing or amending laws and decrees that \n     restrict those freedoms;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     has detained hundreds of Tibetan nuns, monks, and lay persons \n     as political prisoners for speaking out against China's \n     occupation of Tibet and for their efforts to preserve Tibet's \n     distinct national identity;\n       Whereas Phuntsog Nyidron was arrested on October 14, 1989, \n     together with 5 other nuns, for participating in a peaceful \n     protest against China's occupation of Tibet;\n       Whereas, on February 26, 2004, following a sustained \n     international campaign on her behalf, the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China released Phuntsog Nyidron from \n     detention after she served more than 14 years of her 16-year \n     sentence;\n       Whereas Tenzin Delek, a prominent Tibetan religious leader, \n     and 3 other monks were arrested on April 7, 2002, during a \n     nighttime raid on Jamyang Choekhorling monastery in Nyagchu \n     County, Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture;\n       Whereas, following a closed trial and more than 8 months of \n     incommunicado detention, Tenzin Delek and another Tibetan, \n     Lobsang Dhondup, were convicted of inciting separatism and \n     for their alleged involvement in a series of bombings on \n     December 2, 2002;\n       Whereas Lobsang Dhondup was sentenced to death and Tenzin \n     Delek was sentenced to death with a 2-year suspension;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     promised senior officials of the United States and other \n     governments that the cases of Lobsang Dhondup and Tenzin \n     Delek would be subjected to a ``lengthy review'' by the \n     Supreme People's Court prior to the death sentences being \n     carried out;\n       Whereas the Supreme People's Court never carried out the \n     promised review, and Lobsang Dhondup was executed on January \n     26, 2003;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     has failed to produce any evidence that either Lobsang \n     Dhondup or Tenzin Delek were involved in the crimes for which \n     they were convicted, despite repeated requests from officials \n     of the United States and other governments;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     continues to imprison Tibetans for engaging in peaceful \n     efforts to protest China's occupation of Tibet and preserve \n     the Tibetan identity;\n       Whereas Tibetan political prisoners are routinely subjected \n     to beatings, electric shock, solitary confinement, and other \n     forms of torture and inhumane treatment while in Chinese \n     custody;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     continues to exert control over religious and cultural \n     institutions in Tibet, abusing human rights through the \n     torture, arbitrary arrest, and detention without fair or \n     public trial of Tibetans who peacefully express their \n     political or religious views or attempt to preserve the \n     unique Tibetan identity; and\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     has paroled individual political prisoners for good behavior \n     or for medical reasons in the face of strong international \n     pressure, but has failed to make the systemic changes \n     necessary to provide minimum standards of due process or \n     protections for basic civil and political rights: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Government of the People's Republic of China is in \n     violation of international human rights standards by \n     detaining and mistreating Tibetans who engage in peaceful \n     activities to protest China's occupation of Tibet or promote \n     the preservation of a distinct Tibetan identity;\n       (2) sustained international pressure on the Government of \n     the People's Republic of China is essential to improve the \n     human rights situation in Tibet and secure the release of \n     Tibetan political prisoners;\n       (3) the Government of the United States should--\n       (A) raise the cases of Tenzin Delek and other Tibetan \n     political prisoners in every meeting with officials from the \n     People's Republic of China; and\n       (B) work with other governments concerned about human \n     rights in Tibet and China to encourage the release of Tibetan \n     political prisoners and promote systemic improvement of human \n     rights in Tibet and China; and\n       (4) the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     should, as a gesture of goodwill and in order to promote \n     human rights, immediately release all Tibetan political \n     prisoners, including Tenzin Delek.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today I am introducing a resolution \nwith my colleague, Senator Bingaman, calling on the Chinese Government \nto release all Tibetan political prisoners. One individual of concern \nis the prominent religious leader Tenzen Delek.\n  On April 7, 2002 Tenzen Delek and 3 other monks were arrested at \ntheir monastery. Subsequently, Tenzen was held incommunicado for 8 \nmonths and sentenced to death with a two years suspension after a \nclosed door trial. Tenzen Delek and Lobsang Dhondup were both convicted \nof inciting separatism. Lobsang Dhondup was sentenced to death and \nexecuted on January 26, 2003, only one month after the sentence was \nhanded down. Given the arbitrary and political nature of China's \njudiciary, Tenzen Delek could be put to death at any time. It has been \n2 years since his April 7, 2002 arrest, and December 2004 will mark two \nyears since he was sentenced to death.\n  Tenzen Delek moved to a monastery at the young age of 7, and by early \nadulthood he was active on issues of culture and religion and a \ndedicated supporter of the Dalai Lama and his teachings. More than \nlikely, his community work and societal influence left him subject to \nthe suspicion of the Chinese government. It is this sort of peaceful \nprotest of China's occupation of Tibet that has landed so many other \nTibetans in jail.\n  Mr. President, this resolution recognizes China's violation of \ninternationally recognized human rights standards, and calls on the \nChinese government to release Tenzen Delek and the\n\n[[Page S5809]]\n\nother Tibetans who remain in jail. Phuntsog Nyidron is a prominent \nTibetan nun who was arrested in 1989 for her peaceful protest of the \npolitical situation and remained in jail for 14 years. Just this \nFebruary she was freed after the House passed a similar resolution \ncalling for her release. The International Campaign for Tibet estimates \nthat there are 150 political prisoners in Tibet, and 75 percent of them \nare monks and nuns. Those unfortunate enough to find themselves in a \nChinese prison are often subjected to physical and mental torture, and \nisolation. Many of them do not make it out of custody alive.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring this \nresolution. For more than 50 years the Tibetan people have struggled to \npreserve their 1,000 year old sovereign national identity. The Chinese \noccupation that began in 1949 brought with it the subjugation of the \nTibetan people at the hand of the People's Liberation Army, destruction \nof thousands of monasteries and shrines, a prohibition against \npracticing the Buddhist faith and Chinese migration--all aimed at \ndestroying Tibetan culture, language and religion. The United States \nmust confront continued Chinese repression of the practice of all \nfaiths in China, and this resolution does exactly that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/19/senate-section/article/S5809-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5809-S5810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3176.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The incidence of violence motivated by the actual or \n     perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, \n     sexual orientation, or disability of the victim poses a \n     serious national problem.\n       (2) Such violence disrupts the tranquility and safety of \n     communities and is deeply divisive.\n       (3) State and local authorities are now and will continue \n     to be responsible for prosecuting the overwhelming majority \n     of violent crimes in the United States, including violent \n     crimes motivated by bias. These authorities can carry out \n     their responsibilities more effectively with greater Federal \n     assistance.\n       (4) Existing Federal law is inadequate to address this \n     problem.\n       (5) The prominent characteristic of a violent crime \n     motivated by bias is that it devastates not just the actual \n     victim and the family and friends of the victim, but \n     frequently savages the community sharing the traits that \n     caused the victim to be selected.\n       (6) Such violence substantially affects interstate commerce \n     in many ways, including--\n       (A) by impeding the movement of members of targeted groups \n     and forcing such members to move across State lines to escape \n     the incidence or risk of such violence; and\n       (B) by preventing members of targeted groups from \n     purchasing goods and services, obtaining or sustaining \n     employment, or participating in other commercial activity.\n       (7) Perpetrators cross State lines to commit such violence.\n       (8) Channels, facilities, and instrumentalities of \n     interstate commerce are used to facilitate the commission of \n     such violence.\n       (9) Such violence is committed using articles that have \n     traveled in interstate commerce.\n       (10) For generations, the institutions of slavery and \n     involuntary servitude were defined by the race, color, and \n     ancestry of those held in bondage. Slavery and involuntary \n     servitude were enforced, both prior to and after the adoption \n     of the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, through widespread public and private violence \n     directed at persons because of their race, color, or \n     ancestry, or perceived race, color, or ancestry. Accordingly, \n     eliminating racially motivated violence is an important means \n     of eliminating, to the extent possible, the badges, \n     incidents, and relics of slavery and involuntary servitude.\n       (11) Both at the time when the 13th, 14th, and 15th \n     amendments to the Constitution of the United States were \n     adopted, and continuing to date, members of certain religious \n     and national origin groups were and are perceived to be \n     distinct ``races''. Thus, in order to eliminate, to the \n     extent possible, the badges, incidents, and relics of \n     slavery, it is necessary to prohibit assaults on the basis of \n     real or perceived religions or national origins, at least to \n     the extent such religions or national origins were regarded \n     as races at the time of the adoption of the 13th, 14th, and \n     15th amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\n       (12) Federal jurisdiction over certain violent crimes \n     motivated by bias enables Federal, State, and local \n     authorities to work together as partners in the investigation \n     and prosecution of such crimes.\n       (13) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is \n     sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate in nature as \n     to warrant Federal assistance to States and local \n     jurisdictions.\n\n     SEC. __03. DEFINITION OF HATE CRIME.\n\n       In this title, the term ``hate crime'' has the same meaning \n     as in section 280003(a) of the Violent Crime Control and Law \n     Enforcement Act of 1994 (28 U.S.C. 994 note).\n\n     SEC. __04.

Mr. President, I want to discuss with the Democratic \nleader an approach that might enable us to move forward to conference \non S. 1072, the 6-year reauthorization of our Nation's surface \ntransportation laws.\n  While I am proud of the bipartisan agreements reached by the bill's \nmanagers that got us to this point, much work still remains, and it is \nimportant that we start as soon as possible.\n  There are significant differences with the House bill, so this is \nlikely going to be a challenging process. I want to make sure all \nSenators know it is unrealistic to expect the House will agree with all \nour provisions and that we will likely have to make significant changes \nto S. 1072. But as we make those changes, we should make them together.\n  The transportation bill we passed this year was a model of bipartisan \ncooperation that was marked by good faith on both sides. That is the \nessence of the agreement I am proposing, a commitment from both sides \nthat they will work in good faith in conference to get the best \npossible result. I have spoken to Senator Inhofe, who will chair the \nconference. He has agreed he will not pursue a conclusion to the \nconference, nor sign any conference report that would alter the text of \nS. 1072 in a way that undermines the bipartisan working relationship \nthat has existed in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his \nleadership. I have discussed this with my colleagues and can commit \nwholeheartedly to the good-faith process he has proposed. Our side \nunderstands that changes will have to be made, and we are not entering \nthis process demanding a specific outcome on any provision. Instead, we \nare asking any changes to S. 1072 be the result of the mutual agreement \nof the lead Senate conferees acting in good faith.\n  By moving S. 1072 through the Senate, Senators Inhofe, Bond, \nJeffords, and Reid have already demonstrated they can make that process \nwork. If the process should break down due to disagreements over either \ntransportation policy or extraneous provisions, then we understand he \nand I will not bring such a conference report to the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct, so long as the Democratic conferees are \nacting in good faith, and I have every expectation they will. Our goal \nis to reach a conference agreement that reflects the balance and broad \nbipartisan consensus S. 1072 achieves. That will be the test of good \nfaith for both sides. I think we can do that, and we will not bring a \nbill to the Senate floor if it does not reflect that commitment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the leader again for his \nleadership. He has agreement from our side, and we look forward to the \nsuccessful conclusion of this important legislation.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of the House-passed highway bill, H.R. \n3550; provided further that all after the enacting clause be stricken \nand the text of S. 1072, as passed, with the addition of the amendment \nwhich is at the desk, be inserted in lieu thereof; the bill then be \nread a third time and passed; further, the Senate then insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House, and the Chair then be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate with a ratio \nof 11 to 10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Board of Education decision, all \n     Americans are encouraged to observe this anniversary with a \n     commitment to continuing and building on the legacy of Brown.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe concurrent resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 414) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to mark a bittersweet \nanniversary in our Nation's history. Fifty years ago today, the U.S. \nSupreme Court handed down the most important Court decision of the 20th \ncentury and perhaps of all time: Brown v. Board of Education.\n  Fifty years ago today, on May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court unanimously \nruled that ``in the field of public education the doctrine of `separate \nbut equal' has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently \nunequal.''\n  The Brown decision struck down laws that permitted racially \nsegregated schools in 17 states and the District of Columbia. The \nSupreme Court said that such laws violate the fourteenth amendment of \nthe U.S. Constitution--the amendment that was passed after the Civil \nWar to guarantee ``equal protection of the laws.''\n  The day after Brown was handed down, the Chicago Daily Tribune wrote \nthat the idea of educational equality ``may appear dangerously novel to \nsome citizens, but the Supreme Court didn't invent it. Indeed, they can \nbe said to have borrowed it from a distinguished Virginian named Thomas \nJefferson.''\n  A May 19, 1954 editorial in the New York Times stated: ``The Supreme \nCourt's historic decision in the school desegregation cases brings the \nUnited States back into the mainstream of its own best traditions. \nSegregation is a hangover of slavery, and its ugliest manifestation has \nbeen in the schools.''\n  The Brown decision was a victory for equality and a victory for \nAmerica. But many African Americans had a muted reaction to the \ndecision because it was so long overdue. As Richard Kluger wrote in the \nclassic book Simple Justice:\n\n       Too many proclamations of white America's good intentions \n     had reached African Americans' ears in the past to permit \n     premature celebration now. There was added hesitation, no \n     doubt in expressing open glee lest it be taken as a sign of \n     gratitude and thereby provide whites the emotional \n     satisfaction over a deed well done. For, upon analysis, all \n     the Supreme Court had truly and at long last granted to the \n     black man was simple justice.\n\n  The impact of the Brown decision occurred mainly in the South, but \nthe Chicago Daily Sun-Times offered a prescient observation. In a May \n19, 1954 editorial the Sun-Times wrote: ``We of the North would do well \nto apply ourselves with equal diligence and sincerity to our own \nunsolved problems of racial discrimination and prejudice.''\n  Indeed, there were segregated schools in my home State of Illinois in \n1954--the Land of Lincoln. My State had a law that banned racial \nsegregation in our public schools, but there was inadequate \nenforcement.\n  Although we have made great strides over the past century in Illinois \nand in our Nation, we continue to have severe racial disparities in our \npublic school systems--50 years after Brown v. Board of Education.\n  For that reason, the 50th anniversary is bittersweet. In 2004, we see \nthat the racism has not been alleviated. Equal opportunity has not been \nassured.\n  Our schools are not fully integrated. In Illinois, 92 percent of \nwhite children attend majority white schools, and 68 percent of Black \nchildren attend majority Black schools. School segregation for our \nrapidly growing Latino population is on the rise.\n  And our schools are not equal. In Illinois a Black child is about 40 \ntimes more likely to attend a school that has failed to meet State \nstandards for 4 consecutive years, a so-called ``academic watch list'' \nschool. A Latino student is 20 times more likely. But less than 1 \npercent of the White children in Illinois are enrolled at a school on \nthe academic watch list.\n  The Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education stated that equal \naccess to education is a civil right of every citizen. And what a \npromise that was. We believed racial disparities in education would \neventually be erased.\n  In 2001, we realized that this promise had not been realized. We \nenacted No Child Left Behind to try and tackle the enduring problem of \nracial inequality in our public schools. No Child Left Behind requires \nschools to break out test scores by racial and economic categories to \nshow that each segment of a school's population is succeeding.\n  Many of us worked in concert with the more conservative champions of \nthe effort because we believed the law would provide more resources and \nmore opportunities for minority children in public schools.\n  Today schools are struggling to implement the law without the \npromised resources. We have not lived up to the promise of No Child \nLeft Behind. And we have not lived up to the promise of Brown v. Board \nof Education.\n  Many of our schools today are separate and unequal. This \ncommemoration is bittersweet, but we have the means to make it less \nbitter and more sweet.\n  We can live up to the promise of the Brown decision by investing in \nour public schools rather than giving up on them. Giving vouchers to a \nhandful of lucky families only leaves the have-nots in an increasingly \nhopeless situation.\n  We can live up to the promise of Brown by adopting the Student's Bill \nof Rights--requiring an equitable apportionment of funds and qualified \nteachers and small class sizes.\n  We can live up to the promise of Brown by fully funding the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, ensuring that students \nwith disabilities can exercise their right to a public education.\n  We can live up to the promise of Brown by funding No Child Left \nBehind as promised, making it possible for struggling schools to \nimprove the quality of education for all its students.\n  Let us honor the legacy of the Supreme Court's historic decision in \nBrown v. Board of Education by making the appropriate investments in \npublic education and working to ensure equality of opportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/19/senate-section/article/S5848-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5848-S5891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TAX ADMINISTRATION GOOD GOVERNMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I commend the chairman and ranking member \nof the Finance Committee, Senators Grassley and Baucus, for their work \non the Tax Administration Good Government Act. The legislation provides \ntaxpayer safeguards, streamlines tax administration, and simplifies the \ntax code. I do have some concern with one provision in the bill. \nSpecifically, the bill also includes a provision on the IRS Free File \nProgram. The Free File Program is the result of a public-private \npartnership agreement between the IRS and the Free File Alliance, LLC, \na group of tax software companies managed by the Council for the \nElectronic Revenue Communication Advancement, CERCA. It is important to \ncontinue to promote these types of public-private partnerships and it \nis my hope that we can work together on this provision as we move to \nconference with the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator from Virginia. The IRS Free File \nProgram is a direct result of the goal that Congress set for the IRS to \nhave 80 percent of returns filed electronically by 2007. The \npartnership agreement calls for the Free File Alliance to provide free \ntax preparation and filing to at least 60 percent of all taxpayers or \napproximately 78 million individuals who file an individual tax return. \nEach participating software company has its own eligibility \nrequirements. The eligibility requirements ensure that lower income, \ndisadvantaged and under-served taxpayers benefit from the free file \nprogram with the Free File Alliance, LLC. The provision in the bill was \nintended to ensure that the taxpayers participating in the Free File \nProgram were affirmatively consenting to solicitation for other \nproducts or services. I look forward to working with him to ensure that \nwe continue to promote such public-private partnerships.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I agree with Chairman Grassley. It is our intent with the \nFree File provision to protect the integrity of our voluntary tax \nsystem by providing lower income, disadvantaged and under-served \ntaxpayers the ability to meet their filing obligation without \nsubjecting themselves to unwanted marketing. I also commit to work with \nSenator Allen as we conference with the House.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the chairman and ranking member.\n\n\n                       continuing care facilities\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman \nand ranking member of the Finance Committee, Senators Grassley and \nBaucus, for including a provision that I supported as part of the Tax \nAdministration Good Government Act to level the playing field for \nresidents of qualified continuing care retirement communities.\n  Continuing care retirement communities, or CCRCs, are the oldest form \nof seniors housing in America, dating back to the late 1800s--offering \na variety of living arrangements and services to accommodate residents \nof all levels of physical ability and health. The goal of a CCRC is to \naccommodate changing lifestyle preferences and health care needs. In \ngeneral, CCRCs make independent living, assisted living, and skilled \nnursing available all on one campus. The CCRC approach offers residents \nthe pyschological and financial security of knowing that, should they \nrequire increased levels of care, it is readily available at one \nlocation. As a private pay option, CCRCs also play an important role in \nthe Nation's long-term care delivery system because very few, if any, \nCCRC residents will ever require Medicaid funding for their long-term \ncare.\n\n[[Page S5891]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator from Florida for his comments. This \nis a provision that I have also supported. The provision included in \nthe bill will go a long way for those seniors who live in the affected \nCCRCs. I also want to clarify one point with Senator Baucus. It is my \nunderstanding that the purpose of the amendment is to bring the tax \ntreatment of those CCRCs described in section 7872(g) into alignment \nwith the treatment that has historically been afforded to those CCRCs \nthat are not described in section 7872(g). In other words, there is no \nintent to alter the treatment that the IRS has historically provided \nfor CCRCs that are not described in section 7872(g). I am committed to \nworking with Senator Graham as we move this legislation forward.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I agree with the chairman. There is no intent to alter \nthe treatment that the IRS has historically provided for CCRCs that are \nnot described in section 7872(g). This is a critical point that could \naffect a large number of seniors. We do not want there to be any \nmisunderstanding on this issue since the immediate consequences could \nbe significant--with large numbers of seniors potentially having to pay \nadditional taxes. I also know that Senator Mikulski has expressed an \ninterest in this provision. I give my commitment to both Senators \nGraham and Mikulski to work with them on this provision as we go to \nconference with the House.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I thank the chairman and ranking member for \nclarifying the intent of this provision.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Grassley-\nBaucus technical amendment, which is at the desk, be adopted; that the \ncommittee-reported substitute, as amended, be agreed to; and that the \nbill be read the third time.\n  The amendment (No. 3218) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The committee amendment, in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 1528, and \nthe Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1528) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to protect taxpayers and ensure accountability of the \n     Internal Revenue Service.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all after the \nenacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 882, as amended be \ninserted; that H.R. 1528, as amended, be read the third time and \npassed; that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; and that \nS. 882 be returned to the calendar, all without intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H. R. 1528), as amended, was read the third time and \npassed, as follows:\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today the Senate has approved the Tax \nAdministration Good Government Act. This legislation is the first \nlegislation addressing tax administration since the IRS Restructuring \nand Reform Act of 1998.\n  The legislation contains five major components. First, it provides \nadditional safeguards for taxpayers. Second, the legislation \nsignificantly simplifies the current interest and penalty regimes. \nThird, the act also includes the proposals passed out of the Finance \nCommittee on April 2, 2003 and included in a bill introduced by \nSenators Hatch and Breaux to modernize the United States Tax Court.\n  Fourth, our legislation also includes several provisions, some of \nwhich were requested by the Treasury Department and the Joint Committee \non Taxation, to strike an appropriate balance in protecting taxpayer \nconfidentiality through disclosure reforms. Finally, the legislation \ntakes an important step toward simplification of the Tax Code through \nthe elimination of obsolete provisions and unifying the definition of \nchild within the Tax Code.\n  We have worked closely with the Treasury Department, the Internal \nRevenue Service, the National Taxpayer Advocate, and the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation to develop this package of proposals to promote \ngood government in the administration of our Tax Code.\n  Congress's responsibility for the tax system does not stop after we \npass tax law changes. We have an oversight responsibility to ensure \nthat taxpayer rights are protected, that our tax laws are not \nadministered counter to congressional intent, that the judicial body \nwith primary jurisdiction over the tax laws has the tools necessary to \nprovide independent review of controversies between taxpayers and the \nInternal Revenue Service, and to take steps to simplify the Tax Code \nwhenever possible.\n  We are pleased to say that today, the Senate has taken a big step in \nthat direction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/19/senate-section/article/S5891-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 2728 and S. 2448\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
