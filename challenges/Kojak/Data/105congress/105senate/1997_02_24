Pursuant to the order of the Senate of \nJanuary 24, 1901, as modified on February 12, 1997, the Senator from \nTennessee, Mr. Frist, shall now read Washington's Farewell Address.\n  Mr. FRIST, at the rostrum, read the Farewell Address, as follows:\n\nTo the people of the United States.\n  Friends and Fellow Citizens: The period for a new election of a \ncitizen to administer the executive government of the United States \nbeing not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts \nmust be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with \nthat important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as it may \nconduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I \nshould now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline \nbeing considered among the number of those, out of whom a choice is to \nbe made.\n  I beg you, at the same time, to do me the justice to be assured, that \nthis resolution has not been taken, without strict regard to all the \nconsiderations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful \ncitizen to his country; and that, in withdrawing the tender of service \nwhich silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no \ndiminution of zeal for your future interest; no deficiency of grateful \nrespect for your past kindness; but am supported by a full conviction \nthat the step is compatible with both.\n  The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which \nyour suffrages have twice called me, have been a uniform sacrifice of \ninclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what \nappeared to be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would have been \nmuch earlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at \nliberty to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had \nbeen reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this, \nprevious to the last election, had even led to the preparation of an \naddress to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then \nperplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations, and \nthe unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence, impelled me \nto abandon the idea.\n  I rejoice that the state of your concerns external as well as \ninternal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible \nwith the sentiment of duty or propriety; and am persuaded, whatever \npartiality may be retained for my services, that in the present \ncircumstances of our country, you will not disapprove my determination \nto retire.\n  The impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust, were \nexplained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust, I \nwill only say that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards \nthe organization and administration of the government, the best \nexertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not \nunconscious in the outset, of the inferiority of my qualifications, \nexperience, in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, \nhas strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself; and, every day, \nthe increasing weight of years admonishes me more and more, that the \nshade of retirement is as necessary to me as it will be welcome. \nSatisfied that if any circumstances have given peculiar value to my \nservices they were temporary, I have the consolation to believe that, \nwhile choice and prudence\n\n[[Page S1426]]\n\ninvite me to quit the political scene, patriotism does not forbid it.\n  In looking forward to the moment which is to terminate the career of \nmy political life, my feelings do not permit me to suspend the deep \nacknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved \ncountry, for the many honors it has conferred upon me; still more for \nthe steadfast confidence with which it has supported me; and for the \nopportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my inviolable \nattachment, by services faithful and persevering, though in usefulness \nunequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our country from these \nservices, let it always be remembered to your praise, and as an \ninstructive example in our annals, that under circumstances in which \nthe passions, agitated in every direction, were liable to mislead \namidst appearances sometimes dubious, vicissitudes of fortune often \ndiscouraging--in situations in which not unfrequently, want of success \nhas countenanced the spirit of criticism,--the constancy of your \nsupport was the essential prop of the efforts, and a guarantee of the \nplans, by which they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this \nidea, I shall carry it with me to my grave, as a strong incitement to \nunceasing vows that heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of \nits beneficence--that your union and brotherly affection may be \nperpetual--that the free constitution, which is the work of your hands, \nmay be sacredly maintained--that its administration in every department \nmay be stamped with wisdom and virtue--that, in fine, the happiness of \nthe people of these states, under the auspices of liberty, may be made \ncomplete by so careful a preservation, and so prudent a use of this \nblessing, as will acquire to them the glory of recommending it to the \napplause, the affection and adoption of every nation which is yet a \nstranger to it.\n  Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare, \nwhich cannot end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger, \nnatural to that solicitude, urge me, on an occasion like the present, \nto offer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your \nfrequent review, some sentiments which are the result of much \nreflection, of no inconsiderable observation, and which appear to me \nall important to the permanency of your felicity as a people. These \nwill be offered to you with the more freedom, as you can only see in \nthem the disinterested warnings of a parting friend, who can possibly \nhave no personal motive to bias his counsel. Nor can I forget, as an \nencouragement to it, your indulgent reception of my sentiments on a \nformer and not dissimilar occasion.\n  Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your \nhearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm \nthe attachment.\n  The unity of government which constitutes you one people, is also now \ndear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of \nyour real independence; the support of your tranquility at home: your \npeace abroad; of your safety; of your prosperity; of that very liberty \nwhich you so highly prize. But, as it is easy to foresee that, from \ndifferent causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken, \nmany artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this \ntruth; as this is the point in your political fortress against which \nthe batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly \nand actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed; it is of \ninfinite movement, that you should properly estimate the immense value \nof your national union to your collective and individual happiness; \nthat you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment \nto it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the \npalladium of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its \npreservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may \nsuggest even a suspicion that it can, in any event, be abandoned; and \nindignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to \nalienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the \nsacred ties which now link together the various parts.\n  For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens \nby birth, or choice, of a common country, that country has a right to \nconcentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you \nin your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of \npatriotism, more than any appellation derived from local \ndiscriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same \nreligion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have, in a \ncommon cause, fought and triumphed together; the independence and \nliberty you possess, are the work of joint counsels, and joint efforts, \nof common dangers, sufferings and successes.\n  But these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves \nto your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more \nimmediately to your interest.--Here, every portion of our country finds \nthe most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the \nunion of the whole.\n  The north, in an unrestrained intercourse with the south, protected \nby the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of \nthe latter, great additional resources of maritime and commercial \nenterprise, and precious materials of manufacturing industry.--The \nsouth, in the same intercourse, benefiting by the same agency of the \nnorth, sees its agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning \npartly into its own channels the seamen of the north, it finds its \nparticular navigation invigorated; and while it contributes, in \ndifferent ways, to nourish and increase the general mass of the \nnational navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime \nstrength, to which itself is unequally adapted. The east, in a like \nintercourse with the west, already finds, and in the progressive \nimprovement of interior communications by land and water, will more and \nmore find a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from \nabroad, or manufactures at home. The west derives from the east \nsupplies requisite to its growth and comfort--and what is perhaps of \nstill greater consequence, it must of necessity owe the secure \nenjoyment of indispensable outlets for its own productions, to the \nweight, influence, and the future maritime strength of the Atlantic \nside of the Union, directed by an indissoluble community of interest as \none nation. Any other tenure by which the west can hold this essential \nadvantage, whether derived from its own separate strength; or from an \napostate and unnatural connection with any foreign power, must be \nintrinsically precarious.\n  While then every part of our country thus feels an immediate and \nparticular interest in union, all the parts combined cannot fail to \nfind in the united mass of means and efforts, greater strength, greater \nresource proportionably greater security from external danger, a less \nfrequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is \nof inestimable value, they must derive from union, an exemption from \nthose broils and wars between themselves, which so frequently afflict \nneighboring countries not tied together by the same government; which \ntheir own rivalship alone would be sufficient to produce, but which \nopposite foreign alliances, attachments, and intrigues, would stimulate \nand embitter.--Hence likewise, they will avoid the necessity of those \novergrown military establishments, which under any form of government \nare inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as \nparticularly hostile to republican liberty. In this sense it is, that \nyour union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty, and \nthat the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the \nother.\n  These considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting \nand virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the union as a \nprimary object of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common \ngovernment can embrace so large a sphere? let experience solve it. To \nlisten to mere speculation in such a case were criminal. We are \nauthorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the \nauxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions, will \nafford a happy issue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and \nfull experiment. With such powerful and obvious motives to union, \naffecting all parts of our country, while experience shall not have \ndemonstrated its impracticability, there will always be reason to \ndistrust the patriotism of those who, in\n\n[[Page S1427]]\n\nany quarter, may endeavor to weaken its hands.\n  In contemplating the causes which may disturb our Union, it occurs as \nmatter of serious concern, that any ground should have been furnished \nfor characterizing parties by geographical discriminations,--northern \nand southern--Atlantic and western; whence designing men may endeavor \nto excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests \nand views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within \nparticular districts, is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other \ndistricts. You cannot shield yourself too much against the jealousies \nand heart burnings which spring from these misrepresentations: they \ntend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together \nby fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our western country have \nlately had a useful lesson on this head: they have seen, in the \nnegotiation by the executive, and in the unanimous ratification by the \nsenate of the treaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at \nthe event throughout the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded \nwere the suspicions propagated among them of a policy in the general \ngovernment and in the Atlantic states, unfriendly to their interests in \nregard to the Mississippi. They have been witnesses to the formation of \ntwo treaties, that with Great Britain and that with Spain, which secure \nto them everything they could desire, in respect to our foreign \nrelations, towards confirming their prosperity. Will it not be their \nwisdom to rely for the preservation of these advantages on the union by \nwhich they were procured? will they not henceforth be deaf to those \nadvisers, if such they are, who would sever them from their brethren \nand connect them with aliens?\n  To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the \nwhole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts \ncan be an adequate substitute; they must inevitably experience the \ninfractions and interruptions which all alliances, in all times, have \nexperienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon \nyour first essay, by the adoption of a constitution of government, \nbetter calculated than your former, for an intimate union, and for the \nefficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the \noffspring of our own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full \ninvestigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its \nprinciples, in the distribution of its powers, uniting security with \nenergy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, \nhas a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its \nauthority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are \nduties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of \nour political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter \ntheir constitutions of government.--But the constitution which at any \ntime exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the \nwhole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the \npower, and the right of the people to establish government, presupposes \nthe duty of every individual to obey the established government.\n  All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and \nassociations under whatever plausible character, with the real design \nto direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberations and \naction of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this \nfundamental principle, and of fatal tendency.--They serve to organize \nfaction, to give it an artificial and extraordinary force, to put in \nthe place of the delegated will of the nation the will of party, often \na small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; and, \naccording to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the \npublic administration the mirror of the ill concerted and incongruous \nprojects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome \nplans digested by common councils, and modified by mutual interests.\n  However combinations or associations of the above description may now \nand then answer popular ends, they are likely, in the course of time \nand things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and \nunprincipled men, will be enable to subvert the power of the people, \nand to usurp for themselves the reigns of government; destroying \nafterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.\n  Towards the preservation of your government and the permanency of \nyour present happy state, it is requisite, not only that you steadily \ndiscountenance irregular opposition to its acknowledged authority, but \nalso that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its \nprinciples, however specious the pretext. One method of assault may be \nto effect, in the forms of the constitution, alterations which will \nimpair the energy of the system; and thus to undermine what cannot be \ndirectly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, \nremember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true \ncharacter of governments, as of other human institutions:--that \nexperience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of \nthe existing constitution of a country:--that facility in changes, upon \nthe credit of mere hypothesis and opinion, exposes to perpetual change \nfrom the endless variety of hypothesis and opinion: and remember, \nespecially, that for the efficient management of your common interests \nin a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is \nconsistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable. \nLiberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly \ndistributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is, indeed, little \nelse than a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the \nenterprises of fraction, to confine each member of the society within \nthe limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure \nand tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.\n  I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state, \nwith particular references to the founding them on geographical \ndiscrimination. Let me now take a more comprehensive view, and warn you \nin the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of \nparty generally.\n  This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having \nits root in the strongest passions of the human mind.--It exists under \ndifferent shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, \nor repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its \ngreatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.\n  The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by \nthe spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different \nages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is \nitself a frightful despotism.--But this leads at length to a more \nformal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which \nresult, gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose \nin the absolute power of an individual; and, sooner or later, the chief \nof some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his \ncompetitors, turns this disposition to the purpose of his own elevation \non the ruins of public liberty.\n  Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind, (which \nnevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the common and \ncontinual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it in \nthe interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.\n  It serves always to distract the public councils, and enfeeble the \npublic administration. It agitates the community with ill founded \njealousies and false alarms; kindles the animosity of one part against \nanother; forments occasional riot and insurrection. It opens the door \nto foreign influence and corruption, which finds a facilitated access \nto the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus \nthe policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and \nwill of another.\n  There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks \nupon the administration of the government, and serve to keep alive the \nspirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true; and in \ngovernments of a monarchial cast, patriotism may look with indulgence, \nif not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the \npopular character, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit not \nto be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain there will \nalways be\n\n[[Page S1428]]\n\nenough of that spirit for every salutary purpose. And there being \nconstant danger of excess, the effort ought to be, by force of public \nopinion, to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, it \ndemands a uniform vigilance to prevent it bursting into a flame, lest \ninstead of warming, it should consume.\n  It is important likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free \ncountry should inspire caution in those intrusted with its \nadministration, to confine themselves within their respective \nconstitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one \ndepartment, to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends \nto consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to \ncreate, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. A just \nestimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which \npredominate in the human heart, is sufficient to satisfy us of the \ntruth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the \nexercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into \ndifferent depositories, and constituting each the guardian of the \npublic weal against invasions of the others, has been evinced by \nexperiments ancient and modern: some of them in our country and under \nour own eyes.--To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute \nthem. If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or \nmodification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, \nlet it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the constitution \ndesignates.--But let there be no change by usurpation; for through \nthis, in one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the \ncustomary weapon by which free governments are destroyed. The precedent \nmust always greatly overbalance in permanent evil, any partial or \ntransient benefit which the use can at any time yield.\n  Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political \nprosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain \nwould that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to \nsubvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of \nthe duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the \npious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not \ntrace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it \nsimply be asked, where is the security for property, for reputation, \nfor life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which \nare the instruments of investigation in courts of justice? and let us \nwith caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained \nwithout religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined \neducation on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both \nforbid us to expect, that national morality can prevail in exclusion of \nreligious principle.\n  It is substantially true, that virtue or morality is a necessary \nspring of popular government. The rule, indeed, extends with more or \nless force to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere \nfriend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the \nfoundation of the fabric?\n  Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for \nthe general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a \ngovernment gives force to public opinion, it should be enlightened.\n  As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public \ncredit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as \npossible, avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but \nremembering, also, that timely disbursements, to prepare for danger, \nfrequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding \nlikewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of \nexpense, but by vigorous exertions, in time of peace, to discharge the \ndebts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously \nthrowing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear. \nThe execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it \nis necessary that public opinion should co-operate. To facilitate to \nthem the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should \npractically bear in mind, that towards the payment of debts there must \nbe revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can \nbe devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that \nthe intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the \nproper object (which is always a choice of difficulties), ought to be a \ndecisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the \ngovernment in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the \nmeasures for obtaining revenue, which the public exigencies may at any \ntime dictate.\n  Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace \nand harmony with all. Religion and morality enjoin this conduct, and \ncan it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be \nworthy of a free, enlightened, and, at no distant period, a great \nnation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a \npeople always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can \ndoubt but, in the course of time and things, the fruits of such a plan \nwould richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a \nsteady adherence to it; can it be that Providence has not connected the \npermanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at \nleast, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. \nAlas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?\n  In the execution of such a plan, nothing is more essential than that \npermanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and \npassionate attachment for others, should be excluded; and that, in \nplace of them, just and amicable feelings towards all should be \ncultivated. The nation which indulges towards another an habitual \nhatred, or an habitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a \nslave to its animosity, or to its affection, either of which is \nsufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy \nin one nation against another, disposes each more readily to offer \ninsult and injury, to lay hold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be \nhaughty and intractable when accidental or trifling occasions of \ndispute occur. Hence, frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed, and \nbloody contests. The nation, prompted by ill will and resentment, \nsometimes impels to war the government, contrary to the best \ncalculations of policy. The government sometimes participates in the \nnational propensity, and adopts through passion what reason would \nreject; at other times, it makes the animosity of the nation's \nsubservient to projects of hostility, instigated by pride, ambition, \nand other sinister and pernicious motives. The peace often, sometimes \nperhaps the liberty of nations, has been the victim.\n  So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another \nproduces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, \nfacilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest, in cases \nwhere no real common interest exists, and infusing into one the \nenmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the \nquarrels and wars of the latter, without adequate inducements or \njustifications. It leads also to concessions, to the favorite nation, \nor privileges denied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the \nnation making the concessions, by unnecessarily parting with what ought \nto have been retained, and by exciting jealously, ill will, and a \ndisposition to retaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are \nwithheld; and it gives to ambitious, corrupted or deluded citizens who \ndevote themselves to the favorite nation, facility to betray or \nsacrifice the interests of their own country, without odium, sometimes \neven with popularity; gilding with the appearances of virtuous sense of \nobligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable \nzeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, \ncorruption, or infatuation.\n  As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments \nare particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent \npatriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic \nfactions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, \nto influence or awe the public councils!--Such an attachment of a small \nor weak, towards a great and powerful nation, dooms the former to be \nthe satellite of the latter.\n  Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence, (I conjure you to \nbelieve me fellow citizens,) the jealousy of a free people ought to be \nconstantly awake; since history and experience prove, that foreign \ninfluence is one of the\n\n[[Page S1429]]\n\nmost baneful foes of republican government. But that jealously, to be \nuseful, must be impartial, else it becomes the instrument of the very \ninfluence to be avoided, instead of a defense against it. Excessive \npartiality for one foreign nation and excessive dislike for another, \ncause those whom they actuate to see danger only on one side, and serve \nto veil and even second the arts of influence on the other. Real \npatriots, who may resist the intrigues of the favorite, are liable to \nbecome suspected and odious; while its tools and dupes usurp the \napplause and confidence of the people, to surrender their interests.\n  The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations, is, \nin extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little \npolitical connection as possible. So far as we have already formed \nengagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith:--Here let \nus stop.\n  Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none, or a \nvery remote relation. Hence, she must be engaged in frequent \ncontroversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our \nconcerns. Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate \nourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her \npolitics, or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her \nfriendships or enmities.\n  Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a \ndifferent course. If we remain one people, under an efficient \ngovernment, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury \nfrom external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will \ncause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon, to be \nscrupulously respected; when belligerent nations, under the \nimpossibility of making acquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard \nthe giving us provocation, when we may choose peace or war, as our \ninterest, guided by justice, shall counsel.\n  Why forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our \nown to stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with \nthat of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the \ntoils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice?\n  It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any \nportion of the foreign world; so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty \nto do it; for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing \ninfidelity to existing engagements. I hold the maxim no less applicable \nto public than private affairs, that honesty is always the best policy. \nI repeat it, therefore, let those engagements be observed in their \ngenuine sense. But in my opinion, it is unnecessary, and would be \nunwise to extend them.\n  Taking care always to keep ourselves by suitable establishments, on a \nrespectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary \nalliances for extraordinary emergencies.\n  Harmony, and a liberal intercourse with all nations, are recommended \nby policy, humanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy \nshould hold an equal and impartial hand; neither seeking nor granting \nexclusive favors or preferences; consulting the natural course of \nthings; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of \ncommerce, but forcing nothing; establishing with powers so disposed, in \norder to give trade a stable course, to define the rights of our \nmerchants, and to enable the government to support them, conventional \nrules of intercourse, the best that present circumstances and mutual \nopinion will permit, but temporary, and liable to be from time to time \nabandoned or varied as experience and circumstances shall dictate; \nconstantly keeping in view, that it is folly in one nation to look for \ndisinterested favors from another; that is must pay with a portion of \nits independence for whatever it may accept under that character; that \nby such acceptance, it may place itself in the condition of having \ngiven equivalents for nominal favors, and yet of being reproached with \ningratitude for not giving more. There can be no greater error than to \nexpect, or calculate upon real favors from nation to nation. It is an \nillusion which experience must cure, which a just pride ought to \ndiscard.\n  In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and \naffectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and \nlasting impression I could wish; that they will control the usual \ncurrent of the passions, or prevent our nation from running the course \nwhich has hitherto marked the destiny of nations, but if I may even \nflatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, \nsome occasional good; that they may now and then recur to moderate the \nfury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign \nintrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism; this \nhope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by \nwhich they have been dictated.\n  How far, in the discharge of my official duties, I have been guided \nby the principles which have been delineated, the public records and \nother evidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To \nmyself, the assurance of my own conscience is, that I have, at least, \nbelieved myself to be guided by them.\n  In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe, my proclamation of \nthe 22d of April, 1793, is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your \napproving voice, and by that of your representatives in both houses of \ncongress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me, \nuninfuenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.\n  After deliberate examination, with the aid of the best lights I could \nobtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the \ncircumstances of the case, had a right to take, and was bound, in duty \nand interest, to take a neutral position. Having taken it, I \ndetermined, as far as should depend upon me, to maintain it with \nmoderation, perseverance and firmness.\n  The considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct, it \nis not necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that, \naccording to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from \nbeing denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually \nadmitted by all.\n  The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without any \nthing more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on \nevery nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain \ninviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.\n  The inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be \nreferred to your own reflections and experience. With me, a predominant \nmotive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and \nmature its yet recent institutions, and to progress, without \ninterruption, to that degree of strength, and consistency which is \nnecessary to give it, humanly speaking, the command of its own \nfortunes.\n  Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration, I am \nunconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my \ndefects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. \nWhatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or \nmitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me \nthe hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence; \nand that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service, \nwith an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be \nconsigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.\n  Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by \nthat fervent love towards it, which is so natural to a man who views in \nit the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several \ngenerations; I anticipate with pleasing expectation that in which I \npromise myself to realize, without alloy, the sweet enjoyment of \npartaking, in the midst of my fellow citizens, the benign influence of \ngood laws under a free government--the ever favorite object of my \nheart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors \nand dangers.\n                                                  GEO.

Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate a very \nimportant milestone in the history of the State of Ohio and in the \nhistory of this body on this, the first day the Senate has met since my \ncolleague Senator John Glenn announced that he was retiring from this \nbody. On behalf of the people of Ohio and on behalf of the U.S. Senate, \nI have the privilege of paying respects to Senator Glenn, to pay \nrespects to my senior Senator, our friend and our colleague, on the \noccasion of the announcement of his retirement from the U.S. Senate. \nSenator Glenn has served Ohio and the Senate for a longer consecutive \nperiod than any other individual in the history of our State. When he \nleaves office 2 years from now, he will have served in this body for 24 \nconsecutive years. Over this almost quarter of a century of service, \nSenator Glenn has established a reputation as a man who knows the \nimportance of details. Senator Glenn realizes that the most important \nwork done in this Chamber is not the sound bites, not the press \nconferences, but the nitty-gritty of making this complicated \nlegislative process work for the people who sent us here.\n  Despite the fact that I have only been in the Senate for a little \nover 2 years, in many ways I feel I know Senator Glenn better than many \nwho have served with him for a lot longer period of time. This is true, \nin part at least, I suspect, because he and I fought a very tough \ncampaign against each other in 1992. It was a tough, hard-fought \ncampaign. Let no one doubt--I can say this from personal experience--\nlet no one doubt that behind John Glenn's kind, grandfatherly exterior \nbeats the heart of a true marine, a man who is willing to fight very \nhard for what he believes is right. That has been something that has \nreally been the hallmark of John Glenn's life of service to this \ncountry, from his service in World War II and Korea to his service in \nthe military to his work in the space program to this very day, as he \ncontinues his service to this country in the U.S. Senate.\n  Two years after that campaign, I was elected to the Senate, and it \nbecame important, then, for Senator Glenn and me to build a \nrelationship, to build a relationship to benefit all Ohioans. I think \nwe have done that. In the 2 years since then, I have found that Senator \nGlenn's attitude to the work of the Senate really should serve as a \nmodel for all the rest of us. In a campaign, you fight hard, but when \nyou are in the Senate, when you are one of the 100 Members of the U.S. \nSenate drawn from all over this country, there is a different kind of \nwork to be done. I have worked with Senator Glenn on the floor, worked \nwith him on different issues, and he has unfailingly put the interests \nof Ohio and the interests of this country first.\n  I am sure we will continue to disagree on some issues, but our \ndisagreements are buried whenever we have a chance to accomplish \nsomething for Ohioans by working together. Some may say that Senator \nGlenn's style of leadership is too bipartisan for modern politics, too \nbipartisan for this day and age, too bipartisan for this town. If that \nis true, it is a shame, because the dedication to bipartisanship \nexemplified by John Glenn, through his service in the Senate, I think \nshould serve as an example for all of us.\n  It was significant that Senator Glenn chose the 35th anniversary of \nhis three orbits around the Earth to make his announcement that he was \nleaving the Senate.\n  I think as an Ohioan, it was also significant to see where he made \nthat announcement. He went back home to Muskingum College, New Concord, \nOH, a town where he had been raised, where he grew up, a town where \nthere is now a high school named after him, the John Glenn High School. \nHe went home to make this announcement to the people of the State of \nOhio.\n  I think it was also significant that he made the announcement in \nfront of an audience of primarily young people. John Glenn has always \nbeen someone who has thought about the future. How many times have we \nheard him come to the floor and talk about young people, talk about \ninvestment in young people, talk about what we have to do to prepare \nthem and us for the next century? So it was significant that he went \nhome to make this speech and significant that he was talking to young \npeople when he did it.\n  I was reminded, as I think many Americans were, when I heard the \nofficial news that John Glenn was going to retire, where I was 35 years \nago--at least those of us who are old enough to remember--when he made \nthat historic flight. My future wife and I were freshmen at Yellow \nSprings High School, Yellow Springs, OH. On the particular moment that \nhe took off, I happened to be in Ed Wingard's science class and \nremember listening on the radio, and watching on TV later in the day, \nas we followed his progress for the next few hours. John Glenn, on that \ndate, captured the hearts of Americans, and he guaranteed his place in \nthe history of this country and the history of this world.\n  We took a great deal of pride, those of us from Ohio, in what our \nnative son was doing on that date. It was clear that NASA had selected \nthe right person to make the trip, not just because of his nerves of \nsteel, not just because of his technical ability, but it was also clear \nwhy they picked John Glenn when he came back. It was clear that this \nwas a person who young people across the country could look up to, that \nthis was someone who should be considered a national hero and a \nnational treasure.\n  We should not talk today as if John Glenn will not be with us. John \nGlenn is going to be with us for 2 more years in this body. We are \ngoing to argue\n\n[[Page S1431]]\n\nabout some things, agree on some things, but John Glenn will continue \nfor the next 2 years to do what he has done throughout his lifetime, \nand that is serve the people of the State of Ohio and serve this great \ncountry that he loves so very much.\n  So let me, on behalf of the people of the State of Ohio, again say \nthank you to John Glenn for his service to his country, for his service \nto the State of Ohio, and thank him for being a role model for all of \nus 35 years ago and for continuing to be a role model today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/24/senate-section/article/S1430-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1431-S1432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SAFETY OF OUR CHILDREN\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to thank President Clinton \nfor lending his voice to one of the most important efforts underway in \nthis Congress. On February 14, the President unveiled a proposal that \nwould help provide children with safe homes and loving families, \nsomething that every child deserves. This is a victory for America's \nchildren, and I believe a victory for good common sense. It recognizes \nthat the safety of our children must always be our most important \nconsideration.\n  Mr. President, let no one doubt how important this issue is and why \naction by this Congress is so necessary. On a number of occasions over \nthe last year, I have come to the floor of the Senate to discuss a \nprovision in Federal law, that has tragedy in it, which has proven \ndangerous to the safety of America's children. I have on those \noccasions discussed the fact that too many children are spending their \nmost important, most formative years in a legal limbo, a legal limbo \nthat denies them their chance to be adopted, that denies them what all \nchildren should have: the chance to be loved and cared for by parents.\n  Mr. President, we are sending too many children back to dangerous and \nabusive homes. We are sending them back to the custody of people who \nhave already abused them, already tortured them, and we do it, \ntragically, knowing that that has already taken place.\n  The statistics are frightening. Every day in this country, three \nchildren actually die of abuse and neglect at the hands of their own \nparents or caretakers. That is over 1,200 children per year. Almost \nhalf of these children--almost half of them--are killed after their \ntragic circumstances have already come to the attention of local \nauthorities. That means 600 children die every year in cases where we, \nas a society, already know that they have been abused, already know \nthat they may have been tortured, already know that they really should \nnever go back into that home again.\n\n  Mr. President, some of the tragedies in the child welfare system are \nthe unintended consequence of a small part of a law passed by the U.S. \nCongress in 1980--basically, Mr. President, a good law. Under the \nFederal Child Welfare Act--the law I am referring to--for a State to be \neligible for Federal matching funds for foster care expenditures, the \nState must have a plan for the provision of child welfare services \napproved by the Secretary of HHS. The State plan must provide--here I \nquote from statute--``that, in each case, reasonable efforts will be \nmade (A) prior to the placement of a child in foster care, to prevent \nor eliminate the need for removal of the child from his home, and (B) \nto make it possible for the child to return to his home.''\n  In other words, Mr. President, no matter what the particular \ncircumstances of a household may be, a State must make reasonable \nefforts to keep it together, and to put it back together if it has \nfallen apart.\n  There is strong evidence, Mr. President, strong evidence to suggest \nthat, in practice, reasonable efforts have become extraordinary \nefforts, efforts to keep families together at all costs, efforts, I \nmight add, to keep families together that are families in name only and \nto put children back in homes that are homes in name only.\n  As a result of this, Mr. President, children have died. That law \nsimply has to be changed. One of my first legislative acts of the \nCongress was to introduce a bill that would accomplish this.\n  My bill would change the law to make it absolutely clear that the \nbest interests of the child have to come first. Pretty basic, pretty \nsimple--best interests of the child, safety of a child. You would not \nthink we would have to clarify that.\n  I tell you, Mr. President, based on my experience in talking to \njudges, prosecutors, in talking to children service advocates, children \nservice caseworkers across the State of Ohio, and from talking to some \nof my colleagues from other States, and from hearing testimony in our \ncommittee, it is abundantly clear to me that we have to spell this out, \nthat it is being misinterpreted, that reasonable efforts to put \nfamilies back together many times take precedence over the best \ninterests of the child and the safety of the child.\n  As I said, Mr. President, my bill would change the law to make it \nclear that the best interests of the child must come first. We do this \nby enacting the following simple, straightforward amendment to the \nChild Welfare Act. And this is what language I would add, not taking \nanything away, just add this:\n\n       In determining reasonable efforts, the best interests of \n     the child, including the child's health and safety, shall be \n     of primary concern.\n\n  Pretty simple, Mr. President, pretty straightforward, pretty basic, \nbut darn important.\n  In November, Mr. President, I chaired a hearing of the Senate Labor \nand Human Resources Committee on this issue. I assembled some of \nAmerica's chief experts on child welfare. And I was encouraged by what \nthey had to say.\n\n  Peter Digre, the director of Los Angeles County's Department of \nChildren and Family Services--an unbelievably huge department, and a \nman who has to deal with gut-wrenching problems and decisions every \nsingle day of his life--this is what Peter Digre said. He said that \n``we should emphasize child safety as our first priority.''\n  Dr. Digre's department has about 73,000 children under its \nprotection--73,000. He sees the real-life consequence of unreasonable \nattempts to reunite families that are families in name only.\n  But, Mr. President, I believe our most eloquent testimony that day \ncame from Sharon Aulton, a grandmother in Annapolis, MD. Sharon Aulton \nhad warned the local children services that her daughter was neglecting \nher children, her grandchildren, but the officials failed to intervene. \nSharon Aulton's daughter ended up blockading her children in a room and \nsetting the room on fire. Both these beautiful young children died.\n  Mr. President, this happens too often in this country. Last August a \n4-year-old girl named Nadine was found starved to death in her mother's \napartment in New York. The mother had kept Nadine in a crib covered by \na blanket so she did not have to see her. She did not feed the child \nregularly for the year preceding her death. In the last few months \nbefore the child's death, she did not seek medical help despite the \nfact that the child could not walk, could not stand, could not even sit \nup.\n  Apparently, Mr. President, city social workers had visited the \napartment in May 1995 after an anonymous complaint about the little \ngirl's treatment. The commissioner of the Administration for Children \nServices was unable to provide any information as to the conditions \nfound in the apartment or what action was taken at that time by the \ncity. However, the commissioner did say the city investigators found \nenough credible evidence of neglect to open an investigation after they \nvisited the apartment, but yet the case was closed 5 months later. \nNadine only weighed 15 pounds at the time of her death--a week before \nher 5th birthday.\n  Mr. President, I have a daughter who is almost 5, my daughter Anna. \nThose of us who have children, those of us who care about kids, have to \nbe heartsick and shocked by the recounting of this poor little child's \ndeath. According to the ambulance workers, Mr. President, Nadine was \nfound in the crib, dirty, with arms as thin as a half-dollar, her eyes \nsunken, her hair in patches, her ribs protruding. Her mother at\n\n[[Page S1432]]\n\nthat time, when the emergency folks responded, was sitting on a bed \nnear the crib eating a hot dog. That is how they found the mother when \nthe medics arrived at the home.\n  The New York Daily News obtained secret documents which indicate how \ncity child welfare workers and public school officials repeatedly \nignored warning signals in Nadine's case. That is from the New York \nDaily News.\n  School officials never turned in Nadine's mother for not showing up \nfor school, nor did anyone report the fact she did not show up for \nmedical appointments. Officials did not notify the State child abuse \nhotline when Nadine's siblings were out of school for long periods of \ntime.\n  In May 1995, the anonymous caller I mentioned earlier reported to the \nState child abuse hotline that Nadine was, in fact, starving.\n  Mr. President, tragically, Nadine is far from alone in falling \nthrough the cracks in our system. In December, a 10-month-old girl \nnamed Delores died after savagely being beaten by her mother's \nboyfriend; ten weeks earlier, child welfare officials had been warned \nthat she and her siblings were in danger.\n  Mr. President, let me be very clear--I cannot stress enough that I am \nnot trying to lay the blame on children's services officials in these \ncases. I worked with children services officials for many years, going \nback in time to when I was an assistant county prosecutor in 1973. \nThese are good people, people who try to do their job. They generally \nare overworked and have too many cases and have many challenges to \nface.\n  I think it is clear as we look at these cases of abuse, as we recount \nthe fact that we lose at least three kids every day to child abuse in \nthis country--and those are just the kids who die, let alone the other \nones who are savagely beaten or abused--I think it is clear that there \nis one part of this problem that Congress can fix. We cannot fix it all \nby passing legislation. We can try. But one part of the problem can be \nfixed, and that is to move forward in fixing, in clarifying the 1980 \nlaw that I refer to, to make it clear that we want these professionals, \nchildren's service workers, to have the flexibility to do what we all \nwant done, and what they want to do, and that is to save the kids \nfirst, save the children, to set as a priority the best interests of \nthe child and the safety of the child, and that priority has to take \nprecedence over everything else.\n  These case workers work very hard to meet, many times, conflicting \nmandates. We should make their job a little easier and say to them that \nFederal law from now on will be abundantly clear, that the primary \nmission should always be to save the children.\n  Mr. President, some families are families in name only, and simply \nshould not, should not be reunited. Mr. President, my proposed \nlegislation would change the law to make this the key goal. I think \nWashington Post columnist Mary McGrory made the case in a very \ncompelling way in her column of February 9. I ask unanimous consent \nthat column be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me conclude by saying once again how \npleased I am that the President has joined our efforts. I am confident \nthat his proposal will help us speed up the adoption process in this \ncountry and bring us closer to the day when every child in America will \nbe cared for by a loving family. Mr. President, I will continue to come \nto the floor and talk about this issue until we make that change in \nFederal law. It is a change that is urgently needed.\n  I simply conclude by saying what I have said many times on this \nfloor, and that is that it was never, I am sure, the intent of the \nauthors of the 1980 law--which has done a great deal of good in this \ncountry--it was never their intention to in any way tell case workers \nwho are making life and death decisions every day in this country that \nanything other than the best interests of the child, anything other \nthan the safety of children should be their primary concern. But it is \nalso abundantly clear to me, I have traveled through Ohio and talked to \npeople from other States, that this law is being misinterpreted day \nafter day after day. We should clarify it. We should make the job of a \ncase worker simpler, and by doing that, I believe we will save some \nchildren.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 9, 1997]\n\n                       Save the Kids, Not the Mom\n\n                           (By Mary McGrory)\n\n       Richard Gelles, an authority on child welfare, is boldly \n     intervening in a custody case that may be without parallel in \n     the sorry annals of the Family Reunification Act. Latrena D. \n     Pixley, a District mother who, at 19, killed her 6-week-old \n     baby, is asking to be reunited with two of her three other \n     children--a boy of 6 and another of 1 year. Gelles is \n     volunteering to come at his own expense from Rhode Island--\n     where he is director of the Family Violence Research Program \n     of the state university--to offer his view that a woman who \n     has committed infanticide is not a fit mother.\n       ``In these cases, we're often too late,'' says Gelles, who \n     wrote ``The Book of David,'' the story of a baby who was \n     murdered by a mother who had abused an older child. Social \n     workers had a watchful eye on the mother all along. ``This \n     time, I'd like to be early. Most of the time the children are \n     dead or greviously injured by the time I get involved.''\n       The Pixley case has already attracted major attention \n     because it could answer the question of what limits, if any, \n     there are to the Family Reunification Act, which puts \n     preservation of the family over the protection of children. \n     It could also provide a measure of how far our culture has \n     advanced in victimhood: Can a mother who kills her baby \n     succeed in portraying herself as a victim?\n       Gelles knows what it's like to get involved in the Pixley \n     case and with the District bureaucracy. Last year, at the \n     request of Jerome Miller, the receiver in charge of the D.C. \n     Department of Human Services, Gelles did a study of Pixley. \n     He told Miller that he did not think she could then or at \n     ``any foreseeable date'' provide adequate care for her \n     children. He says he was not paid for his work; the receipt \n     of his report was never acknowledged.\n       Miller is one of several figures in the Pixley case who \n     believe in her. He hired her as a clerk while she was serving \n     her sentence for infanticide. Social workers were indignant, \n     and Pixley abused his trust by engaging in credit card fraud, \n     but Miller remains a fan. She's still in jail for fraud (not \n     murder). He told the weekly City Paper this week, ``I'll take \n     her back in a minute.'' Social workers who are critical of \n     him, he says, are ``probably lousy social workers.''\n       Striking as Miller's tolerance is, it pales beside the \n     mercy shown by Superior Court Judge George W. Mitchell, who \n     seems stricken with sympathy. He accepted Pixley's attorney's \n     plea that she killed 6-week-old Nakya in 1992 as a result of \n     postpartum depression. Pixley has testified that, after she \n     had suffocated the crying baby under a blanket, she stuffed \n     the body in a dumpster and went off to a barbecue with her \n     boyfriend.\n       Social workers and therapists speak well of Pixley's \n     cooperativeness and progress. Her lawyer told Judge Mitchell \n     that, apart from the smothering, Pixley had been a good \n     mother to the infant. Gelles observed that she was a quiet, \n     ``compliant'' person but ``seriously damaged.'' Mitchell, in \n     imposing his feather-light sentence--weekends in jail for \n     three years--said he wanted to give Pixley's plea as much \n     respect as that of ``some high society woman.''\n       The judge is sending Pixley to a halfway house where she \n     will be joined in time by 1-year-old Cornilius, who is in the \n     care of an acquaintance of is mother. She will be taught \n     ``parenting'' and could eventually get custody of 6-year-old \n     Edward, whom, Gelles thinks, should be made eligible for \n     adoption.\n       Gelles says he has no choice but to volunteer as a \n     ``complaining witness' for the two little boys whose lives he \n     feels are in danger. He finds it ironic that this test of the \n     Family Reunification Act comes at a time when so many are \n     trying to undo it. Both the president and the First Lady have \n     held White House conferences about it. Sen. Michael DeWine \n     (R-Ohio) has introduced a bill making the safety of the child \n     the prime consideration--a concept sinking out of sight in \n     our addled, victim-struck culture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/24/senate-section/article/S1431-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1432-S1433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO LAWRENCE GRESSETTE, JR.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, in any State, there is a core group of \nbusinessmen and women who help promote and guide development and \neconomic success. These are the people who serve as the leaders of the \nprivate sector, individuals who work in concert with elected officials \nto create jobs, opportunity, and growth. Lawrence Gressette, Jr., has \nbeen one such leader in South Carolina, and I rise today to pay tribute \nto him and the many contributions he has made in helping South Carolina \nbecome one of the fastest growing centers for commerce and industry \nanywhere in the Nation.\n  Though Lawrence Gressette presides over one of the biggest \ncorporations in our State, he did not begin his professional career \nwith ambitions to become\n\n[[Page S1433]]\n\na captain of industry. As a matter of fact, Mr. Gressette started out \nas a country lawyer, which is about as far away from corporate America \nas one can get.\n  Born in rural St. Matthews, SC., Lawrence Gressette, Jr. was the son \nof a well-respected attorney who also served as one of the Palmetto \nState's most influential elected officials, State Senator L. Marion \nGressette, Sr. Early on in life, Lawrence learned the importance of \nbeing a man of integrity and dedication, and he approached all his \ntasks with a keen sense of purpose. These characteristics have helped \nshape Lawrence's life and are a direct correlation to the many \nsuccesses he has enjoyed. Whether it was during his days at Clemson, \nwhere he played football for the Tigers on scholarship and served as \nstudent body president; graduating first in his class at the School of \nLaw at the University of South Carolina; building a successful practice \nas an attorney; or rising to the position of chairman and chief \nexecutive officer of the SCANA Corp., it was a commitment to hard work \nand honesty that paved the way for Lawrence Gressette to become one of \nthe most influential and respected citizens of South Carolina.\n  While he did not follow his father's footsteps into public service, \nLawrence Gressette, Jr. has certainly been a public spirited person, \nand he has repeatedly lent his time, name, and efforts to many causes, \nall of which had the goal of making the Palmetto State an even better \nplace to call home. A devoted family man, he served his Nation as an \nInfantry officer in the U.S. Army, he serves on several boards and \ncommittees throughout the State, and he is very active in his \ncommunity. For his efforts, he has been recognized on several occasions \nwith awards and commendations, and most significantly, he has been \nawarded two honorary degrees from colleges and universities in South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. President, Lawrence Gressette, Jr., is about to step down as the \nhead of the SCANA Corp. We are grateful for all his hard work and \nleadership in running not only one of our State's most important \norganizations, but for his commitment to helping make South Carolina \none of the Nation's most economically dynamic States. We wish him great \nhealth and happiness in the years to come, as well as continued success \nin whatever endeavors he chooses to undertake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/24/senate-section/article/S1432-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO DR. JAY PHILIP SANFORD\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, perhaps one of the best kept secrets in \nthe American medical community can be found not far from this Chamber, \nthe Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences [USUHS], \nlocated in Bethesda, MD. For more than the past 20 years, this \ninstitution has trained in excess of 2,000 doctors who have gone on to \nserve our Nation either in one of the branches of the military, or in \nthe Public Health Service. Without question, this university has \ngreatly benefited the people and military personnel of the United \nStates, and a tremendous debt is owed to the man who is known as the \nfounding dean of this institution, Dr. Jay Philip Sanford. \nUnfortunately and sadly, Dr. Sanford passed away in October of last \nyear.\n  To those who willingly risk their lives in order to ensure the \nsecurity of the United States, there is probably no more comforting \nthought than to know that should they be wounded, they will receive \nexcellent medical care. Indeed, advances in military medicine have \nhelped to ensure that our service personnel will have access to the \nvery best possible treatment and care no matter where they are located \nor what the conditions in which they are carrying out their duties. \nWhether it be the rugged and frigid mountains of Bosnia, or the harsh \nand hot deserts of Kuwait and Iraq, American military personnel do not \nwant for the most advanced and competent medical care available. \nWithout question, the corps of military medical professionals who have \ngraduated from the Uniformed Services University of the Health \nSciences, and the research conducted at that facility, have a great \ndeal to do with that success.\n  The success of USUHS is directly attributable to the guidance and \nhard work of Dr. Sanford, who truly molded that university into the \nrespected institution it has become. Established in 1972 at the \ndirection of Congress, USUHS was to become a school that would prepare \nmen and women for medical service careers in the Armed Forces and the \nU.S. Public Health Service. Not only creating a reliable source for \nmilitary doctors, the university was to stress the instruction of the \nhighly specialized fields of military medicine, preventive medicine, \ntropical medicine, and disaster medicine. It was the responsibility of \nDr. Sanford to help build the university from the ground up, \nestablishing curriculum, securing the necessary books and equipment \nrequired of a first-rate medical school, and ensuring that the first \nclass of doctors would graduate from that school in 1980, as required \nby law. Dr. Sanford rose to the daunting challenge presented him, and \nin the finest traditions of the military, succeeded in achieving his \nmission and opening the doors of USUHS on schedule.\n  For his many impressive achievements, as a doctor, a researcher, and \nan educator, Dr. Sanford was awarded no shortage of tributes and \nrecognitions. Regrettably, space does not permit a complete recitation \nof all the accolades he was granted in his life, but I think my \ncolleagues would be interested to know that his alma mater, the \nUniversity of Texas Southwestern Medical School established the Jay P. \nSanford Lectureship in Infectious Diseases, and the Jay P. Sanford \nProfessorship; and, USUHS established the Sanford Chair in Tropical \nMedicine, as well as creating the Jay P. Sanford Distinguished Alumnus \nAward. Furthermore, in addition to serving as the third president of \nUSUHS, Dr. Sanford was awarded the doctor of military medicine degree \n[Honoris Causa], the USUHS Distinguished Service Medal, and the \nDepartment of Defense Civilian Service Medal.\n  Despite all these recognitions, one cannot help but think that the \ndistinction of which Dr. Sanford was most proud would be the creation \nand success of the Uniformed Services University of the Health \nSciences. In the years since the first class of doctors graduated from \nthat school, USUHS trained physicians have supported American military \noperations throughout the world as well as have made many important \ncontributions to the country through the Public Health Service. There \nis perhaps no greater legacy Dr. Sanford could have left than this \ninstitution which is dedicated to helping others. I do not exaggerate \nwhen I say that Dr. Sanford was a man who gave his all to our Nation \nand has left the United States a better place for his service. He will \ncertainly be missed by all those who knew him, and his family has my \ndeepest sympathies.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 2 hours of debate evenly \ndivided.\n\n[[Page S1434]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the resolution \nthat the President has submitted requesting the early release of \npopulation planning funds.\n  Last fall, in the waning hours of Congress, an agreement was reached \nby the White House and the leadership to make $385 million available \nfor family planning at a rate of 8 percent a month beginning in July. \nThat date was agreed to so there would be no overlap of 1996 and 1997 \nfunds.\n  The effect of the resolution before the Senate would be to virtually \ndouble the amount made available for population planning for 4 months \nthis year. If the Senate passes the President's resolution, $123 \nmillion more in funding will be available for organizations that \nsupport abortions and lobby to undermine laws which protect the unborn.\n  There are those who would like to suggest that this is merely a \nquestion of shifting dates. We are not arguing over whether money \nbecomes available but when, so the argument goes. In fact, this debate \ncenters on how much will be available, to which groups, and under what \ncircumstances.\n  I believe those of us who support the pro-life position made \nsignificant concessions during the negotiations over the omnibus \nresolution. Not only did we agree to raise the overall level of funding \nfrom $356 million in 1996 to $385 million, the disbursal rate was \nincreased from roughly 6 percent to 8 percent a month. Now the \nPresident wants to move up the date when disbursal begins.\n  Very few of us actually oppose making family planning funds \navailable. There is general consensus that a responsible family \nplanning policy has a positive impact on a nation's development. \nEveryone appreciates the consequences exploding population rates have \non every aspect of a nation's well-being, from the availability of \neducation, food and jobs, to the condition of the environment.\n  So let us all agree that there is no question that U.S. family \nplanning funds are extremely helpful in the developing world. But there \nis also absolutely no question that when the United States decided to \nprovide resources only to organizations that agreed not--not--to \nperform abortions and agreed not to lobby to legalize abortions, we \nwere still the single largest global donor of family planning funds. \nThis understanding is the heart of the so-called Mexico City policy, a \npolicy that resulted in steady increases in responsible U.S. family \nplanning support, a policy that at the end of the Bush administration \nmeant the United States contributed 45 percent of all family planning \nfunds made available around the world.\n  There is a deep irony to this debate. On the one hand, the \nadministration argues that the population program is in dire straits \nand beginning the funding in July will cause the closeout or reduction \nof at least 17 projects. Virtually all of those programs could be fully \nfunded because they are carried out by organizations which meet the \ncriteria of not supporting abortion or efforts to legalize abortion. In \nthe misguided interest of protecting a few organizations, the \nadministration is withholding support for the many willing to provide \nfamily planning services consistent with the Mexico City guidelines. \nThey complain about the negative impact of cuts on funding yet are \nwilling to forego an increase if it is linked to Mexico City. It does \nnot make sense.\n  I support family planning, but I cannot and will not vote to provide \nfunds to organizations which in the name of family planning take the \nlives of innocent, unborn children. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst this resolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there are several people on this side of \nthis issue who will speak, and so I will be brief to retain time for \nthem, and I will yield myself now such time as I need.\n  All Senators should understand what this vote is. It is really \nwhether to approve the President's finding. The President's finding is \nthat withholding until July 1 the release of the funds that Congress \nappropriated last September for international family planning would \nresult in more unwanted pregnancies and abortions and harm programs to \nprotect the health of women and children.\n  This is not whether you are for abortions or against abortions, \nwhether you are for family planning or against it. We know in many \nparts of the world family planning is abortion because we do not have \neverything from birth control devices to training, so people rely on \nabortion. What this would do would really give alternatives to it. In a \nmisguided effort by some foes of abortion last year, the funds were \nheld up until now and, if anything, will result in more abortions, not \nless.\n  What I would like to see us do is release the funds for family \nplanning and give people an alternative to abortion as a form of family \nplanning. In fact, 2 weeks ago the House voted by a substantial margin \nto uphold the President's finding. That meant that Republicans and \nDemocrats voted to uphold the President's finding, and the Senate is \ngoing to vote tomorrow.\n  Some say that approving the President's finding would result in \nspending an additional $123 million on abortion. Of course, that is \nfalse, totally, patently false. This vote will not change the amount \nspent on family planning by one dime. And, none of this money can be \nspent on abortion or to promote abortion. Our law prohibits that.\n  This is an extremely important vote, and there should be no confusion \nabout what it is about. So let me first talk about what this is not, so \nall Senators, no matter on which side of the abortion issue he or she \nis, will understand why they can support this resolution. This vote is \nnot about how much we are going to spend on international family \nplanning. We already decided that. We decided that, I believe, last \nSeptember when we passed the foreign aid bill. That bill contained $385 \nmillion for family planning, and if we pass this resolution that amount \nis not going to change at all. If the resolution is defeated, the \namount still will not change. So nobody should think we are voting to \nadd or take away money.\n  The vote will also not affect how we spend the $385 million. It will \nnot affect, for instance, which family planning organizations receive \nthe funds. So, no matter which way we vote today, we do not determine \nwhich groups receive the funds. It does not affect that. Nor will this \nvote decide in any way, no matter which way we vote, if the funds can \nbe used for abortion or to promote abortion.\n  This vote will decide only one thing. All this vote decides is, what \ndate do we start spending the $385 million that we appropriated last \nyear in the last Congress? It does not decide whether to spend it or \nhow to spend it or what to spend it on, only whether we start spending \nthe funds on July 1, 9 months after the start of the fiscal year, or \nMarch 1, 5 months after the start of the fiscal year.\n  You may ask, what difference does 4 months make, March 1, July 1, so \nwhat? If it did not make any difference, we would not even be here. But \nthe difference is, there are tens of millions of people who will not \nhave access to family planning services during those 4 months. We are \ntalking about modern contraceptives, as well as condoms that protect \nagainst AIDS. This vote is about whether we should withhold family \nplanning services to couples who desperately want to limit the size of \ntheir families or space the births of their children so their children \nsurvive past infancy.\n  We are not talking about money in a wealthy country like the United \nStates. We are talking about money in the poorest of poor countries. We \nare talking about money so people might be able to space their children \nso they do not see, what so many of these countries do, children that \ndie in the first year. In fact, a number of these countries do not even \nlist a birth until the child is several months old, or even years old, \nbecause of the high number of infant deaths.\n  There is no more effective, practical way to reduce the number of \nabortions\n\n[[Page S1435]]\n\nthan family planning. I could cite many examples. Here is one. Before \n1990, a Russian woman averaged at least three abortions in her \nlifetime. From 1990 to 1994, with support from USAID, contraceptive use \nin Russia grew from 19 to about 24 percent. Just that 5-percent \nincrease in the use of contraceptives resulted in a decrease in the \nnumber of abortions during that period by 800,000 abortions.\n  I would ask, how many of those who opposed that family planning money \nback during those years because somehow it might be used for abortion, \nhow many of them are willing to stand up and say, ``Because we spent \nit, we stopped 800,000 abortions in one country alone''? That should be \nthe beginning and the end of this debate. If you are against abortion--\nand a number of Senators on this floor have voted for family planning \nmoney because, and primarily because, they are opposed to abortion, \nbecause they know this provides alternatives to abortion, just as we \nproved it did in Russia--just that 6 percent increase in contraceptive \nuse cut the number of abortions by 800,000.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent a letter from Senator Mark Hatfield to \nRepresentative Chris Smith be printed in the Record at end of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. I mention this because Senator Hatfield was ardently, \nconsistently pro-life for all his years here in the Senate. But I also \nknow he is equally passionate about his support for family planning. He \nfully understood that when you limit access to family planning, the \nresult is more abortions.\n  The other side will argue that since a tiny fraction of these funds \nmay go to private organizations that provide abortions in countries \nlike the United States where abortion is legal, the resolution should \nbe defeated. There is no logic in that. What if the tables were turned \nand I argued that no family planning organization should receive U.S. \nGovernment funds unless they do use their own funds for abortion? There \nwould be a big outcry, ``It's big Government. How dare you tell these \nprivate groups what to do with their money?'' That is not a road we \nwant to go down. AID requires every dime to be kept in a separate \naccount. We know how every dime of our money is spent. There has never \nbeen any evidence that any of these funds have been used for abortion. \nIf there were, you can be sure we would have heard about it.\n  So let us start spending the money that we appropriated 5 months ago \nso it can do some good. The longer we wait, the more we add to the \ncosts of administering the program, the more damage we cause to the \nhealth of women and children, the more unwanted pregnancies and \nabortions will result. It is that simple.\n  I would also say, this has become more of a political argument than \nan argument based on reality. I do not hear any of the advocates of \nthis position, of withholding this money, stand up and say, ``Let's not \nsend any of our foreign aid to any country that may use some of their \nmoney, their money in that country, to pay for abortions.'' I challenge \nthose who oppose this resolution, if you want to prove that you are \nreally sincere, if you want to prove you are not doing this because of \nsome other agenda, then pass a law that says that no money, none of our \nforeign aid money, can go to any country that uses any of its money for \nabortion. That make no more sense than voting against this resolution.\n  Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 24, 1996.\n     Hon. Christopher H. Smith,\n     House of Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chris: I have reviewed the materials you recently sent \n     to my office in response to my request that you provide proof \n     that U.S. funds are being spent on abortion through AID's \n     voluntary international family planning program. \n     Unfortunately, I do not see anything in these materials to \n     back up your assertion.\n       AID has a rigorous process to make sure that the current \n     prohibition on the use of U.S. funds is adhered to and that \n     no U.S. funds are spent on abortion services. First, all \n     agreements into which AID enters (grants, contracts, and \n     cooperative agreements) include a legally binding and \n     enforcement clause prohibiting the contractee from using the \n     funds for abortion services. Second, AID staff monitor all \n     agreements as they are implemented in the field to ensure \n     that the agreements terms are being met. And finally, all \n     grants with non-governmental organizations require a \n     ``Circular A-133 Audit'' every one to two years. This audit \n     looks not only at the financial aspects of the agreement, but \n     reviews compliance with all terms of the agreement including \n     the prohibition on the use of U.S. funds. The audit is done \n     by an outside Big 8 accounting firm, not AID. According to \n     AID, compliance with the funding prohibition has not been a \n     problem.\n       In the meantime, Chris, you are contributing to an increase \n     of abortions worldwide because of the funding restrictions on \n     which you insisted in last year's funding bill. It is a \n     proven fact that when contraceptive services are not \n     available to women throughout the world, abortion rates \n     increase. We have seen it in the former Soviet Union where \n     women had no access to family planning and relied on abortion \n     as their primary birth control method. Some women had between \n     eight and twelve abortions during their lifetimes. This is \n     unacceptable to me as someone who is strongly opposed to \n     abortion.\n       It is my hope that we can work together to resolve this \n     issue before AID's international family planning program is \n     destroyed.\n       Kind regards.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Mark O. Hatfield,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has 44 minutes and \n24 seconds.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for yielding.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in total support of sound policies which \nadvance and uphold the sanctity of life and family, but in opposition \nto House Resolution 36. The issue, I believe, in fact, is not one of \nfamily planning but is, in fact, one of funding for abortion, \norganizations which promote and provide for abortions and lobby to \nchange pro-life laws in countries where our foreign aid money goes.\n  First and foremost, allow me to recognize the importance of the two \nvotes that took place in the House of Representatives on February 13. \nThe Clinton resolution, which we will be voting on tomorrow--which \nunwisely, I believe, fails to include a ban on American taxpayer \nfunding of organizations which provide and promote abortion--was \nsuccessful by a vote of 220 to 209. But there was a second vote that \noccurred that day. The second vote, on H.R. 581, legislation of \nCongressman Chris Smith, of New Jersey, reinstituting the successful \nMexico City policy and requiring foreign nongovernmental organizations \nreceiving U.S. funds to agree not to violate the laws, or lobby to \nchange the laws, of other countries with respect to abortion, or to \nperform abortions in those countries except in cases of rape, incest, \nor where the mother's life is in danger, that resolution by Congressman \nSmith was passed by an even larger majority of 231 to 194. So I remind \nSenators that the Smith pro-life resolution passed by a far greater \nmargin than did the Clinton resolution.\n\n  This vote certainly illustrates the simple fact that one can be for \nfamily planning programs while standing for life.\n  As the Members of this body might recall, I am the only legislator in \nCongress to have served in the Arkansas House of Representatives when \nPresident Clinton was Governor of Arkansas.\n  In October 1990, in response to written questions submitted by the \nAssociated Press, the President, then Governor of Arkansas, said:\n\n       Under the present Arkansas law, abortion is illegal when \n     the unborn child can live outside its mother's womb, I \n     support that . . . I have supported restrictions on public \n     funding and a parental notification requirement for minors.\n\n  I believe the President was absolutely correct when he took that \nposition about funding for abortion, and that is the issue before us \ntoday. Despite President Clinton's repeated sentiments in wanting to \nlower the number of abortions performed, his actions,\n\n[[Page S1436]]\n\nsince he took office 4 years ago, has spoken louder than his words.\n  In fact, President Clinton has actively fought to lift any and all \nrestrictions on taxpayer-funded abortions, not with congressional \napproval but by the broad use of the Executive order. Besides refusing \nto reinstate the Mexico City policy, which had been working very \nsuccessfully for a decade before he repealed it, he has also attempted \nto delete the ban on taxpayer funding of abortions and the ban on the \nuse of funds to counsel persons on the practice of abortion. Similarly, \nhis annual budgets have also proposed striking this pro-life language \nfrom the foreign operations appropriations bill.\n  We all know that congressional appropriations for U.S. population \nassistance have been delayed by the debate over the issue of U.S. \nfunding for abortion and coercive birth control measures practiced by \nforeign countries.\n  Mr. President, at the second annual U.N. International Conference on \nPopulation in Mexico City in 1984, the Reagan administration announced \nthat it would discontinue U.S. population aid to those nongovernmental \norganizations that were directly involved in voluntary abortion \nactivities.\n  The Mexico City policy went a step beyond previous legislation that \nhad been passed in the 1970's that specifically banned direct funding \nof abortions and involuntary sterilizations. The Mexico City policy \nbanned funding to nongovernmental organizations that were indirectly \ninvolved in abortion-related activities.\n  Furthermore, the Reagan administration established a requirement that \nthe U.N. Family Planning Agency provide ``concrete assurances that it \nis not engaged in, or does not provide funding for abortion or coercive \nfamily planning assistance programs.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the original Mexico City \npolicy be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Policy Statement: International Conference on Population\n\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       For many years, the United States has supported, and helped \n     to finance, programs of family planning, particularly in \n     developing countries. This Administration has continued that \n     support but has placed it within a policy context different \n     from that of the past. It is sufficiently evident that the \n     current exponential growth in global population cannot \n     continue indefinitely. There is no question of the ultimate \n     need to achieve a condition of population equilibrium. The \n     differences that do exist concern the choice of strategies \n     and methods for the achievement of that goal. The experience \n     of the last two decades not only makes possible but requires \n     a sharper focus for our population policy. It requires a more \n     refined approach to problems which appear today in quite a \n     different light than they did twenty years ago.\n       First and most important, population growth is, of itself, \n     a neutral phenomenon. It is not necessarily good or ill. It \n     becomes an asset or a problem only in conjunction with other \n     factors, such as economic policy, social constraints, need \n     for manpower, and so forth. The relationship between \n     population growth and economic development is not necessarily \n     a negative one. More people do not necessarily mean less \n     growth. Indeed, in the economic history of many nations, \n     population growth has been an essential element in economic \n     progress.\n       Before the advent of governmental population programs, \n     several factors had combined to create an unprecedented surge \n     in population over most of the world. Although population \n     levels in many industrialized nations had reached or were \n     approaching equilibrium in the period before the Second World \n     War, the baby boom that followed in its wake resulted in a \n     dramatic, but temporary, population ``tilt'' toward youth. \n     The disproportionate number of infants, children, teenagers, \n     and eventually young adults did strain the social \n     infrastructure of schools, health facilities, law enforcement \n     and so forth. However, it also helped sustain strong economic \n     growth, despite occasionally counterproductive government \n     policies.\n       Among the developing nations, a coincidental population \n     increase was caused by entirely different factors. A \n     tremendous expansion of health services--from simple \n     inoculations to sophisticated surgery--saved millions of \n     lives every year. Emergency relief, facilitated by \n     modern transport, helped millions to survive flood, \n     famine, and drought. The sharing of technology, the \n     teaching of agriculture and engineering, and improvements \n     in educational standards generally, all helped to reduce \n     mortality rates, especially infant mortality, and to \n     lengthen life spans.\n       This demonstrated not poor planning or bad policy but human \n     progress in a new era of international assistance, \n     technological advance, and human compassion. The population \n     boom was a challenge; it need not have been a crisis. Seen in \n     its broader context, it required a measured, modulated \n     response. It provoked an overreaction by some, largely \n     because it coincided with two negative factors which, \n     together, hindered families and nations in adapting to their \n     changing circumstances.\n       The first of these factors was governmental control of \n     economies, a development which effectively constrained \n     economic growth. The post-war experience consistently \n     demonstrated that, as economic decision-making was \n     concentrated in the hands of planners and public officials, \n     the ability of average men and women to work towards a better \n     future was impaired, and sometimes crippled. In many cases, \n     agriculture was devastated by government price fixing that \n     wiped out rewards for labor. Job creation in infant \n     industries was hampered by confiscatory taxes. Personal \n     industry and thrift were penalized, while dependence upon the \n     state was encouraged. Political considerations made it \n     difficult for an economy to adjust to changes in supply and \n     demand or to disruptions in world trade and finance. Under \n     such circumstances, population growth changed from an asset \n     in the development of economic potential to a peril.\n       One of the consequences of this ``economic statism'' was \n     that it disrupted the natural mechanism for slowing \n     population growth in problem areas. The world's more affluent \n     nations have reached a population equilibrium without \n     compulsion and, in most cases, even before it was government \n     policy to achieve it. The controlling factor in these cases \n     has been the adjustment, by individual families, of \n     reproductive behavior to economic opportunity and aspiration. \n     Historically, as opportunities and the standard of living \n     rise, the birth rate falls. In many countries, economic \n     freedom has led to economically rational behavior.\n       That pattern might be well under way in many nations where \n     population growth is today a problem, if counterproductive \n     government policies had not disrupted economic incentives, \n     rewards, and advancement. In this regard, localized crises of \n     population growth are, in part, evidence of too \n     much government control and planning, rather than too \n     little.\n       The second factor that turned the population boom into a \n     crisis was confined to the western world. It was an outbreak \n     of an anti-intellectualism, which attacked science, \n     technology, and the very concept of material progress. Joined \n     to a commendable and long overdue concern for the \n     environment, it was more a reflection of anxiety about \n     unsettled times and an uncertain future. In its disregard of \n     human experience and scientific sophistication, it was not \n     unlike other waves of cultural anxiety that have swept \n     through western civilization during times of social stress \n     and scientific exploration.\n       The combination of these two factors--counterproductive \n     economic policies in poor and struggling nations, and a \n     pessimism among the more advanced--led to a demographic \n     overreaction in the 1960's and 1970's. Scientific forecasts \n     were required to compete with unsound, extremist scenarios, \n     and too many governments pursued population control measures \n     without sound economic policies that create the rise in \n     living standards historically associated with decline in \n     fertility rates. This approach has not worked, primarily \n     because it has focused on a symptom and neglected the \n     underlying ailments. For the last three years, this \n     Administration has sought to reverse that approach. We \n     recognize that in, some cases, immediate population pressures \n     may require short-term efforts to ameliorate them. But \n     population control programs alone cannot substitute for the \n     economic reforms that put a society on the road toward growth \n     and, as an aftereffect, toward slower population increases as \n     well.\n       Nor can population control substitute for the rapid and \n     responsible development of natural resources. In commenting \n     on the Global 2000 report, this Administration in 1981 \n     disagreed with its call ``for more government supervision and \n     control,'' stating that:\n       ``Historically, that has tended to restrict the \n     availability of resources and to hamper the development of \n     technology, rather than to assist it. Recognizing the \n     seriousness of environmental and economic problems, and their \n     relationship to social and political pressures, especially in \n     the developing nations, the Administration places a priority \n     upon technologically advance and economic expansion, which \n     hold out the hope of prosperity and stability of a rapidly \n     changing world. That hope can be realized, of course, only to \n     the extent that government's response to problems, whether \n     economic or ecological, respects and enhances individual \n     freedom, which makes true progress possible and \n     worthwhile.''\n       Those principles underlie this country's approach to the \n     International Conference on Population to be held in Mexico \n     City in August.\n\n\n                           Policy Objectives\n\n       The world's rapid population growth is a recent phenomenon. \n     Only several decades ago, the population of developing \n     countries was relatively stable, the result of a balance \n     between high fertility and high mortality. There are now 4.5 \n     billion people in the world, and six billion are projected by \n     the year 2000. Such rapid growth places tremendous pressures \n     on governments without concomitant economic growth.\n       The International Conference on Population offers the U.S. \n     an opportunity to\n\n[[Page S1437]]\n\n     strengthen the international consensus on the \n     interrelationships between economic development and \n     population which has emerged since the last such conference \n     in Bucharest in 1974. Our primary objective will be to \n     encourage developing countries to adopt sound economic \n     policies and, where appropriate, population policies \n     consistent with respect for human dignity and family values. \n     As President Reagan stated, in his message to the Mexico City \n     Conference:\n       ``We believe population programs can and must be truly \n     voluntary, cognizant of the rights and responsibilities of \n     individuals and families, and respectful of religious and \n     cultural values. When they are, such programs can make an \n     important contribution to economic and social development, to \n     the health of mothers and children, and to the stability of \n     the family and of society.''\n       U.S. support for family planning programs is based on \n     respect for human life, enhancement of human dignity, and \n     strengthening of the family. Attempts to use abortion, \n     involuntary sterilization, or other coercive measures in \n     family planning must be shunned, whether exercised against \n     families within a society or against nations within the \n     family of man. The United Nations Declaration of the Rights \n     of the Child (1959) calls for legal protection for \n     children before birth as well as after birth. In keeping \n     with this obligation, the United States does not consider \n     abortion an acceptable element of family planning programs \n     and will no longer contribute to those of which it is a \n     part. Accordingly, when dealing with nations which support \n     abortion with funds not provided by the United States \n     Government, the United States will contribute to such \n     nations through segregated accounts which cannot be used \n     for abortion. Moreover, the United States will no longer \n     contribute to separate non-governmental organizations \n     which perform or actively promote abortion as a method of \n     family planning in other nations. With regard to the \n     United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA), the \n     U.S. will insist that no part of its contribution be used \n     for abortion. The U.S. will also call for concrete \n     assurances that the UNFPA is not engaged in, or does not \n     provide funding for, abortion or coercive family planning \n     programs; if such assurances are not forthcoming, the U.S. \n     will redirect the amount of its contribution to other, \n     non-UNFPA family planning programs.\n       In addition, when efforts to lower population growth are \n     deemed advisable, U.S. policy considers it imperative that \n     such efforts respect the religious beliefs and culture of \n     each society, and the right of couples to determine the size \n     of their own families. Accordingly, the U.S. will not provide \n     family planning funds to any nation which engages in forcible \n     coercion to achieve population growth objectives.\n       U.S. Government authorities will immediately begin \n     negotiations to implement the above policies with the \n     appropriate governments and organizations.\n       It is time to put additional emphasis upon those root \n     problems which frequently exacerbate population pressures, \n     but which have too often been given scant attention. By \n     focusing upon real remedies for underdeveloped economies, the \n     International Conference on Population can reduce demographic \n     issues to their proper place. It is an important place, but \n     not the controlling one. It requires our continuing attention \n     within the broader context of economic growth and of the \n     economic freedom that is its prerequisite.\n\n\n             population, development, and economic policies\n\n       Conservative projections indicate that, in the sixty years \n     from 1950 to 2010, many Third World countries will experience \n     four, five or even sixfold increases in the size of their \n     populations. Even under the assumption of gradual declines \n     in birth rates, the unusually high proportion of youth in \n     the Third World means that the annual population growth in \n     many of these countries will continue to increase for the \n     next several decades.\n       Sound economic policies and a market economy are of \n     fundamental importance to the process of economic \n     development. Rising standards of living contributed in a \n     major way to the demographic transition from high to low \n     rates of population growth which occurred in the U.S. and \n     other industrialized countries over the last century.\n       The current situation of many developing countries, \n     however, differs in certain ways from conditions in 19th \n     century Europe and the U.S. The rates and dimensions of \n     population growth are much higher now, the pressures on land, \n     water, and resources are greater, the safety-valve of \n     migration is more restricted, and, perhaps most important, \n     time is not on their side because of the momentum of \n     demographic change.\n       Rapid population growth compounds already serious problems \n     faced by both public and private sectors in accommodating \n     changing social and economic demands. It diverts resources \n     from needed investment, and increases the costs and \n     difficulties of economic development. Slowing population \n     growth is not a panacea for the problems of social and \n     economic development. It is not offered as a substitute for \n     sound and comprehensive development policies. Without other \n     development efforts and sound economic policies which \n     encourage a vital private sector, it cannot solve problems of \n     hunger, unemployment, crowding or social disorder.\n       Population assistance is an ingredient of a comprehensive \n     program that focuses on the root causes of development \n     failures. The U.S. program as a whole, including population \n     assistance, lays the basis for well grounded, step-by-step \n     initiatives to improve the well-being of people in developing \n     countries and to make their own efforts, particularly through \n     expanded private sector initiatives, a key building block of \n     development programs.\n       Fortunately, a broad international consensus has emerged \n     since the 1974 Bucharest World Population Conference that \n     economic development and population policies are mutually \n     reinforcing.\n       By helping developing countries slow their population \n     growth through support for effective voluntary family \n     planning programs, in conjunction with sound economic \n     policies, U.S. population assistance contributes to \n     stronger saving and investment rates, speeds the \n     development of effective markets and related employment \n     opportunities, reduces the potential resource requirements \n     of programs to improve the health and education of the \n     people, and hastens the achievement of each country's \n     graduation from the need for external assistance.\n       The United States will continue its longstanding commitment \n     to development assistance, of which population programs are a \n     part. We recognize the importance of providing our assistance \n     within the cultural, economic and political context of the \n     countries we are assisting, and in keeping with our own \n     values.\n\n\n                    health and humanitarian concerns\n\n       Perhaps the most poignant consequence of rapid population \n     growth is its effect on the health of mothers and children. \n     Especially in poor countries, the health and nutrition status \n     of women and children is linked to family size. Maternal and \n     infant mortality rises with the number of births and with \n     births too closely spaced. In countries as different as \n     Turkey, Peru, and Nepal, a child born less than two years \n     after its sibling is twice as likely to die before it reaches \n     the age of five, than if there were an interval of at least \n     four years between the births. Complications of pregnancy are \n     more frequent among women who are very young or near the end \n     of their reproductive years. In societies with widespread \n     malnutrition and inadequate health conditions, these problems \n     are reinforced; numerous and closely spaced births lead to \n     even greater malnutrition of mothers and infants.\n       It is an unfortunate reality that in many countries, \n     abortion is used as a means of terminating unwanted \n     pregnancies. This is unnecessary and repugnant; voluntary \n     family assistance programs can provide a humane alternative \n     to abortion for couples who wish to regulate the size of \n     their family, and evidence from some developing countries \n     indicates a decline in abortion as such services become \n     available.\n       The basic objective of all U.S. assistance, including \n     population programs, is the betterment of the human \n     condition--improving the quality of life of mothers and \n     children, of families, and of communities for generations to \n     come. For we recognize that people are the ultimate \n     resource--but this means happy and healthy children, growing \n     up with education, finding productive work as young \n     adults, and able to develop their full mental and physical \n     potential.\n       U.S. aid is designed to promote economic progress in \n     developing countries through encouraging sound economic \n     policies and freeing of individual initiative. Thus, the U.S. \n     supports a broad range of activities in various sectors, \n     including agriculture, private enterprise, science and \n     technology, health, population, and education. Population \n     assistance amounts to about ten percent of total development \n     assistance.\n\n\n                   Technology as a Key to Development\n\n       The transfer, adaptation, and improvement of modern know-\n     how is central to U.S. development assistance. People with \n     greater know-how are people better able to improve their \n     lives. Population assistance ensures that a wide range of \n     modern demographic technology is made available to developing \n     countries and that technological improvements critical for \n     successful development receive support.\n       The efficient collection, processing, and analysis of data \n     derived from census, survey, and vital statistics programs \n     contributes to better planning in both the public and private \n     sectors.\n\n\n                        The U.S. at Mexico City\n\n       In conjunction with the above statements of policy, the \n     following principles should be drawn upon to guide the U.S. \n     delegation at the International Conference on Population:\n       No. 1. Respect for human life is basic, and any attempt to \n     use abortion, involuntary sterilization, or other coercive \n     measures in family planning must be rejected.\n       No. 2. Population policies and programs should be fully \n     integrated into, and reinforce, appropriate, market-oriented \n     development policies; their objective should be clearly seen \n     as an improvement in the human condition, and not merely an \n     exercise in limiting births.\n       No. 3. Access to family education and services needs to be \n     broadened, especially in the context of maternal/child health \n     programs, in order to enable couples to exercise responsible \n     parenthood. Consistent with values and customs, the U.S. \n     favors offering couples a variety of medically approved \n     methods.\n       No. 4. Though population factors merit serious \n     consideration in development strategy, they are not a \n     substitute for sound economic\n\n[[Page S1438]]\n\n     policies which liberate individual initiative through the \n     market mechanism.\n       No. 5. There should be higher international priority for \n     biomedical research into safer and better methods of \n     fertility regulation, especially natural family planning, and \n     for operations research into more effective service delivery \n     and program management.\n       No. 6. Issues of migration should be handled in ways \n     consistent with both human rights and national sovereignty.\n       No. 7. The U.S., in cooperation with other concerned \n     countries, should resist intrusion of polemical or non-\n     germane issues into Conference deliberations.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, 2 days after his 1993 swearing-in \nceremony, President Clinton submitted an Executive order repealing the \nMexico City policy. This repeal now allows American taxpayer funds to \nbe given to the United Nations planning agency in support of coercive \nabortions and involuntary sterilization, commonly practiced in places \nlike China, a position which is completely contrary to the desires of \nthe American people.\n  I sincerely consider these practices of involuntary sterilization and \ncoercive abortion to be well outside the boundaries of what can be \nlegitimately called family planning.\n  Most organizations agreed to the terms of the Mexico City policy, \neven giving up their pro-abortion activities in some cases, in order to \nreceive U.S. funds. It did not decrease by even 1 penny the amount of \nfunding for international population control assistance programs. \nRather, it ensured that family planning dollars were sent to \norganizations which neither promoted nor performed abortion as a method \nof family planning.\n  Furthermore, since 1973, when Congress passed the Helms amendment to \nthe Foreign Assistance Act, Federal law has prohibited direct payment \nof most abortion procedures with U.S. foreign aid funds. The Helms \nlanguage was also included in the annual foreign operations \nappropriations bill last year.\n  For most of the years it has been in effect, the Helms amendment has \nnot been challenged either in the Foreign Assistance Act or in the \nforeign operations appropriations bill. However, since President \nClinton has been in office, he has continually sought to repeal the \nHelms amendment ban on foreign abortion funding, thereby subverting the \nwill of the vast majority of Americans.\n  The American people overwhelmingly oppose the use of taxpayer funds \nto perform or promote abortion. And at one time, I might add, so did \nPresident Clinton. On September 26, 1986, then Governor Clinton wrote \nthe following letter to the Arkansas Right to Life:\n\n       I am opposed to abortion and to Government funding of \n     abortions. We should not spend State funds on abortions \n     because so many people believe abortion is wrong.\n\n  And the logic of the President, then Governor Clinton, was exactly \nright. I ask unanimous consent that the letter to the Arkansas Right to \nLife dated September 26, 1986 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           Arkansas Right to Life,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                              Little Rock, AR, September 26, 1986.\n     Earlene Windsor,\n     Arkansas Right to Life,\n     Little Rock, AR.\n       Dear Mrs. Windsor: Thank you for giving me the opportunity \n     to respond to the Arkansas Right to Life Questionnaire. \n     However, most of the questions address federal issues outside \n     the authority of a governor or the state.\n       Because many of the questions do concern the issue of \n     abortion, I would like for your members to be informed of my \n     position on the state's responsibility in that area. I am \n     opposed to abortion and to government funding of abortions. \n     We should not spend state funds on abortions because so many \n     people believe abortion is wrong. I do support the concept of \n     the proposed Arkansas Constitutional Amendment 65 and agree \n     with its stated purpose. As I have said, I am concerned that \n     some questions about the amendment's impact appear to remain \n     unanswered.\n       Again, thank you for allowing me to share my position on \n     this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, because of the concerns of the Clinton \nadministration's population assistance policy, this Congress added \nlanguage that requires any amount that the United Nations population \nfund spends on family planning programs in China be deducted from its \ntotal United States appropriation.\n  Communist China has one of the worst human rights records in the \nworld, promoting forced abortions and sterilizations to limit births. \nIt is a country which has little regard for human life and, in \nparticular, the lives of little baby girls. Press reports are filled \nwith accounts of beautiful female children who are abandoned by their \nfamilies because under China's one-child-per-family rule, male children \nare considered more desirable. This policy is and should be offensive \nto all civilized people.\n  If the administration's resolution is passed by the Senate tomorrow, \nthe American taxpayer will become an unwilling participant in China's \noutrageous practices because some of the $25 million designated for \nUnited Nations population fund will go to China.\n  Without the Mexico City policy, the United States will be giving \nmoney to such countries and organizations which blatantly promote and \nsupport pro-abortion policies and procedures. This should be \nunacceptable to all of us.\n  While I believe the United States can provide meaningful assistance \nto countries attempting to control their population growth, I adamantly \noppose American taxpayer funding for abortion both home and abroad.\n  While I will continue to support continued U.S. population assistance \nprograms, I also believe that the United States should encourage the \ndevelopment of market economies which improve the standard of living \nfor growing populations.\n  This resolution came about because of the Clinton administration's \nrefusal to accept pro-life language preventing AID grantees from using \nforeign aid dollars to promote abortion.\n  Mr. President, please remember at the end of the last Congress, White \nHouse negotiator and former Chief of Staff, Leon Panetta, adamantly \nrejected a proposal which would have allowed AID to spend as much as \n$713 million for international family planning by the end of the fiscal \nyear. This takes into account $303 million carried over from fiscal \nyear 1996.\n  The proposal provided $385 million for population control programs, \nin addition to $25 million for the U.N. Family Planning Agency. If an \norganization did not agree to the terms of the Mexico City policy, it \nwould only receive up to 50 percent of the population funds it received \nin fiscal year 1995. All the fiscal year 1997 funds would be available \nin fiscal year 1997.\n  The administration rejected this proposal because of the nominal pro-\nlife conditions on the fiscal year 1997 funds. Even without the other \nevidence of the Clinton administration's abortion activities, this \nstand by the administration is a clear admission that family planning \nfunds are used to establish, sustain, and build up abortion providers \nand pro-abortion lobbying in developing countries, and the ability of \nAID grantees to perform and promote abortion in developing countries is \nthe real priority of the administration.\n  It is obvious that this battle will be renewed each year on the \nforeign operations appropriations bill until the pro-life position \nprevails, as it has ultimately prevailed on the Hyde amendment, the ban \non Federal employees health benefits coverage of abortions, the \nprohibition on abortions in military hospitals, and all other pro-life \namendments which became law over the President's opposition.\n  I cannot stand here today and believe the Clinton administration's \nclaim that it wants to reduce the number of abortions when United \nStates dollars are given to organizations which actually perform \nabortions and which lobby to legalize abortions in countries like Latin \nAmerica, Africa, and other regions of the world which recognize the \nhumanity and the value of the lives of unborn children.\n  The Clinton administration continues to emphasize that no U.S. \nfunding goes directly to abortion practices. However U.S. funding is \nallocated to organizations like International Planned Parenthood \nFederation, which receives $70 million from the United States. The IPPF \nmakes no secret of their pro-abortion commitment, which is apparent in \ntheir ``Vision 2000 Strategic Plan.''\n  With millions of U.S. dollars each year providing funding for the \nIPPF's lobbying campaigns, overhead, and utilities, how can we then say \nthat\n\n[[Page S1439]]\n\nAmerican taxpayer dollars are not being used to fund abortions? I \nbelieve they certainly obviously are.\n   Mr. President, we must end this practice of the IPPF and similar \ngroups exploiting the hard-earned dollars of every taxpaying citizen \nacross this great Nation.\n  The will of the American people is being subverted by this policy. \nAmericans do not want Federal tax dollars being used for abortions. \nThis applies to our foreign aid policies as well as our domestic \nagenda.\n   Mr. President, I will leave you today with a quote from Mother \nTeresa of Calcutta. Mother Teresa made this comment on February 3, \n1994, at the National Prayer Breakfast. Many of us were in attendance \nthat day. I was there and so was the President. I believe that this \nstatement speaks volumes. She said:\n\n       But I feel that the greatest destroyer of peace today is \n     abortion, because it is a war against the child, a direct \n     killing of the innocent child.\n\n  The issues in this debate are not just family planning, whether \nmillions of pro-life American taxpayers will be required to help foot \nthe bill for a practice they find morally reprehensible; but also \nceding control of taxpayer dollars to foreign governments over which we \nhave no control. I believe that is unacceptable. I think it is wrong to \nask pro-life American taxpayers to foot the bill for that which they \nfind morally offensive and morally wrong. I yield the floor.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin is \non the floor. How much time does he wish?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Eight minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield 8 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise today in support of House Joint Res. 36 to uphold a \nPresidential finding regarding the provision of international family \nplanning assistance.\n  I thank the senior Senator from Vermont for his leadership on this \nissue.\n  Let me just briefly clarify a point with regard to the remarks of the \njunior Senator from Arkansas, who indicated his belief that this \nresolution would impact the UNFPA program. My understanding is that the \nresolution is not related to that program at all, that the resolution \nin question today has to do with USAID funds. If there is any error in \nthat regard, I would be happy to be corrected, but my understanding is \nthat what we are dealing with here is USAID money. So the arguments \nconcerning funding for UNFPA do not relate to the topic we are \ndiscussing today.\n  Mr. President, by voting to uphold this resolution, the Senate will \nexpress agreement with the President that further delays in the \ndisbursement of funds in the population account will cause undue \nhardship for the organizations that carry out U.S. international \npopulation programs. In fact, President Clinton has said that ``a delay \nwill cause serious, irreversible and unavoidable harm'' to these \nprograms.\n  U.S. assistance to voluntary family planning supports a broad array \nof products and services for maternal and child health--including \nfamily planning education, clinical services, and birth control. These \nprograms have proved enormously effective--not only in improving the \nhealth of hundreds of thousands of women and children, but also in \nreducing the pressures that rapid population growth places on food and \nwater, on housing and education, and on forests and trees in developing \ncountries.\n  Perhaps most importantly, studies indicate that international family \nplanning programs can have a tremendous impact on limiting the number \nof unintended pregnancies throughout the world, which--ultimately--\ngreatly decreases the perceived need or demand for abortions.\n  Now let me reiterate this point, because it is extremely important. \nThis vote actually will have the effect of limiting the number of \nabortions conducted worldwide.\n  This vote also is a referendum on how the Senate views family \nplanning. Does the Senate support the provision of family planning \nservices to women and men in the developing world, or does it not?\n  I know that several Senators will speak today about the awful \nconsequences that will result if we fail to uphold the Presidential \ncertification. Each one of us will highlight some area of the world, or \nthe provision of some service, that will suffer from a further delay in \nthe disbursement of these funds.\n  As the ranking Democrat on the Africa Subcommittee, I would like to \nfocus on Africa, where the United States international family planning \nprogram has made a tremendous impact.\n  In fiscal year 1996, United States population assistance funds were \ndistributed in 21 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with a combined \npopulation of 426 million people. These countries are overwhelmingly \npoor, yet have among the highest fertility rates in the world.\n  The United States population assistance program is one of the most \nimportant things that the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment does in Africa.\n\n  As elsewhere, USAID supports a comprehensive program of voluntary \nfamily planning and closely related health efforts in several sub-\nSaharan African countries. It has trained hundreds of nurses and \nmidwives in Uganda. In Mozambique, a country whose entire \ninfrastructure was destroyed by 17 years of civil war, USAID helps \ndeliver family planning and maternal-child health services in four \nprovinces with a combined population of more than 6 million people. And \nit contributes to the distribution of modern contraceptive products in \nZimbabwe, where 42 percent of women are now demanding such products.\n  Now what will happen if the resolution that we will vote on tomorrow \nfails?\n  First, many of the nongovernmental organizations that currently \nadminister these programs will be forced to close key activities. To \ngive a compelling example, CARE, an NGO that has 50 years of experience \nhelping poor families, already is considering shutting down its family \nplanning program in Uganda because of the funding restrictions imposed \nby the United States Congress. After investing some $2 million of USAID \nfunds in this program over 4 years, CARE has trained more than 1,000 \ncommunity-based health workers, launched family planning services in 71 \nclinics, and increased the percentage of couples using contraception in \nthe program target area from 1 percent to 10 percent.\n  If this resolution fails tomorrow, CARE's network of trained \nvolunteers will no longer be able to serve their communities to educate \nwomen and men about family planning and other health care.\n  Second, even those programs that do not close their doors will be \nnegatively affected if we delay our support. The distribution of key \nfamily planning and health products will be seriously disrupted.\n  In Lusaka, the capital of Zambia and a city with one of the highest \nrates of HIV infection, condom distribution would have to be reduced \nsignificantly, greatly increasing the chances of a rapid spread of the \nHIV virus.\n  In Kenya, USAID-funded programs that have spent years teaching women \nabout health and family planning, and have helped create a demand for \ncontraceptive services, may no longer be able to offer birth control \npills or other products to the men and women who now depend on them.\n  A third consequence of a negative vote tomorrow is that information \ncampaigns on family planning and maternal and child health will also be \ncut back dramatically. These campaigns have been successful at reaching \nmillions of couples worldwide, helping to educate them about birth \nspacing, natural family planning and other family planning methods.\n  Finally, as one Member of the Senate who is careful about how and \nwhere we spend U.S. taxpayer money, I am concerned that a negative vote \ntoday will waste thousands--if not millions--of dollars in unnecessary \nadministrative costs that will be incurred if the disbursement of funds \nfor the international family planning program is delayed any further.\n  AVSC International, the second largest-funded agency that works in \npartnership with USAID on international\n\n[[Page S1440]]\n\nfamily planning, estimates that because of previous congressional \nrestrictions and metering, it already has spent $2 million in staff \ntime and associated administrative costs in order to manage the impact \nof delayed funding. What this means, according to an AVSC report, is \nthat ``for every dollar intended to provide access to these services \nlast year, a smaller quantity of services was actually provided.''\n  I find this type of expense, which wastes valuable taxpayer dollars, \nabsolutely unconscionable.\n  If the Senate fails to uphold the Presidential finding, more and more \norganizations will be faced with similar, equally ridiculous costs.\n  In other words, Mr. President, a further delay in the disbursement of \nthese funds would be inefficient.\n  It would be disruptive.\n  And it would be costly.\n  Opponents of House Joint Resolution 36 will have you believe that \nU.S. tax dollars are used to pay for abortion, even though they are \nwell aware that such a practice has been illegal for more than two \ndecades.\n  Mr. President, this vote, as we always have to point out on this \nissue but it bears constant repetition, this vote is not about \nabortion. It is about whether the United States will continue to \nsupport efforts to educate both men and women about modern methods of \nbirth control, about the importance for health and financial well-being \nof spacing one's children, and about obtaining adequate pre- and post-\nnatal care.\n  Mr. President, it frankly boggles the mind that these logical, \ncommonsense activities, which promote sensible family planning in order \nto prevent or delay pregnancies until they are wanted, can be thought \nof as promoting abortion. These funds help prevent pregnancies, not end \nthem. Without these funds, abortion rates will undoubtedly increase.\n  This vote is about helping empower individuals to make the most basic \nand personal decisions a person can make. It is about helping empower \nindividuals to make choices about how many children to bring into this \nworld and when to have them. It is about helping empower individuals to \nsafely prevent pregnancy, and when they choose to give birth, to \ndeliver and care for their children to maximize health. This is an \nissue of fundamental freedom. Our support of these programs represents \na longstanding commitment from which our Nation, founded on the \nprinciples of liberty and democracy, must not back away.\n  Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues who care about women and \ntheir children, who care about health and the eradication of disease, \nwho care about access to food and water, who care about the environment \nand the effect of global warming, who care about Africa or Latin \nAmerica or Asia, who care about responsible spending, or who care about \npreventing the demand for abortion, I urge all of my colleagues to \nuphold the Presidential determination and to vote in favor of this \nresolution.\n  Mr. President, I thank not only the Senator from Vermont but my \ncolleagues who gave me the courtesy of letting me speak at this point. \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We are going to go from side to side, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If you would like.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have sort of an informal agreement \nhere to rotate sides. Senator Helms is here and would like to speak on \nmy side of this issue. I would like to yield him 8 minutes.\n  Mr. HELMS. That will be fine, or less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the \ndistinguished managers of the bill.\n  Mr. President, I am grateful to the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas Mr. [Hutchinson], for offering S. 337, which is the bill to \nrestrict U.S. assistance to foreign organizations that perform or \nactively promote abortion. I am an original cosponsor of that bill. I \nbelieve it is safe to assume it will receive careful consideration in \nthe Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Mr. President, if S. 337 were law, Congress would not be tied in the \nexisting knot regarding international population control funding that \nnow exists.\n  With regard to the pending business, I was astonished to learn that \nthere were 21 mentions of the so-called Helms amendment during the \nFebruary 13 House debate on House Joint Resolution 36. The references \nto the Helms amendment were prompted by the purpose of my resolution, \nwhich prohibits using foreign aid funds for performing abortions as a \nmethod of family planning.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the text of section 104(f) of \nthe Foreign Assistance Act, known as the Helms amendment, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Sec. 104--Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (P.L. 87-195)\n\n       (f) Prohibition on Use of Funds for Abortions and \n     Involuntary Sterilizations.--(1) None of the funds made \n     available to carry out this part may be used to pay for the \n     performance of abortions as a method of family planning or to \n     motivate or coerce any person to practice abortions.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, since the Helms amendment, so-called, is \nreferenced in the administration's talking points, it may be that \nSenators will be referring to it from time to time in this debate, and \ntherefore I feel obliged as the author of the Foreign Assistance Act to \noffer a few comments about what section 104(f) does and what it does \nnot do.\n  The Helms amendment has been permanent law since 1973, the year after \nI came to the Senate. It is a narrow restriction on how funds provided \nby the American taxpayers can be used. It is not a restriction on the \nactions of private groups--for example, International Planned \nParenthood Federation--that receive funding provided by the taxpayers \nof this country.\n  A group may use Federal funds for administrative expenses, \ndistributions of condoms, or to pay for, if you can believe it, family \nplanning radio soap operas and gender analysis tool kits, whatever they \nare. Simultaneously, funds available to these same groups from other \nsources can and often do pay for abortion or pro-abortion lobbying \nefforts. It goes without saying when the U.S. Government pays for \nadministrative and other expenses of these groups, funds from other \nsources are freed up for activities that otherwise would be a violation \nof U.S. law.\n  Which is precisely why the Reagan administration came up with the \nMexico City policy--so that funds provided by the American taxpayers \nwould not be misused to underwrite, directly or indirectly, the pro-\nabortion dogma of the International Planned Parenthood Federation and \nother similar pro-abortion foreign organizations. President Clinton, \nwho agrees with the pro-abortion doctrine, reversed President Reagan's \nMexico City policy and other pro-life protections on the second day \nthat Mr. Clinton was in office back in 1993.\n  So the administration has, therefore, once again masterfully \nobfuscated the real issue, which is, does the 105th Congress today \nagree with underwriting, directly or indirectly, organizations that \nmake a callous business out of performing abortions and browbeating \nthose poor Third World governments into reviewing and reversing their \nlong-held beliefs and pro-life laws.\n  I cannot condone what these organizations set out to do and I refuse \nto be a part of a scheme leading to the deliberate destruction of the \nlives of the most innocent and most helpless human beings imaginable, \nand those are unborn babies.\n  I will vote against the pending resolution, because, as my father so \noften told me many years ago, he said ``Son, you become a part of what \nyou condone,'' and I cannot condone this.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Maine wishes to speak, and I yield to her such time as she may \nrequire.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, and Members of the Senate, I rise in strong \nsupport of this resolution to expedite the release of already \nappropriated funds for international family planning. This resolution \nessentially reaffirms the President's certification that\n\n[[Page S1441]]\n\nthe delaying of these funds which were appropriated last year will \ncause serious and irreparable harm to family planning programs around \nthe world.\n\n  The life and health of women and children should transcend politics \nand party lines. The United States has traditionally been a leader in \nfamily planning assistance around the world for more than 30 years. It \nhas enjoyed strong bipartisan support for such leadership. It has had \nunrivaled influence worldwide in setting standards for these programs.\n  These family planning assistance programs fund voluntary family \nplanning services, contraceptive research, maternal health programs and \nchild health programs. An estimated 50 million families in over 60 \ndeveloping countries, with a combined population of 2.7 billion people \nacross the world, use family planning as a direct result of U.S. \npopulation assistance programs.\n  There is no question that our support and our assistance over the \nlast 30 years in developing countries has been enormously successful. \nThe average family size in countries that receive our assistance has \ndecreased from six children to three children. The Agency for \nInternational Development has increased the use of contraceptives in \ndeveloping countries from 10 percent of married couples in the 1970's \nto 50 to 60 percent today.\n  Yet, there is still a great need for additional family planning \nassistance. In developing countries, maternal mortality is the single \nleading killer of women in their reproductive years, with 600,000 women \ndying annually from pregnancy-related complications. Family planning \ncould reduce the deaths by one-fifth. It is estimated one out of five \ninfant deaths could be averted if all children were spaced at an \ninterval of at least 2 years.\n  Unfortunately, the passage of the omnibus appropriations bill last \nyear came at a heavy price for U.S. family planning assistance \nprograms. As we all know, fiscal year 1997 funds cannot be spent until \nJuly 1, and at only 70 percent of the 1995 level, and on a monthly \nbasis of 8 percent over the next 12\\1/2\\ months.\n  As a result, family planning assistance by our Government will be \nreduced from $547 million in 1995 to only $385 million during 1997. \nThis translates into a 30 to 35 percent cut of $162 million. If we \ndelay the funding for these programs until July 1, we are talking about \ndelay in funding of another $123 million.\n  We agreed to these cuts and restrictions only because we wanted to \navoid a Government shutdown given that there was a difference between \nthe House and the Senate on this issue. The Senate rightfully took the \nposition that we should fund these programs without the Mexico City \nlanguage. But in order to protect these programs, we inserted language \nrequiring a vote on the President's certification that is before us \ntoday.\n  I can assure Members that the failure to release these funds now will \nhave a devastating impact on women, children, and families all over the \nglobe, and particularly in developing countries. Countless programs \nhave already been suspended or halted, as mentioned by the Senator from \nWisconsin, and if the funds are released in July rather than now, \ndozens of programs may be forced to permanently close their doors, \nincluding programs in Peru, Bolivia, Mexico, the Philippines, and \nelsewhere. These programs are critical in preventing unplanned \npregnancies, reducing infant mortality, reducing rates of HIV \ninfection, and promoting maternal and child health.\n  So there is no question, as the President has indicated, there will \nbe irreparable harm to these programs. More than that, the Alan \nGuttmacher Institute and other research institutions predict as a \nresult of just the funding cuts alone, not even the delay in funding, \nbut just in the funding cuts alone, 7 million couples in developing \ncountries who would have used modern contraceptives will be left \nwithout access to family planning. Four million more women will \nexperience unintended pregnancies.\n  Now, according to the World Health Organization, 40 percent of \nunintended pregnancies result in abortions. So we can expect 1.6 \nmillion more abortions and countless miscarriages; 1.9 million more \nunplanned births, often to families, as we know, living in terrible \npoverty conditions and who cannot afford another child; 8,000 more \nwomen dying in pregnancy and childbirth, and 134,000 infant deaths. \nThese figures relate to the funding cuts alone. They do not even take \ninto account the effect of the metering out, on a monthly basis for \n12\\1/2\\ months, of this funding, or, most importantly, the significant \ndelay in funding.\n\n  Make no mistake about it, a vote against this resolution is a vote \nfor more abortions, more women dying, more children dying. That is what \nI think is inconceivable in this debate--that those individuals who are \nagainst abortion are also against family planning. That is the bottom \nline in this debate. I have been debating this issue since 1985. Time \nand time again there hasn't been one single shred of evidence to \nsuggest that U.S. population assistance funding is going for abortions \nor abortion-related activities in other countries.\n  Senator Leahy was absolutely correct when he discussed the \nimplications of the fungibility argument if applied to our assistance \nto foreign governments. We give assistance to foreign governments who \nallow abortions in their countries, according to their laws. We don't \nimpose the requirement that if they use their money for abortion-\nrelated activities, we will not provide them foreign assistance. But \nthis is a standard we are using for private organizations who have been \ninstrumental in reducing the incidence of abortion worldwide. That \nshould be of interest to all of us, given the enormous implications of \npopulation growth in the future.\n  So I suggest that some are trying to bury their heads in the sand, \ntaking an ostrich-like approach to this entire issue, to suggest that \nsomehow if we don't provide family planning assistance, we will have \nfewer abortions in the world. The statistics do not bear that out.\n  I hope that the Senate will overwhelmingly support this resolution, \nbecause I think that there is no question that it is in America's \ninterest and it is in the world's interest. The United States has \ntraditionally taken a leadership role for more than 30 years on \ninternational family planning. In fact, the first Presidential message \nwas issued by a Republican President, President Nixon, back in 1969, \nsaying that population growth was a world problem. America has always \nshown an inclination for humanitarianism through population assistance \nfunding. We should be predisposed to doing the same thing in this body \nhere today. To do less will impose serious hardship on women and \nchildren in developing countries. We know the strain it is going to \nimpose. We know there will be millions fewer couples who have access to \nfamily planning assistance because we are undercutting our support. If \nwe undercut our support, I can assure you that other countries will \nfollow suit and it will affect an already fragile international family \nplanning system program worldwide.\n  When you think about the future, we should be concerned because it \nwill provide an enormous strain on economic and social stability all \naround the world. In the next decade, the number of women of \nreproductive age will increase from 185 million to 900 million women. \nThat is 10 times the size of Mexico. So I know there will be grave \nconsequences of this incremental decrease in U.S. support for \ninternational family planning year after year. How can we incrementally \nundercut our family planning assistance to those organizations who have \nbeen the most effective, the most instrumental in preventing unplanned \npregnancies and improving maternal and child health?\n  I can assure you of one other point: Not one dime has been spent--and \nit bears repeating here today, and let there be no misunderstanding--\nthere has not been one U.S. dollar that supports abortion or abortion-\nrelated activities in other countries. We have had that prohibition in \nlaw since 1973. The fact of the matter is, those funds are maintained \nseparately, and there is monitoring and independent reviews on an \nannual basis. That is why I believe that former Senator Mark Hatfield, \nwho was a pro-life Senator for many years in the U.S. Senate, wrote a \nletter to a colleague in the House of Representatives, saying that \nthere is no evidence to suggest that our funding has ever gone for \nabortion or abortion-\n\n[[Page S1442]]\n\nrelated activities in other countries through our family planning \nassistance programs. In fact, he goes on to say that we are \ncontributing to the increase in abortions worldwide by our failure to \nprovide this assistance.\n\n  So I hope, Mr. President, for these and many other reasons I have \nhighlighted, that my colleagues will support this resolution. It is in \nour interest and in the world's interest. As the Senate votes tomorrow \non this resolution, I hope that these facts will not be forgotten.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to commend the senior Senator from \nMaine for her statement. It demonstrates, as we have said before, that \nthis is not a partisan issue. This is an issue of good sense. Whether \npeople believe that abortion should be legal or whether people believe \nthere should not be abortion, it makes no difference. We should be \ntrying to join together in this to avoid all abortion. If you have \nfamily planning, that, to me, is a far greater alternative than using \nabortion as family planning.\n  As we also showed in this, in Russia, where just increasing our \nforeign aid over a relatively short period of time and increasing the \navailability of contraceptives by about 5 percent, that cut out 800,000 \nabortions. I mean, the fact of the matter is, if we hold the money back \nfor family planning, abortions go up. If we release the money for \nfamily planning, abortions go down. Holding back the money, just \nbecause it may make some feel like they are being a purist on the \nabortion issue, flies in the face of reality. It is rhetoric over \nreality. The reality is, spend money for family planning and you reduce \nabortions.\n  I see the distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts. I yield to \nhim.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know there are others who want to speak \non the resolution. But at the outset of this discussion, I want to pay \ntribute to Senator Leahy and Senator Snowe for their bipartisan \nleadership on this issue. I think that working together bodes well not \nonly for this issue but for other matters that will come before the \nSenate. I congratulate them for their leadership on this important \nresolution, which affects millions of families around the world--people \nwhose names we will never know, as they will not know ours. \nNonetheless, with the release of these resources, which we expect as a \nresult of this vote, lives will be enhanced.\n  I just want to again underline what Senator Leahy and Senator Snowe \nmentioned about what this bill is and is not. This is not legislation \nto promote abortion. They have laid out very clearly that this is about \nproviding resources that will be used to support family planning and \navoid unwanted pregnancies and subsequent abortions. That case has been \nmade by Senator Leahy, Senator Snowe, and our former colleague Senator \nMark Hatfield, who is a strong opponent of abortion. Senator Hatfield \nrejected the argument that family planning is a back-door means of \nsupporting abortion services. He reviewed the alleged evidence that \nfamily planning funds were being used to provide abortions and, in a \nletter to Representative Chris Smith, said, ``I do not see anything in \nthese materials to back up your assertion that U.S. funds are being \nspent on abortion.''\n  This is not only the understanding of those of us here today but also \nthe clear understanding of the President. I think those that support \nthis action have been justified in challenging those that are opposed \nto it to produce information or evidence to the contrary.\n  As President Clinton has said very clearly, ``The United States \nprovides family planning support where it is wanted and needed. We are \nprohibited from law from ever funding abortion--and we abide faithfully \nby that law. Indeed, the work we have funded in developing countries \nhas been supportive of families, helping them to flourish.''\n  One of the extraordinary examples of this work is the lifesaving \nefforts of CARE. In many different parts of the world I have had the \nopportunity to see the extraordinary work of many nongovernmental \norganizations, and I have enormous respect for the dedication of the \nmen and women who are so selfless in volunteering for these \norganizations.\n  All we have to do is read the newspapers of the past weeks and months \nto recognize the enormous threat to their lives. Red Cross and other \nNGO workers in Chechnya, Uganda, Rwanda, and other parts of the world \nhave actually lost their lives because of their work.\n  CARE, long respected for its efforts to meet the basic health needs \nof poor families around the world, has used U.S. funds to enhance the \nlives of large numbers of women and children.\n  In Uganda, over the last 4 years, CARE has trained over 1,000 \ncommunity-based health workers, launched family planning services in 71 \nclinics, and increased the number of couples using contraception from 1 \npercent to 10 percent. But, that project in Uganda--as well as projects \nin Bangladesh, Niger, and Togo--will be shut down if these United \nStates funds are not forthcoming.\n  That is the story all across the Third World. Without U.S. aid, \nmillions of people would not have access to gynecological examinations, \npostnatal care, and family planning services. The funds appropriated by \nCongress decrease the instances of female genital mutilation and \nprevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, such as HIV and \nAIDS.\n  So, for all of these reasons, Mr. President, this is an extremely \nimportant vote. It is really about children, and it is about struggling \nfamilies in foreign and distant parts of the world that are trying to \ntake care of their families and ensure a future with a greater sense of \nhope and health. It is really about life--not about other factors. That \nis the underlying purpose of this bill. That is what the record has \ndemonstrated.\n  That is why I think this vote is so important, and why I commend the \nSenator from Vermont and the Senator from Maine for their leadership.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The distinguished Senator from Vermont is on the floor. \nHow much time does he need?\n  I yield 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that William \nJackson of my staff be granted privilege of the floor for the duration \nof the consideration of the joint resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of House Joint \nResolution 36, which would approve the President's finding that the \ncongressionally imposed delay in disbursement of international \npopulation funding is having a negative impact on the effectiveness of \nour population planning programs overseas.\n  I have been a strong supporter of international family planning \nassistance and see this measure now before us as an important test of \nour Government's commitment to these important, lifesaving programs.\n  Claims that this resolution somehow promotes abortion are completely \nunfounded. This resolution is about the health of women and children in \nthe desperately poor corners of the world, and, if anything, it is \nabout preventing abortion.\n  At issue here is whether to begin releasing funds March 1, or delay \nthe disbursement for another 4 months, until July 1. The 1997 fiscal \nyear began October 1, but under the terms of the fiscal year 1997 \nOmnibus Appropriations Act, funding for this particular program was \ndelayed for 9 months. Regardless of the outcome of this vote, a total \nof $385 million will be spent on bilateral family planning programs. In \nother words, we are not debating if these funds will be spent, but when \nthey will begin to be released--July 1 or March 1.\n  I would like to point out that an additional 4-month delay in funding \nwould result in an actual reduction of $123 million in funds available \nfor programming during fiscal year 1997. The President's finding states \nthat at least 17 bilateral and worldwide programs will have urgent \nfunding needs in the March-June period which cannot be met by remaining \nfiscal year 1996 funds. If fiscal year 1997 funds are withheld until \nJuly 1, these programs would need to suspend, defer, or terminate \nfamily planning services and other critical supporting activities.\n\n[[Page S1443]]\n\n  The continued disruption and possible termination of family planning \nservices would have a devastating impact on the health of women, \nchildren, and their families in many parts of the world. Medical \nresearch shows that women who are able to space their children in at \nleast 2-year intervals have children that are less likely to die at a \nvery early age. Children born less than 2 years apart are more likely \nto have a low birth weight, making them more vulnerable to disease and \nillness. Moreover, births too close together affect older children in \nthe family as well. Infection, malnutrition, and dehydration result \nfrom premature discontinuation of breast-feeding. The inadequate \nnutrition, sanitation, and crowded living conditions often found in \npoor countries, increase the likelihood that already vulnerable \nchildren will succumb to illness. For the health of their families, \nwomen in these circumstances turn to family planning services, when \nthey can get them.\n  UNICEF estimates that each year 600,000 women die of pregnancy-\nrelated causes, and 75,000 of these deaths are the result of self-\ninduced, unsafe abortion. UNICEF also estimates that these women leave \nbehind at least 1 million motherless children. In short, to continue to \nobstruct and delay family planning assistance is to contribute to the \ndeaths of women and young children. Why would we delay the release of \nfunds until July 1 when we could prevent more needless, tragic deaths \nby releasing funds March 1?\n  Mr. President, no Senator in this body wants to promote policies that \nincrease the incidence of abortion overseas. But by continuing to delay \nfunding to clinics in the poorest countries in the world, that's \nexactly what we are doing--shutting off women from the only possibility \nthey have of obtaining family planning services and contraception and \nforcing them to consider abortion as a last, desperate option.\n  Very simply, to vote against this resolution is to vote against the \nhealth of women and children, and to force more women to have \nabortions. I do not believe this is the true intention of the Senate \nand I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in support of House Joint \nResolution 36.\n  This is a vote solely to determine whether funds already appropriated \nfor fiscal year 1997 will be released 5 months late or 9 months late.\n  Currently at least one woman dies every minute from causes related to \npregnancy and childbirth. In developing countries, maternal mortality \nis the leading cause of death for women in reproductive age. The World \nBank estimates a 20-percent reduction in maternal death would result \nfrom improved access to family planning.\n  In parts of sub-Saharan Africa, there are more than 1,500 maternal \ndeaths for every 100,000 live births; in the United States, this ratio \nis 12 deaths per 100,000 live births. By being able to plan their \npregnancies, mothers are able to ensure they bear their children at \ntheir healthiest times and that pregnancies do not occur too close \ntogether. This reduces the risks to the lives of both the mother and \nher children.\n  Babies born less than 2 years after their next oldest sibling are \ntwice as likely to die in the first year as those born after an \ninterval of at least 2 years. Analysis of data from 25 developing \ncountries shows that, on average, infant mortality would be reduced by \none-quarter if all births were spaced at least 2 years apart.\n  Family planning education also helps prevent the spread of sexually \ntransmitted diseases, including AIDS.\n  At least 76,000 women die every year from the consequences of unsafe \nabortions. Thousands more suffer serious complications that can result \nin chronic pain and infertility. A U.S. study found that for every $1 \nincrease in public funds for family planning, there is a decrease of 1 \nabortion per 1,000 women.\n  According to the Rockefeller Foundation, in just 1 year, cuts and \nsevere restrictions of Federal funding for family planning programs \nwill result in an additional 4 million unplanned pregnancies and 1.6 \nmillion of those will end in abortion; 8,000 of those women will die in \npregnancy and childbirth. These are conservative estimates.\n  Pathfinder International is one organization whose 30-year \npartnership with USAID has delivered high-quality family planning, \nreproductive health services, and information to some of the poorest \ncountries in the world. The delays in Federal funding have jeopardized \na significant portion of Pathfinder's programs.\n  One woman who has benefited from Pathfinder's programs is a 27-year-\nold Bangladeshi woman named Ferdousi Begum. She was married when she \nwas 14 years old. Ferdousi and her husband, Mahmud, are poor and their \nlives are hard. Mahmud works 12 to 14 hours a day and Ferdousi works as \na part-time domestic in addition to tending the home and being a \nmother. But they are happy--family planning has given them hope for a \nbetter future.\n\n  Ferdousi and Mahmud received counseling to postpone having children \nuntil she was 18 and her body was more developed. After having two \ndaughters spaced several years apart, they decided not to have any more \nchildren.\n  Mahmud speaks proudly of his daughters. He speaks of having dreams of \nhis older daughter, Salma, becoming a doctor after winning a prize in a \nscience competition.\n  However, after years of using family planning in order to provide a \nbetter life for her family, Ferdousi is at risk of becoming pregnant \nagain. Without the necessary funding, many local affiliates are unable \nto restock their contraceptive supplies. An additional 4 month delay \nwill have severe repercussions on Ferdousi, her family, and millions of \nother families like theirs in Bangladesh and around the world.\n  In 1960 in Chile, less than 3 percent of married women were \npracticing family planning and the abortion rate was 77 abortions per \n1,000 married women of reproductive age. By 1990, use of family \nplanning had increased to 56 percent of married women, and the abortion \nrate had dropped to 45 per 1,000.\n  Data from Bogota, Columbia showed a one-third increase in \ncontraceptive use between 1976 and 1986, accompanied by a 45-percent \ndecrease in the abortion rate during the same period.\n  In Mexico City use of contraception increased by about 24 percent \nbetween 1987 and 1992, while the abortion rate fell 39 percent.\n  In Almaty, Kazakstan, the United States population program has \nprovided funding to train doctors and nurses and to increase \ncontraceptive supplies for 28 clinics. Between 1993 and 1994, the \nnumber of people provided contraceptives by the clinics increased by 59 \npercent, while the number of abortions fell by 41 percent.\n  In Russia, contraceptive use has increased from 19 percent to 24 \nafter an affiliate of the International Planned Parenthood Federation \nopened in 1991. During that period, the abortion rate dropped from 109 \nper 1,000 in 1990 to 76 in 1994. The total number of abortions fell \nfrom 3.6 million in 1990 to 2.8 million in 1994. For years, the average \nRussian woman had 7 to 8 abortions.\n  In Hungary, a dramatic drop in abortion rates from a peak of 80 per \n1,000 women in the late 1960's to just over 30 per 1,000 women in 1986 \nis due in part to an increase in contraceptive use.\n  The numbers are incredible, but what is truly important and who we \ncan't forget are the women and their families represented in these \nnumbers.\n  One such woman is 30-year-old Maria Elena Absalon Ramirez in Mexico. \nHer husband earns just $80 per month to support Maria and their 4 \nchildren. They cannot afford contraceptives and rely on USAID. These \nare Maria's words: ``What I fear most is becoming pregnant again. One \nmore child would completely change our life; it would be our ruin.''\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the resolution and \nrelease the international family planning funds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nOregon such time as he may desire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Thank you, Mr. President. I would also like to \nthank Senator Leahy.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an issue that is both very \ncontroversial and personal; therefore, I do not have a prepared speech, \nbut wish to speak from the heart.\n  Much has been said here today about Senator Mark Hatfield's \nleadership on the issue of international family planning. In fact, I \noccupy the seat that\n\n[[Page S1444]]\n\nMark Hatfield sat in for more than 30 years. Like Mark Hatfield, I am \npro-life. As a State Senator, I advanced pro-life legislation in the \nOregon State senate, and have never been afraid to stand up for the \nprinciples of the sanctity of life.\n  As a candidate in two races for the U.S. Senate in one calendar year, \nno other issue was brought up more frequently than the issue of \nabortion. As I have stated throughout my career as a legislator, I \nintend to continue my support of pro-life issues and to work \nconstructively with Members on both sides of the aisle on legislation \nto reduce the incidence of abortion on a national and international \nlevel.\n  For these reasons, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to join in \nmy support of Senate Joint Resolution 14. While the debate on this \nresolution has centered on the issues relating to abortion, the \nunderlying question is whether the $385 million that has already been \nappropriated for international family planning will be released on \nMarch 1, 1997 or whether it will be released on July 1, 1997. \nRegardless of the outcome of this vote, the money will be released.\n  According to research conducted by the Guttmacher Institute, the \nWorld Health Organization, and other independent researchers, the \nrelease of these funds on March 1, 1997, will significantly reduce the \nincidence of abortion in developing countries that receive assistance \nthrough USAID. Therefore, as a pro-life Member of this body, I \nencourage my colleagues to vote yea.\n  I understand and share the concerns of those who have suggested that \nthis money is being spent for abortion services. This concerns me \ngreatly, particularly as the law of the United States prohibits the use \nof Federal funds for abortion services. To address these concerns, I \nreviewed the USAID audits and am assured that this funding is in fact \nbeing used for family planning services, not abortion. For this reason, \nI also encourage a yea vote.\n  In addition to sharing my support for this resolution, I would also \nlike to take a moment to express my frustration on this issue. While I \ncertainly respect those who may not support my pro-life position, I am \nso often disappointed that there is little effort to educate about the \noptions to abortion and ways to make abortion less frequent. The focus \nis often on the legal and the safe but never the rare. Similar \nfrustration stems from those who advocate for life. It is unfortunate \nthat the effort to advocate and encourage family planning does not \nequal the effort to discourage abortion. Today, we have the opportunity \nto address this inequity and to encourage and protect family planning \nboth nationally and internationally. This is a vote to support life, \nand tomorrow I will vote as my predecessor Mark Hatfield, in favor of \nthis resolution.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  For the benefit of the bill managers, the time of the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont remaining is 14 minutes and the time of the \nSenator from Kentucky is about 35 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, when the House of Representatives passed \nthe resolution, House Joint Resolution 36, which allowed for the \nreleasing of funds, $30 million per month for 4 months, 4 months \nearlier than under current law--after they passed that resolution they \nalso passed another resolution. It is called the Smith-Oberstar-Hyde \nResolution, H.R. 581. H.R. 581 actually releases more money for \ninternational family planning, but it does have restrictions to make \nsure that none of that money would be used for abortion purposes.\n  Since the House has already passed H.R. 581 and these are related \nissues, I would like now, at this point, to ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senate vote on final passage on H.R. 581 at a time not later than \nFriday of this week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I tell \nthe distinguished majority whip that I will object and explain why, I \nunderstand that there are people who wish to be consulted, I believe on \nboth sides of the aisle, on this. Therefore, I do object and suggest \nperhaps we could run a hotline on both sides. We may be able to work \nout a time agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Vermont. I ask \nhis assistance. Hopefully we can get to a vote in the Senate on this \nother resolution. It is a different idea. Let me just compare the two \nso all our colleagues can see exactly what we are talking about.\n  This is the current law. It says, basically, we are going to spend \n$420 million on international family planning funds. Under the \nadministration's resolution, that will increase by $120 million. For 4 \nmonths there will be $30 million more per month.\n  This is a convoluted way to do this. I was not involved in coming up \nwith the consent agreement that arranged this. My sympathies go to my \ncolleague from Vermont and the Senator from Kentucky, because they \nwrestled with this for a long time. I know Mr. Panetta was involved in \nthis. We had a real impasse.\n  Maybe I will give a little background in between, so our colleagues \nmight remember, but there is a difference in philosophy on what we \nshould do with international family planning money. The House felt very \nstrongly we should continue the Mexico City restrictions, the Mexico \nCity restrictions being restrictions that these moneys could not be \nused by an organization, international family planning organization, if \nthey had involvement with abortion. Not only could they not use the \nU.S. taxpayer funds, but they could not use their own funds for \nabortion services, and they also could not promote changes in a \ncountry's laws dealing with abortions. Those are the two main \nrestrictions known as the Mexico City policy, which was the policy in \nthe United States from 1984 through, I believe, 1993. It was changed by \nthe Clinton administration. So, it was the law of the land for 10 \nyears.\n  I might mention also that, under that policy, a significant number of \norganizations followed that policy. From 1984 to 1993 we had 350 \nforeign organizations that complied with the Mexico City policy. In \nother words, they accepted the money. They said the money will be used \nfor family planning but not for abortions. They would not use our \nmoney, U.S. taxpayers' money, they would not use their own money, and \nthey also would not advocate changing laws in other countries.\n  Unfortunately, this was repealed by the Clinton administration \nshortly after he took office. The House of Representatives felt \nstrongly it should be reinstated. After the House had a change of \nleadership in 1994, they reinstated the Mexico City policy. The Senate \ndid not go along. So we had, if I remember, 10, 11, maybe even 12 votes \nin the last Congress over this issue, the Senate basically saying we \nwant to reinstate our position of no prohibition on how the \ninternational family planning organizations use their money. If they \nwant to use their money for abortion, they can use it for abortion. If \nthey want to use their own money to advocate changing laws in other \ncountries dealing with abortion--because a lot of countries have laws \nrestricting abortions that this administration does not agree with and, \nfrankly, the International Planned Parenthood Federation does not agree \nwith, and they want to change it. So the Senate was concurring with the \nadministration and the International Planned Parenthood Federation. The \nHouse was saying no, we should stay with the Mexico City policy.\n\n  So we had a dozen votes, both sides insisting on maintaining their \nown positions. The net result was we came up with this terrible \narrangement which basically said we will continue this policy at 35-\npercent less money--which, incidentally, I might mention we had a 35-\npercent reduction overall in the bill.\n\n[[Page S1445]]\n\n Mr. Panetta said, let's have it the same way, and then we will dole \nthe money out on a monthly basis and then we will have a vote in the \nnext Congress over when that money will be released. That is what we \nare going to be voting on tomorrow.\n  So, if we maintain current law, the amount of money will be $420 \nmillion. If we adopt the administration's resolution, it will be $543 \nmillion. Under these provisions there is no restriction on abortion in \nthis and no restriction on organizations' lobbying capability. The \nHouse passed H.R. 531, the Smith-Oberstar-Hyde resolution that had a \ncouple of million dollars more, about $170 million more. But the money \nhad restrictions. The money has those restrictions that were, in \neffect, the law of the land from 1984 to 1993, that said these groups \ncannot use the money for abortion, they could not use the money for \nlobbying other governments to change their policies.\n  I happen to think the Mexico City policy was right. If we are going \nto be giving money to international family planning organizations, it \nshould be for family planning. It should not be for abortions.\n  Somebody said, ``You are not using U.S. taxpayer dollars for \nabortions. They are using their own money.'' Some of these groups, like \nthe London-based International Planned Parenthood Federation, are \nadvocates of abortion. If we give them so much money, U.S. money, they \ncan say, we do not use a dime of that for abortion. Sure, we will use \nsome of our other money for abortion. And sure we will use some of our \nother money to advocate changes in other countries' laws that we don't \nagree with. So, really, you have U.S. taxpayer dollars subsidizing \ninternational organizations that are, in effect, lobbying other \ncountries to change their laws because they deem them too restrictive \non abortion.\n  That is kind of offensive. It is not just these international groups \nthat are doing it; it is the administration as well. I will just make a \ncouple of comments.\n  Donald Warwick of the Harvard Institute of International Development \nhas written that the International Planned Parenthood Federation ``has \nin word and deed been one of the foremost lobbyists for abortion in \ndeveloping countries.'' They are promoting abortion in developing \ncountries, even to the extent of changing their laws.\n  The International Planned Parenthood Federation has made it clear \nthat legalizing abortion and expansion of abortion networks is one of \nits primary goals. Their 1992 mission statement Strategic Plan--Vision \n2000 repeatedly and unambiguously instructs its 140 national affiliate \norganizations to work to legalize abortion as part of a mandate to \n``advocate for changes in restrictive national laws, policies, \npractices and traditions.''\n  So, we are supporting and giving money to the International Planned \nParenthood Federation so they can use that money, or other money, to \nlobby, to tell some countries that happen to have pro-life laws that \nthey have to change their law. That bothers me. What makes us so self-\nrighteous that we know that other countries should be changing their \nlaws dealing with abortion? How can we be so self-righteous?\n\n  Then we find out it is not only some International Planned Parenthood \norganization, but we see it from our own State Department. On March 16, \n1994, through Secretary of State Warren Christopher in a classified \naction cable to all overseas diplomatic posts, the State Department \nannounced, ``The United States believes access to safe, legal and \nvoluntary abortion is a fundamental right of all women,'' and called \nfor ``senior level diplomatic intervention'' to garner support for the \nU.S. position at the September U.N. conference on population in Cairo.\n  On May 12, 1993, Under Secretary of State Tim Wirth expounded the \npolicy in a detailed speech at the United Nations, stating, ``A \ngovernment which is violating basic human rights should not hide behind \nthe defense of sovereignty * * * Our position is to support \nreproductive choice, including access to safe abortion.''\n  Why in the world would we have the Under Secretary of State make a \nspeech to the United Nations telling other countries we think we know \nbetter, you should change your laws. We think you should have pro-\nchoice laws in countries such as El Salvador or other countries that \nhave maybe a predominantly Catholic population and have pro-life laws \nor laws restricting abortions? Why in the world would we be so self-\nrighteous or sanctimonious that we should be telling those countries, \nWe know best. Change your laws. We think you should have legal \nabortion. Maybe we think you should subsidize it.\n  That, to me, is offensive, to think that the Secretary of State or \nUnder Secretary of State would have that position.\n  April 1, 1993, White House Deputy Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers noted \nthe administration regards abortion as ``part of the overall approach \nto population control.''\n  And if we don't enact H.R. 581, the Smith-Oberstar-Hyde language, \nthen what we are doing is giving this administration a blank check to \ngive money to international organizations that have no restrictions \nwhatsoever on how they use their money on abortion or changing laws in \nother countries. I think that is wrong.\n  So for my colleagues, just to summarize, we have a couple of options. \nWe can accelerate the money with no restrictions whatsoever or, if you \nhappen to be in favor of more family planning money, if you want more \nfamily planning money to go out internationally and you think that \nmight reduce the incidents of abortion, you can do that, you can \nsupport the Smith-Oberstar-Hyde language.\n  We are going to try to get a vote on it. The House already passed it. \nTomorrow it will be pending at the Senate desk. We hope to get a time \nagreement. I understand some people say, ``We want to filibuster \nthat.'' Why? What is the matter with having a vote? Let's find out \nwhere the votes are.\n  There is more money. This has $713 million for family planning. House \nJoint Resolution 36, which will be voted on tomorrow, has $543 million. \nThere is $170 million more money for international family planning, but \nit has restrictions. You will not be able to use that money or your \nmoney for abortion. So, if you want less abortions, you should support \nthe Smith-Oberstar-Hyde language, and if you think it is wrong for our \ncountry to be advocating that other countries change their laws dealing \nwith abortions, then you need to support that resolution as well.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote no on the resolution we will have \npending tomorrow, House Joint Resolution 36. Vote ``no'' on that and \nthen vote in favor of H.R. 581, the Smith-Oberstar-Hyde language, which \nwill have more money for international family planning and no money for \nabortion and no money for advocating changes in other countries' \nabortion laws.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank my colleague from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time is remaining to the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Vermont has 14 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I will take one moment for myself and \nthen yield to the Senator from California.\n  I will note for my colleagues that we are here because of an \nagreement entered into in good faith by Republicans and Democrats, by \nthose who supported the money for family planning and those who opposed \nit last year. Unfortunately, like in the House, we have a request for \nanother vote because some of the people who made that agreement last \nyear do not now want to live up to it.\n  I have spent 22 years in the Senate. If I give my word on something, \nif I make an agreement on something, I carry it out. I am surprised \nthat there have been some in the other body, and elsewhere, who are not \nwilling to honor the spirit of an agreement made.\n  I mention this only because there are aspects to this agreement that \nI was not happy with, and there are other votes I would have liked to \nhave had. But the agreement was that both sides would have this vote \nand that would be it.\n  When I came here 22 years ago, the distinguished majority leader, \nSenator Mansfield, and the distinguished Republican leader, Senator \nScott, said the same thing to every Member of the Senate: ``Whatever \nyou do here, keep your word.''\n  Senators I have dealt with on this issue have. I am concerned some in \nthe\n\n[[Page S1446]]\n\nother body have not, and it is unfortunate.\n  I note that contrary to what some on the other side have said this \nafternoon, this vote is not about the early release of family planning \nfunds. If we approve this resolution, it still means the funds are \ngoing to be 5 months late.\n\n  It has been said that this vote will provide $123 million more to \norganizations that fund abortions. That is totally false. This vote \nwill not increase or decrease the amount we appropriated last year at \nall.\n  It is said this vote will increase from $356 million to $385 million \nthe funds for family planning. Yes, but that is a $130 million cut from \n2 years ago.\n  We also agreed what this vote would be about, and what it would not \nbe about.\n  And we heard that this is about funding abortion. Of course not. If \nanything, the facts show that where we have given money to provide \nfamily planning, the number of abortions have gone down, not up, and \ngone down very substantially, and when we withheld the money for family \nplanning, abortions have gone up.\n  I yield to the Senator from California 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you, Madam President, and I thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont.\n  I rise to support his arguments, to indicate my support for House \nJoint Resolution 36. Madam President, I recently returned from a few \ndays in Nepal. If you go to Nepal, you will see that about 35 percent \nof the children die before the age of 5, and they die before the age of \n5 because they are impoverished. They don't have enough food, and they \ndie. This is true in many areas, particularly undeveloped countries, \nall around the world.\n  I think that one of the most important and effective components of \nU.S. foreign assistance has been our family planning programs. I \nbelieve these programs reduce poverty, I believe they improve health, I \nbelieve they raise living standards around the world, and they enhance, \ncertainly, the ability of couples and individuals to determine the \nnumber and spacing of their children.\n  I think many of us in this country take that opportunity for granted. \nMost of us have had the freedom to make choices about how we live our \nlives by planning the size of our families. But in poorer countries \nwhere contraceptive options are not available, women have much higher \nbirth rates, and the more children they have, the higher the poverty \nrates. Children are malnourished, many get sick, many die.\n  UNICEF estimates that 34,000 children under the age of 5 die every \nday--every day--in developing countries. And it is not just children. \nUNICEF further estimates that 600,000 women die of pregnancy-related \ncauses each year and that unsafe abortions are responsible for 75,000 \nof these deaths. By giving women the opportunity to plan their \npregnancies, lives are saved--the lives of women and their children.\n  So the need for these family planning programs could hardly be \nclearer. Unfortunately, because of this dispute between the House and \nthe Senate last year, the compromise the Senator from Vermont referred \nto was reached, but that delayed the release of family planning funds \nuntil July 1, or March 1, if the President found the delay was harming \nthese programs and Congress agreed.\n  The President has made the finding, arguing, I think, persuasively \nthat the delay thus far has forced many programs to suspend or defer \ntheir operations and that further delay, until July, could cause them \nto shut down.\n  Already, programs serving over 700,000 people annually in Bolivia, \nthe Philippines, Ecuador, and elsewhere, have been suspended.\n  Two weeks ago, the House voted 220 to 209 to agree with the \nPresident's finding. So the vote in the Senate is crucial.\n  If we concur with the President and the House, we can release these \nlife-saving funds only 5 months late instead of 9 months late. The \ndifference is critical.\n  Some have tried to draw a connection between our family planning \nprograms and abortion. But no connection exists. Since 1973, U.S. law \nhas prohibited any USAID funds from being used to pay for abortions as \na method of family planning or to coerce any person to have an \nabortion. All our programs are voluntary and they involve \ncontraception, not abortion. Programs are rigorously monitored to \nensure strict compliance.\n  So the argument that these programs cause an increase in abortion is \nsimply a red herring. It is actually worse than a red herring in a \nsense because it is patently and demonstrably false. In fact, it stands \nthe truth on its head. It is the delay in our family planning programs \nthat is actually causing an increase in abortions.\n  The evidence is clear. When family planning options are available, \nfewer unintended pregnancies occur, and abortions decline.\n  In Russia where the average Russian woman used to have a stunning \nseven or eight abortions in her lifetime, family planning has made a \nhuge difference. With United States assistance, organizations like the \nRussian Family Planning Association have raised the rate of \ncontraceptive use from 19 percent to 24 percent from 1990 to 1994. Even \nthat modest increase produced results. In the same period, the Russian \nDepartment of Health reported that the total number of abortions \nperformed dropped from 3.6 million to 2.8 million. That is 800,000 \nfewer abortions. This is specific, irrefutable, documented, statistical \nproof that family planning moneys drop and lower the rate of abortion.\n  The story repeats itself over and over. In Mexico, in Colombia, \nwherever USAID has funded family planning, this is the case.\n  So facts are facts. And the link is clear. As our esteemed former \ncolleague, Mark Hatfield, who was and is a proudly pro-life Senator, \nreminded us each time we voted on this issue, family planning \nassistance prevents abortion.\n  So this vote is about one thing and one thing only--it is about \ngiving women in the developing world a chance to make their lives and \nthe lives of their children better, safer, healthier, and more \nfulfilling.\n  I believe we have every reason and every interest to give them that \nchance. I hope every Member of this body does as well. So I urge my \ncolleagues to support this resolution. I thank the Chair. I thank the \nSenator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time is remaining for the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 3 minutes, 34 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, with the exception of a few self-\nappointed experts who have apparently never been to Beijing, Mexico \nCity or Calcutta, it is widely understood that stabilizing the Earth's \npopulation is the foremost challenge of our time.\n  This vote is as important as any vote we are going to cast this year. \nBut I do not think we should confuse with something it is not. There \nare other votes for or against abortion, but as the distinguished \nSenator from California has said, that is not what this vote is. There \nseems to be no end to the number of times we will fight the fight on \nabortion. But that is not what this vote is about, despite what some \nwould try to suggest.\n  This vote is about a program that is absolutely crucial if we are \ngoing to stabilize the Earth's population in the 21st century. The \nnumber of people born in the next decade are going to decide that \nquestion.\n  A quarter of the Earth's people live in poverty. They have no jobs. \nThey have nothing resembling adequate shelter and medical care. They \ndrink from the streams they and their animals bathe in. They live from \nhand to mouth in filth and in despair. We can do something to help.\n\n  Our family planning program gives those people a chance to get out \nfrom under the crushing weight of more and more hungry mouths to feed. \nSome argue that by giving them that chance, we impose our values on \nthem. The people who make that argument should ask those people, as I \nhave. They should ask them if they feel we are imposing our values on \nthem. What they will hear, as I have, is that there are hundreds of \nmillions of couples who\n\n[[Page S1447]]\n\nwant access to family planning and cannot get it or cannot afford it. \nThey desperately want to be able to decide when to have children and \nhow many to have. They do not see that as us imposing our will on them, \nbut giving them the chance to make their own decisions. Then they will \ndecide.\n  The only question is whether they will decide with family planning, \nor with abortion or by having more children who die in infancy of \nhunger and disease. If we ask those people if they want to have the \ntechnology, and the knowledge, so they can make the choice of when to \nhave children and how many to have, or if they would rather rely on \nabortion or have more children who will die of disease or hunger, the \nanswer is very simple. They want control over their own lives. And by \npassing this resolution, as the House did 2 weeks ago, we give those \npeople safe alternatives to abortion now, not 4 months from now when \nfor many of them it will already be too late.\n  Madam President, it is the height of arrogance for us to stand on \nthis floor and say, because of a few single-issue groups in the United \nStates, we will not give families in other countries the chance to make \nthe decisions that any one of us could do in our own family or in our \nchildren's families because we live in a nation where family planning \nis readily available and all of us make the kind of income where it is \nnot a problem for us.\n  But we stand here and say, so somebody can put a notch on the wall, \nthat they voted politically correctly for which single-issue group or \nsome fundraising letter has gone out, and we turn our backs on millions \nof people who want our help.\n  Again, I would remind my colleagues of the facts in the record here. \nIn 4 years time in Russia, where we made available family planning \nservices, where we increased just one simple thing, the use of \ncontraceptives by just 4 or 5 percent, the number of abortions went \ndown by 800,000.\n  But some of the same people stand on the floor of the Senate today \nand the floor of the House, and say that they are against providing \nthese services because somehow they are following a right-to-life or \nantiabortion agenda, and they voted against the money that was used in \nRussia. And that same money helped reduce the number of abortions by \n800,000.\n  We have Members in this body and the other body who say they have to \nbe so dependent on single-issue groups that they cannot vote for this \nmoney. They cannot vote for this money because somebody somewhere in \nthat country, some private organization, might use money of their own, \nnot ours, for abortion, so we should not give them any money for family \nplanning. Fortunately, a majority of the House was wise enough to stand \nup to the single-issue groups, and vote for this resolution.\n  Let us stop the hypocrisy and stop the pandering to single-issue \ngroups. I do not care whether they are to the right or to the left. Let \nus do what is right. How can we stand here and say, ``Oh, we can do \nthis because we're rich and we know better, but, boy, we're going to \nshow you. We can't help you because somewhere somebody will send out \nnewsletters to somebody will say they didn't stick to the agenda that \nour group asked them to do.'' Let us stop the hypocrisy and do what is \nright; and let's vote for this resolution.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent a letter by the distinguished Secretary of \nState Madeleine Albright be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       The Secretary of State,\n\n                                    Washington, February 21, 1997.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Minority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: I am writing to urge your support on \n     the upcoming vote to release already-delayed international \n     family planning funds in March instead of July of this year. \n     Given the negative consequences to women and men in \n     developing countries, as well as the administrative costs \n     associated with further constraints on these funds, I am \n     confident that you will agree that a March release date is \n     justified and that no identifiable purpose is served by \n     further delay.\n       In his January 31 report to the Congress, the President \n     made it unmistakably clear that ``a delay will cause serious, \n     irreversible and avoidable harm.'' At least 17 separate \n     programs, administered by the U.S. Agency for International \n     Development and amounting to at least $35 million, would be \n     seriously impacted by the funding delay. As a result, \n     unintended pregnancies will rise, maternal and infant deaths \n     will be more numerous, and abortions will increase. Clearly, \n     family planning saves lives, enhances the health and well-\n     being of women and their children, and prevents the tragic \n     recourse to abortion.\n       International family planning also serves important U.S. \n     foreign policy interests; elevating the status of women, and \n     reducing the flow of refugees, protecting the global \n     environment, and promoting sustainable development which \n     leads to greater economic growth and trade opportunities for \n     our businesses. Efforts to slow population growth, reduce \n     poverty, promote economic progress, and empower women are \n     mutually reinforcing. The proof is not found in arcane \n     studies, but in vigorous economic development in countries \n     like South Korea and Thailand.\n       The President and I are committed to building bipartisan \n     support for a foreign policy that will serve our national \n     interests into the 21st century. International family \n     planning programs have a successful track record and have \n     garnered bipartisan support for the past 30 years; we must \n     rebuild this support for the next 30 and beyond. Unhappily, \n     international family planning programs have often been \n     misunderstood, creating unnecessary rancor. Let me be clear--\n     the United States does not, has not, and will not promote or \n     provide abortion services as a method of family planing in \n     developing countries. These programs are carefully executed \n     and monitored to ensure that U.S. funds are not used for \n     illegal purposes. The upcoming vote is not about abortion. It \n     is, in fact, just the opposite: the release of family \n     planning funds now will reduce the incidence of unintended \n     pregnancy and abortion.\n       On the other hand, it is an indisputable fact that family \n     planning does reduce abortion, as best evidenced by \n     significant declines in abortion as family planning services \n     are becoming available in Russia and Central and Eastern \n     Europe. The argument is also made that by providing support \n     for family planning services, the United States may \n     unwittingly enable organizations to use some of their private \n     funds to provide legal abortion services. Carried to its \n     logical conclusion, of course, the United States would not \n     provide support for child survival or any other health \n     programs in countries where legal abortion services are \n     supported by national health systems.\n       The Congress has a real opportunity to correct a problem \n     with funding set in place last fall. In so doing, you can \n     help advance our interest in improving the status of women, \n     protecting the environment, and encouraging robust economic \n     progress around the world. This progress will make the \n     difference for hundreds of thousands of citizens abroad. Most \n     important, voluntary international family planning programs \n     are in the interest of our own citizens. I urge your support \n     for S.J. Res. 14.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Madeleine K. Albright.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky \nand I discussed earlier. I ask unanimous consent, understanding, of \ncourse, that I will yield immediately to the Senator from Kentucky if \nhe or his representative comes to the floor, that I be allowed to \ncontinue without the time going beyond the time we would begin the Byrd \namendment at 3:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, it is so frustrating. Every year we have \nthis debate, time after time. We have written into our law that not one \ncent of our money for family planning can be used for abortion, and \nnone of it has been. Yet we hear the argument, ``But we can't send \nmoney to some private groups because they may use some of their money \nfor abortion.'' We do not hear anybody stand on the floor and say we \ncannot send foreign aid to this or that government because they may use \nsome of their money for abortion. That is never done, nor will it ever \nbe done, nor should it be done. But it points out the illogic of their \nargument.\n  This has become a litmus test vote for some pressure groups in this \ncountry. The same pressure groups are wise enough to not to advocate \nwithholding foreign aid from governments that allow legal abortion or \nthat uses their funds for abortion. I am not suggesting that nor have I \nheard anybody suggest that. However, the hypocrisy is obvious.\n  Let us not legislate for single-issue groups, on the right or the \nleft, Democrat or Republican, conservative or liberal. Let us instead \nlegislate what is in the best interests of the country. Now, maybe we \nwill offend the right one day and the next day the left, maybe we will \noffend this single-issue group one day and that single-issue group the \nnext day, maybe we will upset somebody's special-interest newsletter \nthis\n\n[[Page S1448]]\n\nday and somebody else's the next day. But do you know what, Madam \nPresident? In the long run the American people will be far more \nrespectful of the U.S. Senate if we do that.\n  On this issue it is very simple. We have already appropriated the \nmoney. What we are doing now is withholding the money so that it cannot \nbe spent. As long as it is not spent, instead of people having access \nto family planning, instead of people being able to make the decision \nthemselves of how many children they will have and when, the number of \nabortions will start going up again. As we have shown over and over \nagain, when family planning is available, the number of abortions go \ndown, and when family planning withheld, the number of abortions go up. \nIt was that way long before any one of us served in this body. It will \nbe that way long after we leave.\n  So we should stop the rhetoric for the fundraising letters, but \ninstead do what is right. We want to help countries determine what they \nmay or may not do on the question of overpopulation, on the use of \ntheir own resources, being given not the tools of abortion but the \ntools of family planning, and tell the special interest groups that say \nno, that maybe they have gone a bit too far.\n  I have nothing but respect for my colleagues who are opposed to \nabortion. I wish there would never be another abortion in this world. \nBut I am also a realist enough to know that simply withholding family \nplanning money or passing laws does not stop abortion. Giving people \nalternatives to abortions, modern contraceptives, that does cut down on \nabortions.\n  As I say, I have nothing but the greatest respect for those who have \nmoral opposition to abortion. But we should be realistic. It is like \nthe old days when we passed laws against abortion and the back-room \nabortionists thrived, as they did in my State. When abortion was legal, \npeople made the choice.\n  This is not necessarily directly on point in this debate, but I \nremember and I remind people who think simply passing a law determines \nwhat is a very difficult question for any woman to ask, what happened \nin my State in days when I was a young prosecutor. I got a call at 3 \no'clock one morning to go to our medical center where a young woman lay \nnearly dying, hemorrhaging from an illegal abortion. As part of the \ninvestigation I instituted that 3 a.m. in the morning, we found out \nthat a number of women, some college students, had gone to one person \nin our community to seek abortions. He would arrange illegal abortions \nfor them. Abortions were performed by a man who had learned how to \nperform abortions while working for the SS at Auschwitz. The women \nwould be sent to Canada, the abortions would be performed. They were \nbasically the darning needle type of abortion, and subsequently he \nwould blackmail these women for money or sex. They had no other place \nto go. This is where they went. This one young woman nearly died, did \nnot die but ended up sterile as a result. If she had not nearly died, I \nnever would have found out about it. This man would never have been \nprosecuted. I prosecuted him. As a result of that, we ended up with \nanother case, which I was very proud of, called Leahy versus Beecham, a \npredecessor to Roe versus Wade, which made clear that abortions within \na medical context would be legal. Then the difficult question that any \nwoman would have to make would be her decision, whatever consequences \nwould be hers, not the manipulations of a back-room abortionist.\n\n  In a way, we do almost the same thing here. We say we will withhold \nsafe and legal alternatives to abortion, family planning, because we \nare against abortion. The abortions will go up. Abortions will go up \nand people will die. Instead, we should give families, from the largess \nof the United States, money to plan their families.\n  Madam President, I yield back all time on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/24/senate-section/article/S1433-3", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1448-S1468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 3:30 \np.m. having arrived, the Senate will now resume consideration of Senate \nJoint Resolution 1, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 1) proposing an amendment to \n     the Constitution of the United States to require a balanced \n     budget.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the joint resolution.\n\n       Pending:\n       Byrd amendment No. 6, to strike the reliance on estimates \n     and receipts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is amendment No. 6, \noffered by the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd].\n  The debate on the amendment is limited to 2 hours, equally divided \nand controlled in the usual form.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                      AMENDMENT NO. 6, AS MODIFIED\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment and send the modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 6), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 3, strike lines 12 through 14 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``Section 6. The Congress shall implement this article by \n     law.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair and I thank the manager of the \nresolution, Mr. Hatch, and I thank all Senators.\n  Madam President, the proponents of the proposed constitutional \namendment now before the Senate would have the American people believe \nthat if their proposal is adopted by Congress and ratified by three-\nfourths of the States, the Federal budget will then be constitutionally \nrequired to be balanced every year, unless supermajorities of both \nHouses pass waivers. But let us all remember that ``the devil himself \ncan quote Scriptures for his purpose.'' My purpose here is to strip \naway the hype and the rhetoric and examine the manner in which this \nconstitutional amendment will actually work.\n  Section 1 of the article states, ``Total outlays for any fiscal year \nshall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year * * *.'' That is \npretty plain. That seems quite straightforward and very clear. There \nappears to be no room for any misplay or misunderstanding. The entire \nFederal budget must be balanced each and every year, right down to the \nbottom dollar. Unlike State and local governments or businesses, where \nborrowing is frequently used for the purchase of capital investments--\nor, in the case of family budgets, where debt is incurred for the \npurchase of homes and automobiles and to pay for college tuition \ncosts--the Federal unified budget will not be allowed to incur debt for \nany reason under this amendment. Instead, the Federal Government's \ninvestments in military weaponry, highways, bridges, waterways, and all \nother capital items will have to be paid for, in full--cash on the \nbarrel head--as they are purchased. Total spending for any year for any \npurpose will have to be no greater than the income to the Treasury for \nthat same year if this amendment is adopted.\n  But, the question arises, just how are we mere mortals to ensure that \ntotal outlays do not indeed exceed receipts, and how will that \nconstitutional requirement be enforced?\n  How, indeed, given that the Federal budget deficit, its total \nreceipts and its total outlays, unlike the family budget, is based \nentirely on estimates? Granted, these estimates of total outlays and \ntotal receipts are prepared by some of the finest statistical wizards \nin this country--the men and women who work for the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  Once the amount of the deficit is set in the annual Congressional \nBudget Resolution, then the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, monitors \nthe performance of the economy throughout\n\n[[Page S1449]]\n\nthe year and keeps Congress informed as to whether the outlay estimate \nand the revenue estimate and the deficit estimate are going to be \ncorrect. But remember, these are all estimates--educated guesses, if \nyou will. I can produce one. You can produce one. It is an educated \nguess. But we live up to the educated guesses, or at least we are \nguided by the educated guesses of the Congressional Budget Office. \nThese are estimates of many factors in the public and private sectors \nwhich are totally outside of the control of any mortal human--totally \noutside the control of any human being.\n  We are told, just don't worry about that section 1. Don't lose any \nsleep over that section. The authors of the amendment have solved the \nproblem. We need only to look at section 6 of their proposal to find \nthe answer to the dilemma of how to ensure that the budget is balanced \nin every fiscal year, despite our having to rely on nothing more than \nestimates. Well, I want Senators, and I want the American people who \nare watching what is being said and what is being done here, to \nunderstand what they would be buying into here. What are you getting \nhere now? Is it just what you see? Is that what you get? We all need to \nthoroughly understand that crucially important section--section 6--of \nthe resolution.\n\n  Section 6 of the resolution reads as follows:\n\n       The Congress shall enforce and implement this article by \n     appropriate legislation, which may rely on estimates of \n     outlays and receipts.\n\n  `` * * * which may rely on estimates of outlays and receipts.''\n  So there you have it.\n  Congress may enforce balanced budgets by relying on ``estimates of \noutlays and receipts.'' We don't need to really balance the budget. We \ndon't need to comply with section 1, which requires the balancing of \nthe outlays, or the spending with the receipts, or the income right \ndown to the bottom dollar, as I said earlier. We don't need to do that. \nAll we have to do is balance the estimates.\n  So the American people need to understand this. They are being told \nthat if this constitutional amendment to balance the budget is adopted \nby the Congress and ratified by the States, that the budget will be \nbalanced. That is what article I says, no if's, and's, and but's about \nit.\n  The American people need to understand this. Unlike their family \nbudget, which is relatively stable as far as income and expenses are \nconcerned--most families know how much income they will have with which \nto purchase their needs from month to month and from week to week as \nthose individuals who receive salaries know from week to week and month \nto month how much those salaries will amount to. So they know how much \nincome they can count upon. But the Federal budget is far from being \nthat stable. The Federal budget is based on myriad estimates that are \ncompiled in advance of each fiscal year by the CBO, the Congressional \nBudget Office. These estimates have to include such factors as \ncorporate profits and how much revenues the Treasury will receive from \ncorporate and individual income taxes; what the unemployment rate will \nbe; what the rate of inflation will be; what interest rates will be 6 \nmonths from now or 9 months from now; and a whole host of other factors \nwhich we do not have to consider as we attempt to keep our own family \nfinances in order.\n\n  The fact is that when it comes to the Federal budget, we never know \nwhether the budget for any fiscal year is balanced until well after \nthat fiscal year is over--the clock has run its course and the calendar \nhas been exhausted--and the Treasury Department has had time to \nfinalize its tally of receipts and expenditures. And this usually \noccurs 3 or 4 weeks after the end of the fiscal year. So we really do \nnot know whether or not the budget is in balance; and if not, how high \nthe deficit is. We really don't know what the final figures are until 3 \nor 4 weeks after the end of the fiscal year. So, in truth, therein lies \nthe Achilles' heel of this amendment: In no year can we know for sure \nthat the budget is balanced until sometime after that year is over.\n  The proponents point to section 6 and say we can balance the budget \nby relying on estimates of outlays and receipts. Madam President, it is \ndisingenuous at best, and, at worst, it is a deliberate hornswoggle to \nlead the American people to believe that we can even come close to \nbalancing the actual budget by relying on estimates.\n  In fact, as I will now demonstrate in a series of charts, these \nestimates vary by billions of dollars--that is billions, not millions, \n``b,'' not ``m,'' billions, not millions--from the actual results in \nnearly every year.\n  Before turning to the specifics of these charts, let me emphasize \nthat the data presented in them come from the independent, nonpartisan \nCBO, the Congressional Budget Office. It is independent. It is neither \nDemocrat nor Republican. It is nonpartisan. These data are hot off the \npresses of the Congressional Budget Office and are taken from CBO's \nmost recent publication, entitled ``The Economic and Budget Outlook: \nFiscal Years 1998-2007.''\n\n  And here it is. This is the document that I am talking about.\n  I highly recommend that Senators, our colleagues here, read this \npublication. I highly recommend the publication to the American public. \nIt contains an entire chapter, namely chapter 3, which explains the \nuncertainties in budget projections and how these uncertainties in the \neconomy and in technical factors can greatly affect deficit \nprojections.\n  In that chapter, when referring to its latest deficit estimates, the \nCongressional Budget Office makes these statements, and I quote:\n\n       . . . considerable uncertainty surrounds those estimates \n     because the U.S. economy and the Federal budget are highly \n     complex and are affected by many factors, none of which can \n     be projected with full confidence.\n\n  That is the Congressional Budget Office talking, the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  Another quotation from that book:\n\n       Growth in potential gross domestic product (GDP) that was \n     half a percentage point higher or lower would decrease or \n     raise the deficit by $50 billion in fiscal year 2002.\n\n  Continuing to quote from that document:\n\n       Similarly, a fairly typical swing in the business cycle \n     would increase or decrease the deficit by more than $100 \n     billion in a given year.\n\n  Madam President, those are just two examples of changes in economic \nfactors which the Congressional Budget Office says could cause huge \nchanges in deficits for any fiscal year.\n\n  The Congressional Budget Office also says, and I quote:\n\n       An increase of 2 percentage points in the annual rate of \n     growth of Medicare and Medicaid alone could boost spending \n     for those two programs by about $50 billion in fiscal year \n     2002. If such technical errors (those not attributed to the \n     performance of the economy or legislation) pushed the deficit \n     in the same direction as economic errors in a particular \n     fiscal year, the deficit could swing by very large amounts.\n\n  That is the Congressional Budget Office talking. There you have it, \nMadam President. The very office which has the responsibility for \nproviding Congress with these annual deficit estimates tells us that \ntheir own calculations can be off by very large amounts.\n  In fact, as this chart shows, the difference between revenues, as \nestimated in the congressional budget resolution for each of fiscal \nyears 1980 through 1996, versus what revenues actually turned out to be \nfor each of those years, varied greatly.\n  Let me first point out that the green horizontal line on the chart \nrepresents a zero difference between estimated and actual revenues--no \ndifference whatsoever. That is what the green line is for any \nparticular year. There is no bar above or below the green line. That \nmeans that the Congressional Budget Office hit it right on the \nhead. The green line means that the CBO got it right on the nose. The \nblack numbers above the green line depict years in which actual \nrevenues exceeded the estimates--that occurred in six of these 17 \nyears: 1980, 1987, 1989, 1994, 1995, and 1996--when revenues were $36 \nbillion greater than CBO estimated they would be.\n\n  For 11 of those 17 years, actual revenues were less than CBO \nestimated they would be, and in a number of those years the revenue \nshortfalls were large. In 1983, for example, the shortfall was $65 \nbillion; and for 1992, Federal revenues were actually $78 billion less \nthan they were estimated to be by the Congressional Budget Office for \nthat year.\n  In all, over these 17 years, revenues never matched the estimate for \nany year--not one. On average, actual revenues collected by the Federal \nTreasury\n\n[[Page S1450]]\n\nwere off, in one direction or the other, by $29 billion. That is a \npretty big disparity.\n  The next chart shows for the same 17 year period, 1980 through 1996, \nthe differences between the estimated outlays and what actual outlays \nturned out to be. For those in our viewing audience, the term \n``outlays'' is a very fancy word for spending. Total outlays means \ntotal spending by the Federal Government for a given year.\n  Starting again on the left of the chart, the green horizontal line \nrepresents a bull's-eye for the CBO. They hit it right in the eye. But \nyou notice there is always a variation from the green line.\n  That green line represents a zero difference between CBO's estimates \nof what outlays were expected to be and what actual outlays turned out \nto be for each year. Again, as was the case with revenues, in no year--\nnot one--did actual Federal outlays, or spending, exactly equal the \nestimate. For 11 of the 17 years, actual spending was greater than the \nCBO estimate. In 1990, for example, outlays actually exceeded CBO's \nestimate by $85 billion. They were off $85 billion. Outlays, in 1993, \nwere $92 billion less than they were estimated to be.\n\n  So the point I am making is that the estimates are always wrong--\nalways.\n  On average, over this 17-year period, CBO missed hitting the bull's-\neye by $36 billion per year--per year. A pretty big ``goof,'' by most \nfolks' standards, I would say.\n  These first two charts have shown that at no time--no time --over the \nlast 17 years have either revenues, or income, or outlays, or spending, \nequaled the estimate for any year. About the only thing that we can \never be sure of when we talk about these estimates is that they will \nalways--always--be wrong. In fact, the whole point of these charts is \nto graphically demonstrate that these best guesses by the best experts \nare consistently, always wrong. And yet, despite knowing that the \nestimates we must work with have always been wrong and will inevitably \ncontinue to be wrong, they are exactly what this section, section 6 of \nthis resolution says Congress may rely on.\n  It is ludicrous to think that just because we adopt this \nconstitutional amendment--hear me out there--ludicrous to think that \njust because we adopt this constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget, somehow we will magically have accurate estimates every year in \nthe future. It just will not happen, unless, of course, someone comes \nup with a crystal ball that can accurately tell us at the beginning \nnow, at the beginning--that is what it says. That is what the amendment \nsays, at the beginning--at the beginning of each fiscal year what the \ngross domestic product will be for that year, or what the unemployment \nrate will be for that year, or what the inflation rate will be for that \nyear, or what interest rates will be for that year, or any of a number \nof other economic and technical factors. It just cannot be done.\n\n  In fact, during the debate on Senate Joint Resolution 1 on Wednesday, \nFebruary 12, the distinguished manager of the measure, Senator Hatch, \nand I debated this problem of the inaccuracy of estimates at some \nlength and during our debate the able manager made the following \nstatement. We took it down, and I quote:\n\n       Let us be honest. There is no way anybody can absolutely, \n     accurately tell what the outlays and receipts are going to be \n     in advance.\n\n  There it is, statement by the manager.\n\n       When we say ``total outlays of any fiscal year shall not \n     exceed,'' it has to be written that way because that is the \n     force that says, Congress, your estimates better be good, a \n     lot better than these statutory estimates we have had in the \n     past, because then we will be under a constraint to balance \n     the budget, or vote by a supermajority vote not to balance \n     it. That is the difference.\n\n  That is the end of my quotation of my esteemed colleague, Mr. Hatch.\n  The point is there is no difference. There is nothing in the pending \nmeasure that will make these estimates any more accurate in the future \nthan they are right now. I have already laid in the Record the \nstatements by CBO that their estimates of deficits can be off by tens \nof billions of dollars for reasons totally beyond any human being's \ncontrol. We will not do any better because we cannot do any better. The \nonly ``difference,'' if we put this hoptoad into the Constitution, will \nbe that we are out of sync with the Constitution of the United States \nif the real budget does not balance at the end of the year.\n\n  What are we in Congress to do then? How do we address an unbalanced \nFederal budget that we are unaware of until the very last minute, or 2 \nor 3 or 4 weeks after the very last minute? The very last minute the \nold fiscal year has come and gone, and then 3 weeks later we find out, \nor possibly even 4, from the Treasury Department what the actual \nfigures were, how much the estimates were off, how much the deficits \nare. So how do we address an unbalanced Federal budget at that point? \nHow do we square ourselves with the new constitutional dictate for \nbalance?\n  What happens when it becomes known that, in fact, there has been a \ndeficit for a year that has ended, even though Congress did not vote to \nwaive the balanced budget requirement of section 1? Will the President \ndecide that he is obligated to impound sufficient funds to make up the \ndifference, make up the deficit? Or failing any action by the \nPresident, will the courts step in to ensure compliance with the \nConstitution, albeit after the year in question has ended? Pretty \nfarfetched. But the President's impoundment of funds, that is not so \nfarfetched. It seems possible that one or both of these actions could \noccur. Remember, the President and the courts will have their own \nresponsibilities to ensure that the constitutional requirements for a \nbalanced budget are met. We are not going to be tinkering around with a \nsimple statute, you know. This is not just a simple statute that can be \nrepealed the next day or the next month or the next year. We will be in \nviolation of the basic, fundamental, organic law of this great Nation.\n\n  One thing is certain. Under this resolution, even if deficits are \nunintended, if they are allowed to stand, they will cause an increase \nin debt and therefore will ultimately force a vote under section 2 to \nincrease the debt limit. And what does section 2 say? That section \nrequires a supermajority vote of three-fifths of the whole number of \neach House of Congress and the President's signature in order to \nincrease the limit on U.S. debt held by the public.\n\n  What happens if this three-fifths vote cannot be achieved? A \nfinancial crisis could be upon us because, at the point when the debt \nlimit is reached and not raised, no more bills can be paid until that \ndebt limit is raised. Virtually all Federal payments would be subject \nto being withheld--I am not saying they would all be withheld, but they \nwould all be subject to being withheld--Social Security checks, \nveterans' pensions, payments on Medicare and Medicaid, payments to \ncontractors.\n  Pretty dire stuff to comprehend, may I say to my colleagues. But, lo \nand behold--lo and behold--ah, now we have it, section 6. There it is. \nSection 6 provides an escape hatch. It is not going to be so hard to do \nafter all. Section 6 provides a way out. Whoopee. I am thankful for the \nproponents having foreseen that we would need a way out of this dilemma \nso that we won't be caught hoisted by our own petard.\n  It is almost as if someone who had something to do with writing this \namendment realized that we could never actually balance the real budget \nin the real world, so they dreamed up the Houdini section. This is the \nHoudini section, section 6. Take a good look at it. The Houdini \nsection. Take a good look. The Houdini section lets us go ahead and use \nestimates, even though they are invariably going to be inaccurate; \ntherefore, it should be obvious to everyone that the Congress will not \nbe chained, bound or gagged by this constitutional amendment. We will \njust bring back some of our old friends like Rosy, Rosy Scenario, or \nresort to some of our well-known magic tricks with smoke and mirrors \nand, lo and behold, just like Houdini, escape--gone. How sweet it is.\n\n  I am perplexed as to how section 6 is intended to work. Will someone \nhelp me here? The distinguished manager is on the floor; perhaps he \nwill help me. I ask the manager of the pending resolution how and when \ndo you intend to put section 6 into effect? Let us see what it says. \nSection 6, ``The Congress shall enforce and implement this article by \nappropriate legislation, which\n\n[[Page S1451]]\n\nmay rely on estimates of outlays and receipts.'' Will we have to carry \nout this section 6 annually? Will we have a kind of floating definition \nof what the deficit will be every year? Or will we just declare that a \ndiscrepancy of, say, 1.4 percent of GDP is ``negligible'' for one year, \nand 1.5 percent is ``negligible'' for the next year?\n  Also, sections 1, 2, 4 and 5 use the terms--this is an interesting \nobservation. I hope the audience and especially my colleagues will pay \nclose attention. Sections 1, 2, 4 and 5 use the terms ``provided by \nlaw,'' ``provided by law,'' ``shall become law,'' ``which becomes \nlaw.'' Yet, section 6 uses a different term. It says, ``by appropriate \nlegislation.'' Why the difference? Section 1, which requires the budget \nto be balanced, which says, ``Total outlays for any fiscal year shall \nnot exceed total receipts for that fiscal year. . .'' it goes on to \nsay, ``. . . unless three-fifths of the whole number of each House of \nCongress shall provide by law for a specific excess of outlays over \nreceipts by a rollcall vote.'' So, there is the ironclad language \nreferring to law in section 1, in section 2, in section 4 and section \n5, but lo and behold, the Houdini section, section 6, does not say \nanything about law. So what does it mean by the term ``appropriate \nlegislation?'' Does this mean that we in Congress can ``enforce and \nimplement'' the article in each year's budget resolution? If so, would \nit not be possible for Congress to simply estimate that the budget will \nbe in balance, in the budget resolution each year, or, to describe a \ndeficit as ``negligible'' in the budget resolution and then pretend \nthat we have met the balanced budget requirement of section 1? What \nwould stop the President from stepping in and finishing the job in \nyears where Congress allowed ``negligible'' deficits? The President of \nthe United States may not want to go along with satisfying the \nrequirements of this amendment by calling a particular amount of \ndeficit a negligible amount.\n\n  I think it is obvious that section 6 shows this amendment to be \nunworkable. It is contradictory to the absolute requirement in section \n1 that the budget be balanced each year unless waived, and it invites \ncontinued deficits, which, if allowed, will likely create an automatic \ncrisis by forcing supermajority votes to raise the debt in order to pay \nfor those continuing deficits.\n  My amendment to section 6 is quite simple. It would modify section 6 \nto read: ``The Congress shall implement this article by law.'' Not by \n``appropriate legislation'' but ``by law.''\n  This language will disallow the use of estimates, which I have shown \nare always inaccurate. It will require Congress simply to comply with \nsection 1. It will eliminate all the gimmicks that section 6 currently \nallows. My amendment is to keep them honest. My amendment is the ``keep \nus honest'' amendment. Keep us honest. It requires ``truth in budget \nbalancing.'' Do it by law.\n  Without my amendment, the American people can expect to see all of \nthe budgeting tricks that are presently allowed by this committee \nreport to be, by implication--not literally, but by implication--\ninserted into the Constitution. Rather than rely on my own imagination, \nMr. President, let me read to you a few ideas for ingenious obfuscation \nwhich come from the Judiciary Committee's own report that accompanies \nthis resolution.\n\n  What does section 6 mean? On page 23 of that report, Senate Report \n105-3, it is stated that ``This provision,'' meaning section 6, ``gives \nCongress an appropriate degree of flexibility * * * .'' That is what \nthe committee report says, ``flexibility.'' Right there it is. There is \nthe word--``flexibility.''\n\n       It gives Congress--\n\n  I am quoting from the report--\n\n       It gives Congress an appropriate degree of flexibility in \n     fashioning necessary implementing legislation.\n\n  What is meant by ``flexibility''? Does anybody still use a dictionary \naround here? The Random House Dictionary defines flexibility as \n``capable of being bent,'' like a flexible piece of rubber hose. I \nthink that is probably a pretty accurate definition when it comes to \nthis amendment. It is going to be flexible, capable of being bent.\n  The report of the committee continues:\n\n       For example, Congress could use estimates of receipts or \n     outlays at the beginning of the fiscal year to determine \n     whether the balanced budget requirement of section 1 would be \n     satisfied, so long as the estimates were reasonable and made \n     in good faith.\n\n  Who is to be the judge? Does this mean that if we pass a budget that \nis balanced only on paper we need not worry, if the budget becomes \nunbalanced during the course of the year, as long as we were reasonable \nand exercised good faith? Who knows whether we are acting in good \nfaith? We could say so. In arriving at the estimates, does that make \nanything we pass hunky-dory? Is that the ideal we are supposed to \ninclude in our implementing legislation? If that is what the sponsors \nof this amendment have in mind, I suspect that it is very different \nfrom what the American people are expecting from a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget.\n  The next sentence states:\n\n       In addition, Congress could decide that a deficit caused by \n     a temporary, self-correcting drop in receipts or increase in \n     outlays during the fiscal year would not violate the \n     article.\n\n  Now, will someone explain to me how one can know in advance that a \ndeficit will be self-correcting? And what about the word ``temporary''? \nWell, there is a word one could really get his teeth into.\n  Mr. President, what that sentence says to me is that at the same time \nthe proponents of the amendment are telling the American people that a \nconstitutional amendment will bring about balanced budgets, they are \ntelling the Congress we don't have to practice what we preach.\n  Reading again from the report, the next sentence states:\n\n       Similarly, Congress could state that very small or \n     negligible deviations from a balanced budget would not \n     represent a violation of section 1.\n\n  Here we have the suggestion that the Congress could just stand up and \ndeclare that certain amounts of deficit, as long as we determined it \nwill be ``negligible,'' were not in violation of the amendment. We are \ntold, for example, that the deficit for 1996 of $107 billion equaled \nonly 1.4 percent of the Nation's $7.5 trillion gross domestic product. \nCould we declare that future deficits of not to exceed 1.4 percent of \nthe GDP would be ``negligible''? Just $107 billion, that's not much, \njust 1.4 percent. I suppose that is the kind of thing the proponents of \nthis resolution have in mind. But if we were to constitutionalize the \nmandate in section 1, that outlays shall not exceed receipts, any \ncongressional attempt to deviate from that requirement would bring the \nmoral authority of the entire Constitution into question. If we could \nviolate this amendment with impunity, then what other amendments of the \nConstitution could be put at risk?\n\n  And finally, the last sentence in this paragraph of the committee \nreport states:\n\n       If an excess of outlays over receipts were to occur, \n     Congress can require that any shortfall must be made up \n     during the following fiscal year.\n\n  Now, that is a loophole that, if adopted by the Congress as part of \nits implementing legislation, would be big enough for Hannibal to take \nhis 46,000 men and his 37 elephants, with which he crossed the Rhone \nRiver in 218 B.C., through. Of course, he had 80 elephants at the \nBattle of Zama in the year 202 B.C. But you could just take all those \nelephants, all 80 of them, through the loopholes created by those \nwords.\n  What the sponsors of the amendment are telling us is that if we \ncannot figure out what to do, if we run into options too difficult to \nswallow, we can just require that the shortfall be made up the next \nyear, just roll it over, just put it off until next year. The American \npeople, are they listening to what the committee report is telling us \nabout this constitutional amendment and how the strictures may be \navoided? They are right there in the print of the committee report. \nWhat kind of fiscal shenanigan is this? Just put it off till next year?\n  The American people think that budget is going to be balanced every \nyear, but that is not what the committee report says. That is not what \nsection 6, the Houdini section of the constitutional amendment, will \nallow. It won't be balanced, need not be balanced. So much for holding \nour feet to the fire. One can tell from these clever little suggestions \nin the committee report that Congress has no intention of\n\n[[Page S1452]]\n\nhaving its feet held to the fire and getting burned by this amendment.\n  Let me emphasize again, these little gems about how to deal with the \ndeficit under a balanced budget amendment come from the committee's \nreport on Senate Joint Resolution 1. As such, they would not become \npart of the underlying resolution if it were to pass. They would not \nhave the force of law in any respect, but, nevertheless, they ought to \ngive the American people some idea of the kinds of gimmicks and \nevasions that the American people can expect to see if this amendment \nis passed by the Congress of the United States and ratified by the \nStates.\n  The American people are being sold a bag of tricks. They are not \nbeing told about the realities of actually balancing the Federal budget \neach and every year. As I listen to those who speak in favor of a \nbalanced budget amendment, I do not hear them telling the people that \nto comply with this mandate, we really intend just to roll the deficit \nfor a given year over into the following year. Won't that just compound \nthe problem the next year? We will end up with ``rolling deficits,'' \nanother term. I do not hear the proponents of this amendment telling \nthe public that the Congress could just state, ``Oh, well, the deficit \nis negligible and so nothing will need to be done this year about it.'' \nI do not hear the proponents telling the public that if this \nconstitutional amendment is passed and ratified, the implementing \nlegislation will only require that the budget be balanced on paper at \nthe beginning of the year. That is not what the American people are \nbeing told.\n  Mr. President, how much confidence have even the authors of this \namendment, if, as is evident right in the committee report, they have \nalready started figuring out ways to weasel around, slip around, get \naround the amendment? No, Mr. President, this proposal is not worthy of \nbeing enshrined in the Constitution of the United States. It is little \nmore than political pandering thrown up to screen the real difficulty \nof getting to budget balance each and every year. And I do not think \nthat we should perpetrate this charade upon the American people. If it \nwere simply a joke, which it is, if it were simply a political dodge, \nwhich it is, it would be regrettable and unwise to adopt. But it is \nmuch, much worse than those things.\n\n  This proposal is potentially dangerous. Within its murky appeal and \nunsound formula for budget balance lie the seeds for the further, \nrampant diminishment of the trust of the American people in their \nGovernment and in their rulers whom they elect. The legislative branch \ncan ill-afford any more cynicism and loss of trust. And I worry as much \nabout the trust deficit as I do about the fiscal deficit. The American \npeople do not trust their politicians now.\n  Often Members believe that doing what seems to be the safe, popular \nthing will prove also to be the right thing. Political correctness is \nthe supposed order of the day for many people. Not for me. I believe \nthat endorsing this balanced budget amendment has taken on the aura of \na politically sacred act. It has become a litmus test of sorts--the \nright choice to make the political meter register 100 percent in one's \nfavor.\n  But whether or not we amend the Constitution in this damaging way--\nand I am not against amending the Constitution per se, because the \nConstitution itself provides for its own amendment--but I am \nunalterably opposed to amending the Constitution in this way. The \nAmerican people must be made to understand that once one takes a closer \nlook at this idea it is far from what it seems. I hope that each \nSenator will carefully study this amendment before voting on it. Of \ncourse, most of them have already made up their minds. Many are \ncommitted and probably feel that they cannot break out of the chains of \ntheir commitments. I believe that close and open minded scrutiny of \nthis proposal shreds it, reveals its many shortcomings and unmasks its \nbenign countenance to reveal the sinister seeds of a constitutional \ncrisis in the making or a Constitution in the ruining.\n  Mr. President, we are told in the Bible that Ezekiel felt the hand of \nthe Lord upon him and he was carried down into the midst of a valley \nwhich was full of dry bones. He was told by the Lord to prophesy upon \nthe bones and to say that the Lord God would cause breath to enter into \nthe bones and they would be covered with sinews and flesh and skin and \nthat they would be filled with breath and that the bones would come \ntogether, bone to bone, and that they would live and stand upon their \nfeet and become an exceeding great army.\n  Do not believe, however, that flesh will grow upon the dry bones of \nthis constitutional amendment. The breath of life cannot be breathed \ninto that carcass. It will never stand upon its feet. It is but dry \nbones and it will remain in the valley of dry bones.\n  Anyone who believes that this constitutional amendment will work is \nreally living in a fool's paradise--a state of illusive bliss, \nsuspended in a limbo of hypocrisy, double-speak, double-shuffle, \nvanity, and nonsense. Surely we will not travel this road if we are \nfully aware of where it may lead. In the days ahead, let us be very \nsure of just what it is we propose to do to our country and to our \nConstitution before we act. Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as always, I enjoyed the distinguished \nsenior Senator from West Virginia. He is always colorful. He always \nuses a great number of metaphors that are very interesting. He is \nintelligent. He is competent. And he is formidable, one of the most \nformidable Senators in history. So it is very difficult for the Senator \nfrom Utah to be as formidable. But I can say this. If we are going to \ntalk about Ezekiel and bones, dry bones, here is 28 years of it, 28 \nyears of dry bones lying over everywhere with no sinews and no \npossibility of any sinews, in other words, resurrection, unless we do \nsomething to countermand this philosophy of taxing and spending the \nAmerican people blind.\n  My friend talks about Hannibal crossing the Alps. If my historical \nbackground is correct, the discussion of Hannibal in the Alps was by \nLivy, who wrote the ``History of Rome''. I think it was a little unfair \nto bring in 37 elephants. Actually, as I recall the estimate was at \nleast 100 donkeys who, if Hannibal was alive today, would probably, as \nthe good Democrat that he was, be trampling all over the balanced \nbudget amendment with all of those donkeys--not elephants. I think the \nelephants would be nudging him forward to try to do what is right.\n  What the distinguished Senator from West Virginia seems to be saying \nto me, and to the world at large, in his comments here today is that \nthe estimates that we use in the budget system today are faulty. They \nhave never been right. He does not take into account the fact that \nCongress has continually changed the rules in the bills and the \nspending practices throughout each year. And that is one of the reasons \nwhy the estimates have not been even close to being right in most \ncases.\n  Therefore, he seems to be making this syllogism. We use faulty \nestimates now. It appears to him that we will not be able to prevent \nthe use of faulty estimates if the balanced budget amendment is passed. \nTherefore, rather than do something that might put some discipline into \nthe budgetary process, let us retain the current faulty system.\n  His amendment does not address the problem he is raising. So the \ndistinguished Senator seems to be arguing for the current \nunsatisfactory system, no change whatsoever. I have to add, these \nunbalanced budgets are higher than I am, I guess, or pretty close to \nit. The Senator argues for no change of the continuation of unbalanced \nbudget after unbalanced budget, because there will not be any \nincentives to get the estimates right, will not be any incentives to \nstop Congress from continuing to spend and raise new spending programs \nevery year that we are in this budget process. The balanced budget \namendment would give us incentives to get things right.\n  If there is a charade, if there is a joke, if there is a dodge, it is \nduring each of these 28 years. I have been here 21 of them, and I am \nashamed to say that every one of my 21 years in the Senate, we have had \nan unbalanced budget. The reason is because we do not have a good \nsystem, we do not have a constitutional mandate to force us to do what \nis right. That is what this amendment will do.\n\n[[Page S1453]]\n\n  Now, my friend says Americans do not trust their politicians. I think \nthat is right. I think his points are well taken. The fact of the \nmatter is, the reason they do not trust us is because they have seen 28 \nstraight years of this, and for 58 of the last 66 years, we have had \nthese kinds of unbalanced budgets.\n  Now, is that a good argument for keeping the status quo, for \ncontinuing what we are doing and mortgaging the future of our children? \nI do not think so. I do not know anybody who looks at it carefully who \nwould think so.\n  There are hoptoads all over the current system, whatever a hoptoad \nis, but they are all over the current system. The system is not \nworking. The reason it is not working is because there is no incentive \nto make it work other than to tax and to spend more. You get more \ncredit for spending around here than you do for standing up and saying, \n``Hey, where will the money come from?'' Some of my colleagues of the \nmore liberal persuasion have been here longer than I have, and I have \nyet to hear some of them say, ``Where do we get the money for that \nprogram?'' No, they go ahead and spend away our children's future, \nspend away our grandchildren's future. Do not worry, have a good time \nnow and let them pay for it.\n  We have reached a point where every living man, woman, and child in \nthis country owes about $20,000 as their share of the national debt \nright now, as we stand here. Yet, some are arguing for the status quo, \na system that is not working, a system that will go on as a broken \nsystem, a system where there is no discipline. We have tried five \ndifferent statutory plans since 1978 and none of them have worked.\n  Now, I have to say if it was up to my friend from West Virginia and \nmyself, I think we could get together.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. On your time, I am happy to yield to the Senator, and if \nyou need extra time, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  The Senator continues to refer to the present system; he says that \nthe Senator from West Virginia apparently prefers the present system.\n  Mr. HATCH. Did I say that? I am implying that.\n  Mr. BYRD. You did not say that exactly.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am strongly suspicious that the Senate may prevail over \nthe balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Tell me, Mr. President, may I ask the Senator, and I am one \nwho believes we ought to do what we can to balance the budget----\n  Mr. HATCH. I acknowledge that.\n  Mr. BYRD. And to reduce the deficits, but I do not think we ought to \ngo about it by way of a constitutional amendment. But the Senator from \nUtah continues to talk about the present system, the weaknesses of the \npresent system.\n  Section 6 is in the constitutional amendment. That is the present \nsystem. That continues the present system of working with estimates of \noutlays and receipts.\n  So there is nothing different, except the Constitution of the United \nStates will be trivialized. There will be nothing different in what we \nare talking about balancing the budget for real after the Constitution \nhas been amended than from what the situation at present is.\n\n  Reading section 6:\n\n       The Congress shall enforce and implement this article by \n     appropriate legislation, which may rely on estimates of \n     outlays and receipts.\n\n  Now, I have been talking all afternoon, or for almost 1 hour, about \nestimates of outlays and receipts and the fact that they are never, \nnever accurate.\n  I hope the Senator from Utah, when he refers to the present system, \nhe scores, he excoriates, and I do not blame him for that, the \n``present system''--the ``present system.'' He wants to get away from \nthe present system. Well, he is not doing it in section 6, because \nunder section 6 we are told, this is the Houdini section, the section \nthat tells Congress it can do it, it can balance the budget, it can \ncarry out the mandate under the constitutional amendment by relying on \nestimates of outlays and receipts. So the Senator from Utah is not \ngetting away from the present system when he falls back on section 6.\n  May I ask the Senator this question: What is meant in this section 6 \nby ``appropriate legislation''? What does that mean?\n  Mr. HATCH. The same thing that is meant in every constitutional \namendment since the Civil War.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me answer the question.\n  In addition, and I will take back my time, in addition to the fact \nthat we have no strong incentives under the current system to stay \nwithin either the estimates or the budget that is under the current \nsystem, Congress often compounds the problems inherent in using \nestimates by making changes in policy that the estimates did not \nforesee. There is no disincentive under the current system for doing \nthis without great concern about the effect on compliance with the \nbudget plan.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could finish. I want to answer your question, and it \nwill take me a second because it is an interesting question, and then I \nwill be happy to yield.\n  Under Senate Joint Resolution 1, Congress will, by necessity, need to \nbe more careful about its decisions through the year in order to comply \nwith the constitutional directive of the other sections. For instance, \nsection 6 simply recognizes that to be reasonable and workable, we will \nneed to rely on estimates throughout the fiscal year in complying with \nthe balanced budget amendment rule.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is the present system.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me finish. If there is a minor or negligible drop \nbelow balance at the end of the year, and we find out that has occurred \nafter the fiscal year has ended, we can avoid constitutional problems \nfor minor deviations. However, we still have an incentive to get the \nbudget back in line because section 2's debt ceiling provision does not \nrely on estimates.\n  That is where the distinguished Senator is missing the point of this \namendment. Section 2 does not rely on estimates. It requires that we \nnot increase the debt without a three-fifths vote, and to avoid hitting \nthe debt ceiling we have every incentive to stay at or above balance \nand to ensure that small deviations are actually made up.\n\n  All of this is substantially better than the current system, which is \nnot working. The current system is where we make our estimates and then \nwe immediately forget about them and pass whatever legislation we want \nto, and that is why they are always out of balance. It has given us 28 \nstraight years of unbalanced budgets, and deficits for 58 of the last \n66 years--enough to drive anybody who is fiscally responsible wild.\n  To argue that this current way of doing things is better than having \nfiscal discipline written into the Constitution, I think completely \nmisses the point. Senate Joint Resolution 1 is a necessary step to give \nus the incentives to do something about this mess of unbalanced budgets \nthat are going to continue unless we have something like this.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator has not answered my question. What is meant by \nthe words ``appropriate legislation'' in section 6? I want to point out \nthe big hole that section 6 provides for the Congress, so that Congress \ncan avoid section 1 of the amendment, which requires a dollar-for-\ndollar match between spending and income. What is meant by \n``appropriate legislation''?\n  May I say as a predicate to asking the question, as I pointed out \nearlier, in section 1 reference is made to the word ``law.'' Section 1 \nis really a binding section if you just stood it out there alone: \n``Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for \nthat fiscal year, unless three-fifths of the whole number of each House \nof Congress shall provide by law.''\n  Section 1 says Congress must ``provide by law.'' Section 2 says: \n``The limit on the debt shall not be increased * * * unless three-\nfifths of the whole number of each House shall provide by law.'' \nSection 4 refers to increases in revenue which shall become law. \nSection 5 refers, and uses the words, ``which becomes law.''\n  Why is it, Mr. Manager of the bill, my dear colleague, Senator Hatch, \nwhy is it that section 6 uses the words ``appropriate legislation''? It \ndoes not say\n\n[[Page S1454]]\n\nthat Congress shall enforce and implement this article by law, which \nmay rely on estimates of outlays and receipts. It says by ``appropriate \nlegislation.'' What is meant? Does that mean a simple resolution? Does \nthat mean a concurrent resolution? Does that mean a joint resolution? \nDoes that mean a bill? What is meant by ``appropriate legislation''? \nWhy is the change made there? It is perfectly obvious that there must \nbe some reason lurking behind this change in the word ``law'' in other \nareas of the constitutional amendment, but in section 6 it uses the \nwords ``appropriate legislation.'' ``The Congress shall enforce and \nimplement this article by appropriate legislation.'' What does that \nmean?\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I will answer the Senator. First, how much time remains on \nboth sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 49 minutes. The \nSenator from West Virginia has 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. All right. I thank the Chair. The term ``by law,'' used in \nthe Senate Joint Resolution 1, sections 1 and 2 is used there in order \nto make clear that Congress cannot imbalance the budget or raise the \ndebt limit by an internal rule. Why? The President must sign a bill for \nit to become a ``law.'' The President is not involved in the adoption \nof rules in the Senate or House.\n  The term ``by appropriate legislation'' is used in Senate Joint \nResolution 1, section 6, because that is the standard term used in all \nother enforcement clauses in the Constitution since the Civil War. So \nwe have followed that which has been used. And I believe it will be \ninterpreted similarly to the word ``law.'' But be that as it may, it \nhas not been a problem since the Civil War, and I don't believe it will \nbe a problem now.\n  Specifically, ``appropriate legislation'' means that it satisfies \narticle 1, passed by both Houses and is signed by the President. But \nthe language actually mirrors all enforcement clauses in the \nConstitution since the Civil War. So I don't quite see the problem that \nthe distinguished Senator from West Virginia does, and I don't think \nanybody else will.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. BYRD. There is a massive problem here. For some reason --and I \nthink the distinguished manager has put his finger on it --the \nconstitutional amendment refers to actions by the Congress that \nconstitute laws--until we get down to section 6. Section 6 is an \nalternative to section 1. Section 1 is a rather binding section, which \nsays, ``Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total \nreceipts * * *''--``shall'' not, not ``may'' not, not ``ought'' not, \nbut ``shall'' not exceed--``* * * for that fiscal year, unless three-\nfifths of the whole number of each House of Congress shall provide by \nlaw. * * *''\n  That is pretty binding. If that section stood by itself, it would be \npretty hard to get around it. But, lo and behold, the authors of the \namendment have come along with the Houdini section --section 6--which \nas much as says you don't have to do it by law, and you can do it by \nrelying on estimates of outlays and receipts.\n  Now, if you had to do it by law, under section 7 of Article I of the \nConstitution, which is the presentment clause, whatever we do in \nsection 6 would have to be presented to the President of the United \nStates. He could veto it. But we have a way out here. Section 6 allows \nus, by ``appropriate legislation,'' to avoid section 1. And appropriate \nlegislation can be a concurrent resolution between the two Houses. It \nis kind of an agreement or an understanding, or a ``shake hands'' deal \nbetween the two Houses. It doesn't go to the President. It isn't \npresented to the President under section 7, the presentment clause. He \nhas no voice in the matter--none. He can't veto. And so section 6 \nallows Congress, in the concurrent resolution on the budget, to put in \nwhatever standards it wants. It can write into the resolution that so \nlong as the deficits do not exceed, say, 1.5 percent of the gross--it \nused to be gross national product, but now it is gross domestic \nproduct--as long as it doesn't exceed 1.5 percent or 1.4 percent. To \nsome, that would be considered negligible. But, as we have seen, with a \n$7.5 trillion GDP, 1.4 or 1.5 percent can amount to over $100 billion. \nBut the President won't have any voice in that. It won't have to go \nacross his desk. He can't veto this little Houdini section. What we do \nthere is all that we will do, but we don't have to do----\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from West Virginia has \nexpired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Does the Senator need more time?\n  Mr. BYRD. I will finish my sentence. I thank the Senator from Utah \nfor his usual courtesy. We will not be bound by section 1. We can do it \nby way of section 6, which does not require a three-fifths vote for a \nwaiver. And we will be complying with section 6 if we do it in a simple \nresolution, which is only an action by the Senate concerning the \nSenate, or on a concurrent resolution, which is an action between the \nHouses and which doesn't have to go to the President for signature.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Utah. It seems to me that the \nwords in section 6 should give Senators pause. I am sure they would \ngive the American people pause if they understood what Congress can do \nunder that section.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I don't want to spend a lot of time on this \nbecause I don't think that is a good point. Ever since the Civil War, \nthe 13th, 14th, 15th, 19th, 24th, and 26th amendments have used the \nlanguage ``appropriate legislation,'' which, under the Chadha decision \nof the Supreme Court, is interpreted as a law as signed by the \nPresident. It has to be submitted to the President.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield briefly?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  Mr. BYRD. Has Congress ever passed any civil rights statutes by \nconcurrent resolution, or by a simple resolution?\n  Mr. HATCH. Not that I know of.\n  Mr. BYRD. No, indeed, but by a joint resolution or a bill, which have \nthe force of law and go to the President for signature.\n  Mr. HATCH. Under the Supreme Court decision in Chadha, appropriate \nlegislation has to go to the President and become a law. I think it is \na moot point, to be honest with you. Frankly, we are using the language \nof the Constitution itself, and appropriately so, in my opinion.\n  I notice the distinguished Senator from Wyoming is here. He would \nlike to speak for 8 minutes. I yield to him, and then I would like to \nhave the time back so I can finish my statement. I want to respond to \nmy dear colleague's thoughtful comments. They are intelligent comments, \nand I always enjoy listening to him as one of the true experts in this \nbody. I mean every word I am saying, as well. I don't agree with him on \nmuch of what he is saying here today, but so what. The fact is, I \nrespect him.\n\n  I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the new \ncounsel on my committee staff, Brian Jones, be granted floor privileges \nfor the remainder of the day on the balanced budget constitutional \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for granting \nme this time.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment that is \nsponsored by my distinguished colleague from West Virginia, Senator \nByrd. The amendment would strike the language from section 6 of the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment that permits Congress to rely \non budget estimates when drafting the implementing language pursuant to \nthe ratification of the amendment.\n  As the only accountant in the U.S. Senate, I know that no budget can \nbe predicted to the penny more than a year in advance. I would like to \nsee that extended out to 2 years in advance. If we demand better \nestimates, we will get better estimates. If more is riding on the \nestimates, the estimates will be better. The estimators' performance \nand ours will be judged. The very heart of budgeting means making \nestimates before the money is spent. There is no way to do it after the \nmoney is spent. You have to do it in\n\n[[Page S1455]]\n\nadvance. Advance means estimates. Without the use of the estimates of \nfuture outlays and receipts, we will be unable to draft implementing \nlegislation that keeps us within the boundaries of the balanced budget \namendment.\n  As an accountant, I am fascinated with the budget discussion because \nwe are talking about numbers. We are talking about balancing budgets. \nWe are talking about formats that will provide us with the most \ninformation possible. And we are doing it in the context of a real \nbudget, dealing with real people. We are doing it in the context of a \nhistory where we have only had one balanced budget in 40 years. We have \nnot balanced the budget in 28 years.\n  Some very valid accounting concerns have been raised here in the \ndebate by opponents of the balanced budget constitutional amendment. I \nhave heard reference to the need for capital budgets. I have heard \nreference to a need for Social Security to be off budget. I have heard \nreference to the need to take care of accounting problems that happen \nduring recessions. As an accountant, I applaud this insight into the \nneed for new accounting methods. We need to have cash flow budgets so \nthat as cash arrives the purchases can be made without extensive \ndeficits. It is just good business. A balanced budget amendment will \nforce us to have a better accounting system and to even have better \nestimates.\n  I have heard debate about the concern with the Judiciary Committee's \ndefinitions for estimates. The committee stated that estimates, for \nexample, ``means good faith, responsible and reasonable estimates made \nwith an honest intent to implement section 1.'' I would add that \ngenerally accepted principles would also ask that they be conservative \nestimates. We all know that there is no way to be absolutely accurate \nabout estimates. We have to do the best we can to estimate outlays and \nreceipts and do it routinely at the same day each year.\n  If we really want to talk about problems with definitions, ``off \nbudget'' is a fascinating accounting term. In fact, in my accounting \nreferences I couldn't even find that term. I have to say from listening \nto discussions that there doesn't seem to be a lot of consensus on what \nthat really means.\n  It looks like we found another catchword that scares senior citizens \nand scares people and gives us a hook not to vote on this. As one who \ndaily approaches being a senior I want to see us get that rhetoric out \nof that term. We give the impression that Social Security has enough \nmoney at the moment. We talk about the surpluses going into Social \nSecurity and being used in the budget. Without estimates of outlays and \nreceipts, it would be impossible to gauge the problems that currently \naffect the very existence of the Social Security system.\n  Let's talk a little bit more about definitions. I think that \naccountants frown on the Federal term ``surplus'' revenue. Surplus \nimplies more than what is needed. That is definitely not the case with \nSocial Security. Social Security is a trust fund. But we give the \nimpression that that money is being set aside in a special account for \nseniors so that when they retire there will be money to be drawn out in \ntheir name. That is not even close to what actually happens.\n  We don't have a crystal ball, only reasonable estimates from which to \nwork. The President and Congress currently use estimates and budget \nplanning. The Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management \nand Budget already give budget estimates each year. It has been pointed \nout how accurate they are. One is more conservative than the other. \nThey correct the estimate twice during the year to ensure their \naccuracy. Congress ultimately decides how to balance the difference \nbetween the estimates.\n  We need to have a system where we can see how far in debt we are. And \nwe need to do that not just for Social Security but for every single \ntrust fund that we have, and the budget. We either have to change the \naccounting system, account for funds honestly and show how much deficit \nthere is, or rename them so that they are not called trust funds. \nPerhaps we should do both.\n  We are not snake oil salesmen here. Meeting the requirements of the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment will require Congress to go \nabout their business with a great level of accountability. Spending and \nborrowing decisions must be deliberate because every decision will \nimpact the requirement of this balanced budget constitutional \namendment.\n  I think those people who are opposing the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment know in their hearts that this one will pass \nand will also have more swift ratification by the States than most of \nthe other amendments to the Constitution.\n  Why will that happen? First, most of the States already have a \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment. They work under them, and \nthey know that they work. And, incidentally, those work with estimates. \nThey know their limitation and the type of problems that develop from \nit. The States understand that problems are not a detriment to the \nUnited States having a balanced budget constitutional amendment.\n  The concern of the inaccuracy of the estimates is overblown. The data \nthat are often used are generated months to over a year in advance to \nthe end of the fiscal year. In fact, the Federal Reserve uses its own \nestimates to help set its own policy. It also makes mistakes. For \nexample, in the July 1996 Humphrey-Hawkins banking deregulation \nhearing, Chairman Alan Greenspan predicted the GDP would grow at about \n2.5 to 2.75 percent. Instead, it grew by about 3.4 percent. Quite a \ndifference; billions in difference. Is that to say that the Fed should \nnot use estimates because they do no more than identify the economic \ntrends and provide decisionmakers with useful information? Yes, an \nestimate is an educated guess. Where else would we start? Where else \nwould the Fed start in determining its policy?\n\n  I think that most people in this body realize that a constitutional \namendment will pass and get ratified by the States. If we didn't \nbelieve that it would be ratified by the States, this would be a real \neasy debate. But we know that the people of the States want it and the \nStates will respond. If just those States with one or more Senators \nopposing the balanced budget constitutional amendment did not ratify \nthe constitutional amendment, it would never become a constitutional \namendment. So if those Senators' States did not ratify it where one or \nmore Senators were opposing it, we wouldn't have the constitutional \namendment. If we did not have appropriate legislation, those people in \nthose States would not have to raise the confusion that we are having \nraised right here today; that is, to get a hook so that they can \nexplain a vote that is very difficult to explain back home.\n  The people understand from their own experience that you can't spend \nmore than you take in. Almost every school kid above third grade is \nable to explain that to me--that, if you spend more money than you take \nin, you go broke. By third grade they have already had enough \nexperience to realize this fact of life. It has been said that we can \nlearn much from children. Children focus on problems in more simple \nterms. There is a difference between being simplistic and being simple.\n  If you went to your banker and said, ``I want to borrow money to buy \na house, and I don't want to have to pay anything but the interest for \nthe rest of my life,'' do you think you would get that loan? No, you \nwouldn't. But that is what we are doing right now with the national \ndebt. By not balancing the budget, the Federal Government has not been \ngood about limiting or disciplining itself in any way.\n  How does this relate to the constitutional amendment? I am suggesting \nthat, if we limit ourselves by a balanced budget constitutional \namendment, we will concentrate more on what we really do well. We will \nhave more people participating and less people expecting Government to \ndo things for them, more caring concern for our elders, and more \nconcentration on our children's and grandchildren's welfare, if we have \na balanced budget amendment.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am going to try to reserve some time out \nof my time for the Senator from West Virginia to make closing remarks \nhere today. If that is all right, I will reserve some time for the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia to make closing remarks out of \nmy time.\n\n[[Page S1456]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senator is very kind and generous. It is \nmost characteristic of him.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time would the distinguished Senator like to have \nto close out at the end?\n  Mr. BYRD. Two or three minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me reserve 5 minutes for the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague. I have great respect for him, as I \nhave said. I have been around here a long time, and I have seen \nSenators come and go. This Senator is one of the greatest of all time, \nand I have respect for him. I do not agree with him here today, but I \ndo have respect for him. And I want his amendment to be given every \nconsideration.\n  Mr. President, today we begin our third week of debate on the \nbalanced budget amendment. Our national budget as of right now is going \nto $5.4 trillion. That is about $20,000 for every man, woman, and child \nin America.\n  Believe me, when we are talking about the debt we are placing on the \nbacks of our children and grandchildren, we are truly playing with \nfire, and we have been getting burned for 28 years, the 28 years \nrepresented by these unbalanced budgets--these stacks are obscene, and \nyet that is what we face ad infinitum if we do not have this balanced \nbudget amendment. These stacks will reach all the way to the ceiling of \nthis Chamber. And it is time to do something. We have been getting \nburned for 28 years now--actually, 58 of the last 66 years. That is \nwhat those two towers of debt mean. There is only one way to scale this \ntower of debt and only one way we will ever reach and remain at a \nbalanced budget. There is only one cure that I can think of for this \naddiction that we have for debt. That is this balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Everybody knows it is a bipartisan amendment. Everybody knows it has \nbeen worked out with Democrats and Republicans. Everybody knows it is \nthe only one that has a chance of passage. Everybody knows we have to \nkeep amendments off or we lose Senators here or Senators there. \nEverybody knows it is the best possible language we can arrive at and \nstill have it be bipartisan.\n  There are Senators over here who want to have a three-fifths vote to \nincrease taxes. We cannot do that and have it bipartisan, even though \nthe Senator from Utah may have some sympathy for that attitude. We have \nSenators on the other side who wish that we did not have a \nconstitutional majority to raise taxes, and that certainly they would \nlike us not to have a three-fifths majority to increase the debt. But \nin order to have a bipartisan amendment and satisfy people on this side \nof the aisle--and, by the way, people on the other side--we have come \nto this conclusion. So anybody who says that they have to have their \none little amendment or they cannot vote for this, they are for \nbalanced budgets and they are for a balanced budget amendment but they \ncannot vote for this, they may be sincere, but, in most cases, they are \nobfuscating. The fact is, they knew at the beginning of this debate if \nwe cannot pass this amendment as it is, there will never be a balanced \nbudget amendment and there will never be, at least I do not think \nthere will ever be, a fiscal mechanism put into the Constitution that \nwill require us to at least do what is right here.\n\n  This afternoon we are resuming the consideration of the Byrd \namendment, which would remove the ability of the Congress to rely on \nestimates in implementing the balanced budget amendment.\n  Let me just say a few things about this proposal, keeping in mind I \nwant to reserve some time for my colleague on the other side. If there \nare any Republicans who want to speak, I hope they will get over here \nsoon, because I am going to reserve the last 5 minutes for my colleague \nfrom West Virginia.\n  Estimates are a necessary tool to be used by a more vigilant Federal \nGovernment living under current law or under the balanced budget \namendment. The very first step in the perennial budgeting process is \nthe presentation of the budget estimates of OMB and the CBO, the Office \nof Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office.\n  We have just seen this process in action this last month as the \nPresident proposed his budget and the Congressional Budget Office came \nout with its latest deficit predictions, predicting that even though \nthe President is trying to balance the budget--of course, 75 percent of \nthe cuts are in the last 2 years after he has left office--even at \nthat, it is $49 billion in debt come the year 2002.\n  This process has not been the subject of intense scrutiny or \nrecriminations. I do not understand why, if it is satisfactory now, \nsome have argued it is insufficient under the balanced budget \namendment.\n  Now, we all know that no budget can be predicted to the penny more \nthan a year and a half in advance, particularly not the $1.6 or $1.7 \ntrillion Federal budget. Even I am amazed at how high it is now. The \nbottom line is that we have no crystal ball, only reasonable estimates \nupon which to work. The President and the Congress use estimates now in \nbudget planning. They are a necessary part of the process. They will \ncontinue whether this passes or not. But there will be some incentives \nto be more careful if the balanced budget amendment passes. The \nbalanced budget amendment accepts the plain truth that the President \nand Congress use estimates in the budget process and that they are a \nnecessary part of the process and that they will have to have continued \nuse.\n  The difference is that the balanced budget amendment provides new \nincentives for Congress to be more vigilant in actually getting to \nbalance or being more deliberate and accountable in our spending and \nborrowing decisions. In the past, estimates have been off target at \nleast in part because there was no incentive to get them right in the \nfirst place and no real sanction for getting them wrong or failing to \nlive within them. It is ultimately up to Congress to determine the \nestimates that we use, and, more importantly, it is up to Congress \nwhether they will work to stay within Congress' projected budget or the \nestimates' projected budget.\n  Under current practice, once the Congress passes a budget resolution, \nit never looks back at these predictions with an eye to adjusting its \nbehavior to accommodate new information. Whether the estimates were in \nfact right or wrong, high or low, Congress is never held accountable \nunder the current system for the accuracy of its estimates or its \nfailure to stay within the stated budget based on those estimates. \nUnder the balanced budget amendment, we would have to be much more \nvigilant. If the estimates are incorrect, then we, the Congress, will \nhave to set things right to get back on track. Failure to do so would \nforce the Congress to muster a three-fifths vote to approve the deficit \nand announce to the American people that we have failed to do our job. \nThat is what it will mean. In other words, Congress will be held \naccountable for its own predictions. This incentive can only help us \nmake more realistic projections and to work to abide by our stated \nbudget goals.\n\n  Further, we have only heard part of the story on the accuracy of \nestimates. The statistics most often cited to show that the CBO is \nfrequently off target when trying to predict the budget are the \nearliest estimates that the CBO compiles, often a full 20 months before \nthe end of the fiscal year they are predicting. But there are many \nother sources of updated information throughout the year. Both OMB, the \nPresident's Office of Management and Budget, and the CBO, the \nCongressional Budget Office, update their budget statistics for the \ncurrent year and their estimates for the next year every February and \nevery August. Further, the Treasury Department issues monthly \nstatements showing detailed information on receipts, outlays, and \nborrowing. These multiple reports and any additional ones we might \nrequire under the balanced budget amendment give the Congress \nincreasingly accurate information, providing the ability to anticipate \na trend towards a deficit and to make appropriate adjustments to the \nbudget.\n  Let us also recognize that the early estimates are often distorted by \nthe subsequent volitional acts of the Government. Life under a balanced \nbudget amendment can use estimates more effectively than they are now. \nThe first thing the Congress and the President will do is pass a budget \nresolution laying out the general scenario for outlays\n\n[[Page S1457]]\n\nand receipts in the fiscal year. This resolution will be based on \nestimates, as is now the case.\n  At this stage, the wisest policy is to shoot for a budget which is in \nsurplus, which would be a very wonderful thing compared to what it has \nbeen over the last 66 years, shoot for a budget that is in surplus to \nprovide a margin for error in case outlays are in fact greater or \nrevenues less than expected during the year. That would become the norm \nrather than to not do anything, which is the norm today.\n  Over the course of the fiscal year, the Congress will need to monitor \noutlays and receipts. While it is not required that the budget remain \nin balance during every moment of the year, Congress must work to get \nits budget back in balance by the end of the year unless it votes, by a \nthree-fifths vote, to authorize a specific deficit. If a trend towards \nan unintended deficit is observed, Congress should adjust its budget in \norder to rectify the problem. Indeed, the reconciliation process was \noriginally created for the purpose of adjusting outlays and receipts, \nif necessary, before the end of each fiscal year.\n  Should it be determined that circumstances are serious enough to \nwarrant deficit spending, the Congress could approve an appropriate \ndeficit and raise the debt ceiling, if necessary, as provided for in \nthe balanced budget amendment.\n  As the fiscal year comes to a close, Congress will have a very good \nidea of whether the budget is likely to be out of balance or out of \nline. This is where Congress will be held accountable for the accuracy \nof the estimates it adopted earlier. Sloppy estimates will require more \nwork to keep the budget in balance. Realizing this potential difficulty \nwill keep Congress honest in its budget estimates.\n  If the budget is balanced or is in surplus, the country will have \nprospered from disciplined fiscal policy. On the other hand, if it \nappears that there may be an unintended deficit due to unexpected \neconomic conditions or events, a deficit could be approved but it would \ntake a three-fifths vote to do it. Even if the precise size of the \ndeficit is unknown at the close of the fiscal year, budget forecasts \nwill certainly provide a range in which the deficit will fall. In order \nto anticipate all contingencies, the Congress would simply approve a \ndeficit at the high end of the projections. That way, the Government \nwould continue proper operations even in the worst case scenario.\n  So you see, the Federal budget process can work smoothly and \nefficiently under the terms of the balanced budget amendment. Further, \nit will provide the strong incentives towards fiscal responsibility, \nreasonable budget forecasts, and, most important, a balanced budget. \nThe reality is that under a balanced budget amendment, the Government \nwill have increased accountability for its decisions and increased \nincentives to act responsibly throughout the year to get to a balanced \nbudget at the end of the year. This is a real change from the system we \nnow have that has given us an unbroken chain of unbalanced budgets for \neach of the past 28 years.\n  Each of the past 28 years--I don't care who you are, you have to be \nshocked by that. I am so afraid of knocking these over for fear I will \ncrush somebody, but literally, these stacks really tell it all. There \nis just no real argument against this, other than the argument that you \nwant to spend more, you want to tax more, and that old argument, let us \njust have the will to do what's right. Come on, give me a break. We \nhaven't had the will for 28 years, we are not going to have it for 28 \nmore if we don't put some fiscal discipline into the Constitution. It \nis about time to end this game and do what's right.\n  And, yes, I have to admit I am very loathe to amend the Constitution. \nIt is, to me, an inspired document. Those Founding Fathers never \nthought for a minute, they never thought for a minute that we would \nhave 28 straight unbalanced budgets and 58 out of 66 years of \nunbalanced budgets. They never thought that for one minute. They \nthought the only way you would ever have an unbalanced budget is during \ntime of war or serious, real serious economic distress, and they could \nunderstand that. But you would immediately get in balance once the \neconomy picked up or you got out of war. The Founding Fathers knew \nthat, and nobody ever thought in their wildest imaginations that we \nwould be brought to the pitiful, or should I say pitiable, position \nthat we are in today.\n\n  Nonetheless, some proponents of the Byrd amendment contend that the \nreliance on estimates somehow turns the balanced budget amendment into \na gimmick. That claim is simply untrue. And, to paraphrase the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Maine, basically she said, ``I'll \ntell you this, if a balanced budget amendment were a gimmick, Congress \nwould have passed it long ago.''\n  I think that says it all. ``If the balanced budget were a gimmick, we \nwould have passed it a long time ago,'' because we love gimmicks around \nhere, the biggest of which, and the biggest hoax of which, is saying \nthat you have to take the largest item in the Federal budget, Social \nSecurity, out of the purview of the balanced budget and then let it sit \nout there all naked so it can be attacked, manipulated, poked at, taken \napart.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator acknowledge that the deficit has come \ndown, now, 4 years in a row and the projected budget will for a 5 year?\n  Mr. HATCH. Of course I will. And I will also acknowledge it is still \n$107 billion in debt. If I can just finish, it is amazing to me--I give \ncredit for that. We had what some think is the largest tax increase in \nhistory and the deficit has come down. But the fact of the matter is, \nonly in Washington would people say that a $107 billion deficit is \nmaking real headway.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as I recall, the tax bill actually lowered \ntaxes for the vast majority of Americans. I can understand some concern \nfor some who may have had it higher, those who serve in this Chamber, \nbecause they are in the highest income bracket anyway. They may have \nfelt their taxes go up slightly. But the vast majority of people we \nrepresent saw their taxes go down.\n  I raise this, however, the fact that without all the rhetoric that we \nhave been hearing for years, rhetoric about balancing the budget at a \ntime when the national debt was tripled in the two previous \nadministrations, we have had a President who has brought down, with \nvery tough votes and very tough action, brought the deficit down 4 \nyears in a row. I would only suggest to my good friend and colleague \nfrom Utah, the President laid it out very well in the State of the \nUnion message. He said all that's needed for a balanced budget: We vote \nit, he signs it.\n  The Republicans are in the majority in the Senate. The Republicans \nare in the majority in the House. All they have to do is bring up the \nvarious spending bills, entitlement bills or anything else. They should \nhave the votes.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just respond. I guess I will do it again. I will \nstand behind these two stacks of unbalanced budgets for the last 28 \nyears and I will just repeat what the Senator said, the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont. All you have to do is sign the bill and send it \nto the President, but we have not been able to do it for 28 years, or \n58 out of the last 66. And, by the way, I will give the President \ncredit for bringing down the deficit from around $170 billion to $107 \nbillion, but in each of the next 4 years, according to his budget, the \ndeficit goes up until we are almost back to where we were until you \nreach 2001 and 2002, after he leaves office, when 75 percent of the \ncuts are going to take place. And everybody knows that is impossible. I \nshould also mention that there were a lot of factors that helped lower \nthe deficit that had nothing to do with the President. So he deserves \nsome credit, but certainly not all of it.\n  So, the same game is still going on, saying all you have to do is \npresent the budget to him and he will sign it. If you believe that, you \ndon't believe that these are real. Anybody who makes that argument just \ndoes not know what has gone on for 28 years and they just don't believe \nthese books are real. I am telling you they are real. This is America, \nthis is where we are going. We are in a fiscal deficit like you cannot \nbelieve and only in Washington, DC do people believe that a $107 \nbillion deficit for a fiscal year is wonderful.\n\n[[Page S1458]]\n\n  And, by the way, even the poor are paying more under the so-called \ntax cuts that the distinguished Senator is talking about. When you look \nat the Social Security tax they are paying, they pay more in Social \nSecurity taxes than they do income taxes; user fees, various user fees; \nthey are paying more for pharmaceutical products because of user fees. \nI was not very happy with it at the time. They are paying higher gas \ntaxes, at least 4 cents or 5 cents a gallon more. That hits the poor \nharder than anything else. You can go right on down the line. There are \nan awful lot of extra taxes that people are paying that we hide around \nhere every year because we don't have to be responsible under the \ncurrent system.\n  We have shared responsibility for our debt. I am not just blaming \ncolleagues on the other side. There are colleagues on our side--all of \nus are responsible for it. And we have shared responsibility for our \nrecent gains because some of the cutbacks in programs and restraint of \ngrowth occurred from this side of the aisle.\n  The tax increase did occur from that side of the aisle. We did not \nsupport that.\n  I think we should stop the partisan bickering and do what we need to \ndo. I think what we need to do is adopt Senate Joint Resolution 1, the \nbalanced budget amendment, and if we do that, I really believe we will \nbe able to make real headway in a joint effort and in a bipartisan way \nto solve the problems of this country, especially the fiscal problems.\n  As I have pointed out, common-sense reliance on estimates is the best \nway to apply the balanced budget rule. Further, the opponents' claim \nfocuses only on the deficit vote in section 1 of the balanced budget \namendment, but ignores the debt ceiling vote that is required in \nsection 2.\n  Under the balanced budget amendment, if we want to raise the limit on \nthe debt, we need a three-fifths vote of both Houses of Congress. The \ndebt is not an estimate. It is the real, cold, hard fact. The bottom \nline is, regardless of what the estimates say, under the balanced \nbudget amendment, our children cannot be saddled with more debt unless \nthere is a vote under the appropriate provision, and, in this case, it \nis section 2.\n  There are no loopholes here. Reliance on estimates is both reasonable \nand sound. If we did not permit a reliance on estimates, someone on the \nother side would be arguing that the balanced budget amendment would be \nunworkable because it does not let us rely on estimates. You can just \nbank on it. Indeed, on the one hand, some opponents argue that the \nbalanced budget amendment would be a straitjacket, while this proposal \nby my friend from West Virginia argues that it is not stringent enough. \nIf this pending amendment of the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia were adopted, this balanced budget amendment would be much \nharder to work with, and you could bet that we would hear from the \ncritics then.\n  Mr. President, this balanced budget amendment that we are debating is \nthe real thing, and that is why so much noise is being made about it. \nIf it wasn't important, there would not be this colossal fight every \ntime we bring it up. It would shake things up in Washington, and there \nare some who are afraid of that. Personally, I think this town could \nuse a good shaking by its neck. I am not one of those who is afraid of \nwhat the balanced budget amendment would do. I am not willing to add \nmany more books to this pile. Even if we pass the balanced budget \namendment and it is ratified by 38 States, or three-quarters of the \nStates, we will still have another 5 years leading up to a balanced \nbudget, but at least we know the game is over; we will have to get \nthere.\n  I am not willing to ruin this country's economy, and I am most \ncertainly not willing to increase that $20,000 in debt that every man, \nwoman, and child in America currently owes as their share of the \nnational debt. I hope our colleagues will defeat the pending amendment \nand move on to passing Senate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget \namendment.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has about 6\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia. I will reserve 1 minute.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my friend.\n  Mr. President, section 1 of the constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget lays it out in a very straightforward way. It says in plain \nEnglish that outgo shall not exceed income. ``Spending shall not exceed \nincome in any fiscal year unless three-fifths of the whole number of \neach House of Congress shall provide by law for such an excess of \noutlays over income.''\n  Now, that is a pretty tough section to comply with, and Congress, I \nthink, would be in great difficulty if it sought to follow that \nmandate. But Congress, by this constitutional amendment, has provided a \nway around section 1, so that we really don't have to comply with \nsection 1.\n  Section 6 says that ``The Congress shall enforce and implement this \narticle by appropriate legislation, which may rely on estimates of \noutlays and receipts.'' So, Congress, as anyone will know, because it \nis plain as the nose on one's face, Congress is just going to forget \nsection 1, that will be too hard to comply with. Congress will choose \nsection 6 as a way out, because then it does not have to balance dollar \nfor dollar, it does not have to have a three-fifths vote, as section 1 \nwould require, for a specific excess of outlays over receipts. It can \nforget about that. No real balancing of the budget. No three-fifths \nvote. Just doing it by appropriate legislation, which could be a simple \nresolution or concurrent resolution. So this is the way out, this is \nthe dishonest way out--section 6. That is the Houdini section.\n  What would I do? My amendment strikes the last words in section 6. My \namendment says: ``The Congress shall implement this article by law.'' \nPeriod. You can't get around that.\n  What does it mean when we say the Congress shall implement this \narticle by law? It means that Congress will do by law what it says it \nwill do in section 1; namely, it will have to balance the budget dollar \nfor dollar, and the only way it can get out of doing that then will be \nto have the three-fifths vote to waive the requirement.\n  So in order to keep us honest, in order to keep the proponents \nhonest, and I include myself--I am not a proponent--in order to keep \nall of us honest in Congress, we strike out this Houdini language, \nwhich allows Congress to weasel around and avoid the impact of the \namendment, and we say ``the Congress shall implement this article,'' \nwhich means section 1, balance the budget, and it has to do it by law.\n  So this is the ``to keep them honest'' amendment, Mr. President, and \nI hope Members of the Senate will support my amendment.\n  The American people have a pretty low estimate of politicians. They \ndon't believe us. They don't believe that we mean what we say. They \ndon't have much faith in Congress. It isn't just Congress, but we are \ntalking about Congress now because Congress has to enforce this \narticle. They don't have faith in Congress, and we are going to confirm \ntheir lack of faith in Congress by enacting this article in the \nConstitution and, more specifically, by including in it section 6, \nwhich provides the loopholes by which we can avoid the strictures and \nthe commandment of the language of section 1. We are merely going to \ncompound and add to and solidify and fortify the American people's low \nestimate of Congress and of politicians in general.\n  So that is why I am offering this amendment. Let's clean up section 6 \nto say, ``No, no, we are not going to have this sleight of hand.'' \nCongress will enforce this article, and Congress will have to do it by \nlaw.\n  Unless we approve my amendment, this section 6 will allow Congress to \navoid the three-fifths vote, which is required if outlays are going to \nexceed income in any fiscal year, and will allow Congress to use \nestimates, sleight-of-hand estimates, in order to fool the American \npeople.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from West Virginia has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair, and I thank Senator Hatch.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I say in relation to section 6, the term \n``appropriate legislation'' has appeared in every enforcement clause \nthat has been adopted since the Civil War. But in\n\n[[Page S1459]]\n\norder for appropriate legislation to become a law, it must be passed by \nboth Houses of Congress, presented to the President, and signed by him \ninto law. I do not think there is any question about it. I yield back \nthe balance of my time. I move to table and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table the Byrd amendment No. 6, as modified. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Wednesday, \nFebruary 26, immediately following the vote on Senator Feinstein's \namendment, Senator Torricelli be recognized to offer an amendment \nrelating to capital budgeting. I further ask consent that there be 3 \nhours for debate, equally divided in the usual form, with no amendments \nin order to the amendment. I finally ask that following the expiration \nor yielding back of the time, the Senate proceed to a vote on or in \nrelation to the Torricelli amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in the early 1930's, this country faced what \nwas called the Great Depression. That was a time that in the history \nbooks is even hard to understand. But banks had their doors locked and \ndepositors could not get into the bank to get their money. Banks were \nformally closed and informally closed. Factories were either slowed \ndown or stopped completely. Homes were foreclosed upon. Families moved \nin with each other. You had brothers living with brothers and everyone \nliving with each other. It was such that books were written about what \nwas taking place. It was the ``Grapes of Wrath,'' as indicated in the \nbook by John Steinbeck, where the State of California, to stop people \nfrom migrating to California, actually tried to close its borders, as \npeople were fleeing from the economic hardship they found in the States \neast of California.\n  We were a rich nation. We are a rich nation. But the rich nation we \nknew had collapsed. Mines were closed. Farms became dust bowls. Trees \nwere not cut in our forests. It was the stuff of which songs were \nwritten. The troubadour of the Depression, Woody Guthrie, wrote many \nsongs dealing with the Depression--``Dust Bowl Blues,'' ``End of the \nLine,'' ``Hey, Buddy, Have You Got a Dime.'' These are a few of the \nsongs Woody Guthrie wrote.\n  There was much written, Mr. President, that capitalism had failed, \nand maybe even democracy was failing. We had soup kitchens, bread \nlines, people scavenged the dumps to find the bare necessities of life. \nThe rules and laws that said kids should go to school were not \nenforced. Some say that up to 25 percent of children were malnourished. \nWe have terms that were originated during the Depression, such as \n``tramps,'' ``bums,'' ``hitchhikers,'' and ``railriders.'' More than 30 \npercent of the people were out of jobs. Those with jobs, many times, \nwished they had no jobs because they worked endless hours, for almost \nno pay. Only about 15 percent of the people of that day had pensions. \nIt was during this time of calamity, this time of depression, that \npeople said we have to do something else.\n  Mr. President, one of the things that was done was, we adopted during \nthe Great Depression in 1935 a program we call Social Security. It was \na noble experiment. It has come to be the finest social program in the \nhistory of the world. What was said during that debate 60 years ago or \nmore? Among other things, President Roosevelt said, on August 14, 1935, \nwhen he signed the bill:\n\n       Today, a hope of many years standing is, in large part, \n     fulfilled. The civilization of the past 100 years, with its \n     startling industrial changes, has tended more and more to \n     make life insecure. Young people have come to wonder what \n     would be their lot when they came to old age. The man with a \n     job has wondered how long that job would last. The Social \n     Security measure gives us at least some protection, and \n     protection to as many as 30 million of our citizens who will \n     reap direct benefits through unemployment compensation, old-\n     age pension, and through increased services for the \n     protection of children of the prevention of ill health.\n       We can never ensure 100 percent of the population 100 \n     percent of the vicissitudes of life. But we have tried to \n     frame a law which will give some measure of protection to the \n     average citizen and to his family against the loss of a job \n     and against poverty-ridden old age.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       If the Senate and the House of Representatives in this \n     long, arduous session. . .\n\n  Remember, Mr. President, this was in the throes of the Great \nDepression.\n\n       If the Senate and House of Representatives in its long, \n     arduous session have done nothing more than pass this bill, \n     the session will be regarded as historic for all time.\n\n  Said President Franklin Roosevelt.\n  Mr. President, at that time we lived by the radio--not TV, but by \nradio. The President gave a radio address where, among other things, he \nsaid, on August 15, on the fifth anniversary of Social Security:\n\n       Five years ago the term ``Social Security'' was new to \n     American ears. Today it has significance for more than 40 \n     million men and\n\n[[Page S1460]]\n\n     women workers whose application for old age insurance \n     accounts have been received. This system is designed to \n     ensure them an income for life after old age retires them \n     from their jobs.\n\n  He went on to say in this same address to the American public:\n\n       The millions of today want and have a right to the same \n     security their forefathers sought--the assurance that with \n     the health and willingness to work they will find a place for \n     themselves in the social and economic system for the time. \n     Because it is becoming increasingly difficult for individuals \n     to build their own security singlehanded, Government must now \n     step in to help them lay the foundation stones. Just as \n     Government in the past has helped lay the foundation of \n     business and industry, we must face the fact that in this \n     country we have a rich man's security and a poor man's \n     security, and that the Government owes equal obligations to \n     both. National security is not half and half. It is all or \n     none. The Social Security Act offers to all our citizens a \n     workable and working method of meeting urgent present needs \n     and future needs. It utilizes the familiar machinery of a \n     Federal-State government to promote the commonwealth and the \n     economic stability of the Nation. The act does not offer \n     anyone, either individual or collectively, an easy life, nor \n     was it ever intended to do so. None of the sums of money paid \n     out to the individual in assistance or insurance will spell \n     anything approaching abundance, but they will furnish that \n     minimum necessary to keep a foothold, and that is the kind of \n     protection Americans want.\n\n  Mr. President, these were some statements made by Franklin Roosevelt. \nThese statements that he made were visionary because we have \nestablished in this country a program that people depend on.\n  I received a letter in my office today from one Helen Collins who \nlives in Las Vegas. I wrote her a letter to talk about the balanced \nbudget. She wanted to know about it. So I answered her request.\n  She wrote on the bottom of my letter a handwritten note \ndated February 18, 1997.\n\n       Dear Senator Reid: Thank you for the update and for \n     supporting a balanced budget amendment which expressly \n     exempts the Social Security trust fund. I have been a widow \n     since age 21. I never considered applying for any kind of \n     welfare assistance. I worked, and raised and educated my son. \n     He got a master's degree. Sad to say, at age 71, I am totally \n     on my own on quite a limited budget. By being very careful, I \n     get by. However, I do worry about getting more seriously ill \n     and losing Social Security. For many of us, these are not the \n     golden years. But I, for one, thank God that good people like \n     you are helping us maintain our dignity and independence. \n     Sincerely, Helen M. Collins.\n\n  Mr. President, this is what the President of the United States said \nmore than 60 years ago. He said, ``The act does not offer anyone''--not \nHelen Collins or anyone else--``either individually or collectively, an \neasy life, nor was it ever intended to do so * * * but they will \nfurnish the minimum necessary to keep a foothold, and that is the kind \nof protection Americans want.''\n  I repeat, the most successful social program in the history of the \nworld is Social Security. This amendment is an effort to save Social \nSecurity.\n  I have listened to the arguments for the last several years about \nthis balanced budget amendment and why it is important. I agree. But I \nagree, Mr. President, that the balanced budget amendment should pass \nonly if it exempts Social Security.\n  I think we should have a balanced budget the hard way, the right way. \nWhy should we use $80 billion this year, as an example, in surplus in \nSocial Security to help disguise and offset the budget? We should not.\n  When I first started this matter a number of years ago--3 years ago, \nto be exact--I was a lone voice crying in the wilderness. That is not \nthe way it is anymore. We have gained support. In the last year we \ngained support from people like courageous Republican Congressmen in \nthe House of Representatives who have said they will support a balanced \nbudget amendment, but they want the opportunity to exclude Social \nSecurity because they believe also that, if we are going to balance the \nbudget, it should be done honestly. It should be done the hard way.\n  This Social Security Program that was set up 60-plus years ago was a \nfairly simple and principled experiment. They said what we will do is \nhave the employer and the employee pay into a trust fund those moneys \nthat will be saved so that people when they retire can have some money. \nRemember, Mr. President, we are talking about a Social Security trust \nfund.\n  Before coming to Congress, I was a practicing lawyer. I represented \npeople who had problems and needed guidance. In some of the work that I \ndid, I dealt with my clients' money. I established in my office trust \naccounts for my clients. And in this trust account, I would put my \nclients' money. If I took any part of that money, $10, $100, $1,000, \n$10,000, any portion of it for personal use, to buy my wife a coat, to \nmake a car payment, to make a house payment, or to go to dinner, I \nwould be subject to disbarment. They could take my license to practice \nlaw. Not only could they do that, but if the activities that I had \ncommitted were egregious enough, I could be prosecuted criminally. I do \nnot see why the Social Security trust fund should be any different. \nWhat right do we have to pilfer those trust funds?\n  I have heard arguments made here on the floor of the Senate by people \nsaying, ``Well, that is what we have been doing in the past.'' Well, \nisn't that great? Does that mean we should place in the Constitution or \nenshrine in the Constitution of the United States the fact that we have \nbeen taking money wrongly in the past from Social Security? It is an \neasy way to balance the budget. It adds billions, coming to trillions \nof dollars by the year 2029 to balance that. It is an easy way to \nbalance the budget. No wonder there is a rush to balance the budget \nwhen you are going to violate and take money out of the Social Security \ntrust fund.\n  I have heard people say, ``Well, there may be a little confusion here \nwith Social Security. What we will do after we pass the constitutional \namendment is we will then come back and pass a statute that says you \ncan't use Social Security.'' That is really stretching, because we all \nknow you can't pass a statute to override an expressed provision in the \nConstitution. A promise like that is really meaningless. Proponents \nknow the calamity of passing it. I say if we want to pass a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, just exclude Social \nSecurity. This would pass with 85 votes in the Senate and probably at \nleast 350 votes in the House. Social Security is not a giveaway. It is \nnot an entitlement program. It is a program, though, that requires \nsacrifice by an employer and employee, and because of that I believe we \nshould do everything within our power to make sure that Social Security \nremains strong for the foreseeable future.\n\n  There are some who say that if we have this amendment, then people \ncan claim everything as Social Security. You can claim that building \nhighways is Social Security. That is so fallacious and wrong. Social \nSecurity is enshrined in the law. We know what Social Security is. The \nunderlying amendment diverts Social Security revenues for other uses. \nIt could force future Social Security cuts to resolve frequent budget \ncrunches, and I think more positively would force future Social \nSecurity cuts to resolve frequent budget crunches. It will force Social \nSecurity into an early funding crisis.\n  Also, this is a little off the point, but I have heard arguments \ntoday saying, well, States balance their budgets; why don't we? I have \nbeen a constitutional officeholder in the State of Nevada, served three \nlegislative sessions. People go around saying Nevada has a balanced \nbudget, just like most States. They do not have a balanced budget. What \nthey do is put capital expenditures off budget. They bond for that. \nThere is no balanced budget in the State of Nevada or most other \nStates. But I am willing to go for a balanced budget. I am saying we \nwill keep the capital expenditures off. All I want is to exclude Social \nSecurity. My amendment seeks a balanced budget that protects Social \nSecurity. It keeps Social Security revenues in the trust fund. It \nprotects Social Security from cuts. It preserves the 1983 long-term \nrescue of Social Security. It protects Social Security.\n  In 1983, Tip O'Neil, Ronald Reagan, Claude Pepper, and a number of \nothers got together to determine what they could do to fund Social \nSecurity in the foreseeable future. Social Security was in a time of \ncrisis. They got together in a bipartisan fashion and funded Social \nSecurity, they thought at the time, to go to the year 2060. We know now \nthat fund will likely go to the year 2029 or thereabouts. But they did \nexcellent\n\n[[Page S1461]]\n\nwork. In 1983, they reformed Social Security to preserve it for future \ngenerations. We can preserve it long after 2029 with some minor \nadjustments. I served as a member of the entitlement commission where \nwe studied this and other issues for more than a year.\n  So to finance Social Security benefits, low- and middle-income wage \nearners now pay a heavier payroll tax than wealthier Americans. The \nlargest single tax that people pay is Social Security. It would seem to \nme that it would be logical and fair to do what we can to secure those \nbenefits.\n  The underlying amendment would abandon our commitment to future \nretirees. No funds could be reserved for future use. The constitutional \namendment would supersede the statutory transfer of bonds into the \nSocial Security trust fund. If we adopt the current underlying balanced \nbudget amendment, we remove the obligation to eventually use the Social \nSecurity surpluses to pay benefits.\n\n  The underlying amendment would force Social Security cuts. It will \nforce crisis. It will encourage deadlock.\n  In a letter to Tom Daschle from the President of the United States, \nJanuary 20 of this year, the President said:\n\n       In the event of an impasse in which the budget requirements \n     can neither be waived nor met, disbursement of Social \n     Security collections would cease or unelected judges could \n     reduce benefits to comply with this constitutional mandate. \n     No subsequent implementing legislation would protect Social \n     Security with certainty because a constitutional amendment \n     would override statutory law.\n\n  That is pretty specific. Would there be a crisis? Of course there \nwould be a crisis. We would have three alternatives: have deep cuts in \nSocial Security or deep cuts in other programs we have already cut to \nthe bone. Alternatively, we could have massive tax increases. I think \nany one of those is not something I look forward to. I think we should \npass my amendment and then pass a real constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget. The Democratic alternative, the one that I am \noffering, would allow the trust fund to spend surpluses, keeping Social \nSecurity viable for many years.\n  We have heard a lot in this past week about the need to protect \nSocial Security. It is important to recognize in a little more detail \nthe history of Social Security and appreciate why some of us are \nfighting so hard for this express exemption. I have said and I believe \nthat Social Security is the most successful social program in the \nhistory of the world. It was enacted on August 14, 1935, at a time this \ncountry was in the throes of the greatest depression this country has \never felt and perhaps the greatest worldwide depression ever. It was \nenacted to provide for the general welfare by establishing a system of \nFederal old age benefits and by enabling the several States to make \nmore adequate provision for its old.\n  The real significance of this act is that it was this country's first \nmajor Federal program to deal directly with the economic security of \nits citizens.\n  Before then, this matter was handled by States and private sources. \nIn those days we had what were called poorhouses. Each county had a \npoorhouse where they woul put poor people They were not pleasant. Some \nwere better than others. There were no standards. Whatever the counties \ncould provide with State assistance is where people went.\n  Social Security took away county poorhouses. Federal action became \nnecessary because neither the States nor private charities had the \nfinancial resources to cope with the growing need during the depression \nyears. The balanced budget amendment now before this body radically \nalters in one fell swoop this program. It shifts the burden for \nensuring the economic security of our Nation's senior citizens. It puts \nus on the course of turning this responsibility back to individual \nStates and private charities, and it does so, in my opinion, in a very \ndeceitful way.\n  Balancing the budget is very hard. It is made significantly easier by \nhaving these Social Security surpluses. If those surpluses were not \navailable, we would really have to bite the bullet. We would have to \nmake some significant changes, but we would at least have an honest \nbalanced budget. This is not an honest balanced budget. And there is no \nwonder that the Helen Collinses of the world write and say, ``We are \nafraid of our little security you are going to take away from us.'' \nThey have reason to be afraid.\n\n  I have talked on this Senate floor a number of times about my \ngrandmother. The first time I ever heard of Social Security was from my \ngrandmother. I never knew my grandmother as a young woman. I knew my \ngrandmother as short and somewhat heavy. She did not get around very \nwell. She had eight children. She lived in a very rural part of Nevada, \nin a very depressed place, but my grandmother had dignity because she \nwas able every month to get her old age pension check, and she was \nproud of that. It gave her dignity and independence from her eight \nchildren. She did not have to be a ward to her family, and she was one \nof the lucky ones because she had a family. Think of how much more \ninsecure a person who had no family would feel.\n  So Social Security is an important program. People like Helen Collins \nshould be worried, because if this amendment passes, Social Security as \nwe know it is gone. It will be destroyed.\n  What is the recent history of Social Security? We have talked about \nit a little bit. We have talked about what happened in 1983 in this \nbipartisan commission. But we have also had a current commission. \nIncluded were former majority leader Dole and current Federal Reserve \nChairman Greenspan, a notable opponent of the balanced budget \namendment. But these people studied what should take place. The panel \ncharted a course to long-term solvency. This contract that we have, the \nSocial Security contract, is really a Contract With America, the first \nContract With America, one that means something to people on the \nstreet. People on the street may not understand the importance to them \nindividually of term limits, of line-item veto, of prayer in school. \nBut they do understand the importance of getting a Social Security \ncheck. Separate and apart from the merits that I have just spoken of, \nSocial Security is a Contract With America.\n\n  So, in short, we must protect what happened in 1935 and how it was \nagain protected in 1983. The only way to do that is to pass this \namendment.\n  In 1990, there was an amendment offered on this floor. It was an \namendment offered by Senator Hollings. It became known as the section \n13301 amendment. The effect of this amendment was that it took Social \nSecurity off budget. It passed overwhelmingly out of committee. All but \none person voted for it out of committee. All but two Senators voted \nfor it in the Senate. It got 98 votes. The author of this amendment has \nspoken on this floor eloquently on a number of occasions. The junior \nSenator from South Carolina said he offered this amendment for the \npurpose of protecting the integrity of the trust funds of the Social \nSecurity system. The purpose of the Hollings amendment was to separate \nSocial Security from the unified budget.\n  After we established the payroll tax we wanted to ensure the money \nwas excluded from the unified budget. It passed by a vote of 98 to 2. \nIt was a strong statement of congressional intent to protect Social \nSecurity.\n  The balanced budget amendment now before this body repeals something \nwe passed 98 to 2. The plain language of S. J. Res. 1, the underlying \namendment here, makes it clear that Social Security should be treated \nas part of the unified budget and should be used to bring down the \ndeficit. It is ironic that some would suggest that this should occur \nafter we voted just a few years ago by a vote of 98 to 2 to pass the \nHollings amendment. The real inconsistency is that voting in 1990 to \nremove Social Security from the budget and then voting in 1997 to again \ninclude it.\n  I do not think there are many people in this body who would say that \nthe senior Senator from New Mexico does not understand budgetary \nmatters. In fact, I think he has had a wide ranging experience, not \nonly serving on the Budget Committee but serving on the Appropriations \nCommittee, where I have had the pleasure of serving with him during my \ntenure in the Senate. The senior Senator from New Mexico, during the \ntime that the debate took place on the Hollings amendment, said,\n\n[[Page S1462]]\n\namong other things, ``I voted for Senator Hollings' proposal because I \nsupport''--this is a direct quote--``I support the concept of taking \nSocial Security out of the budget deficit calculation. But I cast this \nvote with reservations.''\n  Now, listen to his reservation:\n\n       The best way to protect Social Security is to reduce the \n     Federal budget deficit. We need to balance our non-Social \n     Security budget so that the Social Security trust fund \n     surpluses can be invested . . . instead of used to pay for \n     other Federal operating costs. We could move toward this goal \n     without changing the unified budget, a concept which has \n     served us well for over 20 years now.\n\n  So what the chairman of the Budget Committee today said back in 1990 \nis that we have to support the Hollings amendment. And he voted for it. \nThe only reason he did not like it is it was not strong enough.\n  Again:\n\n       I voted for Senator Hollings' proposal [this is the senior \n     Senator from New Mexico talking] because I support the \n     concept of taking Social Security out of the budget deficit \n     calculations. But I cast this vote with reservations.\n\n  And here I say, what are his reservations? It was that the provision, \nthe Hollings amendment, was not strong enough. He wanted to build a \nfirewall. He, Senator Domenici, went on to say:\n\n       We need a firewall around those trust funds to make sure \n     those reserves are there to pay benefits in the next century. \n     Without a firewall or the discipline of budget constraints, \n     the trust funds would be unprotected and could be spent on \n     any number of costly programs.\n\n  Now, please, someone tell me how we can go forward now, 7 years \nlater, after the chairman of the Budget Committee said this in 1990? I \nmean, is this misspeak?\n  Many of us spent a great deal of time reviewing the recent report by \nthe Advisory Council on Social Security, and I mean within the past few \nmonths. This panel of experts was charged with providing \nrecommendations to Congress on the long-term solvency of the trust \nfunds. There were 13 members from all walks of life, chaired by a \nprofessor from a university in Michigan. They were not unanimous, but \nall 13 said that Social Security trust fund moneys should be invested \nin some fashion; part of them. Six felt one way, five another way, one \nanother way, but they all felt these moneys should be partially \ninvested in the private sector.\n  Now we are saying, if this amendment passes, that this 13-member \ncommission, their work would go for naught, because you cannot invest \nmoneys if there aren't any. And there would be no moneys if this \namendment passed because the surpluses would be used to offset the \ndeficit. So, should we now vote to utilize the trust funds for \nbalancing the budget that will place at risk our ability to pursue \nthese proposals suggested by the 13-member commission just a matter of \nfew months ago? One proposal calls for investing a portion of the \ncurrent trust fund in the equities market. You cannot invest in the \nequities market unless there is some money left over, so you could not \ndo that.\n  We need to understand the importance of the mission of the advisory \npanel. We paid this group of experts to find solutions that will bring \nabout long-term solvency of the funds. By including Social Security in \na balanced budget amendment, we are, in fact, admitting that we care \nnot about the long-term solvency of the trust fund. What we are really \nsaying is that the short-term goal of balancing the budget is all that \nmatters.\n  I am saying the American public wants us to stop playing games back \nhere. If we are going to have a balanced budget amendment, let us do it \nthe right way, let us do it the honest way: Exclude Social Security and \nnot use those huge surpluses that will be going on for the next 30-plus \nyears.\n  We are not simply negating their findings by passing this underlying \namendment. In fact, we are negating the whole reason we organized this \nCommission in the first place. And we are negating the need for Social \nSecurity.\n  There are some people who do not want Social Security. I believe that \nthere are people who would rather Social Security fail. I need look no \nfurther. I pull this out. I carry this with me all the time. This is a \nquote from the majority leader of the House of Representatives, House \nMajority Leader Dick Armey:\n\n       Social Security is a rotten trick. I think we are going to \n     have to bite the bullet on Social Security and phase it out \n     over time.\n\n  Does that sound like somebody who wants to save Social Security? I \nthink not.\n  Mr. President, there is a need for an express exemption of Social \nSecurity. It is Congress' obligation to ensure both parties perform \ntheir obligations under the terms of the contract we have with the \npeople of America. This will not be possible if the underlying balanced \nbudget amendment passes. It can only happen if we exempt Social \nSecurity.\n  Social Security is a program that is working. It is a Government \nprogram that works. The poverty rate for today's seniors is about 10 \npercent, the lowest in the history of this country. What was it prior \nto the adoption of Social Security? It is obvious that someone like \nHelen Collins would be in one of those poor houses. A widow since age \n21, who struggled and worked to put her only child through college, now \nis pleading with us: ``All I have is Social Security. I have never had \nto go to welfare. Social Security is not a welfare program. Can't you \ndo something to make sure you protect Social Security?''\n  That is all we are asking. Adopt this amendment and then go ahead and \npass a balanced budget amendment. But I say to my friends, please, \ndon't pass the underlying amendment unless we exclude Social Security. \nThe poverty rate today for seniors is 10.5 percent, the lowest in the \nhistory of this country. We don't need poorhouses anymore. We don't \nneed people, like my friend who wrote me this handwritten note, in a \npoorhouse.\n  Why don't we have poorhouses? Why do we have a poverty rate of \nseniors at 10.5 percent? We have it because of one reason, and that is \nSocial Security.\n  Are we concerned about the raiding of this surplus by those intent on \nenforcing the balanced budget amendment? Maybe so. This is not a \nDemocrat or Republican issue, I hope. I hope my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle would recognize that Social Security is a program \nthat is important to both Democrats and Republicans. We need Republican \nsupport to adopt this amendment, and I plead with my friends, adopt \nthis amendment. We have some courageous Members in the House of \nRepresentatives, sophomore Republican Members of the House, who are \nleading the fight over there to exclude Social Security from a balanced \nbudget amendment. I think we should all be proud of them. We need some \nRepublican Senators to join with them.\n  What we can't support is an attempt to use Social Security as a means \nof achieving this short-term goal. To do so would be a breach of our \nobligation under the terms of the Social Security contract with America \nthat we have. In short, people pay into the Social Security trust fund \nthrough a lifetime of their employment in the labor force with the \nguarantee that they will get their money back upon retirement. It is a \nsimple contract to understand. Today's workers support today's \nretirees, and tomorrow's workers support tomorrow's retirees. This \nsimplicity belies the high regard and faith that the American worker \nhas for this guarantee.\n  So, at a time when so many are attacking this institution, \nquestioning their faith in the system, it is imperative we provide \nAmericans with the guarantee that while we all will sacrifice to \nbalance the budget, we will all sacrifice equally, we won't do it on \nthe back of Social Security, because to do so would just be another \ngimmick, another thing that was referred to as smoke and mirrors.\n  This amendment should receive the support of everybody supporting the \nbalanced budget amendment. While some have given assurances Social \nSecurity will not be touched in the enforcement of a balanced budget \namendment, this amendment will put teeth into that assurance. If people \non the other side of the aisle say, ``We agree with the Senator, we \ndon't think Social Security should be touched either; in fact, we will \npass a resolution, we will even tell you we will pass a statute after \nthis becomes effective,'' well, it is wasteful, it will be meaningless. \nThe only way that it will work is if it is included in this amendment. \nLet's exclude Social Security.\n\n[[Page S1463]]\n\n  Our amendment gives all an opportunity to, in effect, step up to the \nproverbial plate and take a swing at what is the right thing to do, and \nthat is to exlude Social Security so that it is protected. If they \ndon't wish to protect Social Security, they should not support our \namendment. Promises not to raid the Social Security system are \ninsufficient and really unenforceable. We need a binding commitment, \nand this amendment will do just that.\n  Social Security affects all of us. There are proposals that include \ninvesting this money in the private market. This cannot be done unless \nwe exempt the trust funds to ensure those funds are available for \ninvestment. By not exempting Social Security, we not only hurt today's \nsenior citizens but are compromising the future of tomorrow's retirees \nas well. This is not an amendment that helps people with white hair \nonly. This is an amendment that helps their children and their \nchildren's children.\n  As I indicated, Mr. President, when I started this 3 years ago, I had \nvery little support and help. But the message is resonating to the \nAmerican people. Within the past 10 days, there have been two \ncomprehensive nationwide polls. Hart-Teeter--now, remember, these are \nRepublican pollsters. They poll for Republicans running for office. \nThey also do work in the markets. They did a poll for NBC, National \nBroadcasting Co., and the Wall Street Journal. Mr. President, 71 \npercent of the people polled said they will not support a balanced \nbudget amendment unless Social Security is excluded. A similar poll was \nconducted a few days later by the New York Times. Like numbers. Almost \n75 percent of the American people say, ``Do not balance the budget if \nSocial Security is included.'' They say, ``Balance the budget, but \nexclude Social Security.''\n  We have a number of think tanks that have taken a very close look at \nthis. I served on the Entitlement Commission with the Director of the \nCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities, Mr. Greenstein. The Center on \nBudget and Policy Priorities told us that by the year 2020, the second \ndecade of the next century, Social Security reserves will be in the \ntrillions of dollars.\n  They say:\n\n       If Social Security surpluses were to be used in the next \n     two decades to increase national saving rather than to offset \n     the deficit and the rest of the budget, that will likely \n     result in stronger economic growth.\n\n  So what the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says is if you \ntake these moneys to mask the deficit, it doesn't help. But if you take \nthe Social Security reserves and make them truly reserves, it will \nresult in greater savings and will cause more economic growth in our \ngreat country.\n  Here is what the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says about \nthe underlying amendment. Among other things, they say:\n\n       Unfortunately, the balanced budget amendment--\n\n  The underlying amendment--\n\n     would undercut the approach to bolstering Social Security. \n     The implications of this requirement on Social Security are \n     very significant. First, the budget would be considered \n     balanced when the deficit outside Social Security exactly \n     offset the surplus inside Social Security. But when that \n     occurred, the objective of accumulating Social Security \n     surplus, partly to build the Nation's capital stock and \n     productive capacity so we can better afford to pay for the \n     baby boomers' retirement, would be stymied. Second, the \n     benefits of the baby boomers would likely have to be financed \n     in full by the taxes of those working in the years the baby \n     boomers retire.\n\n  Very simple. So everyone understands what the Center on Budget and \nPolicy Priorities says, for example, if in the private sector you pay \ninto a fund all your life so that when you reach age 65 you can retire, \nand you go to your employer and say, ``Well, I'm 65. I want to draw my \nretirement,'' they say, ``Fine. You can go ahead and draw your \nretirement, but every penny you draw out for retirement you have to put \nthat much money in.'' And the person says, ``Would you repeat that?'' \nAnd so the boss would repeat it. The boss would say, ``Sure. You paid \nmoney into the fund all of your lifetime while you worked here, but \nwe've used the money for something else. So if you want to draw money \nout, you have to put it back in the second time.'' That is in effect \nwhat is--not in effect --that is literally what is happening in here.\n\n       If the underlying balanced budget amendment passes, Social \n     Security recipients will have to pay twice if they want their \n     benefits. This version of the balanced budget amendment would \n     thus undercut the central achievements of the 1980 Social \n     Security reforms.\n\n  That is pretty direct. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities \nfurther says:\n\n       Under the amendment, reductions in Social Security could be \n     used to help Congress and the President balance the budget if \n     they are faced with a budget crunch. The balanced budget \n     amendment is likely to lead to periodic midyear crisis when \n     budgets, thought to be balanced at the start of a fiscal \n     year, fall out of balance at the fiscal year, such as factors \n     of slowing economic growth. When sizable deficits emerge with \n     only part of the year remaining, they will often be very \n     difficult to address.\n\n  Among other things, they can, under this amendment, raise the debt if \nthey get a three-fifths vote; raise taxes, another supervote. In such \ncircumstances, the Policy Priority Institute says:\n\n       The President or the courts may feel compelled to act to \n     uphold the constitutional requirements for a budget balance.\n\n  In documents circulated in November 1996, explaining how the \namendment worked, the House coauthors of the amendment--listen to \nthis--wrote:\n\n       In such circumstances the President would be bound at the \n     point at which the Government runs out of money to stop \n     issuing checks. This would appear to include Social Security \n     checks.\n\n  Mr. President, this is not something I made up. These are direct \nwords from the sponsors of the amendment in the House of \nRepresentatives. They put in writing--I quote--\n\n       . . . the President would be bound at the point at which \n     the Government runs out of money to stop issuing checks.\n\n  So, ladies and gentlemen, the underlying amendment clearly will \ndestroy Social Security.\n  The major difference between the two versions of the balanced budget \namendment--mine and the underlying amendment--is that the version which \nexcludes Social Security allows the Nation to draw on its Social \nSecurity savings during the period when the baby-boom generation is in \nits peak retirement years and requires the Nation to save more in \nadvance to help cover the cost of the baby-boom generation. Pretty \nclear.\n  We have here a great institution, part of the Library of Congress, \ncalled the Congressional Research Service. When a Member of Congress \nhas a question about an issue, you can call. You may want to know about \nhow much lumber our forests are producing. You may want to know how \nmany miles of roads there are in Nevada, Iowa, or Colorado. Any kind of \ninformation they can get information for us.\n\n  One of the things they were asked to comment on is, What about this \nunderlying amendment? What about the amendment that is now before this \nbody? What will it do? They said, among other things:\n\n       The amendment would preclude, at a future time when Social \n     Security outlays in a particular year begin to exceed Social \n     Security receipts in that particular year, the use of the \n     Social Security funds to pay out benefits.\n\n  So what they said is the same thing Greenstein said, that when you \nhave surpluses built up they would go to offset the deficit. They go on \nto say:\n\n       Therefore, under the balanced budget amendment's language, \n     there is mandated a balance in each year for the outlays that \n     year and the receipts that year. Payments out of the balance \n     of the Social Security trust funds would not be counted as \n     Government receipts under the balanced budget amendment when \n     in the year 2019, or whenever the time occurs, the receipts \n     in those particular years and the Social Security trust funds \n     are not adequate to cover the outlays in those years. That \n     is, payments out of the trust fund surpluses could not be \n     counted in the calculation of the balance between total \n     Federal outlays and receipts. Because the balanced budget \n     amendment requires that required balance be between outlays \n     for that year and receipts for that year, the moneys that \n     constitute the Social Security surpluses would not be \n     available as a balance for the payment of benefits.\n\n  That again is very clear. It is again from another source saying that \nthe underlying amendment will destroy Social Security.\n  Some people tried to get the Congressional Reference Service to \nchange their mind, to write another report. And they wrote another \nreport that said the same thing. Shorter, but says the same thing.\n\n       Thus, the pending balanced budget amendment requires \n     outlays for any fiscal year not to exceed total receipts for \n     that year.\n\n\n[[Page S1464]]\n\n\n  What they are saying is you would not have to use Social Security \nsurpluses. What you can do is borrow more money or cut more services or \nraise more taxes. Of course, remember, when you have surpluses running \nas highs they are, the one place you are going to go is where the \nsurpluses are.\n  To support what CRS has said we again come back at a later time with \nthe subsequent report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities \nwhere they say:\n\n       Under the balanced budget amendment, the Social Security \n     surplus could not be tapped and interest earnings on the \n     surplus could not be used unless it was offsetting surplus in \n     the rest of the budget.\n\n  Again, it is very clear what CRS said, what the Center on Budget and \nPolicy Priorities said.\n  Mr. President, there are numerous organizations that oppose the \nbalanced budget amendment for various reasons. There are also \norganizations that do not support the passage of the balanced budget \namendment because of what it does to Social Security.\n\n  One such organization is the esteemed National Committee to Preserve \nSocial Security and Medicare with about 6 million members. Mr. \nPresident, they, just a few days ago, wrote a letter to me where they \nsaid, among other things:\n\n       Your amendment would preserve the integrity of the Social \n     Security trust fund under a balanced budget constitutional \n     amendment.\n\n  They did not equivocate. They did not say, ``Offer this amendment at \nthe right time.'' They say, the amendment that is now before this body \nwill preserve the integrity of the Social Security trust fund under a \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment. They go on to say:\n\n       The issue is clear-cut. As drafted, S.J. Res. 1 overturns \n     the 1990 law taking Social Security off budget and allows \n     Social Security to be raided to reduce the deficit. Statutory \n     measures to protect Social Security from such a result are \n     not adequate because of the supremacy of the Constitution and \n     because future Congresses are free to change such statutory \n     measures while the provision to place Social Security on \n     budget will remain in the United States Constitution. \n     Borrowing from the reserve to finance current consumption \n     will place a heavy burden on future generations because the \n     debt to the trust fund must be paid with interest.\n\n  Mr. President, there certainly has to be consideration given to what \nwill happen if the underlying balanced budget amendment passes. It will \nnot only throw the Social Security trust fund out of kilter, it will be \na cheap and very deceitful way to attempt to balance the budget. As a \nresult of that, we have a letter written January 28 from President Bill \nClinton to Leader Daschle where he says in the paragraph in the middle \nof page 1:\n\n       I am very concerned that Senate Joint Resolution 1, the \n     Constitutional amendment to balance the budget, could pose \n     grave risks to the Social Security system. In the event of \n     passage, in which the budget requirements can neither be \n     waived nor met, disbursement of Social Security checks could \n     cease or unelected judges could reduce benefits to comply \n     with this constitutional mandate. No subsequent implementing \n     legislation could protect Social Security with certainty \n     because a constitutional amendment overrides statutory law.\n\n  Mr. President, we have offered this amendment. The Senator from \nNevada has offered it, along with Senators Dorgan, Daschle, Kennedy, \nFeinstein, Wyden, Conrad, Ford and Hollings.\n  Mr. President, I say stop and look at what is happening. If you take \na look at what is the state of the economy today, last year was the 4th \nyear in a row we had a declining deficit, the first time since before \nthe Civil War we have had 4 years in a row with a declining deficit. \nLowest unemployment, lowest inflation for 40 years, highest economic \ngrowth in 40 years, 300,000 fewer Federal employees today than 4 years \nago, excluding the cuts in the military. Our Federal Government today \nis about the same size as when President Kennedy was President. Home \nbuilding during the last 2 years, the largest number of homes built in \nany comparable 2-year period.\n  The economy is doing well. I do not think this underlying amendment \nwhich would throw Social Security in reverse will do anything to help \nthe economy. In fact, it will hurt the economy and certainly hurt the \nHelen Collinses of the world, people who have their dignity as a result \nof the Social Security system.\n  Mr. President, I talked about why Social Security was passed. I \ntalked about banks shutting their doors. I talked about factories \nslowing down and stopping. I talked about homes being foreclosed upon, \nfarms being foreclosed upon, people being evacuated from their \nbusinesses because they did not pay their bills, families living \ntogether, ``The Grapes of Wrath''--we do not need ``The Grapes of \nWrath'' revisited. We are a rich nation. We have an obligation to \nprovide for people in their senior years, especially when they provided \nfor themselves, and that is all Social Security does. Social Security \nis not a gift. It is not welfare. It is a program, Mr. President, that \ngives people dignity like my grandmother and like Helen Collins.\n  We need to understand that this underlying amendment is not fair. If \neveryone acknowledges that they want to take care of Social Security \nand protect Social Security, then why not accept my amendment? I hope \npeople of good will on both sides of the aisle will think about this \namendment, will understand where we have come in the 3 years since I \nfirst offered it.\n  I was a lone voice crying in the wilderness 3 years ago. Now, Mr. \nPresident, we have support. The American public supports what we are \nattempting to do. They are supporting it because they know the \nimportance of Social Security, and they know that if we do not \nexpressly exclude Social Security from a balanced budget amendment, it \nwill be destroyed. That is why I will only support a balanced budget \namendment that expressly exempts Social Security.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am hoping we can conclude debate for this \nevening. I will say a few words and hope that our leadership will be \nready to end the session for today. I give warning that I am prepared \nto close down the Senate if the Senate is prepared to be closed down.\n  Let me just say a few words about my friend's amendment. My friend, \nSenator Reid, and others seek to remove Social Security from the \nprotections of the balanced budget amendment. I look forward to a \nlengthy debate tomorrow on this subject and this issue. But while I \nrespect these critics, and I certainly do, the truth of the matter is \nthat the Reid amendment is merely a diversion from what should be the \nreal focus of this debate: whether the Constitution should be amended \nto require a balanced budget amendment except in exigent circumstances.\n\n  When I say that, I again look at these 28 years of unbalanced \nbudgets. This is the real issue. Everybody knows that if the Reid \namendment passes, this is going to only get worse. The fact of the \nmatter is, if we are going to do anything about this, we have to pass \nthe underlying balanced budget amendment without the Reid amendment on \nit. Exempting Social Security from the balanced budget amendment will \ncreate an overwhelming incentive to do just what these critics fear.\n  Let me point out this chart here. Social Security--don't leave it \nout. The budget is protected by the balanced budget amendment. If \nSocial Security is left out, special interests will eat Social Security \nsurpluses like cheese. There is no question about it. This exemption \nwould focus budget pressures on the Social Security trust fund that \ncould destroy the viability of the Social Security trust fund itself. \nIt is a risky gimmick, and it has no real relationship to the goals \nsought.\n  Taking Social Security off budget will subject its funds to \nWashington's special interest scavengers. When you have rats in your \nhome, you need to plug up all the holes. If you do not, they will find \na way in. If we leave Social Security off budget, new and old special \ninterest spending initiatives which cannot survive or make their way in \nunder a balanced budget plan will smell out the scent of Social \nSecurity and simply devour, just like these rats that are devouring the \nSocial Security cheese. You need to leave it in because the budget will \nbe protected by the balanced budget amendment. Do not take it out.\n  Furthermore, exempting the trust funds is simply unjustified. There \nalready exists an elaborate scheme of firewalls that protect the trust \nfunds from Presidential and congressional tampering. Nothing in the \nbalanced budget amendment is inconsistent with the statutory firewall \nscheme. The\n\n[[Page S1465]]\n\ntruth is that the passage of Senate Joint Resolution 1 is the best way \nto preserve Social Security benefits.\n  Mr. President, I must emphasize another reason why the Reid amendment \nis unnecessary. The proposal to remove Social Security from the \nprotections of the balanced budget amendment does nothing to respond to \nthe concern that Social Security benefits will be reduced. This is the \nlanguage of the Reid amendment. Nothing in the exemption would protect \nSocial Security recipients from either benefit cuts or tax increases. \nJust look at the message there. In fact, the Reid amendment could \nweaken the financial integrity of the Social Security System.\n  Under current projections, Social Security will have exhausted the \ntrust funds and will be running deficits by the year 2029. Many of us \nbelieve they will run deficits before then. By 2070, as shown on the \nchart, Social Security will face a startling $7 trillion shortfall. \nJust look at these deficits--by 2070, a $7 trillion shortfall.\n  Excluding Social Security ignores this problem and places the whole \nsystem in dire jeopardy. Including Social Security in the budget \ncalculation forces Congress to address the pending crisis in a \nresponsible manner before it becomes too late. Why? Because exempting \nSocial Security creates two budgets, one which must be balanced because \nreceipts must equal outlays, and the other, a Social Security trust \nbudget which will contain the current trust fund's surplus. This second \nbudget presents the political branches of Government with a powerful \nincentive to redefine costly spending programs as Social Security and \npay for them through what would become a giant loophole in any attempt \nto balance the budget.\n  There is no telling where these games might lead. Imagine the \nchristening of the SS Social Security battleship, or the creation of \nthe Social Security National Park, which will probably, of course, be \nlocated in Utah if this administration has anything to say about it. \nThus, this loophole would make it easy to balance the budget on paper \nwithout changing anything except accounting methods. And, in perhaps \nthe ultimate paradox, Congress could use the loophole to seem to \neliminate the deficit without a single spending cut.\n  According to Wall Street analyst David Malpass, who recently \ntestified before the Judiciary Committee, ``Financial markets would \nreact negatively to a budget concept that ignores Social Security.'' By \npassing a balanced budget that excludes Social Security, Congress \nwould, according to him, and I think anybody else who looks at it \nobjectively, ``game'' the system, saying, in effect, that it does not \nintend to balance the consolidated unitary Federal budget. For Malpass \nand other market analysts, ``This would be a decidedly negative signal \nfor financial markets leading to higher interest rates.'' That would \nhurt every citizen in this country, but most of all the poor.\n  Furthermore, Wall Street's support for the balanced budget amendment \nwas made evident today in a full-page advertisement that Merrill Lynch \nplaced in Roll Call. The ad was entitled ``Why the Balanced Budget \nAmendment Makes Sense.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Why the Balanced Budget Amendment Makes Sense\n\n       During the next month, Congress will debate whether to add \n     a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n       Many arguments have been raised against a balanced budget \n     amendment. Chief among them is that the amendment would \n     aggravate an economic downturn by forcing budget cuts and tax \n     increases.\n       This is a legitimate concern. There is widespread agreement \n     that tax increases and spending cuts in times of economic \n     contraction would only exacerbate a downturn.\n       But the balanced budget amendment would not put members of \n     Congress in straitjackets. The language of the amendment \n     clearly allows for flexibility on this score and it is \n     certainly plausible that three-fifths of the House and Senate \n     would waive the requirement during economic slowdowns.\n       Concern about the impact of a balanced budget amendment \n     should be linked to where the economy is headed if fiscal \n     policy remains on its present course.\n       Any budget agreement reached this year will strive to \n     balance the budget by 2002. But this year's budget agreement \n     will do little to address the long-term fiscal problems this \n     country faces.\n       As the Congressional Budget Office has shown, our long-term \n     fiscal outlook is unsustainable. According to CBO.\n       Entitlement and interest spending will skyrocket after \n     2010--from 12 percent of GDP today to between 22 percent and \n     30 percent by 2025.\n       The spending explosion will create enormous future \n     deficits. By 2030, the deficit could range between 12 percent \n     and 37 percent of GDP--compared to 1.4 percent in 1996.\n       In addition, economists project that current spending and \n     tax policies will ultimately levy a crushing 84 percent \n     lifetime net tax rate on future generations of Americans.\n       Clearly, measured in terms of deficits, debt levels, or \n     future tax rates, our current fiscal path will soon become \n     unaffordable. As a nation, we have made promises that we \n     simply cannot keep without endangering our economic future \n     and that of our children.\n       That's why we support a balanced budget amendment. The \n     amendment itself will not reduce the deficit by a dime. But \n     it could create a political climate that makes the hard \n     choices we face a little easier and lend political support to \n     the long-term pursuit of fiscal prudence.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I believe that this gamesmanship is exactly \nwhat must be avoided. The way to avoid it is to reject such exemptions. \nThe best way to protect retirees of future generations is to adopt a \nclean and strong balanced budget amendment, free of loopholes. \nSignificantly, critics of Senate Joint Resolution 1, who wish to exempt \nSocial Security, have not demonstrated in the least how they would \nbalance the budget without including the present Social Security trust \nfund surpluses, which, as I stated, is only temporary. Presumably, \nwithout including the present surpluses in budget calculations, other \nprograms would have to suffer greater cuts.\n  It is ironic that many of those who argue that a balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment would cause cuts in social programs are \nthemselves calling for the exemption of Social Security, advocating \ndraconian cuts in their most favorite programs. Let me give you an \nexample. Between the years 2002 and 2007, without including the \nsurplus, the deficit will appear to be $700 billion larger than it is. \nThis means either a mammoth tax hike on all American families--almost \n$1,100 per year per household--or devastating cuts in important \nprograms like Medicare, cancer, and other disease research, Head Start, \nand environmental cleanup. I might add that Treasury Secretary Rubin, \nat a January 17 balanced budget constitutional amendment hearing, \ntestified that the trust fund surplus will be included in the \nPresidential budget, and that this view of budget policy reflects the \nview of the President and the Congress.\n  Indeed, President Clinton, in a recent press conference, while \nopposing the balanced budget constitutional amendment, admitted he \ncould not balance the budget without counting the present Social \nSecurity surpluses. In the words of the President, ``Neither the \nRepublicans nor I could produce a balanced budget tomorrow that could \npass if Social Security funds could not be counted.'' In fact, all the \nbudgets the President has submitted to Congress have contained the \nSocial Security surplus. Some would think it hypocritical to not argue \nthat it should not be included. I would never go that far, but it is a \ngame that is being played by the White House and, frankly, it is time \nfor the games to end.\n  The President knows that not including the present day surpluses \nwould require draconian cuts to other worthwhile Federal programs. By \nthe way, contrary to what Senator Reid has alleged, CRS did not--let me \nemphasize this--conclude in any of its memoranda that the balanced \nbudget amendment requirement and the Social Security program would \nprohibit the use of surpluses or other receipts to finance benefits in \nsucceeding years. In fact, today, the nonpartisan Concord Coalition--a \nnonpartisan group founded by a Democrat, Paul Tsongas, and a \nRepublican, Warren Rudman--revealed a study that clearly demonstrates \nthat the best way to protect Social Security is to adopt this clean, \nunamended balanced budget constitutional amendment.\n  I want to point out that the Concord Coalition has been cited by both \nsides as a responsible group trying to do the best to bring about good \nbudgetary matters in this country. I also want to\n\n[[Page S1466]]\n\npoint out that these amendments that are attacking this balanced budget \namendment would, for the first time, place a statutory reference in the \nConstitution. The constitutional effect of this is unclear and likely \nto engender much confusion that could be destructive in both balanced \nbudgets and Social Security. In fact, former Assistant and Acting \nAttorney General Stuart Gerson, and attorney Alan Morrison, a liberal \nattorney, as witnesses for the majority and minority, respectively, in \na recent hearing on Senate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment, agreed that exempting Social Security from \nthe balanced budget amendment is a bad, bad idea.\n\n  According to Alan Morrison, a litigator with the Public Citizen, who \nopposes the balanced budget amendment and who testified for the \nminority:\n\n       Given the size of Social Security, to allow it to run at a \n     deficit would undermine the whole concept of a balanced \n     budget. Moreover, there is no definition of Social Security \n     in the Constitution, and it would be extremely unwise and \n     productive of litigation and political maneuvering to try to \n     write one. If there is to be a balanced budget constitutional \n     amendment, there should be no exceptions.\n\n  He is a liberal and is affiliated with the Ralph Nader group. But he \nis a competent constitutional expert. Normally, he is advocating the \nmost liberal constitutional principles. But even he said there should \nbe no exemptions like the Reid amendment to this balanced budget \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I am eager for the debate tomorrow over the Social \nSecurity exemption. I am confident that when the dust settles, the Reid \namendment will go down to defeat because it will be shown to be not \nonly unnecessary, but also harmful to the very thing it sought to \nsafeguard, Social Security.\n  I have stated that the debate on the Reid amendment is really a \ndiversion from the real underlying issue--whether this Nation has the \nwill to avert a common fiscal crisis. Mr. President, the absolute \nbiggest threat to Social Security is our growing debt and concomitant \ninterest payments. Debt-related inflation hits hard those on fixed \nincomes, and the Government's use of capital to fund debt slows \nproductivity and income growth and siphons off needed money for \nworthwhile programs. The way to protect Social Security benefits is to \npass Senate Joint Resolution 1. The proposal to exempt Social Security \nwill not only destroy the balanced budget amendment, but, in all \nprobability, will also cause the Social Security trust funds to run out \nof money sooner than they would have without an exemption, risking the \nviability of the Social Security program itself.\n  Finally, the Senator from Nevada has raised the specter that the \nbalanced budget amendment may cause the Social Security trust funds to \nbe ``raided,'' because the amounts of the present day surplus will be \nincluded in budget calculations. This contention is erroneous for \nseveral reasons.\n  The argument to exempt Social Security surpluses disregards the fact \nthat the United States has a unified budget, and not including the \npresent trust fund surpluses will make the budget very difficult to \nbalance and threatens the vitality of other Federal programs.\n  The Social Security trust funds are, in actuality, nothing more than \nan accounting device. Let's consider this chart on how the system \nworks. Social Security tax receipts are not kept in some sort of \nisolated bank vault. Instead, Social Security taxes are deposited into \naccounts maintained by the Federal Government with various financial \ninstitutions. Social Security taxes, along with other deposited \nreceipts, become part of the U.S. Treasury. FICA tax receipts go to the \nSocial Security Administration, and they are passed on from there to \nthe Treasury, where all FICA tax proceeds are commingled with the \ngeneral funds. In return, the Treasury invests in Treasury bonds which \nwill be redeemed later. These bonds are, incidentally, the most \nimportant and stable securities in the world.\n\n  All the Treasury moneys are indistinguishable from other deposited \nmoneys. But the Social Security revenues are accounted for separately \nthrough the issuance of Federal securities to trust funds. The trust \nfunds do not hold the moneys. They are simply bookkeeping accounts.\n  Thus, as part of unified budget, any surplus derived from the trust \nfunds, much like other revenues, is used to finance the operations of \nthe Federal Government. Like all of us, the Federal Government has one \nbudget. Listing categories of spending in discrete bookkeeping entries \ndoes not reduce the size of what we owe or spend.\n  Moreover the surplus Social Security taxes being collected today will \nnot cover the future cost of the system. Most of current Social \nSecurity taxes are currently used to cover benefit payments to present \nretirees.\n  Outlays will exceed receipts of the system, and the year that it is \nsuspected to do that is the year 2019. The guarantee of future \nbenefits, therefore, will depend on the Federal Government's future \nability to levy taxes, the size and the amount of the benefits, and the \noverall health of the economy, not the balances or ``surpluses'' of the \ntrust funds.\n  To characterize the use of the surplus as ``raiding'' the trust funds \nis, therefore, erroneous and absolutely wrong. Furthermore, the \nexclusion of the present-day surpluses in the budget will make it \nextraordinarily difficult to balance the budget by the year 2002, the \ndate Senate Joint Resolution 1 mandates balancing the budget. Between \nnow and the year 2002, the surplus is estimated to be over $500 billion \nin current dollars. Ten years from now, the year 2007, the value of \ntrust fund surpluses is expected to be $1.067 trillion. This is an \nannual surplus average of approximately $100 billion.\n  According to current budgetary figures, $100 billion per year is more \nthan our current annual expenditure on education, the environment, and \ntransportation and infrastructure. Mr. President, $1.067 trillion is in \nfact more than our expenditure this year on Medicare, education, \nveterans' benefits, the environment, national defense, Social Security, \ntransportation and infrastructure, and natural resources combined.\n  Where will we come up with the money to fund these programs if we \nexclude Social Security surpluses from the unified budget? Federal \nprograms would have to be cut, or taxes raised by this amount to reach \nthe balanced budget goal. Ironically, it appears that those who yell \nthe loudest to exempt Social Security are the very same people who wish \nto increase the very social welfare programs that are being put at risk \nby this exemption. They are the ones that are really screaming about \nwanting to spend more on social programs, which will have to be cut if \nthis amendment becomes law.\n  The real issue is where are we going to get the money to redeem the \nFederal securities that make up the Social Security trust funds?\n  Let's put that other chart up. Where will we come up with this $1.067 \ntrillion shortfall if Social Security is exempted from the balanced \nbudget amendment?\n  The trust funds are not being raided. We owe the money to the Social \nSecurity trust fund, and we will have to pay. But if Social Security is \nexempted from the balanced budget amendment it will be mortally \nwounded. Either other programs will be relabeled ``Social Security'' so \nthat they take away from the luster of Social Security and the \nwillingness of people to support it like it should be. Either programs \nwill be relabeled ``Social Security''--as we have done in the past--and \nthe present surpluses will be spent, or the surplus will be used to pay \ndown our national debt. And thereafter we will keep spending until we \nhave reached the debt ceiling. Either way, the surplus will be used up.\n  Well, frankly, it is the Reid exemption and the Reid amendment that \nwill ultimately destroy Social Security. The best way to face the \ncoming problems with the Social Security System is through a unified \nbudget. We all have to work together within constraints to redeem those \nsecurities, and not allow any other programs to be relabeled Social \nSecurity or affect the Social Security trust funds. But if we don't, if \nwe take Social Security outside the unified budget, the rats will come \nand eat it away. Inside, Social Security competes better than any other \nissue for budgetary markets. So, it is penny-wise and pound-foolish to \ntake it out and risk having to reduce all of these other good social \nwelfare\n\n[[Page S1467]]\n\nprograms. Head Start, education, environment, highways and \ninfrastructure--all of these programs that are so important would have \nto be cut to reach a balanced budget by the year 2002 if Social \nSecurity is exempted.\n\n  We show that by the year 2019--on this chart, the green part is the \nsurpluses--surpluses drop, and huge deficits will be as high as $7 \ntrillion a year by the year 2007. Without the balanced budget \namendment, that is where we are headed.\n  We would not get this balanced budget if the Reid amendment happened \nto pass. And, if it did past, it would put us at tremendous risk as we \ntry to reach a balanced budget by the year 2002. We would have to cut \nalmost every social program that we have more than we should. Naturally \nwe are going to have to find restraint in growth, and we are going to \nhave to find ways of cutting without cutting to the bone.\n  Taking Social Security out. I have to tell you, it will still be the \nsame system. The only difference is we will still be investing in the \nbonds which I was showing--these Federal Government securities. The \nonly difference is our colleagues who want to spend more will be \nspending those surpluses for more social welfare programs without \nreaching a balanced budget.\n  The fact is that this country will be doomed. We have to pass this \namendment. Frankly, it is the only thing I know to stop the rats from \nraiding all of our budgetary assets. And this will start us on the the \npathway of getting things in order.\n  Look. We know that we cannot keep up the same system. We cannot keep \ndoing this. We just can't keep doing this. And the only chance to put \nan end to these types of unbalanced budgets year after year is to pass \nthis balanced budget amendment, and to pass it intact without these \namendments, as sincere as they may be.\n  Mr. President, I am prepared to move on this side of the Senate, if \nwe can.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have just a few more comments which I \nwould like to make in response to my friend, my western friend from the \nState of Utah, for whom I have the greatest respect. But I would say to \nhim and those listening that we are all beginning to see where some of \nthe special interest scavengers are and who the rats are that will be \nlooking for the cheese. And I think if you look at the Wall Street \nJournal today you will look at a full-page ad. You would find that \nthose are the people who are the rats and those are the people looking \nfor cheese. The Helen Collins of the world who are trying to survive on \nSocial Security can't run a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal. \nThe cheese is the surplus from Social Security. That is what the rats \nare eating. They have been doing it all along.\n  For my friend from Utah to say that President Clinton has said he has \nbeen using it in his calculations, that doesn't make it right. That is \nmy whole point. Let's do it the right way. Why would we enshrine in the \nConstitution something we have been doing wrong for 15 years now? The \nsurpluses of Social Security should not go toward balancing the budget. \nEverybody says it will be hard to do. You have that right. It will be \nhard to do. But when we do it it will be honest. It will be done the \nright way. When we say we have a balanced budget we will really have \ndone it. We don't have one now.\n  My friend, prior to coming to this body, was a trial lawyer, and a \ngood lawyer. I say to him and to anyone within the sound of my voice \nthat you can't have Social Security. It is statutorily defined. You \ncan't include a national park in that, and other programs. It is \nstatutorily defined.\n\n  Now, people may say that you look in the Wall Street Journal; Merrill \nLynch and others, which I have not seen--I am sure it is a full-page \nad--they run this full-page ad. I repeat, the Helen Collinses of the \nworld and almost 75 percent of the American public do not support a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget unless Social Security \nis excluded. They cannot run a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal. \nBut those that are running full-page ads know where the cheese is, and \nthe cheese is the surpluses for Social Security that they will use to \nbalance the budget.\n  And people say, why? The same answer I guess is the answer that \nWillie Sutton gave when they asked him, after he was put in prison, \n``Willie, why did you rob all those banks?'' He said, ``That's where \nthe money was.'' Well, the reason they are going after the Social \nSecurity surpluses is that is the only place we have surplus money now.\n  I repeat, why enshrine in the Constitution something that we have \nbeen doing that is wrong?\n  Now, my friend from Utah has said, well, the CRS really did not mean \nwhat they said, and if they said what they mean they really did not say \nit that way. I read from the Center on Budget Policy Priorities just a \nfew paragraphs. In fact, I know the time is late. I will read one \nparagraph. They say there are three memos, two from CRS and one from \nthem.\n\n       All three memos explain that under the Hatch and Schaefer-\n     Stenholm versions--\n\n  This underlying amendment--\n\n     outlays in any year--including outlays for benefits paid from \n     the Social Security trust fund--may not exceed receipts in \n     that year. All three memos note that any funds drawn down \n     from the accumulated Social Security surpluses to help pay \n     for the Social Security benefits of retired baby boomers \n     would not count as receipts in those years.\n\n  Very clear. That is what they have said.\n  Now, they have said there is no exception as to war. Of course, there \nis exception in the Constitution as to war. So this amendment is not as \npure as some would like us to believe.\n  I also say for emphasis that my friend said it would be difficult to \nbalance the budget. Democrats and Republicans say it would be difficult \nto balance the budget unless you use Social Security trust fund moneys, \nbut it is not a fair balance.\n  Mr. President, I will close tonight--I know everyone is anxious to \ngo. We will take this debate up tomorrow. We have a series of speakers \nlined up, as does my friend from Utah.\n  Congressman David McIntosh, a sophomore Republican Congressman from \nIndiana, says, and I quote:\n\n       Republicans cannot allow ourselves to be defined as cutting \n     Social Security even as we move forward with the balanced \n     budget amendment.\n\n  Now, this man, Mr. McIntosh, is no left-wing socialist. He is noted \nas being one of the most conservative Members in the entire House of \nRepresentatives. He was part of the Republican revolution, but he, \nsophomore Republican, has said, I want to be able to vote on the Reid \namendment; I want to be able to vote to exclude Social Security. Why? \nBecause it is the right thing to do. It is the honest way to balance \nthe budget.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I do not want to prolong the debate \ntonight, but I have to say no matter what you do, those funds are going \nto be invested in bonds, U.S. securities. That is what is statutorily \nrequired.\n  The fact is, if you set Social Security outside of the budget, if \nSocial Security is defined by statute, it can be redefined by statute. \nSo we have accounting surpluses in Social Security. I am just using \nbizarre examples, but what about Medicare? People around here are not \nwilling to reform Medicare. They are not willing to pay the price to \nget it done. They just want to find some other revenue source to pay \nfor it. It would be easy to shove it into Social Security and make the \nsurplus pay for it rather than facing the music which the balanced \nbudget amendment would make us do.\n  And it is not just that. It is all social spending they want to do. \nThey will use that surplus for that rather than using it for what it \nneeds to be used for, and that is to balance the budget. And the only \nway you are going to get the payment for that Social Security surplus \nin the future is if the United States can redeem its bonds. And the \nonly way the United States can redeem its bonds in the year 2020 is if \nwe do what is right today and we pass a balanced budget amendment.\n  That is the only way, because every dime of it, if there is a surplus \nup to the year 2020, every dime will be invested in Federal Government \nbonds, every dime, just like it is today.\n  The question is, will we be using those dollars, every dime in those \ndollars, to balance the budget or will it just be another big spending \nspree by those who want to spend us blind and who have done so for 28 \nstraight years?\n  I do not mean to sound rabid about this, but this is important stuff. \nAnd when we start talking about putting\n\n[[Page S1468]]\n\nSocial Security outside the balanced budget amendment, we're really \ntalking about milking that program to death. You cannot get away with \nit if it is all on budget. If it is a unified budget, you cannot get \naway with it. And these people say it is currently raided. Everyone \nknows that every single nickel of that money is going to go into \nFederal Government bonds. The question is whether that money is going \nto be used to reduce the deficit and get us to a balanced budget by the \nyear 2002 or whether we are going to have people raiding it and using \nit to pay for other additional social spending programs because it is \nnot subject to balanced budget requisites.\n  This is a pretty serious issue. I have here a wonderful article by \nStephen Chapman in Sunday's Washington Times entitled ``Balanced Budget \nShell Game.''\n  He says:\n\n       Opponents of a simple balanced budget amendment, which \n     include President Clinton, say it would harm retirees by \n     allowing Social Security surpluses to be used to offset \n     deficits elsewhere in the budget.\n       North Dakota's Democratic Sen. Byron Dorgan says such a \n     ``misuse'' would violate ``a solemn promise:''\n\n  How is that, since all that money is going to be invested in Federal \nGovernment bonds? The question is, what is it going to be used for, \nonce the Government gets the money? Is it going to be used to balance \nthe budget or used for more spending, which is going to happen if the \nReid amendment passes?\n\n       This tax taken from your paycheck goes into a trust fund to \n     be used for only one purpose, and that is to fund the Social \n     Security system. The critics say the amendment would \n     encourage Congress to cut retirement benefits to pay for tax \n     cuts and other programs at the expense of the elderly.\n       They propose an alternative version that excludes Social \n     Security from deficit calculations. For many Members of \n     Congress, this option has an extra attraction: It has no \n     chance of enactment, since it would force Congress to come up \n     with another $465 billion in spending cuts or tax increases \n     between now and the year 2002. So there will be no need to \n     make the unpleasant choices that our lawmakers have been \n     dodging for an entire generation.\n\n  As they have passed these 28 unbalanced budgets and 58 of the last \n66.\n\n       The opponents have found a clever way to gull voters into \n     accepting a continued tide of red ink.\n       But the public shouldn't be fooled. The opponents are \n     playing a shell game, hoping voters won't be able to detect \n     their sleight of hand. The fears they have for Social \n     Security are unfounded and their solution would protect only \n     fiscal indiscipline.\n\n  Indiscipline, not discipline.\n\n       First of all, excluding Social Security would create a \n     loophole big enough to drive a $300 billion deficit through. \n     If Social Security is exempt from the balanced-budget \n     requirement, everything will be Social Security. Any program \n     with any remote benefit to the elderly can easily be renamed. \n     ``Housing, national health care, highways will be treated as \n     Social Security,'' says Heritage Foundation budget expert \n     Daniel Mitchell. We would end up with a ``balanced'' budget \n     that drives us ever deeper into debt.\n       The exclusion is billed as a way to prevent looting of the \n     trust fund, but its actual effect would be zero. Right now, \n     the retirement fund is running a surplus every year. The \n     surplus is ``invested'' in government bonds--in other words, \n     it is lent to the Treasury, which uses the borrowed money to \n     pay for other government programs. Once it is excluded from \n     the budget, the surplus will still be lent to the Treasury. \n     Mr. Dorgan says Social Security taxes should never be used \n     except to pay Social Security benefits. But his proposal does \n     nothing to prevent that.\n       The ostensible reason we are running a surplus is to build \n     up a reserve that can be used to pay benefits when the Baby-\n     Boom generation retires. Dorgan and Co. say the original \n     balanced-budget amendment would deplete that reserve, \n     seriously endangering future benefits. Nonsense. The \n     ``reserve'' consists of government bonds. These are nothing \n     more than IOUs, which cannot be repaid unless future \n     taxpayers are willing. When the Baby Boomers retire, taxes \n     will have to rise to pay their benefits. That's true whether \n     Social Security runs a surplus today or not.\n       The opponents insist that excluding Social Security from \n     the amendment would shield it from politicians eager to \n     starve Grandma so they can hand out goodies to special \n     interests. Since Congress wouldn't be able to reduce the \n     deficit by cutting Social Security benefits, those benefits \n     would be as safe as the gold in Fort Knox.\n       This argument is neat, simple and hopelessly naive. What it \n     overlooks is that if Congress can't use the surplus to \n     balance the budget, it can always get rid of the surplus by \n     cutting payroll taxes--then raise taxes an equivalent amount \n     elsewhere to pay for the programs it wants. It could also cut \n     benefits to allow even deeper cuts in the payroll tax, which \n     would permit additional tax increases to finance spending \n     that doesn't help the elderly. The protection for Social \n     Security would soon turn out to be no protection at all.\n       The opponents of the original amendment take the \n     politically easy position of saying that the Constitution \n     shouldn't require the budget to be balanced at the expense of \n     the elderly. What they mean is that the Constitution \n     shouldn't require the budget to be balanced at the expense of \n     anyone.\n\n  The fact is, the same funds will be invested in the same bonds, and \nthe credit of the United States will have to take care of those bonds \nin the future or people on Social Security will not have the money. You \nsaw the deficits expected in Social Security during the next century.\n  The fact is, unless we balance this budget, unless we get fiscal \ndiscipline into the Constitution, I guarantee we are not going to do \nwhat is necessary to solve our fiscal problems. We are certainly not \ngoing to have the funds to take care of Social Security in the future.\n  So, passing the balanced budget amendment in its current form, in the \nform that we have here, the only one that has a chance of passage, is \nour only hope to get spending under control.\n  Mr. President, I am prepared to turn the floor over to the majority \nleader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I see the leader here. I have just a couple \nof more comments. I have about 5 more minutes, Mr. Leader?\n  Mr. LOTT. That will be fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would first of all say I don't know who \nthis man is from the Washington Times, but having read that before \ncoming here I know why he writes for that newspaper. I think he would \nhave trouble getting a job anyplace else with the logic he uses in \nthat.\n  As far as I am concerned, he is perpetuating the myth that Social \nSecurity proceeds will and should be used to balance the budget. I \nthink that is wrong. Remember, the commission that just reported to us \nin the last few months said that some of those trust fund moneys should \nbe invested in private securities. We cannot do that if all the money \ngoes to balancing the budget, as will happen with the underlying \namendment.\n  My friend from Utah said all through this debate that Social Security \nis the only way, using the excesses, the surplus from Social Security, \nthat you can balance the budget. That does not make it right. That is \nwrong. If you told a future Social Security recipient the money you are \npaying in and your employer is paying in is going to be used to balance \nthe budget, it is going to pay for foreign aid and other type things, I \ndon't think they would be too happy.\n  Senator Domenici said it about as well as we could in 1990 when he \nsaid,\n\n       I voted for the Hollings proposal because I support the \n     concept of taking Social Security out of the budget deficit \n     calculations. We need a firewall around those funds to make \n     sure the reserves are there to pay Social Security benefits \n     in the next century.\n\n  The Reid amendment is the firewall that the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee called for 6 years ago. We should pass it. It can be done \nwith my amendment.\n  I further say that the President of the United States, in his radio \naddress this past Saturday said:\n\n       It would prevent us from responding to foreign challenges \n     abroad or economic trouble at home, if to do so resulted in \n     even a minor budget deficit. And because it would write a \n     specific economic policy into our Constitution, it could \n     force the Secretary of the Treasury to cut Social \n     Security, or drive the budget into courts of law when a \n     deficit occurred when Congress was not working on the \n     budget. In a court of law, judges could be forced to halt \n     Social Security checks or to raise taxes just to meet the \n     demands of the constitutional amendment.\n\n  It is wrong to balance the budget using Social Security surpluses. \nThat is what Congressman David McIntosh, Republican from the State of \nIndiana, said when he stated, ``Republicans cannot allow ourselves to \nbe defined as cutting Social Security.'' They will. Anyone voting for \nthe underlying amendment and not for the Reid amendment will be deemed \nas cutting Social Security because that, in fact, is what would occur.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to extend certain privileges, exemptions, and \nimmunities to Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n\n\n            HONG KONG ECONOMIC AND TRADE OFFICES LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise as chairman of the Subcommittee on \nEast Asian and Pacific Affairs to introduce S. 342, a bill to extend \ncertain privileges, exemptions, and immunities to Hong Kong Economic \nand Trade Offices located in the United States. I am pleased to be \njoined by Senator Robb as an original cosponsor.\n  The Hong Kong Government maintains Economic and Trade Offices in \nseveral countries to represent the Colony's economic and trade \ninterests abroad; there are three such Offices in the United States--\nSan Francisco, New York, and Washington. As my colleagues are aware, at \nmidnight on June 30, 1997, Hong Kong will revert to the jurisdiction of \nthe People's Republic of China as the Hong Kong Special Administrative \nRegion [HKSAR]. The HKSAR will purportedly, under agreements reached \nbetween the PRC and the United Kingdom, enjoy a high degree of autonomy \nfrom the central government in Beijing except in the areas of foreign \npolicy and defense. That autonomy includes the right to maintain \neconomic and trade ties with third countries independent of Beijing.\n  The Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 provided, inter alia, that the \nUnited States should invite Hong Kong to maintain its Economic and \nTrade Offices after June 30. The reasoning was not only to continue to \nfacilitate our trade relationship with our ninth biggest trading \npartner; in addition, the move was meant to underscore our commitment \nto an autonomous Hong Kong after 1997.\n  This bill would extend to these offices and employees the provisions \nof the International Organizations Immunities Act and the Agreement on \nState and local Taxation of Foreign Employees of Public International \nOrganizations, thereby assuring that these offices are treated in the \nsame manner as others similarly situated--such as the Taipei Economic \nand Cultural Representative Offices, Taiwan's representative in the \nUnited States.\n  Identical legislation passed the Senate unanimously late last year, \nbut was not considered by the House before we adjourned sine die. \nBecause the June deadline looms so near, I hope that we can move this \nbill quickly and without amendment through both Houses before the July \n1 reversion of Hong Kong to China's jurisdiction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS (for himself and Mr. Robb):\n  S. 343. A bill to authorize the extension of nondiscriminatory \ntreatment (most-favored-nation treatment) to the products of Mongolia; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                        MONGOLIA MFN LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise as chairman of the Subcommittee on \nEast\n\n[[Page S1471]]\n\nAsian and Pacific Affairs to introduce S. 343, a bill to authorize the \nextension of nondiscriminatory treatment--formerly known as ``most-\nfavored nation status''--to the products of Mongolia. I am pleased to \nbe joined by Senator Robb and Senator McCain as original cosponsors.\n  Mongolia has undergone a series of remarkable and dramatic changes \nover the last few years. Sandwiched between the former Soviet Union and \nChina, it was one of the first countries in the world to become \nCommunist after the Russian Revolution. After 70 years of Communist \nrule, though, the Mongolian people have recently made great progress in \nestablishing a democratic political system and creating a free-market \neconomy. Just last year, the country held its third election under its \nnew constitution, resulting in a parliamentary majority for the \ncoalition of democratic opposition parties. Rather than attempt to \nmaintain its hold on power, the former government peaceably--and \ncommendably--transferred power to the new government.\n  Mongolia has demonstrated a strong desire to build a friendly and \ncooperative relationship with the United States on trade and related \nmatters since its turn towards democracy. We concluded a bilateral \ntrade treaty with that country in 1991, and a bilateral investment \ntreaty in 1994. Mongolia has received nondiscriminatory trading status \nsince 1991, and has been found to be in full compliance with the \nfreedom of emigration requirements of title IV of the Trade Act of \n1974. In addition, it has acceded to the agreement establishing the \nWorld Trade Organization.\n  Mr. President, Mongolia has clearly demonstrated that it is fully \ndeserving of joining the ranks of those countries to which we extend \nnondiscriminatory trade status. The extension of that status would not \nonly serve to commend the Mongolians on their impressive progress, but \nwould also enable the United States to avail itself of all its rights \nunder the WTO with respect to Mongolia.\n  I have another, more parochial, reason for being interested in MFN \nstatus for Mongolia. Mongolia and my home State of Wyoming are sister \nStates; a strong relationship between the two has developed over the \nlast 4 years. Many of Mongolia's provincial governors have visited the \nState, and the two governments have established partnerships in \neducation, agriculture, and livestock management. Like Wyoming, \nMongolia is a high plateau with mountains on the northwest border, \nwhere many of the residents make their living by raising livestock. I \nam pleased to see the development of this mutually beneficial \nrelationship, and am sure that the extension of nondiscriminatory trade \nstatus will serve to strengthen it further.\n  Mr. President, I introduced an identical bill in the last Congress at \nthe very end of the legislative year, as did Congressman Bereuter in \nthe House. We both realized that it was too late in the year to move \nthe legislation forward before we adjourned sine die, but we hoped that \nby introducing the bill then that it would serve as a catalyst to \nserious discussion of the issue in this Congress. I was very \nappreciative that last year the distinguished chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Roth, indicated his willingness to favorably \nconsider the legislation early in this Congress, and look forward to \nworking with him.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 344. A bill to require the relocation of a National Weather \nService radar tower which is on Sulphur Mountain near Ojai, CA; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                  national weather service legislation\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 344\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. RELOCATION OF RADAR TOWER.\n\n       (a) Requirement To Relocate Radar Tower.--Not later than 18 \n     months after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n     Secretary shall relocate the National Weather Service radar \n     tower which is located on Sulphur Mountain near Ojai, \n     California, to a site which complies with the criteria listed \n     in subsection (b).\n       (b) Criteria for New Site.--The new site for the radar \n     tower referred to in subsection (a) shall be selected so that \n     the relocation--\n       (1) will not result in degradation of service; and\n       (2) will minimize the negative impact of the radar tower on \n     residential areas.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 6 months after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall transmit a report \n     to Congress that includes--\n       (1) an identification of the new site selected for the \n     radar tower; and\n       (2) evidence which was considered in reaching the \n     conclusion that relocation of the radar tower to the site \n     selected meets the criteria listed in subsection (b).\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For the purposes of this Act--\n       (1) the term ``degradation of service'' means any decrease \n     in or failure to maintain the quality and type of weather \n     services provided by the National Weather Service to the \n     public; and\n       (2) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \n     Commerce.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBB:\n  S. 345. A bill to amend chapter 57 of title 5, United States Code, to \nprovide for the payment to Federal employees of meal expenses required \nwhile serving on a security detail in the protection of a Federal \nofficer, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n                      FEDERAL EMPLOYEE LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to \nright an obvious wrong. As I was reading the Washington Post on January \n6, 1997, I ran across a brief mention that employees of the CIA who are \nassigned to protect the Director of Central Intelligence must pay their \nown way when they are forced to buy meals because of their assigned \nprotection duties.\n  Evidently these Federal employees are required to keep a line of \nsight on the Director 24 hours a day, which sometimes entails following \nhim to restaurants. These restaurants in turn refuse to let the \nprotection detail occupy a table without purchasing a meal. While this \nmay sound trivial, I do not believe it is fair to require a Federal \nemployee to buy an expensive meal as part of their job. I am sure \nyou'll agree that if a person is going to spend that kind of money on a \nmeal, they should be enjoying it with a good friend or loved one, not \nwatching their boss across the room.\n  For that reason, I am introducing this bill, which would authorize \nany Federal agency to pay the meal expenses for cases like this one for \nan employee who is serving on a 24-hour-a-day security detail which \nrequires the employee to remain in the line of sight of the person \nbeing protected. I understand that certain agencies already have this \nauthority, but it clearly should be extended to all Federal agencies. I \nhope that this noncontroversial measure can be examined by the \nappropriate committee and quickly passed. The existing situation is \nblatantly unfair and needs to be changed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Looks Unlike America\n\n                             (By Al Kamen)\n\n       Even some of the Clinton administration diversity policy \n     were embarrassed by President Clinton's strong-arming \n     Transportation Secretary Federico Pena into accepting a \n     nomination to be energy secretary--a job for which he is \n     notably lacking in credentials.\n       But the ethno-gender contortions were deemed, in the best \n     inside-the-Beltway political wisdom, essential to pay off the \n     Hispanic vote with two Cabinet seats.\n       Yet, after so much effort expended on Cabinet diversity, \n     the Clinton White House itself remains a comfortable, mostly \n     white boys club, with hardly an African American, Latino or \n     Asian American in any senior job.\n       With the anticipated departure of public liaison office \n     director Alexis M. Herman, the only minority in the top 25 or \n     so senior staff members is first lady Hillary Rodham \n     Clinton's chief of staff, Margaret A. Williams--and she may \n     leave soon.\n       New Chief of Staff Erskine B. Bowles has three openings--\n     and may have more--at that assistant to the president level: \n     a political affairs director to replace Douglas Sosnik, who \n     moved up to be ``counselor''; a replacement for Herman; and \n     one for outgoing White House counsel Jack Quinn.\n       Administration officials say to keep an eye on former \n     representative Alan Wheat (D-Mo.) and the Labor Department's \n     wage and hour division chief Maria Echaveste, both mentioned \n     for Cabinet jobs.\n       But ``Look Like America''? Not the senior staff.\n\n[[Page S1472]]\n\n                             In Like Quinn?\n\n       Speaking of Quinn, the search goes on for a replacement, \n     and the list doesn't appear too long. The problem, as one \n     senior administration official put it, is ``finding someone \n     who's smart enough to do it and yet dumb enough to take it.''\n       The most prominently mentioned name for the job is former \n     U.S. attorney Charles F.C. Ruff, who had been under \n     consideration for the attorney generalship after Zoe E. Baird \n     went down in flames until it was discovered he had a nanny \n     problem himself. Ruff is public-service minded, so he might \n     be persuaded. And he's been a partner at Covington & Burling, \n     so he presumably would have enough savings to cover his legal \n     fees.\n\n\n                            Career Counselor\n\n       Job alert. There are lots of openings in the counsel's \n     office.\n       Associate White House counsel Elena Kagan, a tenured \n     constitutional law professor on leave from the University of \n     Chicago, had two going-away parties, the movers ready to go \n     and a class waiting for her today. But the students will have \n     to wait. New domestic policy chief Bruce Reed persuaded her \n     to stick around and be his top deputy.\n       Another associate counsel, David B. Fein, however, stuck \n     with his original plan and has gone to private practice in \n     Connecticut. Even before Quinn threw in the towel, he was \n     looking for staff. Shortly after the election, Quinn asked \n     U.S. Attorney Eric H. Holder Jr. to ``make referrals and \n     recommendations to him about individuals who might be \n     interested in moving to the White House Counsel's Office \n     in the new administration,'' according to a memo Holder \n     sent his assistants.\n       ``So that I can be responsive to Quinn,'' Holder said, ``I \n     would like to gather the names of those interested in this \n     opportunity and will then personally forward them to Quinn. . \n     . . (And don't worry, I won't hold it against you for \n     expressing interest in this opportunity--I think it's a great \n     one!)''\n\n\n                              dinner duty\n\n       Browsing on the General Accounting Office World Wide Web \n     page (we obviously need to get out more), we came across the \n     Ebenezer Scrooge Memorial Memo of 1996. The Dec. 30 GAO \n     decision memo involves a CIA request to reimburse members of \n     the director's security detail for meals they were obliged to \n     buy on duty.\n       ``According to the CIA,'' the memo says, the security folks \n     traveling with the director or deputy are to ``remain in the \n     line of sight of the official they are protecting. On \n     occasion [they] must accompany one of the officials'' to area \n     restaurants and sit at nearby tables so as to be unobtrusive \n     but in the line of sight. ``Some restaurants require that \n     members of the detail order meals while sitting at these \n     tables. The cost of these meals, often substantial, has been \n     borne by the individual members of the detail,'' the memo \n     said, adding that the agency thinks it, not the overworked \n     security people, should pick up the tab.\n       Tough luck, the GAO said. The law says no government \n     employee can get a free meal while at ``a normal duty \n     station,'' except for ``extreme emergency situations,'' and \n     this isn't one of them. Congress can and has overridden the \n     restriction for some agencies, but not for the CIA. So until \n     Congress acts, the security detail pays.\n\n\n                             starring roles\n\n       John D. Bates, deputy independent counsel in charge of the \n     Washington operation for Kenneth W.

A bill to assure fairness and assistance to patients and \nhealth care providers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                   THE PATIENT PROTECTION ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I introduce the Patient \nProtection Act of 1997. This bill addresses the issue of fairness in \nhealth care today.\n  Mr. President, the last few years have seen an enormous growth in \nmanaged care health plans. Now, more than 50 percent of Americans are \nenrolled in some kind of managed care arrangement. We have learned a \nlot in the past several years about what works and what doesn't in \nmanaged care, in all kinds of health insurance for that matter.\n  And, let me be clear that I recognize that there are things that are \nworking well in managed care and other types of plans. We have seen a \ndecrease in the rate of increase in healthcare costs. Health plans are \nemphasizing prevention and early intervention. Health plans are largely \nmoving from managing costs to managing care to managing health.\n  All of this is good, but enough time has gone by that we have found \nthe problems, the glitches, the occasions and circumstances where \npatient and providers are not equal stakeholders in the systems and \nwhere they are treated unfairly, where their voices are either silent \nor disregarded. I am deeply concerned about the lack of availability of \nprotections for patients and providers participating in all forms of \nhealth plans. This includes not only managed care plans in their \nvarious forms, but also point-of-service and traditional--fee-for-\nservice--plans as well. The inclusion of self-insured plans, MEWA's \nmultiple employer welfare agreements--and association plans is an \nimportant component of this act because it extends provisions to some \nof those consumers who most need the protections.\n  Many States are currently developing and moving similar bills through \ntheir legislatures and assemblies. There is a clear cry for these \ncorrections and protections. However, even if all 50 States were to \npass patient protection acts, not all Americans would benefit from  \nthese protections. I believe that now more than ever, Federal standards \nare needed to ensure that consumers are protected in our rapidly \nchanging health care delivery environment. Almost 50 percent of \nAmericans, those who belong to health plans regulated by the Federal \nGovernment, are excluded from State based protections. According to a \nreport released by the GAO in July 1995, 44 million Americans are \ncovered under exempt plans. There are an additional 70 million who are \ncovered by other employer plans that may also be outside of the realm \nof State authority. In addition, self-funded plans are becoming more \ncommon, especially in smaller businesses. The standards that I am \nproposing should assure fairness for consumers and providers, while \nstill encouraging health plans to pursue innovative approaches to \nproviding high quality, cost-effective care. I am sure, Mr. President, \nthat each of us is committed to fairness and understands the need for \nthe Federal Government to work cooperatively with the States on this \nissue.\n\n  My Patient Protection Act of 1997 will do several things that will \nease the confusion so often present for consumers and providers in the \nhealth care system. It will assist them with their rights as \nparticipants in health plans.\n  The act will award a grant to each State to establish an office of \nconsumer education counseling, and assistance with health care. This \nwill help consumers choose among the many plans available to them, \nunderstand their rights for appeals if care that their provider advises \nis denied, and receive support if they undertake a grievance procedure. \nThese offices will be modeled after the successful ones in the Medicare \nProgram, staffed largely by volunteers, that have helped seniors find \ntheir way through what might be for many an overwhelming situation.\n  The act will require that health plans disclose certain information \nso that consumers and providers are better informed. Information that \nmust be disclosed ranges from the financial health of the plan to its \ninternal review process and criteria used in making decisions about \ntreatment. No longer will there be a black hole in health plans into \nwhich very personal information about a patient goes, something unknown \nhappens and out comes a decision to treat or not treat the problem. \nThat simply is not the way to provide health care in a democracy.\n  The act will require that plans ensure timely access to services and \nspecialized treatment expertise, when clinically indicated.\n  The act will require the development of health plan standards, \nincluding utilization review activities and handling of grievances of \nconsumers or providers. Providers and consumers will be involved in the \ndevelopment of these processes.\n  The act will protect providers by requiring mechanisms for due \nprocess\n\n[[Page S1473]]\n\nand disallowing dismissal of providers from the panel of a health plan \nwithout cause. It adds antigag clause and whistle-blower protection in \norder to ensure that consumers receive information that they need about \nhealth care options and quality of health care.\n  In a country where many are either uninsured or underinsured, it is \nespecially important that attempts to control costs be accompanied by \nclear legal rights for consumers and providers. With a competitive \ninsurance market lacking adequate consumer protections and a health \ncare system that says it's OK to leave some people out, what's to \nprevent plans from discriminating against patients who are likely to \nneed expensive clinical services?\n  Mr. President, these are not anti-managed care provisions. As a \nmatter of fact, they are not anti anything. They are positive steps \nthat will restore a better balance between health plans, consumers, and \nproviders. Responsible health plans already comply with the standards \nthat the Patient Protection Act would establish. But the Patient \nProtection Act would ensure that all patients and providers are \nguaranteed at least a baseline of protection.\n  We are currently seeing attempts to regulate health care on a \ndisease-by-disease basis. This is not the best way to protect consumers \nand providers. We need to focus on maintaining the unique relationship \nbetween health care providers and their patients, so that optimal care \nis available. Congress should not be in the business of deciding how \nlong a patient needs to stay in the hospital for treatment of a \nspecific condition, or whether a specific technology should be offered \nto a specific patient. We should instead make certain that health care \nproviders can take into account the uniqueness of each of their \npatients in developing a rational and appropriate plan of care that can \nbe followed. We can do this by ensuring that consumers and providers \nare included in the utilization review and decisionmaking process. The \nframework provided by the Patient Protection Act of 1997 will allow \nthis to occur.\n  These issues will become increasingly important as managed care \narrangements proliferate, competition increases, more and more \nAmericans and children lose their health insurance coverage, and costs \ncontinue to escalate. Until we are willing to make the hard choices and \ndeal with the underlying problems in our current system, the very least \nwe should do is enact some sensible protections that safeguard \npatients' and providers' rights.\n  Mr. President, many people are fond of saying that health care reform \nis happening now--employers are managing their costs by enrolling \nincreasing numbers of employees in managed care plans and new provider \nnetworks are emerging daily. But with so much attention being paid to \nthe cost and business of health care, the providers and patients are \nlosing substantial control over decisions affecting patients' health. \nIt is therefore all the more important that we provide patient and \nprovider protections. The Patient Protection Act of 1997 will go a long \nway toward doing that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 346\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

With respect to a decision to deny the \n     provision of health care devices, services or procedures, a \n     comparable provider shall conduct a subsequent review to \n     determine the clinical appropriateness of such a denial. \n     Comparable health providers from the appropriate specialty \n     area shall be utilized in the review process.\n       (B) Decisions.--All utilization review decisions shall be \n     made in a timely manner, as determined appropriate when \n     considering the urgency of the situation.\n       (C) Adverse determinations.--With respect to utilization \n     review, an adverse determination or noncertification of an \n     admission, continued stay, or service shall be clearly \n     documented, including the specific clinical or other reason \n     for the adverse determination or noncertification, and be \n     available to the covered individual and the affected provider \n     or facility. A health plan may not deny or limit coverage \n     with respect to a service that the enrollee has already \n     received solely on the basis of lack of prior authorization \n     or second opinion, to the extent that the service would have \n     otherwise been covered by the plan had such prior \n     authorization or a second opinion been obtained.\n       (D) Notification of denial.--A health plan shall provide a \n     covered individual with timely notice of an adverse \n     determination or noncertification of an admission, continued \n     stay, or service. Such a notification shall include \n     information concerning the utilization review program appeals \n     procedure as well as the telephone number for the Office.\n       (6) Requests for authorization.--A health plan utilization \n     review program shall ensure that requests by covered \n     individuals or providers for prior authorization of a \n     nonemergency service shall be answered in a timely manner \n     after such request is received. If utilization review \n     personnel are not available in a timely fashion, any health \n     care services provided shall be considered approved.\n       (7) New technologies.--A utilization review program shall \n     implement policies and procedures to evaluate the appropriate \n     use of new health care technologies or new applications of \n     established technologies, including health care procedures, \n     drugs, and devices. The program shall ensure that appropriate \n     providers participate in the development of technology \n     evaluation criteria.\n       (8) Special rule.--Where prior authorization for a service \n     or other covered item is obtained under a program under this \n     section, the service shall be considered to be covered unless \n     there was intentional fraud or intentionally incorrect \n     information provided at the time such prior authorization was \n     obtained. If a provider intentionally supplied the incorrect \n     information that led to the authorization of clinically \n     unnecessary care, the provider shall be prohibited from \n     collecting payment directly from the enrollee, and shall \n     reimburse the plan and subscriber for any payments or \n     copayments the provider may have received.\n       (d) Health Plan Requirements.--\n       (1) Disclosure of information.--\n       (A) Prospective covered individuals.--A health plan shall, \n     with respect to any materials distributed to prospective \n     covered individuals, include a summary of the utilization \n     review procedures of the plan.\n       (B) Covered individuals.--A health plan shall, with respect \n     to any materials distributed to newly covered individuals, \n     include a clear and comprehensive description of utilization \n     review procedures of the plan and a statement of patient \n     rights and responsibilities with respect to such procedures.\n       (C) State officials.--\n       (i) In general.--A health plan shall disclose to the State \n     insurance commissioner, or other designated State official, \n     the health plan utilization review program policies, \n     procedures, and reports required by the State for \n     certification.\n       (ii) Streamlining of procedures.--To the extent \n     practicable, a State shall implement procedures to streamline \n     the process by which a health plan documents compliance with \n     the requirements of this Act, including procedures to \n     condense the number of documents filed with the State \n     concerning such compliance.\n       (2) Toll-free number.--A health plan shall have a \n     membership card which shall have printed on the card the \n     toll-free telephone number that a covered individual should \n     call to receive precertification utilization review \n     decisions.\n       (3) Evaluation.--A health plan shall establish mechanisms \n     to evaluate the effects of the utilization review program of \n     the plan through the use of member satisfaction data or \n     through other appropriate means.\n       (e) Emergency Care.--\n       (1) Emergency medical condition.--For purposes of this \n     section the term ``emergency medical condition'' means a \n     medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of \n     sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that a \n     prudent layperson (including the parent of a minor child or \n     the guardian of a disabled individual), who possesses an \n     average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably \n     expect the absence of immediate medical attention to result \n     in--\n       (A) placing the health of the individual (or, with respect \n     to a pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn \n     child) in serious jeopardy,\n       (B) serious impairment to bodily functions, or\n       (C) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.\n       (2) Preauthorization.--With respect to emergency services \n     furnished in a hospital emergency department, a health plan \n     shall not require prior authorization for the provision of \n     such services if the enrollee arrived at the emergency \n     department with symptoms that reasonably suggested an \n     emergency medical condition based on the judgment of a \n     prudent layperson, regardless of whether the hospital was \n     affiliated with the health plan. All procedures performed \n     during the evaluation and treatment of an emergency medical \n     condition shall be covered under the health plan.\n                    TITLE III--HEALTH PLAN STANDARDS\n\n     SEC. 301.

A bill to designate the Federal building located at 100 \nAlabama Street NW, in Atlanta, GA, as the ``Sam Nunn Federal Center''; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                  sam nunn federal center legislation\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, today, I honor Senator Sam Nunn, \nmy friend, and one of America's most outstanding public servants. In \nrecognition of the exceptional service Senator Sam Nunn has given to \nGeorgia, the Senate, and the United States, I believe it would be \nfitting that the new Federal building in Atlanta be designated the \n``Sam Nunn Federal Center.''\n  Senator Nunn has provided exemplary bipartisan leadership over the \npast 24 years, serving in a variety of leadership positions including \nboth chairman and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee \nand the chairman and ranking member on the Senate's Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations. In his years in the U.S. Senate, \nSenator Nunn earned the reputation as an internationally recognized \nexpert on economic policy, defense, and national security.\n  Respected and honored by both his colleagues and constituents, it has \nbeen said of Senator Nunn, ``Unlike some who gained prominence in the \nnation's capital, Nunn has not done so at the expense of his home base \n* * * Public events shift and change, but Sam Nunn keeps right on being \nSam Nunn.'' First elected to the Senate in 1972, Sam Nunn has been one \nof the most admired and respected Members of the U.S. Senate and has \nconsistently been ranked among the most effective Senators in surveys \nof journalists and congressional staffers.\n  Senator Nunn has recently ended his many years of service as a U.S. \nSenator and I am deeply honored to now occupy his seat. I believe that \nnaming the Federal building in Atlanta after Senator Nunn would be a \npermanent way in which we can appropriately recognize Senator Nunn's \ncontributions to the Nation. I urge my fellow colleagues to join me in \nhonoring my friend, and one of America's most admired public servants, \nand support the passage of the bill to designate the ``Sam Nunn Federal \nCenter.'' In conclusion, I would like to have Senator Byrd's September \n27 floor statement made in tribute to Senator Nunn re-entered in the \nRecord.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Congressional Record, Sept. 27, 1996]\n\n                      Tribute to Senator Sam Nunn\n\n       Mr. Byrd. Mr. President, we are rapidly approaching that \n     season when we shall witness the departure of many of our \n     colleagues who have elected not to serve beyond this \n     Congress.\n       Mr. President, I was the 1,579th Senator of 1,826 men and \n     women who have served in the U.S. Senate from the beginning. \n     I have seen many fine Senators come and go. As I think\n\n[[Page S1478]]\n\n     back over the years, something good might well have been said \n     about most, if not all, of these Senators. We are prone, of \n     course, to deliver heartfelt eulogies, speeches declaring our \n     regrets that our colleagues choose to leave the service of \n     this body.\n       About all of these Senators whom I have seen depart the \n     Senate, some good could be said, unlike Lucius Aelius \n     Aurelius Commodus, the Roman emperor who served from 180 to \n     192 A.D., one of the few Roman emperors about whom nothing \n     good could be said.\n       I don't think that any of the Senators that I can recall at \n     the moment who voluntarily retired with honor from this body \n     were Senators about whom nothing good could be said. But \n     shortly, we will witness the departure of one of the truly \n     outstanding United States Senators of our time, and when I \n     say ``of our time,'' I mean my time as a Member of Congress \n     for 44 years, a Member of this body for 38 years. The \n     departure of Sam Nunn will be an irreparable loss. Someone \n     might be able to take his place over a period of years.\n       I remember the death of Senator Russell, Richard Russell of \n     Georgia, on January 21, 1971, 25 years ago. In the course of \n     those 25 years, one-quarter of a century, I have to say that \n     I have not seen the likeness of Richard Russell, except in \n     Senator Samuel Augustus Nunn.\n       So it may be another 25 years, it may be 50 years before we \n     see the likeness of Senator Nunn.\n       I pay tribute to this distinguished colleague who is \n     retiring from the Senate after 24 years--illustrious years. \n     There are many things that one can say about Sam Nunn, as he \n     has been consistently productive, growing in stature year by \n     year to become, without doubt, the leading Senate voice on \n     national defense security and alliance issues--the leading \n     voice. His accomplishments, of which there are many, are \n     notable and derive from an approach to his work which is \n     unfailingly thorough and well-focused. He is blessed with an \n     exceptional intellect, and in Senator Nunn's case that sharp \n     intellect combines with a much rarer talent for harnessing \n     creative visions to practical techniques. Sam Nunn has been \n     especially successful as a legislator in this body because of \n     his ability to reduce complicated issues to an understandable \n     scope, while avoiding oversimplification. Then he works \n     patiently and persistently to build bipartisan support.\n       Indeed, his many ideas and initiatives are often shared and \n     supported by his colleagues across the aisle. In a day when \n     bipartisanship is as rare as platinum and gold and rubies, \n     and certainly as valuable, Sam Nunn epitomizes that for which \n     so many of us strive, and often fail to achieve--bipartisan \n     consensus which the people so desire and which fuels large \n     majorities behind legislative endeavors. The ingredients of \n     vision coupled with practicality, and balance between liberal \n     and conservative views, mark his spectacularly successful \n     career as a Senator and are textbook examples for the younger \n     Members of this body and the newer Members of this body in \n     the years to come to heed and to emulate.\n       Sam Nunn hails from Georgia, where commitment to the \n     Nation's defense runs deeply, and from whence some of our \n     greatest legislators on national defense have emerged. He has \n     upheld the great Georgia tradition so ably begun by his \n     granduncle Representative Carl Vinson, with whom I served in \n     the House of Representatives before coming to the Senate, and \n     his predecessor, Senator Richard B. Russell.\n       While Senator Nunn has only served as the chairman or \n     ranking member of the Armed Services Committee for 12 years, \n     his record of achievement and the reverence in which he is \n     held in this body are comparable to that--and I know--\n     comparable to that of the great Russell. This is a feat of \n     enormous distinction. The State of Georgia has to be \n     extremely proud to have given such talented sons to our \n     Republic, men who have so well borne the mantle of \n     responsibility to protect the defense of our Nation and \n     promote its fighting forces.\n       Now, if you ask Sam Nunn what he regards as the most \n     important of his many, many achievements in affecting and \n     directing U.S. policy in the national defense arena, I \n     doubt--and I have never asked him this question--but I doubt \n     that he would mention the more widely publicized of his \n     achievements, such as his role in developing the Stealth \n     fighter; or the many initiatives he authored to reduce the \n     dangers of war in the Russian-American relationship; or the \n     meaningful measures enacted to reduce and make safer the \n     world's inventories of nuclear weapons and fissile materials; \n     or even his role in broadening and deepening American \n     leadership in NATO, in Bosnia, in the Persian Gulf, or in \n     Haiti. It is in the less heralded, less glamorous but \n     critically important area of the morale and welfare of our \n     men and women in uniform that is at the top of the list that \n     Sam Nunn might himself cite as his most noteworthy \n     achievement in the defense area.\n       Senator Nunn was the key player in meeting the needs of the \n     All Volunteer Force so that we could attract and retain the \n     kind of men and women who could effectively manage and lead \n     our forces across the globe in all environments. He \n     constructed a benefits package for the men and women who \n     fought so well in the Kuwait Desert in Operation Desert \n     Storm. He crafted the post-cold war transition measures that \n     address the needs of our military personnel as they make \n     their way from the front lines of the cold war back into \n     American civilian society.\n       He has worked tirelessly to instill a sense of pride and \n     loyalty in our uniformed men and women that is of such great \n     value to the Nation. As Edmund Burke said on March 22, 1775, \n     ``It is the love of the people; it is their attachment to \n     their government, from the sense of the deep stake they have \n     in such a glorious institution, which gives you your army and \n     navy, and infuses in both that liberal obedience, without \n     which your army would be a base rabble, and your navy nothing \n     but rotten timber.''\n       Now I have been privileged to serve with Sam Nunn as a \n     member of the Armed Services Committee and with Sam Nunn as \n     its leader. Senators are not renowned for their managerial \n     skills, but the Armed Services Committee under Sam Nunn's \n     leadership has been superbly managed.\n       In my 44 years in Congress, I have yet to see a chairman of \n     any committee who excelled Sam Nunn. In my humble judgment, \n     he is the best committee chairman that I have ever seen in \n     these 44 years in Congress, including myself. I worked hard \n     at being a good chairman. But Senator Nunn, to me, represents \n     the ideal, the model, the paragon of excellence as a \n     chairman.\n       Unusual among authorization committees in the Senate, he \n     produced, from 1987 through 1994, eight straight \n     authorization acts, each of which continued major initiatives \n     to build a better managed, sounder Department of Defense. He \n     was the key figure behind the so-called Goldwater-Nichols \n     Reorganization Act, which decentralized power in the armed \n     services, giving more on-the-ground authority to our unified \n     commanders in the geographic areas where they had to prepare \n     forces to fight in various contingencies. He developed the \n     legislation which produced the Defense Base Closure and \n     Realignment Commission, which cut through the political \n     snarls involved in closing bases, and has been a most \n     effective tool in downsizing the DOD establishment in a fair \n     and orderly way.\n       Over the years our uniformed leaders have consistently \n     looked to Sam Nunn as their champion, as a strong but \n     sensitive force, who empathized with their special needs and \n     could be counted on to take the kind of action appropriate to \n     best enhance the morale of the men under their command. He \n     did not fail them.\n       Perhaps some of the most creative ideas that Sam Nunn \n     willed into reality came in the knotty area of reducing the \n     quantum of danger in the Russian-American relationship. He \n     championed, together with John Warner, programs to increase \n     communication between the American and Russian leadership, \n     and thus reduce the possibilities of tragic, accidental \n     nuclear war. Together with Richard Lugar, he crafted a \n     successful program to dismantle nuclear weapons possessed by \n     the states of the former Soviet Union. He led the Senate Arms \n     Control Observer Group for many years, as my appointee to \n     that group when I was Majority Leader, traveling frequently \n     to Geneva, leading delegations of Senators to ensure that \n     progress on the INF and START Treaties had the knowledge and \n     support of the United States Senate. He traveled extensively \n     to Russia, and in turn Russian legislative leaders traveled \n     to the United States, to exchange views and develop \n     cooperative solutions to problems, thereby increasing the \n     level of confidence and understanding between these two \n     superpowers. Lately he has developed additional initiatives, \n     again with a leading Republican counterpart, Senator \n     Domenici, to tackle the problem of terrorist actions against \n     the United States. All in all, Sam Nunn, when he leaves this \n     Chamber and walks out of this door for the last time as a \n     Member of this body, can take immense pride in his long, \n     intense and patient efforts in the superpower relations \n     arena. Those hard-won initiatives have had a substantial \n     impact on the measure of safety in our world. It is indeed no \n     exaggeration to say that the world today is a safer place in \n     part because of the monumental efforts of one man, the senior \n     Senator from the State of Georgia--Sam Nunn.\n       These achievements and the quality of his dedication and \n     work on defense, alliance and international issues, ranging \n     from NATO to arms control and reduction, anti-terrorism, and \n     joint U.S.-Russian threat reduction and communications \n     measures have propelled his glorious reputation far beyond \n     the Senate. He is known internationally and he is viewed \n     universally as an expert in the defense field. He is well \n     known in official circles around the globe and is widely \n     sought for his wise counsel.\n       Is it not remarkable that in my time there would have been \n     two chairmen of the Senate Armed Services Committee, two \n     ``tall men, who lived above the fog in public duty and in \n     private thinking''--Senator Richard Russell and Senator \n     Samuel Nunn--both experts in the field of national defense. \n     Both of whom sought for their wise counsel,--sought out on \n     this floor,--sought out before the bar of the Senate, in the \n     well, sought out in foreign capitals for their wise counsel.\n       It is not an overstatement to say Sam Nunn's reach and \n     impact have been international and characterized by workable, \n     sound proposals and brilliant judgment. The global scope of \n     his work has set him apart from the vast majority of men who \n     have served in this body and is a testimony to his dedication \n     to the addressing of the burning issues of sanity and order \n     in our world today.\n       While Sam Nunn will undoubtedly be remembered for his \n     Senate service in the area\n\n[[Page S1479]]\n\n     of national defense, as if that were not enough, his energy \n     and creativity have also been evident in many other areas. \n     The range of his thinking and his talents as a legislator and \n     policy maker encompass everything from health care, to \n     student loans, to insurance industry reform. In his farewell \n     address, announcing his retirement, in Georgia on October 9, \n     1995, he dwelled extensively on the need for America to put \n     our youth first, to work on protecting our children from \n     street violence and drugs. He spoke eloquently of the need to \n     reverse the saturation of our TV airwaves with programs of \n     sex and violence. He focused on the need to reinvigorate our \n     educational system in order to reincorporate great numbers of \n     American citizens back into the working culture of our \n     nation. He has developed successful legislation to lay the \n     groundwork for a nationwide ``civilian service corps'' by \n     offering education benefits in exchange for public service. \n     As the cochairman of the Strengthening of America Commission, \n     a bipartisan group of business, educational, labor and \n     academic leaders, he has proposed an impressive plan to make \n     radical changes in the income tax code to refocus our economy \n     on savings and investment and away from consumption.\n       Most importantly, and as my fellow Senators well know, Sam \n     Nunn's success is in large part attributable to his hard rock \n     integrity.\n       A religious man, he does not go around wearing his religion \n     on his sleeve; he does not go around making a big whoop-de-do \n     about his religion, but he is a religious man, a moral man. \n     Sam Nunn is known as a man whose judgment can be trusted. How \n     many times have I heard Senators come to the Senate floor to \n     vote on a measure and ask: ``How is Sam voting on this one?'' \n     He is a leader in this body, in spite of the fact that he has \n     not especially sought to lead. He has not been elected to a \n     leadership position, but he has grown into a leadership \n     position. He is a natural leader. His is the best type of \n     leadership, because it is a leadership that is born of strong \n     character. Horace Greeley said: ``Fame is a vapor; popularity \n     an accident; riches take wings. Those who cheer today, may \n     curse tomorrow. Only one thing endures: character.''\n       Sam Nunn epitomizes that great trait, character. The Senate \n     will feel the loss of Sam Nunn and feel it deeply. His legacy \n     and achievements certainly will grow with time. I am \n     personally deeply sorry that he has chosen to go. He will \n     leave an empty place in the Senate.\n       Napoleon rejoiced that the ``bravest of the brave,'' \n     Marshal Ney, had escaped and had returned across the Dnieper \n     River, even though he had lost all of his cannons. Napoleon \n     ordered that there be a salute to celebrate the escape and \n     the return of Ney. And he said, ``I have more than 400 \n     million francs in the cellar of the Tuileries in Paris, and I \n     would have gladly given them all for the ransom of my old \n     companion in arms.''\n       Had Sam Nunn been an officer in the Grand Army of France, \n     Napoleon would have given everything he possessed for another \n     Sam Nunn.\n       His great natural talents will continue to bring him to the \n     forefront of the national policy discussion, and he will, I \n     know, continue to achieve great things in a variety of new \n     settings.\n       I have never really felt about a man in the Senate--other \n     than Senator Richard Russell--as I have felt about Sam Nunn. \n     I was the majority whip in the Senate when Sam Nunn came to \n     the Senate, and I urged that he be placed on the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee. As a member of the Steering Committee, I \n     cast my vote to put Sam Nunn on that committee. That is where \n     he wanted to serve. I watched him grow. I have had some \n     differences, from time to time--minor, of course--with Sam on \n     some issues. That is not the point. Sam has fulfilled my idea \n     of what a Senator ought to be.\n       There were 74 delegates chosen to attend the Constitutional \n     Convention. The Convention met behind closed doors from May \n     25 to September 17, 1787. Fifty-five of those 74 delegates \n     who were chosen participated, and 39 of the 74 signed the \n     Constitution of the United States. I can see in my mind's eye \n     a Sam Nunn in that gallery. I might well imagine that, as \n     they met from day to day, if Sam Nunn had been a participant, \n     they would have come, as they come here when Members of this \n     body gather in the well, and asked, ``What does Sam Nunn \n     think about this?'' I have no difficulty in imagining that. \n     In such an august gathering as was that Convention, which sat \n     in 1787, with George Washington, the Commander in Chief at \n     Valley Forge and the soon-to-be first President of the United \n     States, I can imagine that it would have been the same there. \n     They would have said, ``What does Sam Nunn think? How is he \n     going to vote?''\n       The First Congress was to have convened on March 4, 1789. \n     And only 8 Senators--less than a quorum--of the 22 were there \n     on March 4, 1789. Five States were represented--New \n     Hampshire, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and \n     Georgia. And the Senator from Georgia who attended that day \n     was William Few.\n       It could very well have been Sam Nunn as a Member of that \n     first Senate, serving with Oliver Ellsworth, Maclay and \n     Morris, and others. And as they met to blaze the pioneer \n     paths of this new legislative body, the U.S. Senate, I have \n     no problem in imagining that, often, those men would have \n     turned to Sam Nunn and said, ``How are you going to vote, \n     Sam?'' ``How is Sam going to vote?''\n       I think every Member of this body shares with me that \n     feeling about Sam Nunn. He could have been an outstanding \n     U.S. Senator at any time in the history of this Republic--not \n     this democracy. When the Convention completed its work, a \n     lady approached Benjamin Franklin and said, ``Dr. Franklin, \n     what have you given us?'' He didn't answer, ``A democracy, \n     Madam.'' He said, ``A republic, Madam, if you can keep it.''\n       Now, what is there about Sam Nunn that makes him this kind \n     of man? He is not the typical politician that one conjures up \n     in his mind when thinking about Senators and other \n     politicians. Senator Nunn is not glib. He doesn't jump to \n     hasty conclusions.\n       He does not rush to be ahead of all of the other Senators \n     so that he will get the first headline. He thinks about the \n     problem, and he logically, methodically, and systematically \n     arrives at a decision. Then he carefully prepares to put that \n     decision into action.\n       I suppose that had he lived at the time of Socrates, who \n     lived during the chaos of the great Peloponnesian wars, Sam \n     would have been out there in the marketplace debating with \n     Socrates, about whom Cicero said he ``brought down philosophy \n     from Heaven to Earth.'' Sam would have been a hard man for \n     Socrates to put down because he has that talent, that knack \n     of thinking, an organized thinking, and the consideration of \n     a matter logically, carefully, and thoroughly. He is truly a \n     man for all seasons. His wisdom, his judgment, and his \n     statesmanship have reflected well on the profession of public \n     service at a time when fierce ``take-no-prisoners politics'' \n     has embroiled the Nation to alarming degrees.\n       Napoleon did not elect to go into Spain, and Wellington was \n     concerned that Napoleon himself might lead. Wellington later \n     told Earl Stanhope that Napoleon was superior to all of his \n     marshals and that his presence on the field was like 40,000 \n     men in the balance. Sam Nunn, the 1,668th Senator to appear \n     on this legislative field of battle, is like having a great \n     number in array against or for your position.\n       I was looking just this morning over the names of those \n     Senators who are leaving, and examining their votes on what \n     is called pejoratively the Legislative Line-Item Veto Act of \n     1995. Of those Senators who are leaving, seven voted against \n     that colossal monstrosity, for which many of those who voted \n     will come to be sorry. If this President is reelected, he \n     will have it within his power to make them sorry. He is just \n     the man who might do it.\n       Among the departing Senators, Sam Nunn is one of those who \n     opposed that bill. Senator Heflin, Senator Johnston, Senator \n     Pell, Senator Pryor, Senator Cohen, Senator Hatfield, and \n     Senator Nunn voted, to their everlasting honor, against that \n     miserable piece of junk.\n       Just wait until this President exercises that veto and see \n     how they come to heel--h-e-e-l. They will rue the day. But \n     Sam Nunn voted against it.\n       For the outstanding quality of his character as well as for \n     the brilliance of his service, this Senate and the Nation are \n     eternally in his debt. He will always command, in my heart \n     and in my memory, a place with Senator Richard Russell.\n\n     God, give us men. A time like this demands\n     Strong minds, great hearts, true faith, and ready hands;\n     Men whom the lust of office does not kill;\n     Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy;\n     Men who possess opinions and a will;\n     Men who have honor; men who will not lie;\n     Men who can stand before a demagog\n     And damn his treacherous flatteries without winking.\n     Tall men, sun-crowned, who live above the fog\n     In public duty and in private thinking;\n     For while the rabble, with their thumb-worn creeds,\n     Their large professions and their little deeds,\n     Mingle in selfish strife, lo. Freedom weeps,\n     Wrong rules the land and waiting justice sleeps.\n     God give us men.\n     Men who serve not for selfish booty,\n     But real men, courageous, who flinch not at duty.\n

Mr. President, I rise today to report to the \nSenate on an official trip I took with a House Ways and Means Committee \ndelegation in December 1996 to Hong Kong, Beijing, and Singapore. I was \nprivileged to be the only United States Senator to serve as an official \ndelegate to the first ministerial meeting of the World Trade \nOrganization.\n  The WTO was formed by the Uruguay Round Agreement, ratified by \nCongress in 1994, and is the successor to the General Agreements on \nTariffs and Trade. It serves as a forum for multilateral trade \nnegotiations and a dispute settlement body. The first ministerial was \ncalled to measure progress on the implementation of Uruguay round \ncommitments and seek further liberalization in selected areas of trade. \nAlthough I discuss the various meetings of the delegation in Hong Kong \nand Beijing, this report will focus on our meetings in Singapore.\n\n\n                        Friday, December 6, 1996\n\n  Upon arriving in Hong Kong, the delegation met with U.S. Consul \nGeneral Richard Boucher and several Hong Kong business and government \nofficials. The primary topic of discussion was Hong Kong's transition \nto Chinese control on July 1, 1997.\n\n\n                       Saturday, December 7, 1996\n\n  On Saturday, the delegation met with representatives of the American \nChamber of Commerce of Hong Kong. The upcoming transition was again \ndiscussed as was the annual debate in the Congress on China's most-\nfavored-nation status.\n\n\n                        Monday, December 9, 1996\n\n  On the first day of the ministerial, the delegation was briefed by \nActing U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and Federal \nCommunications Commission Chairman Reed Hunt. Ms. Barshefsky stressed \nthe importance of completing negotiations on the Information Technology \nAgreement while in Singapore. She believed that an agreement was \nimminent but sought our support when discussing the ITA with other \ncountries, delegations.\n  The delegation asked Ms. Barshefsky about the negotiations to bring \nChina into the WTO. I stressed the need for China to open its markets \nfor U.S. agricultural products and to reduce the authority of its state \ntrading enterprises. Ms. Barshefsky stressed three points relating to \nChina's entry into the WTO. First, China must remedy its bilateral \nproblems with the United States, especially on agriculture and \nintellectual property rights. China must increase market access to U.S. \nagricultural exports. Finally, China must abide by the decisions and \npolicies of a rules-based system, the WTO.\n  Mr. Hunt briefed the delegation on the telecommunications \nnegotiations. Mr. Hunt said that the focus in these talks will be on \nderegulation in order to open the global communications industry to \nforeign competition. Since the United States has one of the most open \nmarkets, our companies have the most to gain by liberalizing trade in \nthis area.\n\n\n                       Tuesday December 10, 1996\n\n  On Tuesday morning, I broke from the delegation for breakfast with \nDeputy Secretary Richard Rominger and the Administrator of the Foreign \nAgriculture Service, Gus Schumacher, both with the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture. We discussed our current bilateral trade \ndisputes with the European Union, primarily with Bt corn and the \nveterinary equivalency standards.\n  At the time, the EU was deciding whether to accept Bt corn, a \ngenetically modified organism, exported from the U.S. Failure to accept \nthis product would have jeopardized all of our corn exports to Europe. \nSubsequent to the Singapore meeting, the EU decided to allow Bt corn \ninto its markets.\n  The second issue, unfortunately, has yet to be resolved. The EU has \nfailed to certify most U.S. meat packing plants for export to Europe. \nThis failure will jeopardize current exports, such as pet food, as well \nas potential sales of beef and pork. The issue was to be resolved in \nDecember but a decision has now been delayed until April.\n  Because of the EU's actions, I have introduced a bill with the \nminority leader, Senator Daschle, to address the situation. S. 220 \nrequires the U.S. Trade Representative to determine whether the \nEuropean Union's action violates any trade agreements, including the \n1992 meat agreement and the sanitary/phytosanitary provisions of the \nUruguay Round Agreement. If agreements have been breached, USTR is \nrequired to take some action, which could include unilateral sanctions. \nI urge the European Union to remedy this situation before sanctions are \nnecessary.\n  I rejoined the delegation to meet with Singapore Minister of Trade \nand Industry Yeo Cheow Tong. The delegation thanked the minister for \nhis nation's hospitality and leadership at the ministerial. We \nimpressed upon him the need to consummate the Information Technology \nAgreement in order to make the ministerial a success. I urged Minister \nYeo, in his leadership role at\n\n[[Page S1482]]\n\nthe conference, to assist the United States in resolving the veterinary \nequivalency issue with the Europeans. This was appropriate because \nSingapore recognizes the equivalency of the United States meat \ninspection system as it transships United States meat to other Asian \nnations.\n  We also met with the Canadian delegation. Talks focused on several \nbilateral issues with our two nations, including the recent NAFTA panel \non dairy and poultry and the U.S. sugar program. I also asked the \nCanadians opinion on two issues: China's accession to the WTO and the \ndispute on veterinary equivalency between the United States and the EU. \nThe Canadian delegation agreed fully with my position on China. \nSpecifically, they said that WTO members should not lower entry \nstandards for China and that market access and subsidy issue must be \naddressed before China is admitted.\n  Regarding the veterinary equivalency issue, the Canadian delegation \nagreed that sanitary and phytosanitary provisions of trade agreements \nmust be upheld in order to maintain the grassroots support of farmers \nfor free trade agreements.\n  On Tuesday, the delegation also met with delegations from Taiwan and \nthe European Parliament, and had the opportunity to express our \ngratitude to the Prime Minister of Singapore for his nation's \nhospitality.\n  The Taiwanese expressed their strong desire to join the WTO. Chairman \nPhil Crane, speaking for the delegation, agreed that Taiwan was close \nto meeting the requirements for joining the WTO. But he urged Taiwan to \nbe patient while the United States worked through some of its problems \nwith China. I cautioned the Taiwanese that further progress must be \nmade on reducing barriers for agricultural products, such as beef, \npork, and poultry. The leader of the Taiwan Parliament, Mr. Vincent \nSlew, responded that he did not ``see any problem'' with making the \nnecessary agricultural reforms.\n  The discussions with the European Parliamentary delegation focused on \nthree issues: Bt corn, veterinary equivalency, and allowing China into \nthe WTO. I raised questions about the EU's potentially keeping Bt corn \nand other genetically modified organisms from their markets. The \nEuropean delegation argued that their citizens have an intense distrust \nof the scientific evidence and government policy because of the recent \nBSE--mad cow disease--crisis in Europe.\n  They pointed out that 80 percent of their consumers are against \nbringing Bt corn into their country and they would consider keeping all \nU.S. corn out in order to protect their consumers. At least, the \nEuropeans argued, they would require separation and labeling of Bt \ncorn. As I stated earlier, this issue has since been resolved and Bt \ncorn grown in the United States has been accepted in the European \nmarkets.\n  The European delegation promised to look into the veterinary \nequivalency problem and thought we could make progress in certifying \nUnited States meat packing plants. On China, I argued that if the \nEuropeans are truly concerned with their farmers, they should insist \nthat China enter the WTO only on commercially meaningful terms. The \nEuropean delegation agreed, saying that China must meet all \nrequirements, including those on market access, before joining the WTO.\n\n\n                      Wednesday, December 11, 1996\n\n  On Wednesday, the delegation received a full briefing from acting \nUSTR Charlene Barshefsky. She discussed the Statement on Agriculture, \noutstanding bilateral issues with the European Union, and China's \ndesire to enter the WTO. I pointed out that the terms of China's \naccession will determine whether China becomes our largest export \nmarket for agriculture products or our toughest competitor. To \nemphasize the importance of agriculture to trade agreements, I also \nnoted that one-half of the nongovernmental observers at the ministerial \nwere from the agriculture sector.\n  The delegation also met with United States Ambassador to Singapore, \nMr. Chorba, and Singapore Foreign Minister Jayakumar. I asked Minister \nJayakumar to help bring the other Asian nations on board with the \nInformation Technology Agreement. The minister replied that they shared \nthe United States interest in completing the ITA in Singapore and they \nwould do what they can to accomplish that.\n\n\n                      Thursday, December 12, 1996\n\n  On Thursday, the delegation met with United States Assistant \nSecretary of State Alan Larson to discuss the recent trip of Secretary \nof State Christopher to China.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak once again \non the matter of corporate average fuel economy\n\n[[Page S1483]]\n\nstandards. Recently, a number of colleagues from both sides of the \naisle joined with me to introduce Senate bill 286, legislation to \nfreeze CAFE standards at current levels unless changed by Congress.\n  There are a host of reasons why this legislation should be adopted, \nMr. President. Chief among these: CAFE standards should be frozen so \nthat we may put a stop to the highly inappropriate practice of allowing \nunelected bureaucrats to set far-reaching policies that have \nsignificant effects on the safety and economic well-being of the \nAmerican people. I believe that such responsibility should lie with \nthis legislature, the body entrusted by our Constitution with the duty \nto determine whether any proposed policy change is in the best \ninterests of the American people.\n  Mr. President, in today's Washington Times commentary section, Bruce \nBartlett, a senior fellow with the National Center for Policy Analysis, \noutlines several serious problems with increased CAFE standards. Mr. \nBartlett's article illustrates clearly the need for Congress to regain \ncontrol of CAFE standards and I ask that this article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Feb. 24, 1997]\n\n                     Hidden Costs of the CAFE Caper\n\n                          (By Bruce Bartlett)\n\n       In 1975, at the height of the energy crisis, Congress \n     passed legislation mandating auto manufacturers to meet \n     corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. Each auto \n     company was expected to ensure that the average fuel \n     efficiency for all its new car sales would be at least 18 mpg \n     by 1978. The standard was raised in steps to 27.5 mpg by \n     1990, where it remains currently. However, the Clinton \n     administration has signaled a desire to raise the CAFE \n     standard, despite mounting evidence that the whole program \n     has been a failure.\n       The biggest problem with CAFE is that there is virtually no \n     evidence it has reduced aggregate gasoline consumption. It is \n     true that auto fuel efficiency has risen 70 percent since \n     1973, from 13.3 mpg on average to 22.56 mpg in 1995. However, \n     as the figure indicates, the higher fuel efficiency has \n     simply encouraged people to drive more. The average number of \n     miles driven per year has risen 24 percent since 1980, from \n     9,141 miles to 11,329 in 1995. Thus, even though the average \n     use now uses just 502 gallons of gasoline per year, compared \n     to 771 gallons in 1973, total fuel consumption has continued \n     to rise.\n       Another problem with CAFE is that it has led to a loss of \n     auto jobs in the U.S. The reason is that there are separate \n     CAFE standards for domestic and imported autos. This has \n     encouraged domestic auto companies to increase the percentage \n     of foreign parts used in some of their models in order to \n     reclassify them as foreign-made. For example, in 1989 Ford \n     turned two of its least fuel efficiency cars, the Crown \n     Victoria and the Grand Marquis, into ``imported'' cars by \n     reducing their domestic content from 90 percent to less than \n     75 percent. This allowed Ford to increase the average fuel \n     economy of its domestically produced cars, where it was \n     having a problem meeting the new CAFE standard, while \n     lowering the average for its imported models, where it had \n     room to spare.\n       Finally, there is growing evidence that CAFE has been \n     detrimental to safety. To increase fuel efficiency, auto \n     companies have had to produce smaller, lighter cars that are \n     less safe than larger, heavier cars. And auto companies have \n     often had to heavily discount these smaller models in order \n     to increase their sales and lower their average corporate \n     fuel economy. Thus a 1989 study estimated that CAFE standards \n     would cost 2,200 to 3,900 lives over the next 10 years.\n       Virtually all economists agree that higher gasoline taxes \n     would do a far better job of reducing gasoline consumption \n     than CAFE--assuming there is any real need to do so. At a \n     minimum, there should be no further increase in CAFE \n     standards.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/24/senate-section/article/S1482-3", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO COLIN RIZZIO FOR REVEALING A SAT ERROR\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Colin Rizzio for his outstanding math expertise, which led \nhim to uncover an error on the SAT exams. His quick insight has gained \nmuch national recognition in the last few weeks including an appearance \non ``Good Morning America'' and on the ``Today'' show. Colin is a 17-\nyear-old senior at Contoocook Valley Regional High School in New \nHampshire. He is an above-average student who kept a cool head under \ntesting conditions. Colin discovered an error which had been overlooked \nby internal and external math specialists while he was taking the SAT \nlast Columbus Day. He took the time to consider different possibilities \nthe math question offered and revealed the error. Thanks to Colin, the \ntest will now be rescored and students' scores will go up nationwide as \nthe flawed math question has been tossed out.\n  As a former teacher, I am always heartened by stories of students who \ngo the extra mile for educational integrity. Colin is the type of \nstudent who asks ``What if?'' In this case, his inquisitive nature \ngained him much notoriety.\n  It is students like Colin that contribute to the future of the \nGranite State and I am proud to be his Senator. I congratulate Colin on \nhis outstanding achievement and I wish this exemplary student all the \nbest for his future educational endeavors. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/24/senate-section/article/S1483-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1483-S1485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NARCOTICS CERTIFICATION\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I wish to discuss an important \ndecision facing the President this week in the fight against drug \ntrafficking: Whether to certify that Mexico and Colombia have taken \nsufficient steps in the past year in combating the narcotics trade. The \nchoice is important not merely because it affects our bilateral \nrelations with these countries, but also because it will send a broader \nsignal about our seriousness of purpose in the war on drugs.\n  Of course, there will be other nations whose performance on \ncounternarcotics will be assessed by the President this week. But when \nit comes to the narcotics trade, Mexico and Colombia are in a league by \nthemselves--Colombia, as the leading source country for cocaine, and a \nmajor source of heroin, and Mexico, as the leading transit country for \ncocaine, and as a significant source for heroin, methamphetamines, and \nmarijuana. And it is because of their predominance in the narcotics \ntrade that the President's decision becomes a barometer of the U.S. \ncommitment to this effort.\n  Before discussing my specific views on the Colombian and Mexican \ncases, however, I want to briefly offer some general observations about \nthe drug certification process.\n  Just over 10 years ago, in the 1986 omnibus drug bill, the United \nStates began a process of annually certifying the performance of \ncountries which were either a major source of narcotics, or a major \ntransit route for narcotics trafficking. Decertification does not \nmerely carry a stamp of political disapproval. By law, nations \ndecertified are ineligible for most U.S. foreign aid, and the United \nStates is required to vote against loans for such nations in \ninternational financial institutions such as the World Bank.\n  The President has three choices: First, he can certify that a country \nis fully cooperating with the United States, or is taking adequate \nsteps on its own, to combat the narcotics trade. Second, he can \ndecertify a country--a statement that it has not met that standard. \nFinally, he can provide a national interest waiver--a statement that \nthe country has not met the standards of the law, but that the U.S. \nnational interest lies in continuing the assistance programs.\n  Not surprisingly, the nations subject to the scrutiny of the \ndecertification process have not been thrilled with the honor. Indeed, \nmany nations have protested that the United States has no right to \nchallenge their performance on counternarcotics--given that the large \ndemand in this country helps to generate the supply. Other nations \nperceive the certification process as an effort to shift the blame for \nour drug problem.\n  I firmly reject such arguments.\n  First, while I concede that the demand in the United States for \nnarcotics has contributed to the explosive growth of the drug trade in \nLatin America in the last two decades, the dramatic increase in the \npower of the narcotics cartels--particularly in Colombia and Mexico--\ncannot be blamed upon the United States alone. The nations themselves \nmust bear responsibility for their own neglect--for failing to take \neffective action against vast criminal enterprises which arose before \ntheir eyes.\n  Of course, the United States must do its part to combat the drug \nproblem. Over the past decade, we have. For example, we have steadily \nincreased both our financial resources and our political commitment to \ncombating the narcotics trade. We now spend $16 billion annually on our \nnational drug program, as compared to $4.7 billion a decade ago. We \nhave devised a national\n\n[[Page S1484]]\n\nstrategy, written by a drug czar who coordinates national policy from \nthe White House. We have increased sentences at the Federal level for \nnarcotics traffickers. We have strengthened controls on money \nlaundering and the trade in precursor chemicals. There is more to be \ndone. But by any objective measure, the United States continues to do \nits part.\n  Second, I strongly disagree with the suggestion that the United \nStates has no business assessing the performance of other nations in \nthe drug war. The decision by the United States to maintain a \npartnership with another government--any government--must be based on \nan assessment of whether the cooperation between the two sides advances \nAmerican interests. This is hardly a radical concept; rather, it is the \ndaily practice of diplomacy.\n  The people of the United States should expect nothing less. How else \ncan we justify providing the full benefits of partnership--including \nforeign assistance and special trade preferences--unless we are \nsatisfied that the other nation is doing its part on issues of great \nconcern to us?\n  After a decade of experience with the certification law, we can reach \na conclusion about its utility--and whether it is worth preserving. I \nbelieve a strong case can be made that it should be.\n  In the first few years after enactment of the law, the certification \nprocess, it is fair to say, was less than effective. It was the custom \nof the Reagan and Bush administrations to only decertify those nations \nwith which our relations were already badly damaged. In other words, \nthe primary focus was not on narcotics performance but on geopolitics.\n  Thus, in the late 1980's, the nations regularly decertified were \nSyria and Iran--both on the list of state sponsors of terrorism; \nAfghanistan, then a satellite of the Soviet Union; and Panama, then \nunder the control of General Noriega. In the Bush administration, after \nthe U.S invasion ousted Noriega, Panama again was certified, and the \nnation of Burma--by then under the control of despotic generals--was \nadded to this list of usual suspects. But not once did either President \nReagan or Bush decertify a democratic ally.\n  The message of this action was clear: Maintaining normal diplomatic \nrelations took precedence over our anti-narcotics interests. As a \nresult, most nations that were major drug trafficking centers came to \nexpect that certification would be the norm--and that for all the talk \nand supposed pressure from Washington, they would not pay a price if \nthey failed to meet our expectations.\n  Under President Clinton, that approach has changed for the better--\nand for that change much credit must go not only to the President, but \nalso to the previous Secretary of State, Warren Christopher. Most \nsignificantly, last year President Clinton decertified Colombia--a \ndemocratic nation which had, for much of the 1990's, been a close \npartner in the war on drugs. But when it became clear that the \nPresident of Colombia had taken campaign contributions from drug \ndealers--a matter that I will discuss shortly--and that his government \nlacked the political will to confront the drug trade, President Clinton \nstated plainly that Colombia had not met the standard of the law.\n  That decision has profound implications elsewhere. Nations everywhere \ntook notice--and are now on notice that the United States would make \nits decision on certification based on the standards of the law, not on \nthe dictates of diplomacy. That, in turn, has greatly empowered the \nState Department and the law enforcement agencies--which now have \ngreater leverage in holding our foreign partners to their \ncounternarcotics commitments.\n  In sum, because of the ``truth-in-certification'' which we now \npractice, I believe that the process has become a useful tool in our \nongoing effort to procure the assistance of other nations in the war on \ndrugs. Any effort to repeal the law or alter it significantly would be \nmisguided.\n  That is not to say the law is perfect--few laws are. During \nconsideration of the foreign assistance legislation in the Foreign \nRelations Committee, I will be open to exploring ways of improving the \ncertification process--to assure that the law advances our common \nobjective: of ensuring that all nations join us in fighting the scourge \nof drugs.\n\n  But that question is for another day. Today our primary attention \nmust be devoted to the issue at hand: whether to certify that Colombia \nand Mexico have met the standard of the law. I renew my call--which I \nalso made last year--to decertify Colombia and to not fully certify \nMexico, but instead grant a national interest waiver.\n  As has been widely reported, credible evidence suggests that \nColombian President Ernesto Samper accepted millions of dollars in \ncampaign contributions from the Cali cartel during the 1994 \nPresidential campaign. An investigation by the Colombian Congress--an \ninvestigation which our State Department has described as a ``patently \nflawed process''--absolved Samper. But the conclusion of the Congress \nis not surprising, because many members of that body are also under \ninvestigation for accepting bribes from the cartel.\n  President Samper might have overcome the stain of these allegations \nby taking concrete action to combat the drug trade. In fact, Samper had \npledged such action in a letter to many members of this body in July \n1994. But Samper's pledge proved to be, in large part, an empty \ngesture.\n  For example, long-promised reform of the sentencing system--which \nprovides inadequate penalties for drug trafficking--has not been \nenacted, although the Colombian Congress is just now taking up the \nissue. The inadequacy of the current system was amply demonstrated last \nmonth, when two noted leaders of the Cali cartel were sentenced to \nrelatively light sentences--10\\1/2\\ years in one case, 9 years in \nanother. They were fined just $2 million. None of their assets were \nforfeited. Under the sentencing system in effect, the actual time \nserved may be reduced by half. Worse still, the evidence is strong that \nthey continue to operate their empires from prison--operations which \nthe Colombian Government has done little to prevent.\n  Other measures, such as reconsideration of extradition or \nstrengthening the Colombian money laundering statute, might have \npermitted the certification of Colombia. But extradition is not on the \ntable; and the money laundering statute is only now being considered in \na special session--a transparent last-ditch effort to head off \ndecertification.\n  I say all this in full knowledge that there are thousands of \ndedicated officials in the Colombian National Police, and millions of \nordinary Colombian citizens, who abhor the destructive nature of the \ndrug trade on their own society, and are fully committed to combating \nit. I admire their courage and determination to fight on, despite the \ndangers of confronting the drug lords, who have no respect for human \nlife.\n  But how can we be assured of the Government's commitment against drug \ntrafficking when the President of the country himself almost surely \nbenefited from the drug trade?\n  This must be an essential consideration in any certification \ndecision: whether there exists corruption at high levels of government. \nWe cannot demand perfection in implementation of policy. We cannot \nimpose impossibly high burdens. But we can demand that the highest \nlevels of government remain free from suspicion.\n  Colombia has failed that test. Stated plainly, the corruption at the \ntop in Bogota is the single most glaring failure in Colombia's \nperformance--and the overriding reason that I recommend \ndecertification.\n  Mr. President, there is no joy in this conclusion. But we cannot \noverlook the corruption involving President Samper and the Congress, \nand we cannot avoid the conclusion that Colombia has not done enough to \ncombat the drug trade.\n  The story for Mexico is different than Colombia's. The key difference \nis the commitment of the President of Mexico, who I believe is \nsteadfast in his determination to root out corruption in the Mexican \npolice system. Unfortunately, his personal commitment has, thus far, \nbeen insufficient to cleanse a police system that is rotten to the \ncore.\n\n  The examples of police corruption in Mexico abound. The most \ntroubling example was revealed just last week. A veteran general of the \nMexican Army, a man hired just 3 months ago to head\n\n[[Page S1485]]\n\nMexico's antinarcotics agency--precisely because he was believed to be \nincorruptible--was fired after being accused of taking payments from \none of Mexico's leading drug barons.\n  The arrest of General Gutierrez raises several important questions \nabout the United States-Mexican relationship in fighting the drug war. \nFirst, why did Mexico fail to alert us when it first suspected General \nGutierrez some 2 weeks before his arrest? As a consequence, how much \nintelligence did the United States share in that 2-week period with \nMexico that has now been compromised? Additionally, why did our \nintelligence assets fail to learn that the general had been placed \nunder investigation? Finally, will we be able, in the short term, to \ncontinue cooperative law enforcement efforts--or will we have to step \nback and reassess the level and scope of our joint programs?\n  Mr. President, we must have answers to these questions--both from our \nGovernment and from the Mexican Government.\n  But until we get those answers, and until we see follow through by \nthe Mexican Government on certain promises, I do not believe that we \nshould certify that Mexico has provided full cooperation in the war on \ndrugs. Instead, however, I do believe that the President would be \njustified in granting Mexico a vital national interest waiver. That \ndecision--less than full certification--would send a strong political \nsignal to the Mexican Government that its performance last year was \ninadequate, without causing a total disruption in our joint efforts.\n  In making this recommendation, I should note that Mexico has made \nsome progress in its effort to combat the narcotics trade. Last year, \nat our urging, it enacted several important anticrime laws--an \norganized crime law, a money laundering statute, and a chemical \ndiversion statute. It has agreed to extradite, under exceptional \ncircumstances, Mexican nationals. It has agreed to set up organized \ncrime task forces in key locations in northern and western Mexico.\n  All this is important. But, as the saying goes, the proof is in the \npudding. We have seen only a handful of extraditions. We await \nimplementation of the new anticrime laws. And we await full funding and \nadequate support for the task forces.\n  Most important, we must see institutional changes to root out \ncorruption--for that remains the largest obstacle to combating the drug \ncartels. All the laws, all the promises, all the task forces will be \ninsufficient if Mexico cannot rectify the systemic corruption in its \nlaw enforcement agencies. Mexico's efforts to confront corruption, \nultimately, will be the test of whether it is serious in combating the \nnarcotics trade.\n  Let me reiterate that I believe that, in contrast to the case of \nColombia, Mexico has a President who is on our side. President Zedillo \nhas demonstrated great courage in advancing an agenda of institutional \nreform and in trying to weed out corrupt actors in his government. We \nmust stand with him in this effort. But we must also be honest about \nthe situation as we now see it --and honesty compels the conclusion \nthat Mexico should not be fully certified.\n  But I do not believe that we should take the step of decertifying \nMexico. President Zedillo's demonstrated leadership amid the growing \ndrug threat is the fundamental reason I propose a national interest \nwaiver for Mexico. A full decertification of Mexico could have long-\nlasting, damaging repercussions that we cannot now predict. At a \nminimum, it could inhibit the political space that President \nZedillo has to press forward with his agenda of reform. And if we \ndestroy the President's political ability resolve to combat the drug \ntraffickers, we will have achieved nothing--and we may well lose the \ngains that we have recently achieved.\n\n  Even as I recommend decertification for Colombia, and a national \ninterest waiver for Mexico, I should emphasize that this issue can--\nunder the law--be revisited during the coming year as to Colombia. The \nlaw permits the President to provide a national interest waiver during \nthe course of the year provided there has been a fundamental change in \ngovernment, or a fundamental change in the conditions that led to not \nproviding a full certification in the first instance.\n  In this regard, I encourage the Clinton Administration to spell out \nbenchmarks for Colombia to achieve in the coming months --benchmarks \nthat, if achieved, would permit the President to move forward with a \nnational interest waiver.\n  Mr. President, I do not underestimate the difficulties facing \nColombia and Mexico in combating the power of the drug barons. But the \ndifficulty of the challenge cannot be an excuse for insufficient \naction. Given the massive scourge of drugs confronting us, we must \ncontinue to raise the level of expectations and attention given to the \ndrug trade by our southern neighbors. This is what the certification \nprocess calls for, and this is what our nation must do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/24/senate-section/article/S1483-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REGULATIONS REGARDING DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN PRO BONO LEGAL SERVICES\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Mr. President, 1 year ago today, Fidel Castro \nbrutally murdered Armando Alejandre, Jr., Mario de\n\n[[Page S1486]]\n\nla Pena, Carlos Costa, and Pablo Morales--three Americans and one a \nlegal U.S. resident. These men were shot down while flying on a \nhumanitarian mission over international waters between the United \nStates and Cuba.\n  This incident was the latest in Fidel Castro's reign of tyranny over \nthe people of Cuba. The unjustified downing of the two brothers to the \nrescue planes came shortly after Fidel Castro had stopped a \nprodemocracy and human rights meeting in Havana. Dozens of prodemocracy \nCubans were arrested, detained, and harassed. Just the year before, on \nMarch 13, 1994, a tugboat brimming with freedom-seeking Cubans headed \nfor America was rammed by Castro's government ships until it sank. Some \n40 people died, only because they yearned to be free. Year after year, \nFidel Castro's Cuba tightens the stranglehold it has on basic political \nand economic freedom.\n  To those who believe in the cause of Cuban freedom--in libertad--it \nis unfortunate that it took an act of such callous disregard for human \nlife and freedom to get the world to pay attention to Fidel Castro's \nrepression of the Cuban people.\n  As we honor the memory of the downed pilots today, we should take \ntime to reflect upon the current state of United States policy toward \nCuba. We must ask ourselves--are we doing everything we can to isolate \nFidel and to save the Cuban people from the jaws of tyranny? I believe \nthe answer is, unequivocally, no.\n  After the attack on the American pilots, President Clinton appeared \nto reverse his policy of appeasement toward Fidel Castro by signing the \nHelms-Burton legislation. Unfortunately, the administration's actions \nsince the signing have been weaker than the President's rhetoric.\n  First, the President has failed to stand firm in the defense of \nfreedom--not once, but twice. He has chosen to protect the interests of \nforeign companies over the cause of Cuban freedom by postponing \nimplementation of a key part of the Helms-Burton law. He has \nunilaterally placed a moratorium on the right of U.S. citizens to sue \nforeign companies that profit from property those citizens owned before \nFidel Castro stole it.\n  Second, after the downing of the brothers to the rescue aircraft, \nPresident Clinton promised compensation to the families of the victims \nand criminal indictments against those in Cuba responsible for the \nmurders. On March 7, 1996, then-Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, along \nwith myself and Representatives Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-\nLehtinen sent a letter to President Clinton urging him to ``immediately \ndirect the Attorney General to seek the indictment of all those \nresponsible for the heinous crime of February 24, 1996.'' Now a year \nlater, the families still have not been fully compensated and the Cuban \nofficials who committed these murders are still free.\n  For the sake of the people of Cuba, Mr. President, the United States \ncannot waiver in its commitment to bringing an end to Castro's rule. If \nwe demand of other nations that they not do business with the Castro \ngovernment, then we must demand of ourselves a steadfast policy of \nconcrete action, not just empty words.\n  America must do everything we can to bring freedom and democracy to \nCuba--not just for the benefit of Cubans, but to protect the security \nof Americans.\n  Mr. President, it is with this commitment to action that I offer the \nfollowing five points to bring freedom and democracy to Cuba, and I \ncall on the President to take these steps without delay.\n  First, Fidel Castro must be exposed for what he really is--an \nauthoritarian dictator worried only about maintaining power at any \nexpense. The Cuban people have a word for this called desenmascarar, \nwhich means to remove the mask. We need to remove the mask of Fidel \nCastro as a romantic and cigar-smoking friend; he is a murderer and \ndrug trafficker; and he tortures and imprisons political dissidents.\n  Second, we must reverse our policy since 1995 of returning freedom-\nseeking Cuban refugees and political dissidents to Cuba, and promote \nthe same level of compassion among our allies and friends around the \nworld. At a time when our own State Department classifies Cuba as one \nof the greatest violators of human rights in the world, it is \nunconscionable for the President to order the return of these brave \npeople back into the hands of their oppressor. In addition, we should \nencourage our friends and allies to exhibit the same level of \ncompassion in dealing with the suffering Cuban people. We should \nfurther promote the efforts of the United Nations and the International \nCommittee for the Red Cross in gaining access to Cuba.\n  Third, we must increase our efforts to support and encourage Cuba's \nbudding civil society. This is best accomplished by increasing support \nfor pro-freedom and democracy groups through the National Endowment for \nDemocracy and other effective groups dedicated to democratic reforms.\n  Fourth, military and nuclear subsidies to Cuba must be halted. Fidel \ncurrently benefits economically from the presence of the Russian \nintelligence facility at Lourdes, Cuba. In addition, International \nAtomic Energy Agency money is being spent to maintain the Juragua \nnuclear power plant, in contradiction to current United States policy.\n  Fifth, stop the flow of drugs from Cuba. For the past several \ndecades, Cuba has served as a transhipment point for narcotics entering \nthe United States. Castro uses this drug flow as a means of acquiring \nmuch needed cash and as a weapon against the United States. High-\nranking members of the Castro government benefit from this source of \nrevenue and several are currently under indictment in the United States \non drug trafficking charges.\n  If we implement these specific actions identified in my five points \nand insist upon executing the strategy mandated by Congress in Helms-\nBurton of isolating Castro and supporting the Cuban people, we can hope \nfor a free and democratic Cuba.\n  Mr. President, I would conclude my remarks with a plea to those who \nwould appease Fidel Castro. Castro heads a government which denies \nbasic freedoms to 11 million people. Fidel Castro will not change. His \nonly interest is the perpetuation of his totalitarianism. He continues \nto force his people to work for slave wages; he denies them the freedom \nto read and speak freely, to associate freely, and to work hard and \nprofit from their effort and intellect so that their children can live \nbetter lives.\n  Over the years I have consistently said that freedom is the core of \nall human progress. Mr. President, on the anniversary of the downing of \nthe brothers to the rescue pilots, let us honor their memory by \nfulfilling their commitment--and our American commitment--to a free and \ndemocratic Cuba.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/24/senate-section/article/S1485-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1486-S1493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ETHICS\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

In any such case an absent Member's \n     vote may be announced solely for the purpose of recording the \n     Member's position and such announced votes shall not be \n     counted for or against the motion.\n       (2) On matters other than matters listed in paragraph \n     (m)(1) above, the Committee may order that the record be held \n     open for the vote of absentees or recorded proxy votes if the \n     absent Committee Member has been informed of the matter on \n     which the vote occurs and has affirmatively requested the \n     Chairman or Vice Chairman in writing that he be so recorded.\n       (3) All proxies shall be in writing, and shall be delivered \n     to the Chairman or Vice Chairman to be recorded.\n\n[[Page S1488]]\n\n       (4) Proxies shall not be considered for the purpose of \n     establishing a quorum.\n       (n) Approval of Blind Trusts and Foreign Travel Requests \n     Between Sessions and During Extended Recesses: During any \n     period in which the Senate stands in adjournment between \n     sessions of the Congress or stands in a recess scheduled to \n     extend beyond fourteen days, the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     or their designees, acting jointly, are authorized to approve \n     or disapprove blind trusts under the provision of Rule XXXIV, \n     and to approve or disapprove foreign travel requests which \n     require immediate resolution.\n       (o) Committee Use of Services or Employees of Other \n     Agencies and Departments: With the prior consent of the \n     department or agency involved, the Committee may (1) utilize \n     the services, information, or facilities of any such \n     department or agency of the Government, and (2) employ on a \n     reimbursable basis or otherwise the services of such \n     personnel of any such department or agency as it deems \n     advisable. With the consent of any other committee of the \n     Senate, or any subcommittee, the Committee may utilize the \n     facilities and the services of the staff of such other \n     committee or subcommittee whenever the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman of the Committee, acting jointly, determine that \n     such action is necessary and appropriate.\n\n\n                Rule 2: Procedures for Sworn Complaints\n\n       (a) Sworn Complaints: Any person may file a sworn complaint \n     with the Committee, alleging that any Senator, or officer, or \n     employee of the Senate has violated a law, the Senate Code of \n     Official Conduct, or any rule or regulation of the Senate \n     relating to the conduct of any individual in the performance \n     of his or her duty as a Member, officer, or employee of the \n     Senate, or has engaged in improper conduct which may reflect \n     upon the Senate.\n       (b) Form and content of Complaints: A complaint filed under \n     paragraph (a) shall be in writing and under oath, and shall \n     set forth in simple, concise and direct statements:\n       (1) The name and legal address of the party filing the \n     complaint (hereinafter, the complainant);\n       (2) The name and position or title of each Member, officer, \n     or employee of the Senate who is specifically alleged to have \n     engaged in the improper conduct or committed the violation \n     (hereinafter, the respondent);\n       (3) The nature of the alleged improper conduct or \n     violation, including, if possible, the specific provision of \n     the Senate Code of Official Conduct or other law, rule, or \n     regulation alleged to have been violated.\n       (4)(A) A statement of the facts within the personal \n     knowledge of the complainant that are alleged to constitute \n     the improper conduct or violation.\n       (B) The term ``personal knowledge'' is not intended to and \n     does not limit the complainant's statement to situations that \n     he or she personally witnessed or to activities in which the \n     complainant was a participant.\n       (C) Where allegations in the sworn complaint are made upon \n     the information and belief of the complainant, the complaint \n     shall so state, and shall set forth the basis for such \n     information and belief.\n       (5) The complainant must swear that all of the information \n     contained in the complaint either (a) is true, or (b) was \n     obtained under circumstances such that the complainant has \n     sufficient personal knowledge of the source of the \n     information reasonably to believe that it is true. The \n     complainant may so swear either by oath or by solemn \n     affirmation before a notary public or other authorized \n     official.\n       (6) All documents in the possession of the complainant \n     relevant to or in support of his or her allegations may be \n     appended to the complaint.\n       (c) Processing of Sworn Complaints:\n       (1) When the Committee receives a sworn complaint against a \n     Member, officer or employee of the Senate, it shall determine \n     by majority vote whether the complaint is in substantial \n     compliance with paragraph (b) of this rule.\n       (2) If it is determined by the Committee that a sworn \n     complaint does not substantially comply with the requirements \n     of paragraph (b), the complaint shall be returned promptly to \n     the complainant, with a statement explaining how the \n     complaint fails to comply and a copy of the rules for filing \n     sworn complaints. The complainant may resubmit the complaint \n     in the proper form. If the complaint is not revised so that \n     it substantially complies with the stated requirements, the \n     Committee may in its discretion process the complaint in \n     accordance with Rule 3.\n       (3) A sworn complaint against any Member, officer, or \n     employee of the Senate that is determined by the Committee to \n     be in substantial compliance shall be transmitted to the \n     respondent within five days of that determination. The \n     transmittal notice shall include the date upon which the \n     complaint was received, a statement that the complaint \n     conforms to the applicable rules, a statement that the \n     Committee will immediately begin an initial review of the \n     complaint, and a statement inviting the respondent to provide \n     any information relevant to the complaint to the Committee. A \n     copy of the Rules of the Committee shall be supplied with the \n     notice.\n\n\n    Rule 3: Procedures on Receipt of Allegations Other Than a Sworn \n                     Complaint; Preliminary Inquiry\n\n       (a) Unsworn Allegations or Information: Any Member or staff \n     Member of the Committee shall report to the Committee, and \n     any other person may report to the Committee, any credible \n     information available to him or her that indicates that any \n     named or unnamed Member, officer or employee of the Senate \n     may have--\n       (1) violated the Senate Code of Official Conduct;\n       (2) violated a law;\n       (3) violated any rule or regulation of the Senate relating \n     to the conduct of individuals in the performance of their \n     duties as Members, officers, or employees of the Senate; or\n       (4) engaged in improper conduct which may reflect upon the \n     Senate. Such allegations or information may be reported to \n     the Chairman, the Vice Chairman, a Committee Member, or a \n     Committee staff Member.\n       (b) Sources of Unsworn Allegations or Information: The \n     information to be reported to the Committee under paragraph \n     (a), may be obtained from a variety of sources, including but \n     not limited to the following:\n       (1) sworn complaints that do not satisfy all of the \n     requirements of Rule 2;\n       (2) anonymous or informal complaints, whether or not \n     satisfying the requirements of Rule 2;\n       (3) information developed during a study or inquiry by the \n     Committee or other committees or subcommittees of the Senate, \n     including information obtained in connection with legislative \n     or general oversight hearings;\n       (4) information reported by the news media; or\n       (5) information obtained from any individual, agency or \n     department of the executive branch of the Federal Government.\n       (c) Preliminary Inquiry:\n       (1) When information is presented to the Committee pursuant \n     to paragraph (a), it shall immediately be transmitted to the \n     Chairman and the Vice Chairman, for one of the following \n     actions:\n       (A) The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, may \n     conduct or may direct the Committee staff to conduct, a \n     preliminary inquiry.\n       (B) The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, may \n     present the allegations or information received directly to \n     the Committee for it to determine whether an initial review \n     should be undertaken. (See paragraph (d).)\n       (2) A preliminary inquiry may include any inquiries, \n     interviews, sworn statements, depositions, and subpoenas that \n     the Chairman and Vice Chairman deem appropriate to obtain \n     information upon which to make any determination provided for \n     by this Rule.\n       (3) At the conclusion of a preliminary inquiry, the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman shall receive a full report of its \n     findings. The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, \n     shall then determine what further action, if any, is \n     appropriate in the particular case, including any of the \n     following:\n       (A) No further action is appropriate, because the alleged \n     improper conduct or violation is clearly not within the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee;\n       (B) No further action is appropriate, because there is no \n     reason to believe that the alleged improper conduct or \n     violation may have occurred; or\n       (C) The unsworn allegations or information, and a report on \n     the preliminary inquiry, should be referred to the Committee, \n     to determine whether an initial review should be undertaken. \n     (See paragraph (d).)\n       (4) If the Chairman and the Vice Chairman are unable to \n     agree on a determination at the conclusion of a preliminary \n     inquiry, then they shall refer the allegations or information \n     to the Committee, with a report on the preliminary inquiry, \n     for the Committee to determine whether an initial review \n     should be undertaken. (See paragraph (d).)\n       (5) A preliminary inquiry shall be completed within sixty \n     days after the unsworn allegations or information were \n     received by the Chairman and Vice Chairman. The sixty day \n     period may be extended for a specified period by the Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman, acting jointly. A preliminary inquiry is \n     completed when the Chairman and the Vice Chairman have made \n     the determination required by subparagraphs (3) and (4) of \n     this paragraph.\n       (d) Determination Whether to Conduct an Initial Review: \n     When information or allegations are presented to the \n     Committee by the Chairman and the Vice Chairman, the \n     Committee shall determine whether an initial review should be \n     undertaken.\n       (1) An initial review shall be undertaken when--\n       (A) there is reason to believe on the basis of the \n     information before the Committee that the possible improper \n     conduct or violation may be within the jurisdiction of the \n     Committee; and\n       (B) there is reason to believe on the basis of the \n     information before the Committee that the improper conduct or \n     violation may have occurred.\n       (2) The determination whether to undertake an initial \n     review shall be made by recorded vote within thirty days \n     following the Committee's receipt of the unsworn allegations \n     or information from the Chairman or Vice Chairman, or at the \n     first meeting of the Committee thereafter if none occurs \n     within thirty days, unless this time is extended for a \n     specified period by the Committee.\n       (3) The Committee may determine that an initial review is \n     not warranted because (a) there is no reason to believe on \n     the basis of the information before the Committee that the \n     improper conduct or violation may have occurred, or (b) the \n     improper conduct or violation, even if proven, is not within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee.\n       (A) If the Committee determines that an initial review is \n     not warranted, it shall\n\n[[Page S1489]]\n\n     promptly notify the complainant, if any, and any known \n     respondent.\n       (B) If there is a complainant, he or she may also be \n     invited to submit additional information, and notified of the \n     procedures for filing a sworn complaint. If the complainant \n     later provides additional information, not in the form of a \n     sworn complaint, it shall be handled as a new allegation in \n     accordance with the procedures of Rule 3. If he or she \n     submits a sworn complaint, it shall be handled in accordance \n     with Rule 2.\n       (4)(A) The Committee may determine that there is reason to \n     believe on the basis of the information before it that the \n     improper conduct or violation may have occurred and may be \n     within the jurisdiction of the Committee, and that an initial \n     review must therefore be conducted.\n       (B) If the Committee determines that an initial review will \n     be conducted, it shall promptly notify the complainant, if \n     any, and the respondent, if any.\n       (C) The notice required under subparagraph (B) shall \n     include a general statement of the information or allegations \n     before the Committee and a statement that the Committee will \n     immediately begin an initial review of the complaint. A copy \n     of the rules of the Committee shall be supplied with the \n     notice.\n       (5) If a Member of the Committee believes that the \n     preliminary inquiry has provided sufficient information for \n     the Committee to determine whether there is substantial \n     credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the \n     Committee to conclude that a violation within the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred, the Member may \n     move that the Committee dispense with the initial review and \n     move directly to the determinations described in Rule 4(f). \n     The Committee may adopt such a motion by majority vote of the \n     full Committee.\n\n\n          rule 4: procedures for conducting an initial review\n\n       (a) Basis for Initial Review: The Committee shall promptly \n     commence an initial review whenever it has received either \n     (1) a sworn complaint that the Committee has determined is in \n     substantial compliance with the requirements of Rule 2, or \n     (2) unsworn allegations or information that have caused the \n     Committee to determine in accordance with Rule 3 that an \n     initial review must be conducted.\n       (b) Scope of Initial Review:\n       (1) The initial review shall be of such duration and scope \n     as may be necessary to determine whether there is substantial \n     credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the \n     Committee to conclude that a violation within the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred.\n       (2) An initial review may include any inquiries, \n     interviews, sworn statements, depositions, and subpoenas that \n     the Committee deems appropriate to obtain information upon \n     which to make any determination provided for by this rule.\n       (c) Opportunity for Response: An initial review may include \n     an opportunity for any known respondent or his designated \n     representative, to present either a written or oral \n     statement, or to respond orally to questions from the \n     Committee. Such an oral statement or answers shall be \n     transcribed and signed by the person providing the statement \n     or answers.\n       (d) Status Reports: The Committee staff or outside counsel \n     shall periodically report to the Committee in the form and \n     according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee. The \n     reports shall be confidential.\n       (e) Final Report: When the initial review is completed, the \n     staff or outside counsel shall make a confidential report to \n     the Committee on findings and recommendations.\n       (f) Committee Action: As soon as practicable following \n     submission of the report on the initial review, the Committee \n     shall determine by a recorded vote whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Committee \n     may make any of the following determinations:\n       (1) The Committee may determine that there is not such \n     substantial credible evidence. In this case, the Committee \n     shall report its determination to the complainant, if any, \n     and to the respondent, together with an explanation of the \n     basis for the determination. The explanation may be as \n     detailed as the Committee desires, but it is not required to \n     include a complete discussion of the evidence collected in \n     the initial review.\n       (2) The Committee may determine that there is such \n     substantial credible evidence, but that the alleged violation \n     is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de minimis \n     nature. In this case, the Committee may attempt to correct or \n     to prevent such violation by informal methods. The \n     Committee's final determination in this matter shall be \n     reported to the complainant, if any, and to the respondent, \n     if any.\n       (3) The Committee may determine that there is such \n     substantial credible evidence, but that the alleged \n     violation, if proven, although not of a de minimis nature, \n     would not be sufficiently serious to justify the severe \n     disciplinary actions specified in Senate Resolution 338, 88th \n     Congress, as amended (i.e., for a Member, censure, expulsion, \n     or recommendation to the appropriate party conference \n     regarding the Member's seniority or positions of \n     responsibility; of for an officer or employee, suspension or \n     dismissal). In this case, the Committee, by the recorded \n     affirmative vote of at least four Members, may propose a \n     remedy that it deems appropriate. If the respondent agrees to \n     the proposed remedy, a summary of the Committee's conclusions \n     and the remedy proposed and agreed to shall be filed as a \n     public record with the Secretary of the Senate and a notice \n     of the filing shall be printed in the Congressional Record.\n       (4) The Committee may determine, by recorded affirmative \n     vote of at least four Members, that there is such substantial \n     credible evidence, and also either:\n       (A) that the violation, if proved, would be sufficiently \n     serious to warrant imposition of one of the severe \n     disciplinary actions listed in paragraph (3); of\n       (B) that the violation, if proven, is less serious, but was \n     not resolved pursuant to the procedure in paragraph (3). In \n     either case, the Committee shall order that an investigation \n     promptly be conducted in accordance with Rule 5.\n\n\n           rule 5: procedures for conducting an investigation\n\n       (a) Definition of Investigation: An ``investigation'' is a \n     proceeding undertaken by the Committee, by recorded \n     affirmative vote of at least four Members, after a finding on \n     the basis of an initial review that there is substantial \n     credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the \n     Committee to conclude that a violation within its \n     jurisdiction has occurred.\n       (b) Scope of Investigation: When the Committee decides to \n     conduct an investigation, it shall be of such duration and \n     scope as is necessary for the Committee to determine whether \n     a violation within its jurisdiction has occurred. In the \n     course of the investigation, designated outside counsel, or \n     if the Committee determines not to use outside counsel, the \n     Committee or its staff, may conduct inquiries or interviews, \n     take sworn statements, use compulsory process as described in \n     Rule 7, or take any other actions that the Committee deems \n     appropriate to secure the evidence necessary to make this \n     determination.\n       (c) Notice to Respondent: The Committee shall give written \n     notice to any known respondent who is the subject of an \n     investigation. The notice shall be sent to the respondent no \n     later than five working days after the Committee has voted to \n     conduct an investigation. The notice shall include a \n     statement of the nature of the possible violation, and a \n     description of the evidence indicating that a possible \n     violation occurred. The Committee shall offer the respondent \n     an opportunity to present a statement or to respond to \n     questions from Members of the Committee, the Committee staff, \n     or outside counsel.\n       (d) Right to a Hearing: The Committee shall accord a \n     respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends \n     disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate.\n       (e) Progress Reports to Committee: The Committee staff or \n     outside counsel shall periodically report to the Committee \n     concerning the progress of the investigation. Such reports \n     shall be delivered to the Committee in the form and according \n     to the schedule prescribed by the Committee, and shall be \n     confidential.\n       (f) Report of Investigation:\n       (1) Upon completion of an investigation, including any \n     hearings held pursuant to Rule 6, the outside counsel or the \n     staff shall submit a confidential written report to the \n     Committee, which shall detail the factual findings of the \n     investigation and which may recommend disciplinary action, if \n     appropriate. Findings of fact of the investigation shall be \n     detailed in this report whether or not disciplinary action is \n     recommended.\n       (2) The Committee shall consider the report of the staff or \n     outside counsel promptly following its submission. The \n     Committee shall prepare and submit a report to the Senate, \n     including a recommendation to the Senate concerning \n     disciplinary action, if appropriate. A report shall be \n     issued, stating in detail the Committee's findings of fact, \n     whether or not disciplinary action is recommended. The report \n     shall also explain fully the reasons underlying the \n     Committee's recommendation concerning disciplinary action, if \n     any. No recommendation or resolution of the Committee \n     concerning the investigation of a Member, officer or employee \n     of the Senate may be approved except by the affirmative \n     recorded vote of not less than four Members of the Committee.\n       (3) Promptly, after the conclusion of the investigation, \n     the Committee's report and recommendation shall be forwarded \n     to the Secretary of the Senate, and a copy shall be \n     provided to the complainant and the respondent. The full \n     report and recommendation shall be printed and made \n     public, unless the Committee determines by majority vote \n     that it should remain confidential.\n\n\n                    rule 6: procedures for hearings\n\n       (a) Right to Hearing: The Committee may hold a public or \n     executive hearing in any inquiry, initial review, \n     investigation, or other proceeding. The Committee shall \n     accord a respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it \n     recommends disciplinary action against that respondent to the \n     Senate. (See Rule 5(d).)\n       (b) Non-Public Hearings: The Committee may at any time \n     during a hearing determine in accordance with paragraph 5(b) \n     of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate whether to \n     receive the testimony of specific witnesses in executive \n     session. If a witness desires to express a preference for \n     testifying in public or in executive session, he or she\n\n[[Page S1490]]\n\n     shall so notify the Committee at least five days before he or \n     she is scheduled to testify.\n       (c) Adjudicatory Hearings: The Committee may, by majority \n     vote, designate any public or executive hearing as an \n     adjudicatory hearing; and, any hearing which is concerned \n     with possible disciplinary action against a respondent or \n     respondents designated by the Committee shall be an \n     adjudicatory hearing. In any adjudicatory hearing, the \n     procedures described in paragraph (j) shall apply.\n       (d) Subpoena Power: The Committee may require, but subpoena \n     or otherwise, the attendance and testimony of such witnesses \n     and the production of such correspondence, books, papers, \n     documents or other articles as it deems advisable. (See Rule \n     7.)\n       (e) Notice of Hearings: The Committee shall make public an \n     announcement of the date, place, and subject matter of any \n     hearing to be conducted by it, in accordance with Rule 1(f).\n       (f) Presiding Officer: The Chairman shall preside over the \n     hearings, or in his absence the Vice Chairman. If the Vice \n     Chairman is also absent, a Committee Member designated by the \n     Chairman shall preside. If an oath or affirmation is \n     required, it shall be administered to a witness by the \n     Presiding Officer, or in his absence, by any Committee \n     Member.\n       (g) Witnesses:\n       (1) A subpoena or other request to testify shall be served \n     on a witness sufficiently in advance of his or her scheduled \n     appearance to allow the witness a reasonable period of time, \n     as determined by the Committee, to prepare for the hearing \n     and to employ counsel if desired.\n       (2) The Committee may, by a majority vote, rule that no \n     Member of the Committee or staff or outside counsel shall \n     make public the name of any witness subpoenaed by the \n     Committee before the date of that witness' scheduled \n     appearance, except as specifically authorized by the Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (3) Any witness desiring to read a prepared or written \n     statement in executive or public hearings shall file a copy \n     of such statement with the Committee at least two working \n     days in advance of the hearing at which the statement is to \n     be presented.

Such request and such statement shall be \n     submitted to the Committee for its consideration and action.\n       (i) Conduct of Witnesses and Other Attendees: The Presiding \n     Officer may punish any breaches of order and decorum by \n     censure and exclusion from the hearings. The Committee, by \n     majority vote, may recommend to the Senate that the offender \n     be cited for contempt of Congress.\n       (j) Adjudicator Hearing Procedures:\n       (1) Notice of hearings: A copy of the public announcement \n     of an adjudicatory hearing, required by paragraph (e), shall \n     be furnished together with a copy of these Rules to all \n     witnesses at the time that they are subpoenaed or otherwise \n     summoned to testify.\n       (2) Preparation for adjudicatory hearings:\n       (A) At least five working days prior to the commencement of \n     an adjudicatory hearing the Committee shall provide the \n     following information and documents to the respondent, if \n     any:\n       (i) a list of proposed witnesses to be called at the \n     hearing;\n       (ii) copies of all documents expected to be introduced as \n     exhibits at the hearing; and\n       (iii) a brief statement as to the nature of the testimony \n     expected to be given by each witness to be called at the \n     hearing.\n       (B) At least two working days prior to the commencement of \n     an adjudicatory hearing, the respondent, if any, shall \n     provide the information and documents described in divisions \n     (i), (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (A) to the Committee.\n       (C) At the discretion of the Committee, the information and \n     documents to be exchanged under this paragraph shall be \n     subject to an appropriate agreement limiting access and \n     disclosure.\n       (D) If a respondent refuses to provide the information and \n     documents to the Committee (see (A) and (B) of \n     this subparagraph), or if a respondent or other individual \n     violates an agreement limiting access and disclosure, the \n     Committee, by majority vote, may recommend to the Senate \n     that the offender be cited for contempt of Congress.\n       (3) Swearing of witnesses: All witnesses who testify at \n     adjudicatory hearings shall be sworn unless the Presiding \n     Officer, for good cause, decides that witness does not have \n     to be sworn.\n       (4) Right to counsel: Any witness at an adjudicatory \n     hearing may be accompanied by counsel of his or her own \n     choosing, who shall be permitted to advise the witness of his \n     or her legal rights during the testimony.\n       (5) Right to cross-examine and call witnesses:\n       (A) In adjudicatory hearings, any respondent who is the \n     subject of an investigation, and any other person who obtains \n     the permission of the Committee, may personally or through \n     counsel cross-examine witnesses called by the Committee and \n     may call witnesses in his or her own behalf.\n       (B) A respondent may apply to the Committee for the \n     issuance of subpoenas for the appearance of witnesses or the \n     production of documents on his or her behalf. An application \n     shall be approved upon a concise showing by the respondent \n     that the proposed testimony or evidence is relevant and \n     appropriate, as determined by the Chairman and Vice Chairman.\n       (C) With respect to witnesses called by a respondent, or \n     other individual given permission by the Committee, each such \n     witness shall first be examined by the party who called the \n     witness or by that party's counsel.\n       (D) At least one working day before a witness' scheduled \n     appearance, a witness or a witness' counsel may submit to the \n     Committee written questions proposed to be asked of that \n     witness. If the Committee determines that it is necessary, \n     such questions may be asked by any Member of the Committee, \n     or by any Committee staff member if directed by a Committee \n     Member. The witness or witness' counsel may also submit \n     additional sworn testimony for the record within twenty-four \n     hours after the last day that the witness has testified. The \n     insertion of such testimony in that day's record is subject \n     to the approval of the Chairman and Vice Chairman acting \n     jointly within five days after the testimony is received.\n       (6) Admissibility of evidence:\n       (A) The object of the hearing shall be to ascertain the \n     truth. Any evidence that may be relevant and probative shall \n     be admissible unless privileged under the Federal Rules of \n     Evidence. Rules of evidence shall not be applied strictly, \n     but the Presiding Officer shall exclude irrelevant or unduly \n     repetitious testimony. Objections going only to the weight \n     that should be given evidence will not justify its exclusion.\n       (B) The Presiding Officer shall rule upon any question of \n     the admissibility of testimony or other evidence presented to \n     the Committee. Such rulings shall be final unless reversed or \n     modified by a majority vote of the Committee before the \n     recess of that day's hearings.\n       (C) Notwithstanding paragraphs (A) and (B), in any matter \n     before the committee involving allegations of sexual \n     discrimination, including sexual harassment, or sexual \n     misconduct, by a Member, officer, or employee within the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee, the Committee shall be guided \n     by the standards and procedures of Rule 412 of the Federal \n     Rules of Evidence, except that the Committee may admit \n     evidence subject to the provisions of this paragraph only \n     upon a determination of a majority of the Members of the full \n     Committee that the interests of justice require that such \n     evidence be admitted.\n       (7) Supplementary hearing procedures: The Committee may \n     adopt any additional special hearing procedures that it deems \n     necessary or appropriate to a particular adjudicatory \n     hearing. Copies of such supplementary procedures shall be \n     furnished to witnesses and respondents, and shall be made \n     available upon request to any Member of the public.\n       (k) Transcripts:\n       (l) An accurate stenographic or recorded transcript shall \n     be made of all public and executive hearings. Any Member of \n     the Committee, Committee staff Member, outside counsel \n     retained by the Committee, or witness may examine a copy of \n     the transcript retained by the Committee of his or her own \n     remarks and may suggest to the official reporter any \n     typographical or transcription errors. If the reporter \n     declines to make the requested corrections, the Member, staff \n     Member, outside counsel or witness may request a ruling by \n     the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly. Any Member or \n     witness shall return the transcript with suggested \n     corrections to the Committee offices within five working days \n     after receipt of the transcript, or as soon thereafter as is \n     practicable. If the testimony was given in executive session, \n     the Member or witness may only inspect the transcript at a \n     location determined by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly. Any questions arising with respect to the processing \n     and correction of transcripts shall be decided by the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (2) Except for the record of a hearing which is closed to \n     the public, each transcript shall be printed as soon as is \n     practicable after receipt of the corrected version. The \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, may order the \n     transcript of a hearing to be printed without the corrections \n     of a Member or witness if they determine that such Member or \n     witness has been afforded a reasonable time to correct such \n     transcript and such transcript has not been returned within \n     such time.\n       (3) The Committee shall furnish each witness, at no cost, \n     one transcript copy of that witness' testimony given at a \n     public hearing. If the testimony was given in executive \n     session, then a transcript copy shall be provided upon \n     request, subject to appropriate conditions and restrictions \n     prescribed by the Chairman and Vice Chairman. If any \n     individual violates such conditions and restrictions, the \n     Committee may recommend by majority vote that he or she be \n     cited for contempt of Congress.\n\n[[Page S1491]]\n\n                   rule 7: subpoenas and depositions\n\n       (a) Subpoenas:\n       (1) Authorization for Issuance: Subpoenas for the \n     attendance and testimony of witnesses at depositions or \n     hearings, and subpoenas for the production of documents and \n     tangible things at depositions, hearings, or other times and \n     places designated therein, may be authorized for issuance by \n     either (A) a majority vote of the Committee, or (B) the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, at any time \n     before a preliminary inquiry, for the purpose of obtaining \n     information to evaluate unsworn allegations or information, \n     or at any time during a preliminary inquiry, initial review, \n     investigation, or other proceeding.\n       (2) Signature and Service: All subpoenas shall be signed by \n     the Chairman or the Vice Chairman and may be served by any \n     person eighteen years of age or older, who is designated by \n     the Chairman or Vice Chairman. Each subpoena shall be served \n     with a copy of the Rules of the Committee and a brief \n     statement of the purpose of the Committee's proceeding.\n       (3) Withdrawal of Subpoena: The Committee, by majority \n     vote, may withdraw any subpoena authorized for issuance by it \n     or authorized for issuance by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     acting jointly. The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly, may withdraw any subpoena authorized for issuance by \n     them.\n       (b) Depositions:\n       (1) Persons Authorized To Take Depositions: Depositions may \n     be taken by any Member of the Committee, designated by the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, or by any other \n     person designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly, including outside counsel, Committee staff, other \n     employees of the Senate, or government employees detailed to \n     the Committee.\n       (2) Deposition Notices: Notices for the taking of \n     depositions shall be authorized by the Committee, or the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, and issued by the \n     Chairman, Vice Chairman, or a Committee staff Member or \n     outside counsel designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     acting jointly. Depositions may be taken at any time before a \n     preliminary inquiry, for the purpose of obtaining information \n     to evaluate unsworn allegations or information, or at any \n     time during a preliminary inquiry, initial review, \n     investigation, or other proceeding. Deposition notices shall \n     specify a time and place for examination. Unless otherwise \n     specified, the deposition shall be in private, and the \n     testimony taken and documents produced shall be deemed for \n     the purpose of these rules to have been received in a closed \n     or executive session of the Committee. The Committee shall \n     not initiate procedures leading to criminal or civil \n     enforcement proceedings for a witness's failure to appear, or \n     to testify, or to produce documents, unless the deposition \n     notice was accompanied by a subpoena authorized for issuance \n     by the Committee, or the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly.\n       (3) Counsel at Depositions: Witnesses may be accompanied at \n     a deposition by counsel to advise them of their rights.\n       (4) Deposition Procedure: Witnesses at depositions shall be \n     examined upon oath administered by an individual authorized \n     by law to administer oaths, or administered by any Member of \n     the Committee if one is present. Questions may be propounded \n     by any person or persons who are authorized to take \n     depositions for the Committee. If a witness objects to a \n     question and refuses to testify, or refuses to produce a \n     document, any Member of the Committee who is present may rule \n     on the objection and, if the objection is overruled, direct \n     the witness to answer the question or produce the document. \n     If no Member of the Committee is present, the individual who \n     has been designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly, to take the deposition may proceed with the \n     deposition, or may, at that time or at a subsequent time, \n     seek a ruling by telephone or otherwise on the objection from \n     the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Committee, who may refer \n     the matter to the Committee or rule on the objection. If the \n     Chairman or Vice Chairman, or the Committee upon referral, \n     overrules the objection, the Chairman, Vice Chairman, or the \n     Committee as the case may be, may direct the witness to \n     answer the question or produce the document. The Committee \n     shall not initiate procedures leading to civil or criminal \n     enforcement unless the witness refuses to testify or produce \n     documents after having been directed to do so.\n       (5) Filing of Depositions: Deposition testimony shall be \n     transcribed or electronically recorded. If the deposition is \n     transcribed, the individual administering the oath shall \n     certify on the transcript that the witness was duly sworn in \n     his or her presence and the transcriber shall certify that \n     the transcript is a true record of the testimony. The \n     transcript with these certifications shall be filed with the \n     chief clerk of the Committee, and the witness shall be \n     furnished with access to a copy at the Committee's offices \n     for review. Upon inspecting the transcript, within a time \n     limit set by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, \n     a witness may request in writing changes in the transcript to \n     correct errors in transcription. The witness may also bring \n     to the attention of the Committee errors of fact in the \n     witness's testimony by submitting a sworn statement about \n     those facts with a request that it be attached to the \n     transcript. The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, \n     may rule on the witness's request, and the changes or \n     attachments allowed shall be certified by the Committee's \n     chief clerk. If the witness fails to make any request under \n     this paragraph within the time limit set, this fact shall be \n     noted by the Committee's chief clerk. Any person authorized \n     by the Committee may stipulate with the witness to changes in \n     this procedure.\n\n\n rule 8: violations of law; perjury; legislative recommendations; and \n               applicable rules and standards of conduct\n\n       (a) Violations of Law: Whenever the Committee determines by \n     majority vote that there is reason to believe that a \n     violation of law may have occurred, it shall report such \n     possible violation to the proper state and federal \n     authorities.\n       (b) Perjury: Any person who knowingly and willfully swears \n     falsely to a sworn complaint or any other sworn statement to \n     the Committee does so under penalty of perjury. The Committee \n     may refer any such case to the Attorney General for \n     prosecution.\n       (c) Legislative Recommendations: The Committee shall \n     recommend to the Senate by report or resolution such \n     additional rules, regulations, or other legislative measures \n     as it determines to be necessary or desirable to ensure \n     proper standards of conduct by Members, officers, or \n     employees of the Senate. The Committee may conduct such \n     inquiries as it deems necessary to prepare such a report or \n     resolution, including the holding of hearings in public or \n     executive session and the use of subpoenas to compel the \n     attendance of witnesses or the production of materials. The \n     Committee may make legislative recommendations as a result of \n     its findings in an initial review, investigation, or other \n     proceeding.\n       (d) Applicable Rules and Standards of Conduct:\n       (1) No initial review or investigation shall be made of an \n     alleged violation of any law, rule, regulation, or provision \n     of the Senate Code of Official Conduct which was not in \n     effect at the time the alleged violation occurred. No \n     provision of the Senate Code of Official Conduct shall apply \n     to, or require disclosure of any act, relationship, or \n     transaction which occurred prior to the effective date of the \n     applicable provision of the Code.\n       (2) The Committee may conduct an initial review or \n     investigation of an alleged violation of a rule or law which \n     was in effect prior to the enactment of the Senate Code of \n     Official Conduct if the alleged violation occurred while such \n     rule or law was in effect and the violation was not a matter \n     resolved on the merits by the predecessor Committee.\n\n\n  rule 9: procedures for handling committee sensitive and classified \n                               materials\n\n       (a) Procedures for Handling Committee Sensitive Materials:\n       (1) Committee Sensitive information or material is \n     information or material in the possession of the Select \n     Committee on Ethics which pertains to illegal or improper \n     conduct by a present or former Member, officer, or employee \n     of the Senate; to allegations or accusation of such conduct; \n     to any resulting preliminary inquiry, initial review, or \n     investigation by the Select Committee on Ethics into such \n     allegations or conduct; to the investigative techniques and \n     procedures of the Select Committee on Ethics; or to other \n     information or material designated by the staff director, or \n     outside counsel designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman.\n       (2) The Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee shall \n     establish such procedures as may be necessary to prevent the \n     unauthorized disclosure of Committee Sensitive information in \n     the possession of the Committee or its staff. Procedures for \n     protecting Committee Sensitive materials shall be in writing \n     and shall be given to each Committee staff Member.\n       (b) Procedures for Handling Classified Materials:\n       (1) Classified information or material is information or \n     material which is specifically designated as classified under \n     the authority of Executive Order 11652 requiring protection \n     of such information or material from unauthorized disclosure \n     in order to prevent damage to the United States.\n       (2) The Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee shall \n     establish such procedures as may be necessary to prevent the \n     unauthorized disclosure of classified information in the \n     possession of the Committee or its staff. Procedures for \n     handling such information shall be in writing and a copy of \n     the procedures shall be given to each staff Member cleared \n     for access to classified information.\n       (3) Each Member of the Committee shall have access to \n     classified material in the Committee's possession.

Removal \n     from the Committee offices of such documents or materials is \n     prohibited except as necessary for use in, or preparation \n     for, interviews or Committee meetings, including the taking \n     of testimony, or as otherwise specifically approved by the \n     staff director or by outside counsel designated by the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman.\n       (2) Each Member of the Committee shall have access to all \n     materials in the Committee's possession. The staffs of \n     Members shall\n\n[[Page S1492]]\n\n     not have access to Committee Sensitive or classified \n     documents and materials without the specific approval in each \n     instance of the Chairman, and Vice Chairman, acting jointly. \n     Members may examine such materials in the Committee's \n     offices. If necessary, requested materials may be taken by a \n     Member of the Committee staff to the office of a Member of \n     the Committee for his or her examination, but the Committee \n     staff Member shall remain with the Committee Sensitive or \n     classified documents or materials at all times except as \n     specifically authorized by the Chairman or Vice Chairman.\n       (3) Any Member of the Senate who is not a Member of the \n     Committee and who seeks access to any Committee Sensitive or \n     classified documents or materials, other than documents or \n     materials which are matters of public record, shall request \n     access in writing. The Committee shall decide by majority \n     vote whether to make documents or materials available.

So, now, for the information of all Senators, tomorrow \nmorning the Senate will be resuming debate on the pending Reid \namendment to the balanced budget resolution. At 2:10 p.m. tomorrow the \nSenate will begin 5 minutes of closing remarks followed by a rollcall \nvote on adoption of House Joint Resolution 36, the resolution regarding \nU.N. population funding.\n  Following that vote, the Senate then will resume debate on the Reid \namendment, with a vote occurring on or in relation to the amendment at \n6 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon.\n  As a reminder, the Senate will debate Senator Feinstein's amendment \non Wednesday morning, from the hours of 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. Following the \nvote at 11 on or in relation to the Feinstein amendment, Senator \nTorricelli will be recognized to offer an amendment relating to capital \nbudgeting. That amendment is limited to 3 hours for debate.\n  I thank my colleagues for their cooperation in allowing us to \nschedule these votes, and I hope we can continue to make progress on \nthis important matter. It is my understanding that just prior to our \nweekly party conferences, the Democratic leader and I will be able to \nconsult, and hopefully he will be in a position to enter into an \nagreement outlining the remaining amendments in order to the \nconstitutional amendment. Once that agreement is reached, then we will \nbe in a better position to notify our Members with respect to votes \nduring the remainder of this week.\n  It is my intention at this time to have votes on Friday on \namendments, if necessary, unless we can get an agreement to the \ncontrary. We should know about this tomorrow, and we will let the \nMembers know for sure about votes on Friday and/or Monday.\n  We want to have, and we have had, a full and fair debate on this very \nimportant constitutional amendment, and there have been amendments to \nthat language that have been fully discussed. We continue to reach \nagreements on those amendments, including a Feinstein amendment, the \nReid amendment, and for the Torricelli amendment. But I do think there \nis a point, at some time, when we need to come to closure on the \namendments that are in order, have those debated and voted on if \nnecessary, and then get to final passage. I hope we can get that worked \nout in the next couple of days.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/24/senate-section/article/S1494-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
