Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of \nmorning business until 2 p.m. Following morning business, the Senate \nwill resume consideration of the tobacco bill. As a reminder to all \nSenators, any votes ordered today with respect to the bill will occur \nat 5 p.m. this evening. I believe there is one amendment that there may \nbe a vote on. We should expect a vote at 5 o'clock, and it will \nprobably be very close to 5 in order to accommodate Senators who will \nhave to leave shortly thereafter. It is expected that no more than two \nvotes will be ordered today.\n  Pending is the amendment of Senator Reed of Rhode Island regarding \nthe deductibility of tobacco advertising. We hope to lock in that vote \nfor 5. But we will notify Members if it is going to be any different \nfrom that. It is hoped that the next Republican amendment can also be \noffered today. The vote on that may follow the vote on the Reed \namendment. But, again, that has not been locked in yet.\n  We may also attempt to reach an agreement with regard to the Higher \nEducation Act. We made some progress on that last week. There are some \nconcerns still pending. But we will have the committee chairman and the \nMembers working on the Higher Education Act. We need to get that \ncompleted. We have extended the time for the loans and grants under \nthat act for 90 days. We don't have the July 1 deadline that would \ncause the students not to get their loans and grants, but the program \nexpires July 1. We need to try to get that legislation moved as soon as \npossible.\n  We also have the NASA authorization bill and the drug czar office \nreauthorization bill, as well as other legislation or Executive \nCalendar items that may be cleared for action.\n  Any votes with regard to other items on the tobacco bill will occur \nthen on Tuesday morning at a time to be determined by the two leaders--\nprobably around 9:30 or 10. But we will need to see if we have \nsomething ready by then.\n  The official photo for the 105th Congress will take place tomorrow, \nTuesday, June 16, at 2:15 p.m. All Senators are asked to be in the \nChamber and seated at their desk at that time. Again, at 2:15 tomorrow, \nTuesday, we will take the official photograph. This is the best time, \nlooking at everybody's schedules and illnesses that we have been having \nto work around. But we want to get this done. We plan on doing it \ntomorrow.\n  One final point: We expect that the education conference report will \nbe available one day this week--maybe Wednesday. That is the Coverdell \nA+ issue with some other parts that were added to it in the Senate. I \nbelieve this is a conference report that will have broad bipartisan \nsupport. We will take that up when the conference report is available.\n  Observing no Senator wishing to speak, I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are getting into the tobacco wars again \ntoday. I know we have made some progress. I have seen in the last week \nseveral amendments adopted which I think are very important. As a long-\ntime advocate of assuring full deductibility for\n\n[[Page S6310]]\n\nhealth insurance for the self-employed, I was delighted that, and the \nmarriage penalty provision, survived a vote in the Chamber, and also \nwhat we called the Bond-Kerry amendment directing that some of the \nmoney paid out to the States be used at the very essential early stages \nof a child's development through early childhood development, parent \neducation to make their children better students, better people, to \naccept responsibility for them, and providing child care to assure that \nchildren in elementary school are not left alone without supervision \nbefore and after school.\n  These are steps in the right direction. I understand that one of my \ncolleagues, for whom I have great respect, later on today will come to \nthe floor and seek to strike all mandates on States in this bill.\n  Generally, I have taken the position as a former Governor that we \nshould not be mandating what States do with all of the money that is \ncollected by the Federal Government from our State constituents. In \nthis case, however, I think the situation is a little different because \nwe have been asked by the States to come in and legislate. These \nactions started off as lawsuits, and it came to the point where they \nbelieved that a Federal law was necessary to implement the objectives \nthat the States have and that we share, which is to assure discouraging \nof teenage smoking. I think that once we go down that path of imposing \na major legislative solution--and we are going to be the ones who have \nto take the responsibility for imposing the fees, for setting up the \nsmoking cessation programs and other things--that there is every reason \nfor us to pose responsible legislative provisions which will have to be \nagreed to by a majority of both Houses.\n\n  I would mention the fact that there has been some controversy. I \nregret we were not able to place a limit on the amount of fees the \nlawyers for the States would receive. It seems to me we missed an \nessential ingredient here. We are talking about imposing a settlement \nor directing a distribution of sums that is not really a settlement of \na lawsuit. We are developing a major proposal which is going to raise \nlarge amounts of money, provide some tax relief, send some money back \nto the States. I think we have every reason to say how much money that \nlobbyists, who are essentially the attorneys who brought the suits--the \nlobbyists pushing this legislation--should be able to achieve. Some of \nthe figures that have been expressed on the floor about $80,000 to \n$90,000 an hour are unconscionable. And the people of my State--and I \nbelieve the people of the United States--are very much concerned about \nwhat is going to be done with all this money. I share that concern.\n  I think before this measure passes, or is finally adopted, there \nought to be some limitation. Sure, let the people who worked on it get \na reasonable return. But there is no reason to give a small group of \npeople, selected by attorneys general, a windfall of literally \npotentially billions of dollars from our legislative action. The people \nwho are going to have to be paying the higher fees for cigarettes, I \nthink, have a right to ask us not to permit States to go through with \nthe contracts which give essentially judicial contingent-fee-type \nrewards to people who are, in essence, coming to us, lobbying for us to \npass legislation.\n  I think we ought to be able to establish some conditions on some of \nthe money that goes back to the States. I have said that smoking \ncessation is important. The educational element is important in \nensuring young people at least know the message that smoking can be \nharmful and that they should not start. I think we need to inform them.\n  I think, second, It is right and proper that, as we did last week, we \nsupport the concept in the Bond-Kerrey proposal, that funds going back \nto the States should be utilized for expanding child care, for assuring \nadequate early childhood development to ensure that every family takes \nresponsibility for its child's behavior. We ought to be talking about \nparental responsibility, about family responsibility, about adult care-\ngiver responsibility.\n  I will tell you one other thing. There is something that is lacking \nin this bill, and I intend to offer--I hope it will be tomorrow--an \namendment which will deal with one of the areas that this bill, in my \nview, wrongfully ignores. We are trying to get teenagers to stop \nsmoking. Where is the responsibility on the teenagers themselves? I \nknow teenagers. I happen to have one in my family. Mine is a fine young \nman. We have these wonderful, bright-eyed, aggressive, intelligent \nyoung people here who are working as pages. Yet we are saying we are \ngoing to protect them from everybody else--from the sellers, from the \ntobacco companies--but we are not saying they have to take any \nresponsibility. Young people are old enough to begin taking \nresponsibility. If they drive a car illegally and they get caught, they \nget sanctioned. If they drive and they are drinking, or if they are \nusing drugs, in my State they can lose their licenses. Young people \nought to know they have some limits and some responsibilities. So I am \ngoing to offer an amendment to say to the States: If you want to \nreceive money under these block grants, you ought to set up a system \nfor sanctioning teenagers who purchase cigarettes illegally.\n  We are raising the price, we are providing education, but, as one \nteenager I talked to said: ``Hey, if all they are doing is saying it's \nbad and the store that sells it to me is going to be in trouble or the \npeople who make it are going to be in trouble but I can walk scot-\nfree--that's worth a try.'' There are some teenagers who, \nunfortunatley, in their rebellious teen-age ways--and most of us can \nstill recall when we were teenagers and remember those days--will say, \n``That's worth a try.'' If we want to discourage teenage smoking, then \nthere need to be some sanctions on the teenagers.\n\n  I would lay out a string of sanctions and say, for the first offense, \neither a $50 fine or a day's worth of community service. A $50 fine \nmight be really heavy on one teenager, but for another teenager it \nmight not make any difference. But if that young man has to spend a day \npicking up trash along the highway as part of a community service \nsanction imposed on him for purchasing cigarettes illegally, I don't \nthink he is going to want to be out there in broad daylight in the hot, \nbroiling sun, with all his buddies going by honking and waving at him \npicking up trash on the highway.\n  I would even go so far as to say parents out to get sanctioned, too. \nWe want to hold parents responsible. We want parents to recognize it is \nnot just Government's responsibility, it is their responsibility as \nparents. Sure, we have all kinds of sanctions on the sellers, mom-and-\npop stores that sell a whole range of things, including a legal \nproduct, tobacco, saying: You are really going to get it if youi sell \nto a teenager.\n  But is it fair to have that penalty only on one side? The amendment I \nam going to offer, and I hope both sides of the aisle will support, \nwill say: States, you have to come up with a graduated system of \nsanctions so teenagers will know it is not a risk-free endeavor to try \nto lure a convenience store operator or a grocery store operator to \nsell you cigarettes that you should not be buying. Some States are \nmoving ahead and they have sanctions, so they would be in compliance. \nBut I think this bill would be sadly lacking if we set out a system of \npenalties and tried some educational efforts to convince teenagers they \nshould not do what is illegal, and left them without sanctions.\n  So I hope we can adopt, tomorrow, a measure which does impose \nsanctions on teenagers or encourages States to say they must set up a \nreasonable graduated system of sanctions for anybody who purchases--\nacquires cigarettes illegally. Thus, I would say, when we come to the \npoint about debating whether this bill should have no sanctions or no \nlimitations or restrictions on the States, I think we have gone past \nthat. Once the States came here and asked us to get involved and to set \nup a scheme to discourage teenage smoking, to raise the price of \ncigarettes to provide smoking education, provide research, provide \nhealth care benefits, we ought to continue down that road and provide \nthe one element which is lacking in the current scheme, and that is \nstrong incentives for States to punish and to impose a reasonable, \ngraduated system of penalties on those who purchase illegally.\n  So I ask my colleagues not to support a removal of all requirements \non\n\n[[Page S6311]]\n\nthe States. I ask them--I hope it will be tomorrow when we come forward \nwith our amendment--to support the amendment. My amendment will simply \nprovide incentives for States to impose sanctions on youth who buy or \npossess tobacco products illegally. We are taking all kinds of steps in \nthe bill to keep cigarettes out of the hands of teens. We are creating \nnew boards and agencies, we are seeking that the tobacco industry limit \nadvertising, we are planning ad campaigns to discourage teens from \nsmoking, we are holding convenience stores accountable for selling \ncigarettes to teens illegally. About the only people we are not holding \nresponsible are the teens themselves. I ask support for my amendment \nthat will do that.\n  Teen smoking is on the rise at a time when older adults are reducing \ntobacco consumption. there is more information out there than ever \nbefore about the risks of smoking, but teens continue to smoke. Some of \nthat may be rebelliousness. How should we handle that rebellion? Quite \nsimply, by holding teens accountable for their actions. Teens need to \nknow that their actions have consequences. If they purchase tobacco \nillegally, they should have a penalty to pay--perform community service \nor kick in with some money to the General Treasury of the entity \ninvolved.\n  Mr. President, I ask support for my amendment. If others want to \ncosponsor the amendment, I welcome having them contact us. We are \nalready working with several Members who are interested. I hope we can \nget this amendment accepted on both sides. I think it is a responsible \nand appropriate response to the problem that this measure seeks to \naddress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and, seeing no other Senator present \nwishing to speak, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/15/senate-section/article/S6309-7", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6311-S6313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        INDIA'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, given the fact that the managers of the \ntobacco legislation are not here even though the Senate was to begin \nreconsideration of that proposal at 2 o'clock, I would like to continue \nto speak in morning business for about 5 minutes to put an article in \nthe Record and ask unanimous consent at this time to include that \narticle at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this is an article from the Washington Post \nby Victor Gilinsky and Paul Leventhal. Victor Gilinsky is an energy \nconsultant, and Paul Leventhal is president of the Nuclear Control \nInstitute. At the time of the 1974 nuclear test by India, they were, \nrespectively, a member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the \nU.S. Senate staff.\n  They write about the history of the nuclear program conducted by \nIndia, illustrating the complicity that the United States has had in \nthe Indian program and, more importantly, the misplaced reliance that \nthe United States has put in arms control agreements, which in the end \nnever quite seem to bear the fruit that we had hoped for.\n  In this case, it was part of the Atoms for Peace Program that the \nUnited States participated in as a result of a previous treaty, and it \nwas part of the Atoms for Peace Program whereby the United States and \nCanada and other nuclear powers would provide some material for India \nfor peaceful purposes. They had a reactor built by Canada. It was made \nessentially operable, according to this article, by the United States \nproviding 21 tons of heavy water. This, of course, was all under a \npromise that the Indians made to the United States that the reactor \nwould be used only for peaceful purposes. But apparently India used \nplutonium from this reactor in its 1974 nuclear explosion. What the \nauthors said--I will quote: ``. . .neither capital''--meaning the \ncapital of Canada or the United States--``has uttered a peep about this \nmatter is symptomatic of Western complicity in the South Asian nuclear \ncrisis and of the present paralysis in dealing with it.''\n  What they are pointing out is that when we negotiate a peace treaty \nwith countries which says, ``You won't develop nuclear weapons--if you \nwill promise not to do that, then we will provide you peaceful nuclear \ntechnology,'' it is almost impossible for that peaceful technology to \nend up in a nuclear weapons program if that is the country's ultimate \ndesire. And, in the case of India, for whatever reasons it decided it \nwas in its national interest to produce a nuclear weapon, apparently it \nused the product of this Atoms for Peace peaceful nuclear program as \npart of its weapon program in violation of the treaty.\n  But for the United States, or Canada, or the other nuclear powers of \nthe world to complain about this would require us to have to admit to \nsomething that we are not about to admit; namely, that these treaties \ndon't work; that there is no way to enforce them; and that, in point of \nfact, a program that we had every hope would be a success--the Atoms \nfor Peace Program--has in fact helped to contribute to the development \nof a nuclear weapon by the country of India.\n  The article goes on to make some other points that I think are \nimportant; that is, that the country of India has broken several \npromises here in the development of its nuclear weaponry; that it had \nalways complained about the charter of the new International Atomic \nEnergy Agency in the 1950s.\n  The article points out:\n\n       It was duplicity in carrying out the Atoms for Peace \n     agreements in the 1960's. It undermined the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty with its ``peaceful'' bomb of 1974.\n\n  That is referring to the fact that the Indians got around the \nviolation by claiming that the bomb they exploded was for peaceful \npurposes. And apparently the United States looked the other way.\n  But the article goes on to note, ``Despite this history, each new \ngeneration of American policymakers thinks that by being a little more \naccommodating''--for countries like India--we will then gain their \nrestraint and their acceptance of the nuclear controls that we would \nlike to place upon them. Of course, India is not alone in this. I am \nnot being any more critical of India than I would be of other countries \nthat would be engaged in the same kind of conduct.\n  But what this article concludes is ``. . .American self-deception \nthat stems from a mix of idealism and commercial greed.'' is the reason \nthese countries have been able to get away with this for so long--\nagain, ``. . .American self-deception that stems from a mix of idealism \nand commercial greed.''\n  Mr. President, that is exactly what we have seen with the desire to \nsell virtually anything to nobody, the argument always being, if we \nwill not sell it to them, then someone else will, which is always an \nexcuse for transferring technology. That we have come to learn with \nsome sadness recently. That should not have been transferred to China, \nfor example.\n  We also find this concept of idealism--that if they will just sign \none more treaty, if we will just get one more commitment from a country \nthat it won't engage in conduct that we believe inimical to world \npeace, that just maybe, therefore, we will have the peace that we so \nearnestly desire.\n  The fact of the matter is that when it comes to a nation's self-\ndefense, it is going to do what it deems in its best interest \nirrespective of a piece of paper, of a treaty, of a commitment, or of a \npromise to the rest of the world, and it is not going to be swayed by \nworld opinion or even by the punishment that nations or organizations \nmay mete out.\n  Thus, India and Pakistan were all too willing to suffer the \nopprobrium of the world community. They were very--I shouldn't say \n``happy''--but they were willing to suffer the constraints of the \neconomic sanctions that are automatically imposed upon them as a result \nof their nuclear programs and their testing, because, first of all, it \nis domestic politics for them, but, even more importantly, they deem it \nto be in their national self-interest for the preservation of their \ncountries.\n\n[[Page S6312]]\n\n  You cannot expect a treaty that has been signed to prevent a country \nfrom doing what it believes is in its national self-interest. To think \nthat the United States could, therefore, dissuade a country like North \nKorea or Iran or Iraq or one of the other so-called rogue nations of \nthe world to forego the development or testing of nuclear weapons if \nonly we could get everybody in the world to sign the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty is, I think, a ludicrous, self-deceptive, naive thought.\n  That is why I thought the article these two gentlemen wrote and was \npublished in the Washington Post today is so interesting, because it \ngives a little bit of perspective. It reminds us of how, with the best \nintentions, we signed treaties in the past. Part of the terms of those \ntreaties was that we would supply atoms for peace, but when a country \ndeemed it to be in their self-interest to use that largesse to develop \ntheir nuclear program, they did it. And after having developed their \nnuclear program, and this having been a violation of the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty, we should not find it as a surprise that they are \nthen going to test those nuclear weapons which would, if these \ncountries were to sign the CTBT, be a violation of that treaty as well.\n  Mr. President, I conclude with this point. There has been some talk \nlately that the explosions of the Pakistani and Indian nuclear devices \nsuggest it is now time for the Senate to take up the CTBT, the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  Exactly the opposite is true, as the distinguished majority leader of \nthe Senate pointed out in a television interview a week ago last \nSunday. He said it is 180 degrees wrong. He said the fact is that these \ntwo tests demonstrate that a test ban treaty will not have any effect \non a country that deems it in its national self-interest to test these \nweapons; that a piece of paper is not going to stop them.\n  It is interesting that in the last 2\\1/2\\ years, during the time that \nthe United States has had a moratorium on testing, and that we have \nsupposedly led world opinion in encouraging other nations not to test, \nfive nations have tested nuclear devices--probably five. We know about \nFrance and China and now India and Pakistan, and perhaps Russia. But, \nyou see, as to verifying whether Russia actually tested at its test \nsite in the Novaya Zemlya, we don't know for sure whether that \nhappened, or at least we can't discuss it publicly because the means \nthat we have for detecting those explosions is not adequate for the \nverification that would be called for under the CTBT.\n  But we know that at least four, if not five, nations have tested, and \nthis is all during the time that the United States has been leading the \nway by not testing, by having a unilateral moratorium here. The only \nother, of course, Great Britain, has acknowledged having nuclear \nweapons that it hasn't tested.\n  So world opinion, leading by example, sanctions, none of these is \nsufficient to prevent a country from doing what it believes is in its \nnational self-interest. As this article points out, you just cannot \nrely upon a treaty or a piece of paper to prevent a country from doing \nwhat it believes it has to do to protect its national security. To do \nso is to fall back on that great American practice of hoping against \nhope and of putting our reliance in idealism and in treaties when, in \nfact, the answer is to always be prepared with an adequate military \ndefense. In this case, of course, the defense is the establishment of a \nmissile defense, which we have got to get on with building.\n  That is a subject for another day, but the bottom line is we can \nalways do what we can do to defend ourselves, such as building a \nmissile defense as opposed to putting our reliance on something over \nwhich we have no control, and that is another country's behavior, even \nin the face of moral condemnation by world opinion and the significant \neconomic sanctions that might be imposed by other countries as well as \nthe United States.\n  As I said, I will put this article in the Record. I urge my \ncolleagues who are interested in the subject to further explore it as \nwe debate the question of whether or not the Senate should take up the \nCTBT. As I said, I agree with the distinguished majority leader that \nthese tests demonstrate that putting any reliance on that agreement \nwould be folly and therefore far from suggesting this is the time to \ntake it up, I suggest it is time to forget about it.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 15, 1998]\n\n                             India Cheated\n\n                (By Victor Gilinsky and Paul Leventhal)\n\n       You wouldn't know it from news reports, but most of the \n     military plutonium stocks India dipped into for its recent \n     nuclear tests came from a research project provided years ago \n     by the United States and Canada. India had promised both \n     countries it would not use this plutonium for bombs.\n       If Washington and Ottawa were now to keep India to its \n     promise, and verify this, India would lose more than half the \n     weapons-grade plutonium for its nuclear bombs and missiles. \n     The United States and Canada should make this an essential \n     condition for the lifting of economic sanctions.\n       The plutonium in question is the approximately 600 pounds--\n     enough for about 50 bombs--produced in India's CIRUS research \n     reactor since it began operating in 1960. This was an ``Atoms \n     for Peace'' reactor built by Canada and made operable by an \n     essential 21 tons of heavy water supplied by the United \n     States. In return for this assistance, India promised both \n     suppliers in writing that the reactor would be reserved for \n     ``peaceful purposes.''\n       India used plutonium from this reactor for its 1974 nuclear \n     explosion. When the facts emerged, Prime Minister Indira \n     Gandhi insisted there had been no violation of the peaceful-\n     use commitments because India had set off a ``peaceful \n     nuclear explosion.'' The Indian scientist then in charge, \n     Raja Ramanna, now has admitted it was a bomb all along. And \n     India now has declared itself a nuclear-weapons state on the \n     basis of its current tests. With the decades-old ``peaceful'' \n     pretense stripped away, the United States and Canada should \n     make unambiguously clear that India may not use CIRUS \n     plutonium for warheads or related research.\n       The fact that neither capital has uttered a peep about this \n     matter is symptomatic of Western complicity in the South \n     Asian nuclear crisis and of the present paralysis in dealing \n     with it. There is also the matter of a 1963 agreement \n     covering two U.S.-supplied nuclear power reactors at Tarapur \n     and their fuel. The radioactive used fuel from these reactors \n     is in storage and contains most of India's ``reactor-grade'' \n     plutonium. India has said it will reprocess the used fuel to \n     extract the plutonium for use as civilian power-reactor fuel. \n     But reactor-grade plutonium also is explosive and once \n     separated, it could be used by India's scientists for rapid \n     deployment in warheads. There is enough Tarapur plutonium for \n     hundreds of them.\n       Under the 1963 agreement, India must get U.S. approval to \n     reprocess. India disputes this and insists it is free to \n     reprocess the used fuel at any time. The State Department, \n     historically reluctant to tangle with India, rationalized \n     Tarapur as an unnecessary irritant in U.S.-India relations \n     and put this disagreement in the sleeping-dogs category.\n       In the history of U.S.-India nuclear relations, nothing \n     stands out so much as India's constancy in pursuing nuclear \n     bomb-making and America's nearsightedness about Indian \n     intentions. India fought to weaken the charter of the new \n     International Atomic Energy Agency in the 1950s. It was \n     duplicitous in carrying out Atoms for Peace agreements in the \n     1960s. It undermined the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty \n     with its ``peaceful'' bomb of 1974.\n       Despite this history, each new generation of American \n     policymakers thinks that by being a little more accommodating \n     it will gain Indian restraint and acceptance of nuclear \n     controls. The Indians (they are not alone in this) have for a \n     long time played on that characteristically American self-\n     deception that stems from a mix of idealism and commercial \n     greed. It is not surprising that the Indians expect the game \n     to continue.\n       The angry congressional reaction to discovering America's \n     role in the 1974 test was the 1978 Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Act. This barred nuclear reactor and fuel exports to \n     countries such as India that refuse to accept full \n     international inspections. But the State Department helped \n     India get around the law by arranging for France and later \n     China to continue the Tarapur fuel supply. Is it any wonder \n     the Indians do not take us seriously?\n       Like India's 1974 test, the 1998 tests present a defining \n     event in U.S. nonproliferation policy. We have failed to \n     react sharply enough to head off Pakistani tests. But we \n     still can be taken seriously in this region and by other \n     aspiring nuclear states such as Iran. At a minimum we should \n     insist that Indian plutonium covered by ``peaceful purposes'' \n     agreements be unavailable for warheads, and that Tarapur fuel \n     is not reprocessed to extract plutonium. This is by no means \n     the whole answer, but there is no point in trying to \n     ``engage'' India is new nuclear limitations if we do not \n     enforce existing agreements.\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, last Thursday, before Secretary of \nTreasury Robert Rubin began testifying before the Senate Finance \nCommittee, it is interesting to reflect on the status of the Japanese \nyen. At that time, it was trading at 141 to the dollar. During the \nhearing, I had an opportunity to ask Secretary Rubin whether or not the \nUnited States would intervene to stabilize the yen, and Secretary Rubin \ncorrectly observed that with the hundreds of billions, if not trillions \nof dollars and yen trading around the world on a daily basis, central \nbank intervention can only stabilize a currency for a very short period \nof time. It is further interesting to note, upon the completion of the \nSecretary's comments the yen fell to 144 to the dollar. So clearly \nthere is a question of confidence.\n  On Friday, the Government of Japan announced that the Japanese \neconomy had met the standard definition of a recession; that is, two-\nquarters of negative growth. Unemployment in Japan is at its post-1950s \nrecord of 4.1 percent, which in Japan is extraordinarily high, with \nyouth unemployment exceeding 9 percent.\n  As of this morning, the yen has fallen through the 146 level. The \nJapanese stock market was within 2 percent of a 52-week low. Moreover, \nthe stock markets--Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, South Korea and \nThailand--have all hit 52-week lows. Mr. President, it is clear that \nAsia has yet to turn itself around from the crisis that started well \nover a year ago, and the biggest reason Asia is tumbling is because the \nJapanese Government has failed to face up to the realities of its \ncrumbling economy, especially the dismal state of its banking sector. \nSo long as Japan fails to take decisive action in the banking sector, \nthe yen is very likely to plunge further as lack of confidence \nprevails, carrying with it the threat to all Asian economies of \ndeflation and further currency devaluations. I think you would agree \nthat all Americans should be very concerned about this crisis in Asia, \nand particularly in Japan.\n  Japan is the second largest economy in the world and imports more \nthan $66 billion in goods from the United States. Moreover, Japan is a \nmajor importer from the rest of Asia, and if its economy continues in \nrecession, the rest of Asia will remain mired in economic decline which \ncould lead to political instability, not unlike what we recently \nwitnessed in Indonesia.\n  The reality of the yen decreasing in value is very simple, Mr. \nPresident. Eighteen months ago, the yen was about 80. A year ago, it \nwas a little over 100. At that time, it took 80 yen to buy a U.S. lamp. \nToday, it takes 146 yen. As a consequence, we are not selling any lamps \nor much of anything else in Japan.\n  Alan Greenspan recently noted:\n\n       Without first fixing its banking sector, Japan has little \n     hope of fueling economic recovery.\n\n  An editorial in today's New York Times, commenting on Japan's \nrecession, states:\n\n       The first priority for Japanese officials must be to save \n     the country's sick banking system.\n\n  Ever since the so-called bubble economy burst in Japan 7 years ago, \nthe banking system has been carrying bad loans on its books from the \ndays of heady land and financial speculation.\n  As a former banker with 25 years of experience in commercial banking, \nI can tell you what happens when these loans become nonperforming. When \nthe payments cannot be made, of course, the interest can't be paid as \nwell. More often than not, the bank simply adds the past-due interest \nto the principal and brings the loan current, and the loan appears \ncurrent on the books when, in reality, it is a nonperforming loan and, \nin many cases, a loss.\n  Since 1991, the Japanese Government has promised time and time again \nto reform financial sectors within the country, but it has yet to \nfulfill its promise. Instead, I believe that the Government has always \nbelieved it could say one thing and do another or, in this case, simply \nrely on exports to stimulate the economy. The reality is that it will \nnot and has not worked in the past.\n  In January, Japan's Ministry of Finance announced that the number of \nproblem loans was $577 billion, of which at least $85 billion had \nalready gone bad or were insolvent. The remaining, nearly $500 billion, \nhad the potential to go bad as well. Some analysts believe the value of \nthe problem loans today in Japan is closer to $700 billion.\n  Following this report, the Japanese Government announced a large bank \nbailout, but since then almost nothing has been done to implement it. \nThe sick banks stay open and the economy continues to hemorrhage.\n  In Japan today, short-term interest rates are at their lowest level \never since economic statistics have been recorded. Short-term loans \ncarry interest rates--interest rates, Mr. President--below 1 percent. \nImagine that the yield on a long-term, 10-year Japanese Government bond \nis an incredible 1.3 percent. With interest this low, it is hard to \nimagine why Japan is sinking into a recession.\n  Yet, in a recent poll, 95 percent of Japanese companies interviewed \ncomplained about the difficulty of receiving loans from Japanese banks. \nThe explanation is simple: The banks are fearful of making new loans. \nThere is a credit crunch in Japan because of the overhang of all the \nbad debt that is being carried on the banks' books already. So long as \nthis overhang continues, Japan will continue to fall further into \nrecession.\n  Mr. President, the Japanese can learn a valuable lesson from our bad \nexperience with the failed savings and loans in the United States. When \nthe S crisis first began to be felt in 1985, it was debated at great \nlength here on this floor. Congress and the President refused to face \nthe crisis and did not provide the sufficient funds to close the failed \nS This only prolonged the crisis and ballooned the cost of the \nbailout to the taxpayer.\n  When we first recognized the difficulty with the failing savings and \nloans, the estimated loss at that time was $25 billion to $30 billion. \nBut we in the United States did not take our medicine in a timely \nmanner and the S bailout ultimately cost the taxpayers of this \ncountry more than $200 billion.\n\n  We finally did face the S problem. The longer we put it off, the \nmore it cost. We created the Resolution Trust Corporation. We closed \ndown the failed banks and consolidated others. After several years, we \nfinally put the S crisis behind us, because we recognized that \nkeeping sick financial institutions open only exacerbates the problem \nand costs more to the taxpayer.\n  By contrast, the Japanese banks and their regulators have for years \ntried to hide their financial problems. In order to help cover up the \ninsolvency problems of Japanese banks, just before the end of the \nfiscal year, in March, the Ministry of Finance changed the accounting \nrules affecting the so-called BIS ratio, a ratio used by international \nmarkets as a bellwether of financial health of the banks. This ratio \nsays that shareholder equity--or assets minus liabilities--should at \nleast equal 8 percent of the weighted assets, or typically the \noutstanding loans.\n  The changes allowed the banks to use the purchase price of their \nstock portfolios as the asset value when the stocks' prices have \nfallen. Since many of these stocks were bought in the heyday of the \nJapanese bubble economy, this enabled the Japanese banks to look \nhealthy when, in fact, they were sick. Indeed, they are very sick, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Moreover, the Government attempted to manipulate the end-of-March \nstock prices by buying up shares on the open market. Neither of these \nactions suggest that the Japanese Government is serious about making \nbanking changes in conformity with good accounting practices.\n  Until Japan faces up to its banking crisis, things are going to get \nworse, not only in Japan but throughout Asia, because of the importance \nof the Japanese economy to the rest of Asia.\n  Another looming threat to Asia lies in China which also faces a \nseriously dangerous banking situation. I was over in Beijing and \nShanghai towards\n\n[[Page S6314]]\n\nthe end of the year. It is amazing to see the number of huge high-rises \nwith very little occupancy as they attempt to negotiate the rent to a \nlevel to get people in them, regardless of if it makes financial sense.\n  By some estimates, China has as much as $250 billion in doubtful \nloans. The Government-controlled Chinese banking system has been \ndirecting funds to favored companies regardless of the economics. In \nChina's case, 70 percent of the state-owned banking loans go to \ninefficient and near-bankrupt state-owned enterprises. The Government \nis attempting to encourage foreign ownership coming into China, but \nthere is a great reluctance on the part of U.S. firms to come in and \nshare the debt associated with those opportunities.\n  In any event, Mr. President, as a result, an estimated three out of \nfour state commercial banks are now believed to be insolvent in China. \nChina has announced their intention to reform their banking system, but \nwith the Asian economy weakening and Japan in recession, China may wait \ntoo long to make the tough changes, and then those changes become that \nmuch tougher.\n  In the end, we could find the two largest economies in Asia in \nrecession, and I think this is very likely. My experience in finance \ntells me that when you have bad financial news, if you can take the hit \nup front and get on with it, as opposed to bearing it and putting it \noff, you will be much better off. That is not what is happening in Asia \nin either the case of China or Japan. There is a great reluctance to \nface up to the realities and take the medicine to change the banking \nsystem and get them back on a functional basis. This would shore up the \neconomy in Asia.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, our own U.S. economy is, more than ever, \nlinked to the world economy. So I can only hope that the Japanese \nGovernment and the Chinese Government will accept the problems in their \nsystem and make the necessary changes before the cost becomes too \ngreat, before the cost affects the U.S. economy and the U.S. taxpayer.\n  Mr. President, neither Japan nor China is going to survive this \ncrisis merely by devaluing their currency and trying to export their \nway out of their economic problems. When we see both countries taking \nserious steps to address their failed financial institutions, as they \nare currently structured, and bringing greater transparency to their \nbanking systems, then at last we will know that Asia is beginning to \nturn the corner.\n  Mr. President, I suggest they start now without further delay.\n  I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, a couple of weeks ago a couple of Members \nof Congress came to the floor of the Congress to announce Bob Hope's \ndeath. Bob Hope was having breakfast in California at the time. This \nweekend, we had some legislators talking about the tobacco bill and \npredicting that the tobacco bill was dead. Well, the tobacco bill, or \nthe tobacco legislation, that is being debated by the U.S. Senate is \nnot exactly having breakfast--clearly, this has been a struggle to get \na piece of legislation through the Senate dealing with the tobacco \nissue--but, the tobacco bill is not dead by any means. I hope that \nthose who tell the American people that the Senate cannot pass a \ntobacco bill will understand that the Senate fully intends to pass \nlegislation dealing with tobacco.\n  I want to describe just for a moment why I think those who predict \nits death are wrong, and why those who call this a bad bill are wrong, \nand why those who believe that Congress will eventually not act on \ntobacco are wrong.\n  Let me go back to the start of this issue. Why are we debating a \ntobacco bill? Why tobacco legislation? Simply put, it is because we now \nknow things we did not know 25, 50, and 100 years ago about tobacco. We \nknow that tobacco can kill you. The use of tobacco, we know, causes \nfrom 300,000 to 400,000 Americans a year to die from smoking and \nsmoking-related causes.\n  Tobacco is a legal product and will remain a legal product. But we \nalso know that it is illegal for kids to smoke, and we know that \ntobacco companies have targeted our children to addict them to \nnicotine.\n  The majority leader this weekend said, ``Well, the tobacco bill is so \nbad that it should not be passed in its current form,'' and so on and \nso forth, and ``If we can't get to a conclusion on it this week, we've \ngot to move on.'' That is another way of saying, ``We're going to leave \nthis carcass in the middle of the road and just drive forward.''\n  Fortunately, we learn a lot as we go along here in this country and \nin life. One of the things we ought to learn is, this piece of \nlegislation dealing with tobacco, and especially dealing with the \ntobacco industry targeting America's children--we must resolve this \nissue; we must pass this legislation.\n  Let me describe for my colleagues some of the evidence that has been \nunearthed from depositions and from court suits, and so on, in recent \nmonths.\n  A 1972 document by a tobacco company, Brown & Williamson. It says:\n\n       It's a well-known fact that teenagers like sweet products. \n     Honey might be considered.\n\n  Talking about sweetening cigarettes because teenagers like sweeter \nproducts--does that sound like a company that is interested in \naddicting kids to their product?\n  How about Kool--the cigarette Kool?\n\n       KOOL has shown little or no growth in share of users in the \n     26 [and up] age group.\n\n  This was written by a Brown & Williamson person. It is a memo from \n1973. It says:\n\n       . . . at the present rate, a smoker in the 16-25 year age \n     group will soon be three times as important to KOOL as a \n     prospect in any other . . . age category.\n\n  Talking about their 16-year-old customers for Kool cigarettes.\n\n       Marlboro's phenomenal growth rate in the past has been \n     attributable in large part to our high market penetration \n     among young smokers . . . 15 to 19 years old . . .\n\n  This is according to a report by a Philip Morris researcher.\n  You say that they are not targeting kids?\n  1974, R.J. Reynolds. A marketing plan submitted to the board of \ndirectors of the company says:\n\n       As this 14-24 age group matures, they will account for a \n     key share of the total cigarette volume--[in the] next 25 \n     years.\n\n\n[[Page S6315]]\n\n\n  Or if you are still unconvinced--that there is no need here; that the \nindustry has not targeted our children--how about a Lorillard \nexecutive, a cigarette company executive, in 1978:\n\n       The base of our business is the high-school student.\n\n  A cigarette company executive saying, ``The base of our business is \nthe high-school student.''\n  Philip Morris, 1979, says:\n\n       Marlboro dominates in the 17 and younger category, \n     capturing over 50 percent of this market.\n\n  It is like they should have a fiesta here. They capture over 50 \npercent of the 17-year-old and under market. And you say the industry \nisn't targeting kids?\n  Well, cigarette smoking is addictive. It is legal but addictive.\n  Here is something that was picked up this morning. It is actually a \npiece from Marlboro. It talks about river rafting, cookouts, fly-\nfishing, bonfires, mountain biking, and bands. And it is advertising, \nof course, cigarettes. It has the warning, as we require by law, \n``Surgeon General's warning: Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, \nemphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.''\n  The question for the Congress is: Do we want an industry to try to \naddict our children to this product? And the answer is no. And if not, \nif we do not want the industry to continue to do that--and they have in \nthe past; the evidence is quite clear--if we do not want them to \ncontinue to do that, if it is our position that it is wrong for the \nindustry to target children--and that is our position--then the \nquestion is, What are we going to do about that? Is the Congress going \nto pass a piece of legislation that prohibits this industry from \ntargeting our children? And that is the legislation that is on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  Some do not like it; and some, for their own reasons, want to kill \nit. But they will be on the wrong side of history if they succeed in \nkilling this legislation.\n  Oh, we have done a lot of things over the years that were \ncontroversial at the time we did them. Even things like giving women \nthe right to vote in this country was controversial, wasn't it? For \nmore than half of this country's history, women were not allowed to \nvote. Or skip forward to the Civil Rights Act of the early 1960s. Who \nin this Chamber now would decide that the things that we provided for \nin the Civil Rights Act in the early 1960s they would now support? A \ngood number of them opposed it back then.\n\n  Things like requiring labels on food--that was controversial. \nRequiring companies that produce our food in the grocery store to \nactually put something on the label that states the fat content, the \nsodium content, or the carbohydrates--that was big government intruding \non those who manufacture the food. How could we require that someone \nput on the can of peas what is in that can of peas? We did it.\n  Now you can go down the grocery store aisle and see traffic jams of \npeople, taking that can or package, and trying to figure out what is in \nit, how much fat it contains, how much sodium is in a product. It was \ncontroversial at the time.\n  A lot of things that were controversial at the time turned out to \nhave been the right thing. The tobacco bill will turn out to be the \nright piece of legislation for this country.\n  How many in this Chamber who spend a lot of time on airplanes \nremember, going back 10 or 20 years, getting in the middle seat of a \n727 and as the airplane takes off, the person in the seats on the \nright-hand side and the left-hand side light up their cigarettes. \nBecause then there were no restrictions on smoking anywhere on \nairplanes? Eventually they put the smokers in the back of the plane. \nThat meant everybody breathed the same smoke, although they were \nseparated by distance. Then, finally, you shall not smoke on airplanes \nin this country. It was controversial at the time. I voted for that. It \nwas the right thing to do.\n  This piece of legislation on the floor of the Senate talks of a range \nof issues, most especially the issue of teen smoking. In an industry \nthat knows the only customers it has access to are kids--because almost \nno one reaches adult age in this country and tries to figure out what \nthey have missed in life and comes up with the idea of smoking; nobody \n30 or 40 years old says what will really enrich my life is if I started \nsmoking--kids are the only source of new customers for tobacco \ncompanies. The tobacco companies say it themselves in the research \nmaterial we have provided.\n  This legislation provides a range of programs, including providing \nsmoking cessation programs, trying to help people who are now addicted \nto quit; prohibits advertising that targets our children; provides for \ncounteradvertising, that actually tells our kids that smoking is not \ncool and that smoking can cause lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema \nand so on.\n  The resources in this bill help us invest in the National Institutes \nof Health to continue to develop the breathtaking achievements in \nmedical research that we see day after day and month after month in the \nNational Institutes of Health. It seems to me this is a remarkable \nbargain for the American people.\n  This legislation, I think viewed 10 years from now, will be seen as \nsomething that was right for the time. Ten years from now, those who \nvote against this legislation will say, ``How on Earth did I ever come \nto that conclusion?'' Of course it made sense for us as a country to \ndecide cigarette companies cannot target our children. Of course it \nmade sense for us to have counteradvertising and smoking cessation \nprograms and more investment in the National Institutes of Health to \ndeal with the range of medical problems caused by smoking. Of course \nthat made sense.\n  So let me conclude by saying that those who this weekend were on the \ntalk shows and were speaking to the press about what will happen to \nthis tobacco bill, they have prematurely announced its death. This \ntobacco bill is not dead. There are some who wish it were dead. There \nare some who this week will work against it and will try with every bit \nof energy they have to kill it, but they will not succeed because this \nis the right thing to do. We have made the case effectively that at \nthis time in this country we ought not allow the tobacco industry to \ntarget our kids to the addiction of cigarettes. This piece of \nlegislation moves us in that direction in a very, very significant way.\n  The majority leader and others who speak about this legislation need \nnow, I think, to provide some leadership to help us pass this \nlegislation. A bipartisan group of Senators, including Senator McCain, \nwho has spent a great deal of time on this legislation and someone for \nwhom I have great admiration and I commend him for his work, Senator \nConrad on our side and others, a great many people have spent a lot of \ntime crafting this in a bipartisan way. Now we need this week to finish \na job and pass it through the Senate and get it to a conference with \nthe House so that the American people can look at the job the Congress \nhas done. And then make the judgment that they have done a good job on \nbehalf of our children, they have stood up for our children and have \ntold an industry that addicted our children, you can't do that anymore; \nwe are not going to let you do that anymore. That is the right position \nfor our country.\n\n  I know that the Senator from Rhode Island is about to talk about an \namendment, I think, that he has pending in the Senate. Let me, as I \nconclude, also commend him for the work he has done. The Senator from \nRhode Island, the Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, and a number \nof others have worked a great deal on this legislation, including the \nSenator from Massachusetts, and I mentioned the Senator from Arizona, \nSenator McCain.\n  This is a tough piece of legislation. The toughest thing in the world \nis to propose. The easiest thing in the world is to oppose. It doesn't \ntake any skill to oppose. I think it was Mark Twain who once was asked \nif he would be involved in a debate and he immediately accepted, \n``provided I can take the opposing side.'' They said, ``You don't even \nknow the subject of the debate,'' and he says, ``I don't have to, as \nlong as I am on the opposing side.''\n  It takes no time to prepare. We are proposing a piece of legislation \nin the Senate dealing with smoking, tobacco and children that is right \nfor the time. Those who stand in its way will be on the wrong side of \nhistory. Those who predict its death are dead wrong, because we fully \naim, this week or next\n\n[[Page S6316]]\n\nweek, to pass this legislation through the U.S. Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. As an initial point, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nTim Johnson as a cosponsor of the Reed amendment, amendment numbered \n2702.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, first let me commend my colleague, the \nSenator from North Dakota, for his fine words and also for his \ncommendation. He has been, also, a leader in this effort to try to pass \na balanced, yet very effective, tobacco legislation.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2702\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, before this body today is my amendment which \nwould deny the deductibility of advertising expenses to the tobacco \nindustry if they did not follow the FDA rules with respect to \nadvertising.\n  The FDA, after very careful rulemaking, promulgated a series of rules \nwhich would proscribe advertising directed at children. Among these \nrules are limiting tobacco billboards to a distance further than 1,000 \nfeet from a school. It will require the publication of advertisements \nin youth-oriented magazines to be in black and white text only. It \nwould dispense with some of the other staples of advertising that the \nindustry is using.\n  As the Senator from North Dakota has pointed out and as I pointed out \nin my remarks last Friday, there is clear, convincing, overwhelming \nevidence that for decades the tobacco industry has deliberately, \nrelentlessly, and ruthlessly targeted children in their advertising. It \nis not an accident. It is not a coincidence. It is not the collateral \neffect of trying to reach the 21- to 25-year-old market. It is very \npurposeful, very deliberate, and, regrettably, very effective.\n  In the course of the debate over the last several weeks we have taken \ndiversions through many different areas. We are talking about tax \npolicy. We are talking about child care policy. We are talking about \nhow we spend these resources, whether this is an inappropriate tax. I \nthink it is helpful to refocus why we are here. We are here because the \ntobacco industry, as I mentioned before, has, over decades, targeted \nyoung people for their advertising. They are attempting, and succeeding \ntoo well, to literally entice young people as young as 12 and 13 years \nold into smoking cigarettes and using other tobacco products.\n  I think that is wrong. I think the vast majority of the Americans \nthink that is wrong. I think the vast majority of my colleagues in the \nSenate feel it is wrong. We can do something about it. As we have \ndiscussed all of these different issues of tax policy, fiscal policy, \nregulatory policy, it sometimes helps to remind all of us what the \nindustry is doing.\n  I had a very graphic reminder sent to me by one of my constituents \nfrom Rhode Island. I mentioned this last week. This is a very slick, \nsophisticated, mailing piece, sent to his son, a 16-year-old junior in \nhigh school. I have blown it up here so the audience can see in larger \ndetail what I am talking about. Again, this was sent to a 16-year-old. \nIt was sent addressed to him, personally. It wasn't ``occupant,'' or \n``resident.'' It was addressed to him.\n  As a first point, I can recall as a youngster when I ever got mail it \nwas a big occasion. To think that someone would actually want to send \nme a letter, particularly a big company like the Brown & Williamson \nTobacco company was a big occasion.\n  The first part of it grabs your attention: ``We know you like it \nloud.'' How do they know they like it loud? Because he essentially was \ncontacted and solicited because this young man went to a rock concert \nwhich Brown & Williamson sponsored the preceding summer. This is not \ncoincidence, either. Their decision to sponsor a rock concert that \nattracts, as the father said in the letter, a majority of the audience \nbeing 18 or younger, much younger in some cases, was very \ndeliberate. It wasn't spur of the moment. They sat around a conference \nroom on Wall Street and Madison Avenue saying, ``How do we get our \ntarget population? How do we reach them and make contact with them? \nAnd, oh, by the way, how do we draw them into this addiction of \nsmoking?''\n\n  So he received this mailing at home. You open it up. It is three \ndimensional. I know in the course of some of my campaigns I have used \nthem in mailings to my constituents. This is a very expensive, very \nprofessional, and very sophisticated mailing. It is a very targeted \nmailing.\n  Then you read the narrative. ``You like it loud''; and ``very, very \nsmooth.'' ``Kick back today and enjoy a bold treat. Refreshing menthol, \nand a coupon to save you some change. Relax with Kool, and slip into \nsomething smooth.''\n  You are overwhelmed by this message. The message is not about the \nstatistics, or the smoking, or the dangers of smoking, the information \nhe or she would want as a rationale consumer if he or she were making a \ndecision to smoke. You are being overwhelmed by I would argue \nmisinformation. Oh, yes, there is the required Surgeon General warning \nhere. ``Warning: Smoking greatly increases serious risk to your \nhealth.''\n  If you are 16 years old, do you really believe that, when everything \nelse is talking about your favorite rock group, talking about how ``we \nsupport'' that rock group in the concert, how you are part of this \n``loud'' generation, how you like it ``smooth'' personally directed to \nyou? I don't think so. And the most ironic part of all of this is this \nmessage says ``quitting smoking'' will help your health. This message \ndown here says, ``We will give you a buck, kid, if you buy two packs of \nour cigarettes.'' What a deal.\n  This is what we are talking about in this tobacco bill. We are \ntalking about an industry that has deliberately, repeatedly attempted \nto market the kid shamelessly; without shame.\n  This took place 6 months ago at the same time they were talking about \ntheir arrangement with the attorneys general; at the same time they \nknew we were going to be debating tobacco legislation on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate. And yet they continued to try to sell their ware to \nkids.\n  You know, people get addicted to cigarettes. I think the industry is \naddicted to children. They just can't leave them alone. They just have \nto keep selling to them, even when common sense would say let off while \nthe smoke clears. No pun intended. They can't stop because their \ncustomer base is hooking these kids. You hook a 16-year-old child, and \nthat is 10, 20, 30 years of customer for your brand. Of course, we know \nthat one out of three of these children will die prematurely. We know \nthat 5 million people under 18 years of age today will die prematurely \nbecause they are addicted to cigarettes and other tobacco. But they \ndon't want you to know that. They want you to think this is cool, this \nis smooth, and there is the whole adult world opening up for you. ``You \ncan be as successful and as attractive and as desirable as any rock \nstar. You just have to smoke our cigarettes.'' That is wrong.\n  This is just one example of what goes on. It is ubiquitous \nthroughout. This is a promotion by Winston. Winston's, by the way, are \nthe new health food of America. You see their ads. Smoking it is like \neating health food; no additives; no anything; it is macrobiological; \nwhatever. Again, they are taking an approach now with their campaign, \nwhich is making their product look like it is healthy for you; it is \nwhat you would buy if you were a research scientist trying to develop \nthe best diet in the world. But they have sponsorship for NASCAR \nracing, which is a venerable tradition in this country. For the Winston \nCup, they are sponsoring it. Not all; you could not argue that all of \nthe people who attend these races are young people. But we also must \nrecognize that this is a very attractive event for young people. There \nmust be something here.\n  I read a few weeks ago in the New York Times that Mattel, Inc., is \nthinking of creating a NASCAR Barbie doll, the most popular toy in the \nworld, because they figured it out, too. There are lots of young girls \nwho are attracted to this whole scene of NASCAR racing and a NASCAR \nBarbie is going to be a very popular toy. The same type of calculations \nthat are going on at Mattel are going on in some cases up in the \ncigarette headquarters of the world. But one should say, of course,\n\n[[Page S6317]]\n\nthat the Barbie doll is a much more benign figure in American life than \ncigarettes. But this is ubiquitous. Our children are being subjected to \nthis constantly.\n  My amendment simply says, listen, the FDA, after rulemaking at \nlength, has come up with very reasonable restraints on tobacco \nadvertising. If you follow those restraints, you will receive your full \ndeduction. But if you violate them, you will lose your deduction. I \nbelieve most of my constituents would say the same thing, that we \nshould not be subsidizing the tobacco industry as they attempt to lure \nour children into smoking. The industry spends about $5.9 billion a \nyear on advertising. We kick back, if you will, about $1.6 billion \nthrough the deduction. That is money that, I think, is poorly spent. \nBut as long as the industry is willing to refrain from targeting \nchildren I don't think we can object because it is available to other \nindustries. But if they persist in targeting children and not following \nFDA regulations, then I believe we should act very strongly, very \nvigorously, and deny them this deduction.\n  By the way, too, independently, my amendment would not restrict \nspeech whatsoever. Of course we have tobacco concerned any time the \nGovernment attempts to invoke any type of restriction on speech. But \ntaken by itself, my amendment would simply say you can say anything you \nwant. You can even promote your product using this. But don't charge \nthe Government for your deduction. You can do it on your own money.\n  My amendment has been criticized on a couple of points, which I would \nlike to respond to. First, there are many of my colleagues who say we \nshouldn't really do anything unless it is voluntary, because, if we do, \nthe tobacco industry will sue us and we will be tied up in court for 10 \nyears.\n  The reality is the tobacco industry is already suing the FDA, and not \njust the tobacco industry, but the advertising interests are all there, \nand it is absolutely their right. They feel strongly that not only \ncommercial interests are at stake but also constitutional interests. \nBut to deflect or defer from doing something today vigorously about \ntobacco access to children simply because we might be sued is \nabsolutely, I think, an implausible and inappropriate comment. We will \nbe sued perhaps, but we have to act to ensure that we do what is right \nfor the children of America.\n  The other approach is suggesting that the Supreme Court decisions \nplace a much higher standard when you come to restricting commercial \nspeech. Specifically, the case of 44 Liquormart, Inc. versus Rhode \nIsland. I feel somewhat familiar with the case. It originated in my \nhome State. Actually it originated and the legislation was passed in \n1956 in Rhode Island. Although I served in the assembly in Rhode \nIsland, I was not there in 1956. I was in grammar school in 1956. But \nthis legislation that Rhode Island passed prevented the publication of \nprice information with respect to liquor advertising.\n  Stepping back a bit, I think the judges probably got the same sense \nthat I did when I read the statute in this case and realized what might \nbe afoot; that it is equally likely that this legislation was passed 40 \nyears ago not so much to increase temperance in Rhode Island but simply \nto prevent discount liquor stores from encroaching on established \nliquor stores. So right away, there is a suspicion about the underlying \nstatute in 44 Liquormart.\n  But, first, let me say something about that case. The Supreme Court \nreaffirmed the doctrine associated with Central Hudson, which is the \nleading case on commercial speech, and they said essentially one may \nrestrict commercial speech, first, if it is unlawful; or, it \nmisrepresents significantly the product. Even if it doesn't do so, one \nmay restrict it if there is a substantial governmental interest at \nstake. The legislation directly affects that interest. And the means \nare no more restrictive than necessary to accomplish the governmental \ninterests. So the Central Hudson test is in place and remains.\n  In 44 Liquormart, the Court found essentially that the State of Rhode \nIsland made no showing that their proposed legislation materially and \ndirectly advanced the goal of decreasing the consumption of alcohol. In \nfact, there was no evidence submitted in the record to show that this \nwould have any effect at all on alcohol consumption in the State of \nRhode Island. Alternatively, the Court discussed the fact that there \nwere other means possibly available that had not even been used. On \nthose factual bases, together with the Central Hudson doctrine, they \ndeclared that the statute was impermissible encroachment on commercial \nspeech.\n  The case is much different here. The FDA has established a record \nthat advertising decisively affects children's choices to begin to \nsmoke cigarettes, and by maintaining appropriate restrictions on \nadvertising, we can, in fact, directly affect the behavior of children \nwith respect to cigarettes. This is not based upon whimsy. The FDA \nrelied on at least two major studies: a study at the Institute of \nMedicine in 1994, and the Surgeon General's report in 1994. Both \nconcluded that advertising was an important factor in young people's \ntobacco use. Moreover, these reports indicated that advertising \nrestrictions must be a part of any meaningful approach to reduce \nunderage smoking.\n  So this is not a situation of trying something that has not been \ntested or has not been tried by other means. Their conclusion \nauthoritatively is that these types of restrictions must be in place.\n  I should also remind you that we have tried other ways to moderate \nthe consumption of tobacco products in this country. In the early \n1970s, we banned television advertising of tobacco products.\n  But as Robert Pitofsky, the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, \npointed out, what happened is the industry simply shifted to other \nforms of advertising. When I was a kid back in the 1950s and the 1960s, \nyou would see TV advertising, but you would be very, very shocked if \nyou could have a record of direct mail pieces sent to 16-year-olds, as \nhappens today. And the sponsorship of NASCAR racing--all of these \nthings are a direct result. In fact, cigarette advertising has \nexploded. From 1975 to 1995, 20 years, it has increased manyfold--going \ninto not only these types of promotions, but also all the gadgets and \nall the other rigmarole that the industry is promoting.\n  This is a Camel cash collectible. Now you can get Joe Camel T-shirts, \nand Joe Camel lighters, and Joe Camel dart boards, and Joe Camel \nposters, and Joe Camel everything--wristwatches, you name it. That, \ntoo, is part of the ubiquitous promotion of tobacco. And although it \nsays very precisely, ``Offer restricted to smokers 18 years of age or \nolder,'' I dare say I see more kids with Joe Camel T-shirts and bicycle \ncaps and things like that than I do 40-year-olds, 30-year-olds, or even \n20-year-olds.\n  So what the intent is, we will let the consumer decide.\n  Furthermore, when the FDA promulgated its regulations, they went on \nvery clearly to state what was happening here.\n\n       Collectively, the studies show that children and \n     adolescents are widely exposed to, aware of, respond \n     favorably to, and are influenced by cigarette advertising. \n     One study found that 30 percent of 3-year-olds and 91 percent \n     of 6-year-olds identified Joe Camel as a symbol of smoking.\n\n  Thirty percent of 3-year-old toddlers knew that Joe Camel, that \ncuddly cartoon character, was associated with smoking. Ninety-one \npercent of 6-year-olds, in the first grade of school, might not know \ntheir ABCs, but they know that Joe Camel and smoking go together.\n  That is not good. That is what we are talking about here, and that is \nwhy, unless we effectively and dramatically affect the advertising of \ntobacco products to children, we will never turn the table on this \nepidemic of smoking among young people.\n  Mr. President, I have other comments I wish to make, but I notice \nthat my colleague, the Senator from South Dakota, is here, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the Chair.\n  I thank the Senator from Rhode Island, my friend and colleague, Mr. \nReed. I commend him for this particular amendment. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of this amendment.\n  If you were to talk to a typical South Dakotan and say, ``You know, \nthe Federal budget is tight this year; we may\n\n[[Page S6318]]\n\nnot have the resources we need to do all we would like to do in terms \nof cancer or heart research at the National Institutes of Health; we \nmay not be able to do all we would like to do for education, for health \ncare; we may not be able to do all that we want for child care; and, \noh, by the way, we do have some $1.6 billion of your tax money we are \ngoing to turn back to the tobacco industry as a subsidy for their \nmarketing messages to our children,'' I guarantee you, the typical \nSouth Dakotan would be appalled. He would be amazed that any \ninstitution could possibly have come up with a priority as wrong-headed \nas that.\n  And so, Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nReed amendment which would deny tobacco companies any tax deduction for \ntheir advertising and promotional expenses when those ads are aimed at \nAmerica's most impressionable group, its children. This amendment has \nthe overwhelming support of the public health community, and it would \ngreatly strengthen the underlying McCain bill. I congratulate my \ncolleague from Rhode Island on this amendment.\n\n  It is almost incomprehensible to me that taxpayers actually subsidize \nthe tobacco industry's promotional efforts even as we go about forming \na consensus on the dangers of smoking and the problems created by the \nindustry's efforts to target children.\n  Numerous studies have implicated the tobacco industry's advertising \nand promotional activities as the cause of continued increases in youth \nsmoking rates in recent years. Research on smoking demonstrates that \nincreases in youth smoking directly coincide with effective tobacco \npromotional campaigns.\n  We simply have to address the industry's ceaseless efforts to market \nto children. It is time for this Congress to put a stop to the \nindustry's practice of luring children into what is an untimely \nprogression of disease and death.\n  Under this amendment, if the tobacco manufacturers do not comply with \nthe advertising restrictions as promulgated by the FDA, the \nmanufacturer's ability to deduct the cost of tobacco advertising and \npromotional expenses will then be disallowed for that particular year. \nThis approach has overwhelming support of the public health community, \nsupported by Dr. C. Everett Koop, the American Lung Association, the \nCenter for Tobacco-Free Kids, and ENACT Coalition, a coalition \ncomprised of leading public health groups including the American Cancer \nSociety, American Heart Association, and many others.\n  Mr. President, the importance of this issue is simply enormous. The \nfacts speak for themselves. Today, some 50 million Americans are \naddicted to tobacco. One of every three long-term users of tobacco will \ndie from a disease related to their tobacco use. About three-quarters, \n70 percent, of smokers want to quit, but fewer than one-quarter are \nsuccessful in doing so. Tobacco addiction is clearly a problem that \nbegins with children. Almost 90 percent of adult smokers started using \ntobacco at or before the age of 18. The average youth smoker begins at \nage 13 and becomes a daily smoker by 14\\1/2\\.\n  Each year, 1 million children in our Nation become regular smokers. \nOne-third of them will die prematurely of lung cancer, emphysema, and \nsimilar tobacco-caused diseases. Unless current trends are reversed, 5 \nmillion kids currently under 18 will die prematurely from tobacco-\nrelated disease.\n  So, Mr. President, this is a public health crisis. A recent survey by \nthe University of Michigan found that daily smoking among 12th graders \nincreased from 17.2 percent in 1992 to 22.2 percent in 1996 and \ncontinued to climb in 1997 to 24.4 percent. This represents a \ncumulative 43-percent increase in daily smoking among our Nation's high \nschool seniors just over these past 5 years.\n  One of the advertising campaigns most markedly aimed at young people \nis the now notorious Joe Camel campaign that my colleague has alluded \nto. After R.J. Reynolds introduced this campaign, Camel's market share \namong underage smokers jumped from 3 percent to over 13 percent in just \n3 years. Although Congress had banned cigarette advertising on TV in \n1970, tobacco companies routinely circumvented this restriction through \nsponsorship of sporting events that gave their products exposure \nthrough television.\n  The Federal Government subsidizes advertising through a tax \ndeduction, generally a 35-percent deduction, for advertising expenses. \nIn 1995, this subsidy cost the American taxpayers approximately $1.6 \nbillion. In terms of lost revenue to the Federal Treasury, this is a \nvery significant sum of money. In effect, the Federal Government is \nsubsidizing industry's advertising costs. For example, in 1995 the cost \nof the cigarette advertising deduction covered the total amount spent \nby the industry on coupons, multipack promotions, and retail value-\nadded items such as key chains and other point-of-sale advertising, the \nkind of items that are most attractive to children.\n\n  In 1995, the tobacco industry spent $4.9 billion on advertising, \ndouble the total Federal Government appropriation for the National \nCancer Institute in fiscal year 1995, $2.1 billion, and almost four \ntimes the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute appropriation, which \ntotaled $1.3 billion that year. In 1995, the tobacco industry spent \nthis $4.9 billion on advertising, 40 times the amount spent by the NIH \non lung cancer research during that year.\n  It is certain that Congress has authority over the Tax Code. We \nunderstand the first amendment, free speech rights of any individual, \nand even in the case of commercial speech. We are very much aware of \nthat. But there is no constitutional right to have the expense of a \ncorporation's speech subsidized by the taxpayers. So, while I concur \nthat within some limits, which the Senator from Rhode Island has \noutlined relative to commercial speech, there is a first amendment \nright that is at the heart of all of our concern about advertising, \nthat certainly there is no constitutional right to taxpayer subsidy. \nWhen a message is designed to addict vulnerable youth to a deadly \nproduct, it is absolutely imperative for Congress to act with great \nurgency.\n  So, again, I commend the Senator from Rhode Island for this \namendment, for his excellent outline of the legal history of how we \nhave arrived at where we are today. But it would seem in the course of \nall the contentious amendments that we have dealt with on this floor \nover the last several weeks, and will still in the week to come, that \nthis ought to be an amendment around which there would be great \nbipartisan, commonsense support. I challenge any Member of this body to \ngo home to his or her State and explain to constituents that at the \nsame time we are trying to come up with ways to reduce youth addiction \nto tobacco products, that we continue to spend in the range of $1.5 \nbillion of the taxpayers' dollars--dollars that could be better used \nfor medical research, for education, that could go back into the \npockets of the taxpayers in the form of tax cuts, for that matter. \nAlmost any other use would be more productive than to use it in such a \nnegative way as a subsidy for marketing techniques directed at our \nyouth.\n  Again, I commend the Senator from Rhode Island. I commend this \namendment to my colleagues and yield my time back to the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, first I thank the Senator from South Dakota \nfor his fine words and support of this amendment and also for his \neffort in this legislative process. He has been there every step of the \nway, working very closely to ensure that we develop legislation that \nwill work for the children of this country, their parents, and for all \nAmericans. I thank him for that and for his kind words today.\n  Again, continuing to respond to some of the issues that were raised \ntoday with respect to my amendment, there are suggestions that under \nthe latest case, 44 Liquormart, there has to be a material showing that \nthe regulation proposed, the proposed restriction on speech, will \nsignificantly and materially advance the underlying Government \nobjective. Once again, in that particular case they do not find such \nsignificance. In this situation, the significance is obvious and \ncompelling. The FDA, after its extensive rulemaking, concluded that \nlimits on advertising will avert the addiction of anywhere between 25 \npercent and 50 percent of the children at risk. So, literally, we have \nwithin our power the\n\n[[Page S6319]]\n\nability to save 250,000 a year from the ravages of smoking. That is not \nhypothetical. That is not conjecture. That is based upon sound analysis \nby the FDA. And that is material and significant.\n  Consequently, all the criticism directed to the amendment with \nrespect to the first amendment, and particularly with respect to 44 \nLiquormart, failed, I believe, and we are left with legislation that is \nfocused, that deals with a very substantial national interest--the \nreduction of teen smoking--that directly affects that interest, that \nwill produce significant material beneficial results, and also one that \nis used now after several other attempts have failed--noticeably \nwarning labels, noticeably banning certain types of advertising, \ntelevision advertising.\n  So I believe we are on sound constitutional grounds and very, very \nsound policy grounds, because intuitively I think we all grasp that \nthis barrage of advertising images has an overwhelming and upsetting \neffect on children. If 90 percent of 6-year-olds recognize Joe Camel \nand smoking, then that is pretty compelling evidence that we have to do \nsomething to restrain the way cigarettes are advertised and marketed in \nthis country. That is what this amendment proposes to do.\n  Let me also suggest that within the FDA regulations there are \nprovisions which are not particularly novel. All of these discussions \nabout restricting speech, I think, fail to recognize the fact that many \nStates already put significant restrictions on cigarette advertising. \nFor example, in California the State prohibits advertising of tobacco \nproducts within 1,000 feet of any public or private school playground. \nThe statute also allows local ordinances to be more restrictive.\n  A second statute makes it clear that one cannot sell, lease, rent, \nprovide any video game which will primarily be used by minors if the \ngame contains any paid commercial advertisement for tobacco products.\n  In Indiana, the State prevents non-point-of-sale advertisements for \ntobacco within 200 feet of a school. In Kentucky, the State has banned \ntobacco billboard advertising within 500 feet of a school. In Texas, \nthe State prevents tobacco advertising within 1,000 feet of a school or \nchurch. In Utah, the State law bans all tobacco advertising on ``any \nbillboard, street car, sign, bus placard or any other object or place \nof display.'' In fact, the Utah statute originates from 1929.\n  All of these States have, by their State laws, imposed restrictions \non tobacco advertising. The justification, of course, is that they are \nprotecting children. They have been on the books, in some cases, as in \nthe case of Utah, for 60-plus years. So we are not breaking new ground. \nWhat we are doing, finally, is assembling a coherent set of rational \nregulations based on extensive findings by the FDA which will, we hope, \nfor the first time ensure that children are not the objects of tobacco \nadvertising.\n  The other aspect or complaint that has been made about the amendment \nis that it might not work out well, it is using the Tax Code to enforce \na public policy.\n  Lately, this body has been preoccupied with using the Tax Code to \nenforce public policy positions of the various parties, so that is not \na novel idea. But one aspect of this legislation which I think is very \ncommendable is that essentially what will happen is that the industry \nitself will have to police itself. Today, the FTC, the Federal Trade \nCommission, could come in and take any one of these ads and say, ``This \nis false and misleading. You have no evidence to say it's smooth. This \nis just totally misleading.'' They can do that.\n  It will take 2 years of administrative procedures to work through the \nadministrative law judge level. And at the end of those 2 years, if the \ncompany is distressed with the outcome, they will simply sue and go to \nthe court of appeals, claiming that the ALJ's decision was arbitrary, \ncapricious, et cetera, and that appeal will be stretched out.\n  In the world of advertising, the product life of an advertising \ncampaign is measured probably in a month, maybe a year; there are \nperennials that last a long time. But that particular advertising will \nbe old hat in a matter of months, so there is every incentive, when \nthere is a question about whether they are pushing across the line or \nnot, to go ahead and advertise, because, remember, if you hook that 16-\nyear-old, you have a faithful customer for 30 years maybe.\n  In this situation, they are going to have to look very carefully, \nbecause the consequence of violating this amendment is that they lose \ntheir tax deduction, it goes right to the bottom line, and it is \nsomething that if they choose to litigate for years or months and, at \nthe end, they are found liable, not only do they pay the taxes owed, \nbut also interest and penalties. They are very much concerned, as they \nshould be.\n  This is an effective enforcement device. I believe we need effective \nenforcement devices. We have tried other approaches--the advertising \nban on television, the warning labels, even FTC jurisdiction to ferret \nout individual ads--but still we are seeing our young people deluged by \nthese advertisements and, again, remarkably, 90 percent of 6-year-olds \nbeing able to recognize Joe Camel as a symbol for cigarette smoking in \nthe United States. So I believe we need this amendment very, very much.\n  Let me suggest also there has been another general argument against \nthe amendment, and that argument has essentially been: Well, the sky's \nfalling, the slippery slope; if you do this, you will enforce every \nFederal regulatory policy with the Tax Code, and that will be a \nterrible thing. Again, I think that is more alarmism than rational.\n  The reason I am here today is that central to the business of tobacco \nis the business of promoting it through advertising. People smoke \ncigarettes like this not because they have, I think, some need to do \nit, but they have been subjected to this type of advertising over many, \nmany years. Advertising and cigarette promotions have been hand in hand \nfor as long as anyone can remember.\n  If you go back far enough, the industry was much more aggressive in \nsome respects, and blatant. They put in magazines pictures of doctors \nsmoking away, suggesting that cigarette smoking was really good for \nthem; they put in photographs, pictures, drawings of very attractive, \nsophisticated young women, suggesting that smoking was good to control \nweight--none of which, of course, was buttressed by the fact that \nsmoking is an addiction that ultimately prematurely kills people.\n  There is such a logical connection, an inextricable connection, \nbetween advertising, the way they do it, and the promotion of a tobacco \nproduct that it is logical to take this step. It is not logical to \nsuggest that FDA regulations will be enforced by denying deductibility \nor any other type of regulatory policy. So the whole issue of, this is \njust the first step on a very slippery slope is, I think, refutable on \nits face.\n  We have before us the opportunity to pass significant legislation \nwhich will materially, effectively improve the public health of this \ncountry. We have to recognize--I think so many of us do--that \ncigarettes probably are the No. 1 pediatric disease in the country. It \naffects kids adversely. It takes it a while to catch up with them, but \nit affects kids adversely. Ninety percent of smokers begin before they \nare 18 years old. This is a pediatric health crisis, and we are \nresponding.\n  The fear I have is, if we don't respond in this manner, that we \nreally won't be able to effectively accomplish what we want to do. Even \nif we pass this legislation--and Senator McCain has done a remarkable \nthing moving this legislation through; his perseverance and strength, \nalong with Senator Kerry and along with so many of my colleagues, has \nbeen remarkable--even if we pass legislation that has increases on the \nprice of cigarettes, that has effective funding for a public health \nprogram, if we do that and yet we still have no real check on \nadvertisements like this aimed at young people, I believe we will end \nup not doing what we are setting out to do: to restrict smoking among \nunderage Americans.\n  I think we should do it, I think we must do it, and I urge careful \nconsideration and support for this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to raise concerns about the Reed \namendment to the pending tobacco legislation. The amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Rhode Island may sound appealing on first impression, \nbut\n\n[[Page S6320]]\n\ncould have some harmful consequences. While I believe that the \namendment is offered in all sincerity, in my view it would be wrong for \nus to take this approach to tobacco use. In particular, this amendment \nwould establish a dangerous precedent by using federal tax policy as \nthe primary enforcement penalty for federal agency rules issued by an \nagency other than the IRS.\n  Let me give a few examples to highlight the concerns I have:\n  First, imagine that General Motors has announced its fall line of new \nChevrolets, but that the Department of Transportation determines that \nthe cars fail to meet the minimum fuel consumption standards. Now \nimagine that the Department of Transportation could instruct the \nInternal Revenue Service to disallow as a business deduction the cost \nof all General Motors advertising for 1998. That could be devastating, \nand it would place tremendous and potentially destructive power in the \nhands of the federal government.\n  Another example: Say the Department of Agriculture conducts a routine \ninspection of one of the nation's largest food processing facilities in \nthe Midwest. Upon finding unsanitary conditions, the Secretary of \nAgriculture might announce under a similar regulation that the food \nprocessing company that operates the plant and every company that \nmarkets its products will be punished by losing the entire deduction \nfor 1998 of all of their food product marketing and advertising costs. \nAgain, the result could be disastrous.\n  The pending amendment would make such scenarios all the more likely.\n  Under the Reed amendment, if the FDA found that one advertisement of \na tobacco product failed to comply with marketing and advertising rules \nissued by the FDA nearly two years ago and still under litigation, the \noffending company would lose the entire business expense deduction for \nall of its advertising. This is unsound public policy, unsound tax \npolicy, and an unwise expansion of federal regulatory authority.\n  Federal agency rules are generally enforced with other fines or \npenalties that are tailored to the violation. The Reed amendment would \nallow the same result--a higher tax payment, which could in some cases \nbe quite substantial--regardless of whether a violation was inadvertent \nor inconsequential.\n  In addition, the financial impact could itself be tremendous and \ncould get into the hundreds of millions of dollars. The Congress should \nnot be giving the FDA such expansive and punitive authority. The \npossibility of such a penalty could chill advertising and deter \nlegitimate, protected speech. In my view, this raises constitutional \nconcerns and liberty interests that should at a minimum be seriously \nconsidered in the appropriate committees, including the Finance and \nJudiciary Committees, before we consider placing such an unprecedented \nand potentially damaging provision in the pending legislation.\n  We should be especially careful about creating a precedent that will \nnot only distort the Tax Code but will lead to more expansive and \nintrusive authority on the part of regulatory agencies. Mr. President, \nI ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter by \nGrover Norquist, President of Americans for Tax Reform, expressing \nstrong concerns about the tax implications of the Reed amendment and \nabout the significant increase in governmental authority contemplated \nby that amendment as well.\n  While I believe Senator Reed to be well-intentioned, I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     Americans For Tax Reform,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 12, 1998.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: I am writing to express my strong \n     opposition to an amendment that Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) is \n     offering to the anti-tobacco legislation (S. 1415). This \n     fatally flawed amendment would for the first time in our \n     nation's history link the denial of a necessary and ordinary \n     business expense deduction to complying with rules issued by \n     a federal regulatory agency. It is my understanding the Reed \n     amendment will be debated today and possibly voted on next \n     Monday evening.\n       The Reed amendment, which would eliminate the ability of \n     tobacco companies to deduct all advertising, marketing, and \n     promotion costs if only one advertisement violates \n     regulations promulgated by the Food and Drug Administration, \n     is a reckless attempt to use the Tax Code for a purpose for \n     which it was never intended. I can find no sound public \n     policy reason to start using the Tax Code to help enforce FDA \n     regulation, which by the way have been declared illegal by a \n     Federal District Court.\n       This amendment, if adopted, could establish an unacceptable \n     precedent of granting power to such agencies as the \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Occupational \n     Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Equal Employment \n     Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the Federal Trade Commission \n     (FTC), or any other government agency that issues regulations \n     to increase taxes on businesses by millions of dollars for \n     technical violations of rules that are highly complex and \n     confusing.\n       For example, would it be proper to allow OSHA to deny the \n     ability of a large consumer product manufacturer from \n     deducting its advertising costs simply because a building \n     among its many facilities around the country violates one \n     OSHA standard? Or another example, should EPA be permitted to \n     use the Tax Code against a small business, which greatly \n     depends on advertising to stay in business, because the small \n     businessperson inadvertently violates an EPA regulation \n     because of a technical misunderstanding?\n       This is exactly what the Reed amendment, if approved, puts \n     in motion as every anti-business group in the country will \n     attempt to enlist the Tax Code to fulfill their agenda.\n       In short, the utilization of the federal government's \n     taxing authority for regulatory enforcement may represent one \n     of the largest expansions of the federal government's power \n     since enactment of the Great Society programs of the 1960's. \n     Therefore, I strongly urge you to vote against this ill-\n     conceived proposal.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Grover G. Norquist,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish I could support the Reed amendment. \nIf this amendment simply disallowed the tax deductibility of any \nadvertising deemed in violation of FDA rules, I believe we might be in \nthe ballpark.\n  However, this amendment goes well beyond. It says that if a company \nadvertises in any way, even unintentionally, that violates FDA rules, \nthen that company may not deduct any advertising expenses incurred that \nyear which are otherwise legal and deductible under current law.\n  Mr. President, concerns have been expressed about the advertising \ndeduction as generally applied. In fact, both the CATO and the \nProgressive Policy Institutes have identified this deduction as one \nthat should be reformed. Perhaps that is something we should do in a \nmanner that treats all taxpayers the same. But, this amendment is not a \ngeneral reform, it is specific and I believe goes too far.\n  I appreciate the motives of the Senator from Rhode Island but I will \nnot vote for this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Chair advises the Senator, under the previous order, the Senate \nis to proceed to the amendment by the Senator from Rhode Island, No. \n2702, with 10 minutes allowed for debate, 5 minutes each, and then a \nvote no later than 5 o'clock on or in relation to the amendment, unless \nconsent is granted otherwise.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I propose a unanimous consent that we begin \nthe debate on my amendment at 5 o'clock, to conclude at 10 minutes \npast, and to begin the vote at 5:10.\n  Mr. GORTON. Unfortunately, I must object on behalf of the majority \nleader. He wishes the vote take place then. Then I will yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, at 5 p.m. the Senate will vote on my \namendment, which would deny advertising deductions to the tobacco \nindustry if they do not follow the FDA rules and regulations with \nrespect to advertising to children.\n  We are here debating a large, comprehensive tobacco bill because our \nmajor goal, our overriding interest, is to prevent children from being \nenticed into smoking. We know from the industry's own records that they \nhave relentlessly, over decades, deliberately\n\n[[Page S6321]]\n\nmounted promotional advertising campaigns aimed at children as young as \n12 or 13 years old. We know from the effects of this record that in a \nsurvey of 3-year-old children, 60 percent or so recognize Joe Camel as \na symbol of smoking; 6-year-old children, first grade, 91 percent \nrecognize Joe Camel as a symbol of smoking.\n  Advertising and the promotion of cigarettes are inextricably linked. \nMy amendment goes to the heart of that. The FDA has proposed narrowly \nbased and narrowly focused regulations. The amendment would say if the \ntobacco industry does not want to abide by these regulations, they lose \ntheir tax deductions for advertising. Taken by itself, my amendment \ndoes not even preclude them from saying anything or doing anything. \nWhat it simply says is they will do it on their own nickel.\n  Now, we have a great support from the public health community. The \nfollowing organizations and individuals are supporting it: C. Everett \nKoop, the former Surgeon General, the American Lung Association, the \nCenter for Tobacco-Free Kids, ENACT Coalition, and many others. \nCosponsors of this legislation include my colleagues Senator Boxer, \nSenator Wyden, Senator Kennedy, Senator Daschle, Senator Durbin, \nSenator Wellstone, Senator Feinstein, Senator Bingaman, Senator Conrad, \nand Senator Johnson.\n  This amendment is a logical way to strengthen and make effective the \nmajor goal of this legislation. It also is constitutionally permissible \nunder the Central Hudson test, the Supreme Court case that outlined \npermissible limits on commercial speech. It meets that test. First of \nall, we are advancing a substantial national interest. According to the \nFDA documents and their research and the rulemaking, if we have \neffective controls on advertising to children, we can save \napproximately 250,000 children a year from becoming addicted to \nnicotine.\n  It is also directly related to the substantial national interest. In \nfact, the industry itself is the best evidence of this. They spend $6 \nbillion a year on advertising. We are subsidizing them to the tune of \n$1.6 billion, but they know and they have demonstrated that advertising \nis the way they entice young people to smoke. If we stop this linkage, \nwe will do more than anything else to ensure that we protect the \nchildren of America.\n  The final aspect of the Central Hudson test is that this legislation \nis narrowly constructed and focused. As I mentioned before, it does not \nabsolutely forbid any ban on speech. What it does do, however, it \nessentially restricts their ability to put posters near schools and to \ndo many other things.\n  This legislation is both constitutionally sound and is a public \npolicy which will support what we are here to do--to prevent children \nfrom smoking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. How much time is available to the opponents?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is approximately 2 minutes 45 seconds \nallotted to the majority.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in the absence of any other person here, I \nyield myself that time to say that during 2 years when I was not in the \nSenate, between 1987 and 1989, I had the privilege of being a partner \nin a Seattle firm, Davis, Wright and Tremaine, the senior partner of \nwhich, Cameron DeVore, is one of the most distinguished first amendment \nlawyers in the United States. He informed me in no uncertain terms, and \nI agree with him, that this proposal is clearly and blatantly \nunconstitutional. You cannot condition a right, a privilege, available \nto everyone else in the United States, on its abandonment of its first \namendment rights--a highly simple proposition.\n  We can and we should limit advertising of cigarettes. We can only do \nthat constitutionally, Mr. President, if we come up with a bill like \nthe proposal made by the State attorneys general that has the agreement \nof those who are asked to give up their first amendment rights to \nadvertising. Therefore, this amendment should be defeated.\n  On another matter, Mr. President, on Thursday, for the second time, I \nvoted against limitations on attorney's fees in these cases, because in \nboth cases I thought they were unfair. I will soon introduce an \namendment that allows higher attorney's fees for those who began these \ncases early, when they were greatly at risk and ask for lower \nattorney's fees for those attorneys who got in late, when winning cases \nof the nature that have been discussed here is like shooting fish in a \nbarrel.\n  I think we should be fair. I think we also have the right to propose \nand propound such limitations to those who have come before the \nCongress asking us to intervene in what previously was litigation \noutside of the scope of the Congress at all.\n  I am sorry I have no more time at this point to discuss that \nproposal, but it is both nuanced in favor of those attorneys who really \ndid the yeomen's work in this connection and much less favorable to \nthose who got in essentially after the fact and who will be engaged in \nsuch litigation in the future.\n\n  Mr. President, I move to table the Reed amendment, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Washington to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am now informed that the leaders of both \nsides are willing to postpone this vote for approximately 10 minutes. I \nask unanimous consent that the vote on the motion to table take place \nat 5:10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, again, the vote before us is a vote on my \namendment which would restrict the deduction of advertising expenses \nfor tobacco companies which do not choose to follow FDA rules and \nregulations. There are many reasons why this is appropriate. The most \ncompelling reason is simply the record of tobacco itself. It is a \nrecord that has shown over many, many decades a consistent attempt to \nmarket to children.\n  There have been some objectives with respect to the first amendment. \nLet me suggest, first, that commercial speech under the doctrine of the \nSupreme Court is not afforded the same level of protection as pure \npolitical speech. This is clearly a case of commercial speech.\n  Second, the test of the leading case, Central Hudson, clearly states \nthat if there is a substantial governmental interest, if the proposed \nlegislation addresses directly that interest, and if it is done by \nmeans that are narrowly focused and no more than is necessary, that it \nwould pass the test. I submit that this legislation does that. There \ncan be no more compelling national interest than curbing teenage \nsmoking.\n  Under the record of the FDA, they have demonstrated that if we take \neffective advertising restrictions and put them in place, we could on \nan annual basis save 250,000 children from addiction to nicotine. That \nis a direct, material, significant correlation between the substantial \nnational interest and this legislation.\n  Finally, this legislation is narrowly focused.\n  I also submit that this legislation does not spring up de nova. We \nhave had a long record of trying to constrain access to tobacco \nproducts to children. In the 1970s and 1960s, we put warning labels on \ncigarettes. That has proven ineffective. In the early 1970s, we banned \nTV advertising on tobacco products. That has proved ineffective. We \nhave reached an intellectual consensus that in order to get the job \ndone--that is what we are here to do--in order to effectively prevent \nthe children from the addiction of nicotine, we have to have reasonable \nconstraints on advertising. This legislation does it.\n  I should also point out that many States in the United States already \nimpose certain restrictions on advertising to children. For example, \nthe State of Utah precludes the placement of billboards or other types \nof visible advertising for cigarettes within that State.\n  To point out that in many other jurisdictions--Texas, for example--\nthere\n\n[[Page S6322]]\n\nare limits on how close one can place a billboard within a school. All \nof these have been in effect for many, many years. They have been \ntested. They are constitutionally permissible. We can do it. And, \nindeed, we must do it.\n  We have literally within our power the opportunity to save 250,000 \nchildren a year from the ravages of smoking. That is the conclusion of \nthe FDA after their extensive, detailed rulemaking process. We can and \nwe must insist on this type of regulatory authority. I think it will \nprovide a device that will lead the companies to do what they have yet \nbeen unable to do; that is, stop marketing cigarette products to \nchildren.\n  We see it in every manner in every form. I have been for the last \nseveral days pointing out an advertisement, a mail solicitation that a \n16-year-old junior high school student received in Providence, RI. It \nwas slick. It was sophisticated. It was based upon a rock concert that \nhe attended several months before, a concert attended by many people \nunder 18 years of age. It was not coincidental. It was a deliberate, \ncalculated, focused attempt by the industry using the talents of \nadvertising executives, focus group directors, people who understand \npsychology and the dynamics of youth addiction, to figure out how they \ncould get the message right in the hands of a 16-year-old that smoking \nis good; not only good, it is socially desirable.\n  We shouldn't stand for that. We don't have to stand for it. We know \nthat for years and years and years the tobacco industry has been \nmisleading the American public. That is objectionable. But when we \ndiscover, as we do from all of these documents and all of this \nlitigation, that their target has been young children as young as 12 \nand 13 years old, that becomes unconscionable. And the conscious of \nthis country and the conscious of this Senate will be tested today. \nWill we take effective steps to preclude access to tobacco products of \nchildren?\n  This amendment is constitutionally sound. This amendment will, in \nfact, provide decisive and effective controls on tobacco access by \nyoung people in this country. We shouldn't shrink from this \nresponsibility. We should pass this legislation to ensure that when we \nfinish this great debate, and as we look ahead, we will be confident \nthat we have taken effective, practical steps to prevent children from \nbeing addicted to nicotine and tobacco. If we don't do that, many, many \nyoung people--the estimate is 5 million young people under 18--will die \nprematurely. We can stop that if we vote today to support this \namendment.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time is in opposition to the \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against this \namendment.\n  First, let me say to the proponents that if they want to have an \namendment to ban advertising, or deduction of advertising, for tobacco \nproducts, they can do so. But to turn it over to the FDA, I think, may \nbe some of the worst tax policy we have seen. This bill already has \nsome of the worst tax policy we have seen. The look-back penalties, as \nI have stated a couple of times, are clearly not working. But if I read \nthis amendment right, advertising is deductible, unless it doesn't \ncomply with FDA regulations.\n  What are the FDA regulations? You are in violation of FDA regulations \nif you have a ball cap that says ``Marlboro'' on it. If I have a staff \nmember who went to a car race, or something, that has a ball cap that \nsays ``Marlboro,'' they would be in violation. I don't know if a ball \ncap under FDA regulations would be in violation of advertising \nrestrictions. They would lose deductibility of their advertising \nexpenses.\n  Again, if people want to be more direct, let's be more direct. Just \nsay, I have an amendment to disallow all advertising expenses for \ntobacco products. I expect some may have that. They probably will have \nit on this bill. But to say you cannot have the deduction unless you \ncomply with FDA regulations, and treating FDA regulations as \nsacrosanct, as if they make sense--some of them don't make sense. For \nexample, there is an FDA regulation that says people selling tobacco \nmust check IDs up to age 27. A lot of people aren't aware of it. But \nthat is part of the same FDA regulation that we are talking about. I \ndon't think that is workable. It is legal to buy cigarettes if you are \nover 18. But if you are 18, and they come up with a regulation that \nsays we are going to mandate that you check identification of people up \nto age 27--they also have restrictions on advertising that says you \ncan't have a T-shirt, a ball cap, or tobacco companies--you can't \nadvertise during the races. This is auto racing time--Indianapolis 500. \nMy friend from Indiana is here. My guess is there was a car running \naround the track that had ``Marlboro'' on it. Somebody probably said, \n``Wait a minute. That is directed at youth.'' I don't know if it is \ndirected at youth or not.\n  If they did it, if they sponsored a sporting event, they would be in \nviolation of this provision and they would lose deductibility of \nadvertising.\n  I just do not think we should have FDA making tax policy. I do not \nthink we should have FDA deciding what is compliance or whether a \ncompany is allowed to take the deduction. If Senators do not want to \nhave tobacco advertising, they want to ban it, let them introduce that \non a tax bill, but let's not turn that kind of authority over to FDA. I \nthink this bill has already granted FDA too much authority, including \nthe authority to totally ban nicotine without prior congressional \napproval, which I think is a mistake, and I think the ID check up to \nage 27 is a mistake. I think that is FDA overreaching. I think their \nban on ball caps and T-shirts, again, is overreaching.\n  Now, I do not want them targeting teenagers either, but I think to \nturn over tax policy to FDA would be a serious mistake. So I urge my \ncolleagues to vote no on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, in whatever time I have remaining, I would \nlike to respond.\n  First of all, I do not want to let stand the suggestion that this has \nanything to do with checking IDs at a retail store. That is not part of \nthe FDA regulation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Rhode Island has \nexpired.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the Reed amendment No. 2702.

Mr. President, I enter the motion to reconsider the vote \nby which the Reed amendment was adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to reconsider has been entered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to voice my hopes that the Senate \nwill this week have the opportunity, after several weeks of debate, to \nvote on the pending tobacco bill.\n  The course that this bill has taken is in marked contrast to the \ncourse taken by many other important bills that we have considered in \nthe 105th Congress. Whereas the Republican leadership has severely \ntruncated debate on such important matters as campaign finance reform \nand education policy, we have been on the tobacco bill for several \nweeks, have engaged in hours of debate, and have considered a wide \nrange of amendments. I have no doubt that when the Republican \nleadership has wanted quick resolution of an issue during the 105th \nCongress, it has understood how to accomplish that goal, and worked \ntoward it. A similar commitment has not been apparent in the area of \ntobacco legislation.\n  Let me be clear, Mr. President. I support the idea of full and \nconsidered debate on an issue as important as this one. I also believe, \nhowever, that once an issue has been fully vetted, once Senators have \nhad a chance to listen to the debate and vote on amendments, it becomes \ntime for the Senate to step up to the plate and vote on the legislation \nbefore us. That is what we are paid to do, and it is what the American \npeople expect us to do.\n  This is the fourth week of the tobacco debate. We have debated and \nvoted on germane amendments and non-germane amendments; we have \nconsumed dozens of hours of floor time and hundreds of pages in the \nCongressional Record. I worry, Mr. President, that the delays we are \nnow facing on this bill are not designed to allow further thoughtful \nconsideration of tobacco legislation, but rather to delay and obfuscate \nthat legislation, to add to tobacco legislation layer upon layer of \nunrelated measures, to divide supporters of action in this area, and to \nrun the clock in a legislative session that is evaporating before our \neyes. The American people deserve better than that.\n  Now I do not support everything in this bill. I have voted for some \nof the amendments the Senate has considered and against others. I have \nfound the wide-ranging discussion on the Senate floor to be valuable \nand enlightening in some instances and irrelevant and repetitive in \nothers. I do believe, however, that by the end of this week, after the \nSenate has had the chance to consider the handful of remaining \noutstanding issues, we will be ready to take a stand on how to deal \nwith the problems of smoking--especially the problem of teen smoking--\nin our nation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding the Senator from \nTexas is waiting to speak, and the Senator from Minnesota. I ask both \nof them if they would like to begin and would ask their indulgence of \nSenator Gorton, who is going to come over for a brief time to lay down \nan amendment--very briefly, if they would allow him to interrupt for a \nfew minutes upon his arrival.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Texas be allowed to go into morning business, followed by the \nSenator from Minnesota, and at some time the Senator from Washington be \nrecognized to interrupt for morning business to lay down an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, before you finish, let me make sure \nthat I will be able to ask for a resolution to be unanimously passed \nand if I can do that in morning business. I want to be sure that I can \ndo that. It has been cleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Repeat the request.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I have a resolution that has been entered by both \nsides. I wanted to be able to bring it up, read the resolution, and \nspeak for about 5 minutes, and ask unanimous consent that it be passed. \nSo I didn't want to be prohibited from doing that in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Arizona make that part \nof his request?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 248, which was \nsubmitted earlier today by myself and Senator Gramm and Senator \nMoseley-Braun.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The clerk will report the \nresolution.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 248) condemning the brutal killing of \n     Mr. James Byrd, Jr., and commend the community of Jasper, TX, \n     for the manner in which it has come together in response.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to read the resolution because \nI think the Senate is taking a step that is very important, and I want \nto speak for a few minutes on the great honor I had this weekend to \nattend the services for one of my constituents, Mr. James Byrd, Jr.\n  The resolution condemns the brutal killing of Mr. James Byrd Jr., and \nit commends the community of Jasper, TX, and Jasper County, TX, for the \nmanner in which it has come together in response to this brutal \nkilling.\n  The findings are as follows:\n  Mr. James Byrd, Jr., of Jasper, TX, was brutally murdered on June 6, \n1998.\n  Since this heinous tragedy, the citizens of Jasper, from all segments \nof the community, have come together to condemn the killing and honor \nthe memory of Mr. Byrd.\n  The sheriff of Jasper County, Billy Rowles, spoke for the community \nwhen he appealed that the Nation not ``label us because of this random, \nbrutal act.''\n  Mr. and Mrs. James Byrd, Sr., called for ``justice and peace,'' \nasking that ``we * * * get this over and put it behind us.''\n  The community's response reflects the spirit that other communities \nacross the Nation have shown in the face of recent incidents of random \nand senseless violence.\n  The Senate condemns the actions which occurred in Jasper, TX, as \nhorrific and intolerable, to be rejected by all Americans.\n  The Senate expresses its deepest condolences to the Byrd family for \ntheir loss and the pain it caused.\n  The Senate notes the strong religious faith of the Byrd family, under \nthe inspired leadership of James, Sr., and Stella Byrd, and the \nReverend Kenneth Lyons, Pastor of the Greater New Bethel Baptist \nChurch, that has helped the family through this most trying time.\n  The Senate sees in the Byrd family reaction to this tragedy the \ninspiration for hope, peace and justice in Jasper and throughout the \nUnited States.\n  The Senate commends the leadership shown by Jasper County sheriff, \nBilly Rowles, City of Jasper Mayor R.C. Horn, and other community \nleaders in responding to this tragedy.\n\n[[Page S6324]]\n\n  The Senate urges that law enforcement officials at all appropriate \nlevels continue with the full and fair investigation into all of the \nfacts of this case.\n  The Senate urges prosecutors to proceed with a fair and speedy trial \nto bring the perpetrators of this outrageous crime to justice.\n  Mr. President, I had an experience that I will never forget this \nweekend when I attended the funeral service for Mr. Byrd. I saw a \ncommunity coming together in confronting a tragedy that was unspeakable \nand yet they handled it in a way in which I think all of us could \nlearn. They said unanimously in that little community, ``There is no \nhate here; there is only love.''\n  I want to say that the Byrd family reminds me of something that \nSenator Gramm has said before, and that is the greatness of our country \nis that ordinary people do extraordinary things. I have seen the spirit \nof America in Mr. and Mrs. James Byrd, Sr., in James Byrd, Jr.'s \nsisters, and in his children. They endure the pain of knowing how their \nloved one died and yet can say to all the world, ``There is no hate \nhere, there is no hate in our home, there is no hate in our church; \nthere is love.''\n  I walked through that church and I saw a woman who goes to that \nchurch every Sunday. She had on four yellow ribbons. The yellow ribbons \nwere displayed all over the community of Jasper, showing that the \ncommunity was coming together in memory of James Byrd, Jr. This woman \nhad on four ribbons, and she knew James Byrd, Jr. She said, ``I have \nfour ribbons. I have one ribbon for James Byrd, Jr., and I have three \nribbons for the three who are accused of killing him.'' That said \neverything about the way this community is handling this terrible \ntragedy.\n  I think the leadership that is given to us by the Byrd family, by \nMayor Horn, by Sheriff Rowles, and by Rev. Kenneth Lyons is something \nthat all of us will be able to say has enriched us. I was enriched this \nweekend by seeing that community. I was enriched when Sheriff Rowles \ntold me that he was trying to make sure that everyone stayed together, \nthat everyone had their say, and he was even giving the same courtesy \nand respect even to the Black Panthers who came and did not talk about \nunity at all. Nevertheless, Sheriff Rowles recognized their freedom of \nspeech. I saw a community that said we are proud that we have been able \nto grow up in loving homes with Christian backgrounds.\n  So I think that Abraham Lincoln's call to the ``better angels of our \nnature'' was personified by the Byrd family during this past week. All \nof us are better because we have seen the Byrd family endure a tragedy \nthat we pray none of us will ever have to endure, and we saw them rise \nabove it and counsel justice and prayer, not hate and despair.\n  It is their leadership that will make me a follower, and I hope all \nAmericans will follow their message--that love is what is important for \nour country, not hate.\n  So I commend them, and that is why I introduced this resolution with \nSenator Gramm tonight and why the Senate is, I hope, going to \nunanimously pass this resolution in just a few minutes, because I want \nto follow the Byrd family's example and talk about love, not hate; \nprayer, not despair. That is how we can come together as a country and \nlearn from the worst of tragedies, and, by the very nature of its \nhorror, resolve that we are going to fight harder for equality and \njustice in this country for our children and grandchildren.\n  That will be the memory of James Byrd, Jr., that we will all come out \nof this stronger because of the horror that he endured.\n  I also want to say that the Reverend Jesse Jackson was a healer this \nweek, that Kweisi Mfume was a healer this week, that Rodney Slater, \nrepresenting the President of the United States, was a healer this \nweek, that Congresswoman Maxine Waters was a healer this week. All of \nthem came together with the same message that the Byrd family gave to \nus. And I was touched by what I saw in Jasper, TX, this week. I think \nwe will all be better because of the leadership of the Byrd family of \nJasper, TX.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that S. Res. 248 be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 248) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 248\n\n       Whereas, Mr. James Byrd, Jr., of Jasper, Texas, was \n     brutally murdered on June 6, 1998;\n       Whereas, since this heinous tragedy, the citizens of \n     Jasper, from all segments of the community, have come \n     together to condemn the killing and honor the memory of Mr. \n     Byrd.\n       Whereas, the Sheriff of Jasper County, Billy Rowles, spoke \n     for the community when he appealed that the nation not \n     ``label us because of this random, brutal act.''\n       Whereas, Mr. and Mrs. James Byrd, Sr., called for ``justice \n     and peace,'' asking that ``we . . . get this over and put \n     this behind us.''; and\n       Whereas, the community's response reflects the spirit that \n     other communities across the nation have shown in the face of \n     recent incidents of random and senseless violence. Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That The Senate--\n       (1) condemns the actions which occurred in Jasper, Texas as \n     horrific and intolerable, to be rejected by all Americans;\n       (2) expresses its deepest condolences to the Byrd family \n     for their loss and the pain it caused;\n       (3) notes the strong religious faith of the Byrd family, \n     under the inspired leadership of James Sr., and Stella Byrd, \n     and the Reverend Kenneth Lyons, Pastor of the Greater New \n     Bethel Baptist Church, that has helped the family through \n     this most trying time;\n       (4) sees in the Byrd family reaction to this tragedy the \n     inspiration for hope, peace, and justice in Jasper and \n     throughout the United States;\n       (5) commends the leadership shown by Jasper County Sheriff \n     Billy Rowles, City of Jasper Mayor R.C.

Mr. President, there is at least an informal \nunderstanding that there will be a debate on this amendment tomorrow \nfor approximately 1 hour. With the kind indulgence of my friend and \ncolleague from Minnesota, I am going to simply give a brief explanation \nof this amendment now so Members who are watching, or staffs who are \nwatching, will understand its general subject matter.\n  Twice during the course of this debate we have debated the subject of \nlimitations on attorneys' fees. On both occasions I have voted to table \nthose amendments, not because I felt that limitations on attorneys' \nfees in connection with tobacco litigation and legislation were not \nappropriate, but because I felt that the amendments themselves were \nunfair. This amendment is a third attempt to provide some limitations \nin a manner that I, at least, believe to be considerably more sensitive \nand more fair to the attorneys who have been involved in that \nlitigation. I hope under those circumstances it will be given \nreasonably careful consideration by my colleagues.\n  We are dealing with litigation that is literally unprecedented, I \nthink, in the history of the United States, with the potential of \nimmense recoveries on the part of various States interfered with and \namended by the legislation that we are considering here on the floor. \nUnder those circumstances, the possibility that attorneys' fees would \nbe awarded in the billions of dollars--perhaps even in the billions of \ndollars to some individual firms, but certainly in the order of nine \ndigits to many individuals and individual firms--is a matter that I \nthink greatly disturbs the majority of the American people and many, if \nnot most, members of the bar. Those attorneys' fees have been subject \nto much criticism from the outside, and there should be a way to see to \nit that they are dealt with fairly.\n  The difficulty with the two earlier amendments, in my view at least, \nwas that they treated all lawyers, all attorneys who were involved in \ntobacco litigation--past, present, and future--in exactly the same \nfashion. Yet it is obvious that, if we look at the history of this \ncontroversy, the initial litigation and the ideas for that initial \nlitigation that were brought forth some time ago, in the early 1990s, \nwere developed by a group of tremendously gifted and imaginative \nattorneys at a time at which the odds on their success, looking at it \nfrom the beginning, would have been judged to have been very small.\n  They have shown great skill, great persistence; they have spent, in \nmany cases, a great deal of their own and their law firms' money; and I \nthink the reward they have earned is considerably larger than awards \nthat will be earned by those who got into this litigation very late in \nthe game when it was obvious that the litigation was going to be \nsettled for large amounts of money or litigated successfully; not to \nmention those who will bring tobacco-related litigation in the future \nwhen, under the terms of this bill, and many State legislative acts, it \nwill be almost impossible for an attorney to lose a tobacco case.\n  As a consequence, the fundamental approach of this amendment is to \nsay that for those who were in this litigation early--that is, before \nthe end of the year 1994--attorneys' fees can be up to $4,000 an hour--\na huge amount of money beyond any question, a mind-boggling amount of \nmoney, but nevertheless considerably less than many of these attorneys \nwill get in the absence of such legislation, on the basis of percentage \ncontingent fees.\n  Moreover, like other amendments in this connection, that is a \nceiling, not a floor. The courts, in this case, will make a \ndetermination considering all of the same items that have been outlined \nin previous decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court and in previous \namendments on this subject. So when a judge determines that amount is \ntoo much, the judge may reduce the amount below that hourly fee but \nunder no circumstances may go above it.\n  The second category of attorneys will be those who were involved in \nthis litigation after 1994 but before early last year. Their ceiling \nwill be half the amount of the pioneers, or $2,000 an hour. And certain \nother attorneys who worked on developing the ideas that went into this \ncase will fall into that category as well.\n  The next clear date is when the Liggett Tobacco Company agreed, in \neffect, to turn state's evidence to settle the matter and to admit its \nliabilities and admit, generally speaking, the liabilities of the other \ntobacco companies. Those who got into the litigation after that were \nalmost certain winners--almost certain winners. They did not run the \nrisks that earlier attorneys did, and their maximum fee under this \namendment will be $1,000 an hour. That will, in fact, be somewhat less \nthan the maximum recovery under the last Faircloth amendment, because \nwhile it stated the sum of $1,000 an hour, it allowed for recovery of \ncosts over--considerably over and above the actual costs incurred in \nthe litigation.\n  Finally, after the beginning of this debate here, assuming that this \ndebate, of course, ends up in actual legislation, tobacco litigation \nwill be almost like Workmen's Compensation litigation in all of our \nState courts, and the limit there is $500 an hour under this amendment, \nhalf that in the last Faircloth proposal. Again, these are limits, \nthese are maximums, but they are maximums set in a different way than \nthey were in the other two amendments, reflecting the actual risks, the \nactual\n\n[[Page S6326]]\n\nimagination, the actual work that went into the litigation and, for \nthat matter, into the legislation itself.\n  I am not certain this is a totally perfect proposal of this nature, \nbut I think it is highly reasonable. I think it is highly generous. I \nthink it meets the views of people in the United States as a whole who \ndo not think the lawyers in this case should become billionaires out of \nit. And it will husband the actual recoveries, whatever those \nrecoveries may be and however they are derived, far more for the \npurposes of the litigation and the legislation itself than relatively \nunlimited contingent fees would do.\n  That is a brief explanation and a justification of something that I \nhope meets with the support of those who have felt that there ought to \nbe limits on those attorneys' fees, but that they should be somewhat \nlower and those on the other side, who, like I, have voted against \nthese previous limitations on the grounds that they weren't sensitive \nenough and for at least some people were not high enough. I would like \nto bring people together on this so that at least this particular \nelement of this debate can be brought to a successful conclusion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/15/senate-section/article/S6324-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COMMANDER GARY MAYES\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to recognize \nand say farewell to an outstanding Naval Officer, Lieutenant Commander \nGary Mayes, who has served with distinction for the past two years in \nthe Navy's Senate Liaison Office. It is a privilege for me to recognize \nhis many outstanding achievements and to commend him for the superb \nservice he has provided this legislative body, the Navy and our great \nNation.\n  Lieutenant Commander Mayes is a graduate of Purdue University and was \ncommissioned an Ensign upon graduation from Aviation Officer Candidate \nSchool in Pensacola, Florida, in May 1988. He proceeded to flight \ntraining where he received his ``Wings of Gold'' and was designated a \nNaval Aviator in October 1989.\n  Lieutenant Commander Mayes' first assignment in the Navy was as a \npilot flying the UH-1N and C-12B at Naval Air Station Guantanamo Bay, \nCuba, from July 1990 to May 1991. Following training in the SH-60B \nSeahawk helicopter, he reported to Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron, \nLight Four Eight (HSL-48) as the Detachment Five Assistant Maintenance \nOfficer. He qualified as an Aircraft Commander and deployed aboard USS \nBoone (FFG-28) to the Mediterranean. He was next assigned to Detachment \nOne as the Maintenance Officer during Operation Support Democracy to \nHaiti while embarked on USS Spruance (DD-963). He also was deployed on \nUSS Comte de Grasse in 1995, flying missions in support of exercise \nUNITAS around South America.\n  Lieutenant Commander Mayes joined the Navy's Senate Liaison team in \nJanuary 1996. During his service as a Navy Liaison Officer, he provided \nmembers of the Senate Armed Services Committee, personal staffs, as \nwell as Senators from both sides of the aisle, with timely support \nregarding Navy plans, programs and constituent casework. His valuable \ncontributions have enabled Congress and the Department of the Navy to \nwork close together to preserve the well-trained and well-equipped \nnaval forces upon which our country has come to depend.\n  Mr. President, Gary Mayes, his wife Stephanie and their daughter \nGabrielle have made many sacrifices during his 10-year Navy career. He \nhas served proudly with a dedication and enthusiasm that only comes \nfrom our Nation's best and brightest. Lieutenant Commander Mayes is a \ngreat credit to both our Navy and our country. As he now departs to \nattend the Marine Corps Command and Staff War College, I call upon my \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle to wish him fair winds and \nfollowing seas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/15/senate-section/article/S6326-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS WEEK\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to express my support and \nadmiration of small business owners and entrepreneurs as we reflect on \nanother successful National Small Business Week. It is appropriate that \nwe recognize the contributions and achievements entrepreneurs have made \nto strengthen our communities and our national economy.\n  Small businesses account for 99.7% all the employers in the country \nand employ 53.7 percent of the private work force. Senate Democrats \nhave demonstrated their support of small business by advocating \nincreased funding for the reauthorization of the Small Business \nAdministration, supporting targeted tax relief, ensuring responsible \nregulatory relief, and increasing procurement opportunities for small \nbusinesses.\n  Small businesses are changing the face of the economy by creating \njobs and bringing prosperity to small towns and cities across the \ncountry. One such small business is the Roundup Building Center, owned \nby Doug and Julie Kapsch in Belle Fourche, South Dakota. As part of \nNational Small Business week, Doug and Julie have been awarded special \nrecognition from the Small Business Administration as the South Dakota \nSmall Business Owners of the Year.\n  Doug and Julie became business owners under a rather unique set of \ncircumstances. In 1990, a fire destroyed much of the Belle Fourche \nBuilding Center, which Doug managed at the time. Faced with adversity, \nDoug and Julie saw an opportunity. After the fire, Doug contacted the \nformer owner of the Belle Fourche Building Center, and the Kapschs \nbegan building their business. Today, Doug and Julie's business, the \nRoundup Building Center, serves the tri-state area of South Dakota, \nWyoming and Montana by providing local contractors and do-it-yourself \nbuilders with a variety of building supplies. The business has grown by \napproximately 10 percent a year under Doug and Julie's management.\n  As successful small business owners, Doug and Julie have shown that \nhard work, initiative, and a bit of risk-taking can produce big \ndividends. I congratulate them on their success and wish them many more \nprofitable years of business.\n  I would also like to commend another woman who has made significant \ncontributions to South Dakota's small business community. Sandra \nChristenson, President of Heartland Paper Council, has been appointed \nby the Small Business Administrator to serve on the National Women's \nBusiness Council. The Council advises the President and the \nAdministrator on small business issues especially important to women.\n  After serving as President of Triangle School Service in Sioux Falls, \nSandra was named President of Heartland Paper Company in 1989. In this \ncapacity, she oversees 170 employees and the company's seven thousand \ncustomers. Heartland Paper has been a vibrant member of the Sioux Falls \nbusiness community under Sandra's leadership, and I am confident that \nwith her leadership and experience, Sandra is uniquely qualified to \nrepresent the views of women business leaders and rural America before \nthe Council.\n  Small businesses are vitally important to South Dakota's economy, and \nI truly appreciate the contributions that Sandra, Doug and Julie have \nmade to our state's small business community. They join countless other \nsmall business owners across the country who have helped make America's \nvibrant economy the envy of the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/15/senate-section/article/S6326-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6326-S6327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF CARL STOKES\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man who \nhas rendered a great service to the State of South Carolina through his \nefforts as a professional law enforcement officer, Carl B. Stokes.\n  Just like his father, who was the Sheriff of Darlington County, Carl \nStokes has literally dedicated his life to crime fighting. As a matter \nof fact, I am told that he is supposed to be the longest serving lawman \nin the Palmetto State, and his distinguished career began in the 1950's \nwhile he was still attending the University of South Carolina and \njoined the South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division (SLED). In \njust a few weeks, he will bring that career to a close when he retires \nfrom his position as System Vice President for Law Enforcement and \nSafety for the University of South Carolina.\n  For more than 25-years, Carl Stokes held a number of positions within\n\n[[Page S6327]]\n\nSLED, including undercover operations, crowd control, investigations, \nand forensics. As a trusted, competent, and reliable member of SLED, \nCarl Stokes caught the attention of that agency's chief, J.P. Strom, \nwho tapped Stokes to undertake an innovative and important project-\ncreating a computer system for law enforcement in South Carolina. He is \nalso credited with implementing the first incident-based Uniform Crime \nReporting System, which is used by all law enforcement agencies in the \nPalmetto State.\n  In addition to his work at SLED, Stokes made a number of important \ncontributions to professionalizing law enforcement in South Carolina. \nHe was involved in many organizations, associations, and committees \nthat worked to make law enforcement at all levels more professional and \nefficient. Through his involvement with these groups, he became very \nwell known throughout the state and region, and his expertise was \nrespected by many. This varied and progressive experience made him an \nideal candidate to head up law enforcement and security operations at \nthe University of South Carolina, and in 1981, Carl Stokes returned to \ncollege, this time not as a student, but as a cop.\n  Law enforcement on college campuses has changed tremendously in the \npast twenty years. Colleges and universities have diverse populations \nthat are essentially the size of small cities, and it is critical that \nsuch institutions have professional police forces that are trained in \neverything from community relations to resolving a hostage crisis. Such \na responsibility is a tremendous task, but Carl Stokes was able to \ncarry out his duties with seeming ease. Over the past seventeen years, \nhe has helped to make certain that students, faculty, and staff are \nsafe and secure in housing, classrooms, and university property. He and \nhis department have worked closely with the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, the United States Secret Service, the Department of \nState, the United Nations, and a host of other national and \ninternational law enforcement agencies in order to provide security to \nvisiting dignitaries as well as to provide police services on the nine \nUSC campuses. Impressively, Carl Stokes also worked to ensure that the \nUniversity of South Carolina Division of Law Enforcement and Safety \ngained national accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation for \nLaw Enforcement Agencies. This is an especially noteworthy achievement \nas this is one of only fifteen college and university police \ndepartments in the United States to earn such a professional \nrecognition.\n  I am certain that after such a long and distinguished career, it must \nbe difficult for Carl Stokes to take off his badge and hang-up his gun, \nbut he can do so knowing that in his more than four decades as a law \nenforcement official, he made countless contributions to the safety and \nsecurity of society. I am pleased to note that all three of his \nchildren have followed in his footsteps in one way or another, his two \nsons are involved in law enforcement and his daughter works for the \nUniversity of South Carolina. I wish Carl and his wife health and \nhappiness in the years to come, I know that they will both enjoy being \nable to spend time with their children and grandchildren and reflecting \non a full life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/15/senate-section/article/S6326-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         U.S. FOREIGN OIL CONSUMPTION FOR WEEK ENDING JUNE 5TH\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise \ntoday to recognize the Leadership Training Institute (LTI), a summer \ncamp being held in Bolivar, Missouri this week. LTI is challenging \nAmerica's youth to reach for personal excellence and to lead their \ngeneration to an ever higher standard of morality and achievement than \nthe generation before them. The United States has seen success because \nindividuals have the opportunity to set standards that define their \nhighest and best.\n  Leaders have the opportunity to be both ``intensive'' and \n``extensive.'' Intensive leadership is influencing towards excellence \nthose that are closest to you--your family and friends. Extensive \nleadership is reaching beyond to your community, culture, and even the \nworld. My hope for today's youth--and those participating in this \nweek's leadership training--is that they will take the opportunity to \nbe leaders close to home and beyond.\n  Programs that guide youth in setting the highest standards for their \nlives are essential to the continuity of morality in our culture and \nthe setting of our sights on the noble. God has given principles which \nturn our eyes from the temporal, the physical, and the menial to the \neternal, the spiritual, and the noble.\n  The Leadership Training Institute is headquartered in Arkansas and \nits staff and participants come from many communities across America, \nincluding from my home state of Missouri. LTI is committed to training \nyouth in the virtues which leaders such as Thomas Jefferson considered \nto constitute the moral fabric of our society: ``With a firm reliance \non the protection of the Divine Providence; we mutually pledge to each \nother, our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.''\n  LTI educates youth in the lessons of our Nation's founders --their \nexperiences, wisdom, and legacies. Youth learn that good leaders are \npeople of faith as well as people of science. This training in American \nheritage and ingenuity prepares today's youth to set an excellent \nexample in their homes, schools, communities, and government.\n  I am proud to see the staff and supporters of the Leadership Training \nInstitute challenging America's youth to lead by personal standards of \nexcellence. Hopefully, the participants of the program this week in \nBolivar, Missouri, will set goals to become the leaders that remind us \nof all that is good in our country by advancing those values in their \nown lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/15/senate-section/article/S6327-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6327-S6328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHILDREN'S SCHOLARSHIP FUND\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, on many occasions, I have come to the \nSenate floor to talk about the importance of parental control and \ninvolvement in a child's education. Study after study has confirmed \nthat parental involvement is the single most important element in \neducational achievement.\n  One way to allow parents more control over and involvement in their \nchildren's education is to give them more choices of where to send \ntheir children to school. Choice empowers parents. It puts them in the \ndriver's seat instead of the nickel seats. I believe we want parents in \nthose front seats.\n\n[[Page S6328]]\n\n  Education is an important tool that our children need in order to \nsurvive and be successful in our society. It is sad to realize that for \ntoo many children in too many families, a safe, structured and \nchallenging education is out of reach. The public schools in many of \nour major cities simply cannot or do not provide adequate education, \nwhile a private or parochial education is too costly for most families \nof modest means.\n  On the other hand, it is encouraging when individuals in our society \nstep forward to provide the means for better educational opportunities \nfor our nation's underprivileged children. When those in the private \nsector, through their charitable giving, open the door for kids to \nreceive a high quality education, those individuals are to be \ncommended.\n  I am pleased to say that last week, two very generous and \ncompassionate Americans gave new hope to thousands of families across \nthe country who want the same thing all of us want--the best possible \neducation for their children.\n  Ted Forstmann and John Walton are businessmen, entrepreneurs and \nphilanthropists. On June 9, they launched the Children's Scholarship \nFund, which will provide scholarships to bright and deserving children \nfrom low-income families across the nation to help their parents send \nthem to any private or parochial school they're academically qualified \nto attend--from kindergarten right through high school. Thanks to these \nindividuals, new educational opportunities will now be available to \nthousands of youngsters that were not available before.\n  These two civic-minded Americans have given the fund quite a start, \nwith an initial contribution of $100 million dollars. Over the summer, \nthey will select cities to become partners with the fund, lining up \ndonors in each city to match their initial generosity. That will allow \nthis new and exciting program to distribute more than $200 million in \nscholarships in more than a dozen cities, with each scholarship being \nan opportunity for a child to prepare for a better and brighter future.\n  This national program is modeled after--and really inspired by--an \neffort Mr. Forstmann and Mr. Walton launched here in the city of \nWashington, D.C. earlier this year. Together they donated $6 million to \nthe Washington Scholarship Fund, which recently awarded scholarships to \nmore than 1,000 students from the troubled District of Columbia public \nschools. Washington is one of about thirty privately-funded scholarship \nprograms in the country. The fact that there are so many of these \nprograms speaks volumes, I think, about the state of the public schools \nin many of our cities.\n  I mention the Washington program because I think it's a good example \nof what the national effort is all about. First, the Washington \nScholarship Fund is locally-based and locally-run. Mr. Forstmann is \nright when he insists that each program must have strong involvement \nfrom local officials, community leaders, local businesses and anyone \nelse who wants to help kids obtain the best education. I have always \nbelieved that local neighborhoods and communities are in the best \nposition to create solutions to meet the specific needs of individuals \nin their communities.\n  The Children's Scholarship Fund is already in contact with more than \n300 mayors from all around the country. This is the first step in \nselecting partners who know what's needed in their community and who \nwill support this program financially and with their hard work.\n  But perhaps more important than the scholarships themselves is what \nthey represent. it's important--and maybe even a bit sad--to note that \nmore than seventy-five hundred families here in the Nation's Capitol \napplied for those 1,000 scholarships. It took a lottery to give them \nout. Mr. Forstmann has said he never dreamed the demand would be so \noverwhelming.\n  Who are these families? They're families whose children are trapped \nin public school systems that offer them no choices. If students only \nhave one choice of where to attend school, they are locked into that \nschool and don't have the capacity to say I am going to do better, I \nwill go elsewhere.\n  On the other hand, when students have more choices of where to attend \nschool, they will have the ability to receive a higher quality, more \nrigorous education. The Children's Scholarship Fund provides children \nand their families with more educational choice.\n  I believe that providing more educational choices for families can \neven help our nation's public schools, because they will understand \nthey are no longer the exclusive provider of education in their \ncommunity. They will have to start becoming the creative supplier of \nwhat it is that students need. When you have diversity and pluralism in \na school system by providing more choices for students, this creates \nenergy, creativity, and quality when institutions know that they have \nto do their best for to compete for students.\n  I commend Mr. Forstmann and Mr. Walton for providing the opportunity \nfor our nation's children to have greater choices of where to receive \ntheir education, giving them the chance to learn as much as their minds \nand hard work will allow.\n  Education is an investment in future citizens, future leaders, the \nfuture work force of America. Ted Forstmann and John Walton have made a \nprofound investment in the nation's future, one that is worthy of our \nadmiration and gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/15/senate-section/article/S6327-4", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6328-S6338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CORRECTION OF THE RECORD--JEFFORDS AMENDMENT NO. 2704\n\n  The Jeffords amendment No. 2704 which appeared in the Record of \nFriday, June 12, 1998, was missing some text.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) in order to be successful workers, citizens, and \n     learners in the 21st century, individuals will need--\n       (A) a combination of strong basic and advanced academic \n     skills;\n       (B) computer and other technical skills;\n       (C) theoretical knowledge;\n       (D) communications, problem-solving, teamwork, and \n     employability skills; and\n       (E) the ability to acquire additional knowledge and skills \n     throughout a lifetime;\n       (2) students participating in vocational education can \n     achieve challenging academic and technical skills, and may \n     learn better\n\n[[Page S6329]]\n\n     and retain more, when the students learn in context, learn by \n     doing, and have an opportunity to learn and understand how \n     academic, vocational, and technological skills are used \n     outside the classroom;\n       (3)(A) many high school graduates in the United States do \n     not complete a rigorous course of study that prepares the \n     graduates for completing a 2-year or 4-year college degree or \n     for entering highskill, high-wage careers;\n       (B) adult students are an increasingly diverse group and \n     often enter postsecondary education unprepared for academic \n     and technical work; and\n       (C) certain individuals often face great challenges in \n     acquiring the knowledge and skills needed for successful \n     employment;\n       (4) community colleges, technical colleges, and area \n     vocational education schools are offering adults a gateway to \n     higher education, and access to quality certificates and \n     degrees that increase their skills and earnings, by--\n       (A) ensuring that the academic, vocational, and \n     technological skills gained by students adequately prepare \n     the students for the workforce; and\n       (B) enhancing connections with employers and 4-year \n     institutions of higher education;\n       (5) local, State, and national programs supported under the \n     Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education \n     Act (20 U.S.C. 2301 et seq.) (as such Act was in effect on \n     the day before the date of enactment of this Act) have \n     assisted many students in obtaining technical, academic, and \n     employability skills, and tech-prep education;\n       (6) the Federal Government can assist States and localities \n     by carrying out nationally significant research, program \n     development, demonstration, dissemination, evaluation, data \n     collection, professional development, and technical \n     assistance activities that support State and local efforts \n     regarding vocational education; and\n       (7) through a performance partnership with States and \n     localities based on clear programmatic goals, increased State \n     and local flexibility, improved accountability, and \n     performance measures, the Federal Government will provide to \n     States and localities financial assistance for the \n     improvement and expansion of vocational education for \n     students participating in vocational education.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to make the United \n     States more competitive in the world economy by developing \n     more fully the academic, technological, vocational, and \n     employability skills of secondary students and postsecondary \n     students who elect to enroll in vocational education \n     programs, by--\n       (1) building on the efforts of States and localities to \n     develop challenging academic standards;\n       (2) promoting the development of services and activities \n     that integrate academic, vocational, and technological \n     instruction, and that link secondary and postsecondary \n     education for participating vocational education students;\n       (3) increasing State and local flexibility in providing \n     services and activities designed to develop, implement, and \n     improve vocational education, including tech-prep education; \n     and\n       (4) disseminating national research, and providing \n     professional development and technical assistance, that will \n     improve vocational education programs, services, and \n     activities.\n\n     SEC. 3. VOLUNTARY SELECTION AND PARTICIPATION.\n\n       No funds made available under this Act shall be used--\n       (1) to require any secondary school student to choose or \n     pursue a specific career path or major; and\n       (2) to mandate that any individual participate in a \n     vocational education program, including a vocational \n     education program that requires the attainment of a federally \n     funded skill level or standard.\n\n     SEC. 4. CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to permit, allow, \n     encourage, or authorize any Federal control over any aspect \n     of a private, religious, or home school, regardless of \n     whether a home school is treated as a private school or home \n     school under State law. This section shall not be construed \n     to bar students attending private, religious, or home schools \n     from participation in programs or services under this Act.\n\n                     TITLE I--VOCATIONAL EDUCATION\n\n                     Subtitle A--Federal Provisions\n\n     SEC. 101.

ERNEST TOMASI\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the real treasure of our state of \nVermont is the people who make up our special state. One whom I have \nknown all my life is Dr. Ernest Tomasi of Montpelier. It seems from the \ntime I was a youngster, we knew the Tomasis, and partly because like \nDr. Tomasi, my mother was an Italian American who knew almost every \nItalian American family in the area.\n  Dr. Tomasi was a true hero of WWII, but like so many, rarely ever \nspoke about what he did. In one rare instance, he was interviewed for \nThe Times Argus, and I ask that the article be printed in the Record.\n  I also want to applaud his dedication to the people of Montpelier. \nMany, many of those from my hometown received medical help and, when \nmany could not pay for it, they received it as a gift from Dr. Tomasi. \nHe was a hero abroad, but he has also always been a hero at home.\n  The article follows:\n\n                  [From the Times Argus, May 30, 1998]\n\n                   Montpelier Vet Recalls His Service\n\n                          (By David W. Smith)\n\n       Montpelier.-- Dr. Ernest Tomasi likes to tell the story of \n     the bravest act he witnessed on the European fields of battle \n     during World War II.\n       It was shortly after the invasion of the French coastline \n     at Normandy by American troops in June of 1944, and Tomasi \n     had been temporarily assigned to a medical unit with the 3rd \n     Battalion, 116th Regiment of the 29th Infantry Division.\n       Hunkered down amongst inland hedgerows--enormous earthen \n     barriers topped\n\n[[Page S6342]]\n\n     with brush and trees--Tomasi watched a young sergeant named \n     Black gather together several soldiers who spoke German and \n     French, and climb up on a hedgerow waving Red Cross flags.\n       The men were shouting in three languages that they were a \n     medical team and were trying to bring aid to both American \n     and German soldiers.\n       Apparently they were successful, and managed to bring \n     wounded from both sides back for medical attention.\n       ``Sgt. Black, after the war, married Shirley Temple,'' \n     Tomasi laughed.\n       Tomasi has a lot of stories from the years he served as a \n     surgeon with the 2nd Battalion of the 116th, his regular \n     unit. From the time they sat foot on the deadly beaches of \n     Normandy, all the way to Berlin, Tomasi traveled with the \n     soldiers, offering what medical attention he could.\n       Tomasi recalled helping a cow give birth, and the time he \n     delivered a human baby girl along the shores of the Elbe \n     river while nearby the crippled city of Berlin finally caved \n     in from the relentless attack of the Russian army.\n       Six years later, while working in his clinic on Barre \n     Street in Montpelier, Tomasi received a letter from the \n     German woman he helped, and a picture of that young girl.\n       ``Our unit liberated the first town in Germany,'' Tomasi \n     said with pride, although he couldn't recall the name of the \n     town. ``We were all sort of optimistic then.''\n       Tomasi, who was born and raised in Montpelier, attended \n     medical school at the University of Vermont, graduating in \n     1942.\n       After a year of internship in Waterbury, Conn., he flew \n     through a quick four weeks of field officer's training, and \n     was soon shipped off to England to prepare for the massive \n     American D-Day invasion.\n       While in England, Lt. Tomasi trained for the assault along \n     a beach called Slapton Sands, where many Americans got their \n     first taste of war.\n       ``They warned us that German torpedo boats . . . were \n     there. We practiced there anyway,'' said Tomasi. ``Two weeks \n     later, the 4th Battalion practiced there and lost 200 men.''\n       Not long afterward, Tomasi and his company crossed the \n     English channel aboard the ocean liner Thomas Jefferson, and \n     were soon deposited from a landing craft into the cold sea \n     water to half-walk, half-swim into shore. The 29th was one of \n     the first divisions of soldiers to attack the coast.\n       The captain of Tomasi's company was immediately wounded, \n     and had to be sent back to the ship.\n       ``I was the only officer there,'' Tomasi recalled. ``We \n     landed where we shouldn't have landed. There was a burning \n     building so the Germans couldn't see us, so we all got in \n     fine.''\n       Only when he tried to describe what happened on the beach, \n     did Tomasi run out of words, saying it was impossible to \n     describe it to anyone who had not seen it for themselves.\n       ``There were so many people there that were killed,'' he \n     said, ``It was terrible. We had to stay on the beach and take \n     care of the people.''\n       Tomasi remembers unique events from the war, preferring not \n     to dwell on the horror: He slipped easily into a story of the \n     time he was out at night riding in a jeep driven by a \n     corporal, searching for a missing sergeant.\n       An American tank lurched up behind them, and a gruff voice \n     boomed out.\n       ``What the hell are you doing out here, don't you know this \n     is no-man's land?''\n       It was the corporal who told Tomasi the man shouting was \n     General George S. Patton, who told them to return to their \n     unit and promised to find the sergeant himself.\n       Tomasi remained near Berlin until the end of the war, then \n     returned home to Montpelier, where he set up a practice, \n     raised a family and remained until the present. Tomasi's son, \n     Tim, currently serves on the Montpelier City Council.\n       He will probably walk, Tomasi said, with members of the \n     American Legion in the annual downtown Barre Memorial Day \n     Parade at 11 a.m., although Memorial Day activities don't \n     stir up any particular emotions for him.\n       ``I just think that it's nice that people take a few \n     minutes to remember,'' he said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/15/senate-section/article/S6341-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SCHOOL SAFETY AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, immediately following the \ntragedy that occurred at Thurston High School in Springfield, Oregon, \nSenator Wyden and I went to the floor of the Senate to express our \ngreat sadness and outrage that a community in our state would be \nsubject to such an act of violence. Perhaps what is equally disturbing, \nis the fact that Oregon is not alone. From Jonesboro to Springfield, \nthe virus of school violence has been indiscriminate.\n  While we will never forget these tragic events, it is time for us to \nturn our grief and our anger into action. I believe it is our \nresponsibility as legislators, governors, school officials, law \nenforcement, parents and students to work together to determine the \nsources and solutions to this complex problem.\n  To address this issue, Senator Wyden and I have introduced \nlegislation, S. 2169, to encourage states to require a holding period \nfor any student who brings a gun to school. If states pass a law \nrequiring the 72-hour detainment of a student who is in possession, or \nhas been in possession, of a firearm at school, they will receive a 25 \npercent increase in funding for juvenile violence prevention and \nintervention programs.\n  As we have learned from recent events, students who bring guns to \nschool are suspended temporarily because communities often lack the \npersonnel and resources to detain them in juvenile justice settings. By \nproviding states that pass laws requiring detainment an increase in \nfunding for prevention programs, schools will have additional resources \nto address the growing severity of violence and juvenile delinquency. \nStates may use such additional funds for prevention and intervention \nprograms that include professional counseling and detention in local \njuvenile justice centers.\n  Mr. President, it has been said that ``the foundation of every state \nis the education of its youth.'' If we do not fulfill our promise of \nproviding a strong and safe foundation for our students, education will \nnot be possible. I believe this legislation is an important step in \nbuilding a strong foundation, and I encourage my colleagues to join \nSenator Wyden and me in cosponsoring S. 2169.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/15/senate-section/article/S6342-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6342-S6343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEDICARE HOME HEALTH EQUITY ACT\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to join 16 of my \ncolleagues in cosponsoring S. 1993, the Medicare Home Health Equity \nAct. I want to commend my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, for \ntaking the lead on this extremely important issue. This legislation \nwill go a long way toward ensuring that seniors in Wisconsin continue \nto have access to the quality home health services they need, and that \nhome health providers in low-cost States like Wisconsin receive fair \nand equitable reimbursement for the valuable services they provide.\n  Mr. President, I have long supported efforts to expand access to home \nhealth care. This important long-term care option allows people to stay \nin their homes longer, where they are often most comfortable, while \nthey receive the skilled medical care they need. Home care empowers \npeople to continue to live independently among their families and \nfriends. It is of added value that in many cases, home care is also \nmore cost-effective than institutional-based care. For those seniors \nwhose medical needs can be met with home-based care in a cost-effective \nway, we should do everything we can to make sure that they have the \nchoice to continue to stay in their homes and received care through the \nMedicare home health benefit.\n  I realize that the Medicare changes Congress made last year in the \nBalanced Budget Act were necessary in order to help prevent Medicare \nfrom going bankrupt. Home health is the fastest growing component of \nMedicare and it was imperative that we bring costs under control. \nHowever, I am deeply concerned that the Interim Payment System created \nin the BBA will inadvertently penalize those States, like Wisconsin, \nthat have historically done a good job in keeping costs low.\n  The IPS established in the BBA is based on a technical formula which \npays home health agencies the lowest of three measures: (1) actual \ncosts; (2) a per visit limit of 105% of the national median; or (3) a \nper beneficiary annual limit, derived from a blend of 75% of an \nagency's costs and 25% regional costs. Without going into the details \nof this complicated formula, this in effect means that agencies that \nhave done a good job keeping costs and utilization low will be \npenalized under the IPS. At the same time, those agencies that provided \nthe most visits and spent the most per patient will be rewarded by \ncontinuing to receive higher reimbursement levels that the agencies \nthat were more efficient. Although the IPS would reduce reimbursement \nfor everyone, Wisconsin agencies have already been successful in \nkeeping costs low, and there is no fat to trim from their \nreimbursement.\n  The proposed IPS would be devastating for home care in Wisconsin and \nwould likely drive many good providers from the Medicare program. \nAlready, I\n\n[[Page S6343]]\n\nhave heard from Wisconsin agencies who have had to let staff go, limit \nnew patients, and who honestly don't know how they will be able to \nafford to operate under the IPS. This will severely hurt Wisconsin's \nseniors, many of whom will now have to enter nursing facilities because \nfar fewer home health services will be available for them.\n  Mr. President, this was not my intention when I voted for the \nBalanced Budget Act last year, and I believe that we must now work to \nmake the IPS more equitable for seniors and providers. The Medicare \nHome Health Equity Act will accomplish this by changing the formula on \nwhich IPS is based. The new formula would be based 75 percent on the \nnational average cost per patient in calendar year 1994 ($3,987) and 25 \npercent on the regional average cost per patient in calendar year 1995. \nThis change would bring more equity between States and would ensure \nthat low cost States like Wisconsin are not penalized for being \nefficient. Most importantly, this change will ensure that seniors in \nWisconsin continue to have access to the quality home health care \nservices they need and deserve.\n  Mr. President, I understand that several more of my colleagues are \nalso working on legislation that would bring greater equity to the \nInterim Payment System. I am cosponsoring this legislation not only \nbecause it is good for Wisconsin and other low cost States, but also \nbecause it is my hope that by bringing attention to this issue, we can \nall work together to find a fair solution for all States. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on this important issue during \nthe remaining months of the 105th Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/15/senate-section/article/S6342-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNITION OF CHERYL POEPPING\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, on behalf of all Minnesotans, I \nwould like to congratulate Cheryl Poepping from Cold Spring, Minnesota. \nCheryl was recently named the Minnesota state winner in the Citizens \nFlag Alliance Essay Contest. The topic of her award winning essay is \n``The American Flag Protection Amendment: A Right of the People . . . \nthe Right Thing to Do.''\n  I am submitting Cheryl's winning essay and ask that it be printed in \nthe Record. I agree whole-heartedly with her endorsement of the flag \nprotecting amendment and appreciate the words she chose to convey her \nmessage. Cheryl is an outstanding young American, and I am proud to \ncount her among my constituents. Again, I offer my sincere \ncongratulations.\n  The essay follows:\n\nThe American Flag Protection Amendment: A Right of the People . . . the \n                           Right Thing to Do\n\n                          (By Cheryl Poepping)\n\n       Maj. Gen. Patrick Brady was quoted as saying, ``Neither the \n     ACLU nor the media gave us free speech--our veterans did.'' \n     For over 200 hundred years Americans had the right to protect \n     the flag but in the cases of Texas v. Johnson in 1989 and \n     U.S. v. Eichman in 1990 the court ended this power and stated \n     that it was a ``First Amendment right of citizens to burn \n     flags in protest.'' (Goldstein 85). This allowance undermines \n     the very thing that veterans strove for, freedom. Which is \n     why H.J. Res. 54 was introduced by Gerald Solomona. This \n     resolution is a constitutional amendment proposed to prohibit \n     the desecration of the flag (Packard http.). To many the flag \n     is not just a symbol but rather representation for all the \n     men who died defending and supporting this country. By \n     allowing this to continue we not only undermine 200 years of \n     history but we also destroy patriotism and respect for the \n     country and our veterans.\n       The flag is a symbol of patriotism. Sown not only for those \n     living but those who have sacrificed to make this country \n     what it is. The flag is ``a beacon of democracy and hope in a \n     world plagued by turmoil and depression (Packard http).'' The \n     flag allows people to believe in the country and promotes a \n     level of respect for everything the country stands for. \n     Without patriotism the values of the country will decline. \n     Many feel the greatest tragedy in flag burning is the \n     mutilation of the values it embodies and the disrespect to \n     those who have sacrificed for those values (Brady http). This \n     amendment understands that when someone desecrates the flag, \n     such acts are perceived as attacks on patriotic self \n     sacrifice (Presser http).\n       If you went to Arlington Cemetery how many men do you think \n     died defending a cause as noble as democracy? The answer is \n     obvious, all of them. They did not die to protect themselves \n     or even the ones they loved, but to protect all future \n     generations and to ensure what this country is based on \n     freedom. These veterans deserve the honor that defending the \n     flag has given them. To these veterans we will be saying with \n     the passage of the flag protection amendment that we will \n     honor them through not allowing the desecration of the symbol \n     they united in defense to protect. Protection of the flag \n     comes directly from the citizens where 80% support the \n     amendment (Presser http) stating that we as citizens feel \n     that ``You--the United States--have done a whole lot for us, \n     and therefore we are going to do this for you, we are going \n     to protect you against public indignity. (National Review \n     75).'' Maj. General Patrick Brady stated that, ``I hope they \n     (the voters) will have the compassion to defer to those great \n     blood donors to our freedom, those men and women we honor on \n     Veterans Day, many whose final earthy embrace was in the \n     folds of Old Glory.'' This quote emphasizes the importance of \n     this symbol to our veterans and our country, displaying the \n     need for its protection.\n       Many oppose the constitutional amendment saying for the \n     first time in history they are limiting the freedoms of \n     Americans. This is not true. It is not a dagger struck out at \n     the first amendment, but rather a indication that popular \n     sovereignty is vital and active in this country. This \n     question demonstrates the struggle over what kind of country \n     we want to be (Presser http). The First Amendment has come to \n     protect many ideals that when it was written it has no \n     intention of protecting. The proposed amendment would merely \n     clarify that the First Amendment never presupposed citizens \n     the right to desecrate the flag (National Review 76). Flag \n     burning is not speech. It is an act that has no association \n     with the first amendment or what it preserves (Brady \n     http). In fact in the 1880's the initial flag protection \n     acts were institutionalized and later in 1984 extended \n     laws were enacted to safeguard our flag from intentional \n     public desecration (Packard http). Let it be understood \n     that such champions of liberty such as Earl Warren and \n     Hugo Black expressed their opinions that flag desecration \n     was not protected under the First Amendment (Presser \n     http).\n       Flag desecration is an act that does not represent anything \n     wholesome or respectable about our country. We as citizens of \n     this country now have the opportunity to amend this injustice \n     done to us by the passage of The American Flag Protection \n     Amendment. All responsible citizens should voice the opinion \n     that flag desecration goes against the ideas the United \n     States was conceived to uphold. The First Amendment was never \n     designed to allow these grossly offensive acts to occur. This \n     amendment would uphold the honor bestowed on those that \n     fought for this country. It would allow the loved ones of \n     those who died to know that this country is noble and worth \n     sacrificing their life for. As Stephen B. Presser stated \n     ``Disrespect, division, an disunity are not characteristic of \n     a lovable people.'' With the passage of this amendment we \n     will prove not only to ourselves but also to the world that \n     the United States does not exemplify any of these negative \n     characteristics.\n\n\n                              biliography\n\n       ``Burn the Flag?

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the City \nof Roseville, Michigan, which is celebrating its 40th birthday on June \n20, 1998. Residents of Roseville are justifiably proud of their \ncommunity's growth throughout the last 40 years.\n  People have lived in the area known today as Roseville since before \nMichigan became a state in 1837. In its early years, Roseville was an \nagricultural area and its people were predominately farmers. In 1836, \nWilliam Rose was appointed postmaster in the area and he established a \npermanent office in 1840, which he named the Roseville Post Office in \nhonor of his father, who was a hero of the War of 1812. Thus the area \nreceived its name, though Roseville was not officially incorporated as \na village until 1926.\n  From its humble beginnings, Roseville has grown into an increasingly \nattractive place to live for people moving to the Detroit area. While \nit had previously been considered a small suburb of Detroit, in the \n1950s Roseville's population increased dramatically. In 1950, the \npopulation of the village of Roseville was 15,816. By 1960, more than \n50,000 people called Roseville home. In\n\n[[Page S6344]]\n\n1958, Roseville was incorporated as a city and Arthur Waterman was \nelected as its first mayor.\n  In conjunction with a fireworks display, entertainment, and other \nbirthday festivities on June 20, Roseville officials will dedicate a \nnew addition to the city's library, demonstrating that even as they \ncommemorate the past, the people of the City of Roseville are \ncommitting themselves to the needs of the future.\n  Mr. President, I invite my colleagues to join me in offering \ncongratulations and best wishes to the residents of Roseville, \nMichigan, on this important occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/15/senate-section/article/S6343-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ST.

Mr. President, today, I would like to call to the \nattention of the Senate and the nation the exceptional work of Mr. \nHarrison Lim, founder and executive director of Charity Cultural \nServices Center in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n  Harrison Lim immigrated to the United States in 1970. He established \nthe original Charity Cultural Services Center (CCSC) in San Francisco \nin 1983 and opened a second, San Jose based CCSC in 1991. Drawing from \nhis own experiences and challenges as a newly arrived immigrant, Mr. \nLim created CCSC to help speed and ease the transition of newcomers to \nlife in America.\n  CCSC is the embodiment of Harrison Lim's belief in the importance of \ncommunity and self-sufficiency. Among the many services CCSC provides \nare English language instruction, job skills training, counseling and \nplacement, and juvenile outreach. These programs are working. The \nCenter's Employment Training and Placement Program, which trains chefs, \nbartenders and waiters, boasts a placement rate of over 90 percent. The \nCenter's Families in Transition Program is out in the community every \nday addressing the needs of at-risk young people through such things as \nacademic tutoring, counseling, volunteer opportunities, self esteem and \nconfidence building, recreational activities and parental involvement.\n  Mr. Lim's personal story is one of determination, dedication and \ntriumph. He and his wife and three children left Hong Kong to care for \nHarrison's ailing mother and begin a new life in California. Although \nhe was a respected teacher and journalist in his native land, he ran \ninto many obstacles upon his arrival to America. He had difficulty with \nthe language and was forced to accept jobs well below his skill and \neducation levels. Tragically, he also encountered people and businesses \nunwilling to give him a chance to succeed simply because he was new to \nthis country.\n  But Harrison Lim persevered and has not only succeeded, he has \nprospered. Appropriately, this prosperity cannot be measured in dollars \nand cents. To be truly understood, it must be seen in the light of the \nmany thousands of lives he and his Charity Cultural Services Center \nhave made richer over the years.\n  Twenty-eight years ago Harrison Lim travelled to a country renowned \nfor freedom and opportunity. By pursuing a life and career true to his \nown values and those of his adopted country, Harrison Lim has made the \nAmerican Dream a reality for his family and for countless others. He \nhas my utmost respect and admiration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/15/senate-section/article/S6344-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL (RETIRED) JAMES C. PENNINGTON\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge a \ngreat American, a wonderful patriot and fellow Georgian, Major General \nJames C. Pennington, United States Army, Retired, and President of the \nNational Association for Uniformed Services. General Pennington died \nJune 5th at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, where he had a \nspeaking engagement addressing the veterans and military health care \nsystems.\n  General Pennington was born in Rocky Ford, Georgia, and spent most of \nhis life soldiering--first in the military and then in a military \nassociation. Entering the armed forces during World War II, he worked \nhis way up through the ranks from private to major general. During his \ndistinguished 37-year military career, he always made taking care of \nthe troops his top priority. He was very proud to defend this great \nNation.\n  General Pennington's fight for soldiers did not cease with his \nretirement from the military. In fact, it just allowed him to expand \nthe effort on behalf of the National Association for Uniformed \nServices. He passionately and tirelessly pursued benefits for veterans \nand the health care promises made to military retirees.\n  Shortly after I was elected to the United States Senate, General \nPennington came to my office to enlist my support on this critical \nhealth care issue. This past year, I made military health care my \nnumber one legislative priority. In the National Defense Authorization \nBill for Fiscal Year 1999, I cosponsored a military health care \ninitiative which seeks to improve the quality and accessibility of \nhealth care for our veterans and military retirees. It is because of \nmen like General Pennington that this issue has been brought to the \nforefront of our attention as legislators. All veterans owe a debt of \ngratitude to him.\n  General Pennington's life is testimony to the fact that we still have \nAmerican heroes. Let us remember him and continue his crusade in \nfulfilling our commitment to our soldiers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/15/senate-section/article/S6344-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6344-S6345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING THE OAK LAWN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the \nextraordinary work of nine fifth graders and their teacher from the Oak \nLawn Elementary School in Cranston, Rhode Island. On Friday, June 5, \nthese students became the first civilians in the 223-year history of \nthe U.S. Navy to name a naval ship.\n  In February, the Navy challenged America's school children to name \nits newest oceanographic survey vessel. Out of 1,600 submissions, the \nNavy ultimately chose the name proposed by these young Oak Lawn \nstudents: the USNS Bruce C. Heezen.\n  Bruce C. Heezen was a pioneer in oceanographic research. During his \ncareer, Heezen identified the rift at the center of the Mid-Atlantic \nRidge, discovered ocean turbidity currents and formulated theories \nabout ocean crust formation. He dedicated his life to exploring the \nworld's oceans, providing future oceanographers with an invaluable \nknowledge base upon which to build. Heezen died in 1977 while aboard \nthe Navy's nuclear research submersible enroute to further study the \nMid-Atlantic Ridge.\n  These fifth graders dedicated tremendous time and energy to this \nproject. Not only did they learn about oceanography, but they also \nshared their new knowledge with their fellow students at Oak Lawn \nElementary. Now, with the naming of this new vessel, the USNS Bruce C. \nHeezen, the work of these outstanding young scholars will enlighten all \nthose who look upon this great ship. I commend Amanda Baillargeon, \nJames Coogan, Meagan Durigan, Stephen Fish, Patricia Gumbley, John \nLucier, Sara Piccirilli, Dana Scott, Rebecca Webber. I also want to \nrecognize their teacher, Ms. Marilyn Remick, who has been expanding the \nminds of students for 28 years.\n  The USNS Bruce C. Heezen is a fine and fitting name for the Navy's \nnewest oceanographic survey vessel. Rhode Islanders and all Americans \nshould be proud that students like those at Oak Lawn Elementary are \nkeeping Heezen's memory alive to inspire future oceanographers. I hope \nthe fifth graders of\n\n[[Page S6345]]\n\nOak Lawn Elementary will inspire others in search for \nknowledge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/15/senate-section/article/S6344-4", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO GERALD H. LIPKIN\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I want to pay tribute to \na good friend and exceptional leader in the business community, Gerald \nH. Lipkin, as he is honored with B'nai B'rith International's Corporate \nAchievement Award.\n  B'nai B'rith, one of the oldest Jewish organizations in our nation, \nhas long recognized model citizens for their contributions in the areas \nof business, politics, philanthropy and the arts. By conferring this \nprestigious award for Corporate Achievement on Gerry Lipkin, B'nai \nB'rith is recognizing his contributions to his community, his business \nsavvy and generosity.\n  Gerry, like me, came from humble beginnings, he from Passaic and I \nfrom Paterson. But we both made our way in the world of business. From \na young age, Gerry knew what his passion was as he worked his way \nthrough school, earning an undergraduate degree in economics at Rutgers \nUniversity as well as a master's in business administration at New York \nUniversity.\n  His business acumen is exemplified by his success at Valley National \nBank, a leading financial institution with 97 branches in Northern New \nJersey. Gerry began his career there in 1975 as Senior Vice President, \nand steadily rose to hold the joint positions of Chairman, President \nand CEO. Valley National has been nominated by U.S. Banker's magazine \nas the second most efficient bank and eighth overall best performing \nbanking company out of America's 100 largest.\n  Beyond his business accomplishments, Gerry's philanthropic \ncontributions to New Jersey and to causes across the globe are widely \nacknowledged, as is his keen sense of humor!\n  Gerry has been a staunch supporter of an organization close to my \nheart. For 15 years he has been involved with the Lautenberg Center in \nJerusalem, Israel, serving as a board member and supporting its work on \ncancer and immunology research. I founded the Lautenberg Center at \nHebrew University-Hadassah Medical Center in 1968. And twenty years \nlater, Gerry was honored with the ``Torch of Learning Award'' in 1988 \nfor all that he has contributed.\n  Gerry's volunteerism does not end there. He is also a trustee of the \nBeth Israel Hospital in Passaic, where he has served for 21 years, and \nsits on the board of trustees of Daughters of Israel Geriatric Center. \nGerry is on the nominating committee of the Federal Reserve Bank of New \nYork and the Foundation Board of William Paterson College, which \nhonored him with its Legacy Award in 1994.\n  Mr. President, Gerry and I also both share a love of trains. Gerry's \nare miniatures, while I have an affinity for larger ones. At this \npoint, I think Gerry has more trains than Amtrak, so maybe I should \ntake transportation pointers from him in the future.\n  I couldn't be happier to extend my congratulations to Gerry, and his \nwife Linda, for receiving this great honor. And I want to thank B'nai \nB'rith for recognizing Gerry's professional success and his exemplary \nservice to New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/15/senate-section/article/S6345-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6345-S6346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE CASE OF BONG KOO CHO\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the \nattention of my colleagues the case of Mr. Bong Koo Cho, whose property \nwas confiscated by the Government of Korea in 1984. His daughter, my \nconstituent, Sally Cho, is a U.S. citizen and resident of Maryland who \nhas been actively involved in the effort to recover property. Recently, \nthe Los Angeles Times published an article about the case which details \nthe plight of Mr. Cho and his family, and I would ask that the full \ntext of the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n           [From The Los Angeles Times, Sunday, Mar. 1, 1998]\n\n               From Afar, a Onetime Magnate Seeks Redress\n\n                             (By Henry Chu)\n\n       Lawsuit: In a case filed in L.A. County, a S. Korean \n     industrialist claims the Seoul government and a rival firm \n     conspired to take his business.\n       From the window of his small Westside apartment, Bong Koo \n     Cho can gaze out at the ocean, but only in his mind's eye can \n     he look across to the life and land he left more than a \n     decade ago.\n       Then, Cho was one of South Korea's wealthiest businessmen, \n     the owner of Samho, one of the nation's biggest \n     conglomerates, and the head of a sprawling estate in the \n     heart of Seoul. Chauffeurs drove him around. Maids waited on \n     his wife.\n       But in 1984, his world was overturned. The government \n     abruptly declared Samho insolvent and confiscated the entire \n     construction empire, seized the family burial plot for good \n     measure, and handed his business to a rival firm. Already in \n     the U.S. for medical reasons, Cho had no choice but to stay, \n     reduced in health and lifestyle.\n       Now, the former entrepreneur and his family have sued to \n     recover their money and property, alleging that a conspiracy \n     between the South Korean government and their rival company \n     drove them out of business. In exchange for huge kickbacks, \n     the Chos say, South Korea's leaders concocted the bankruptcy \n     charge against Samho, then divided the spoils--nearly $2 \n     billion worth in current value--among their friends.\n       The case is unusual in that the Chos are seeking redress in \n     Los Angeles County Superior Court even though the actions in \n     question took place 6,000 miles away.\n       But more than that, the lawsuit provides a unique rearview-\n     mirror look at the kinds of economic practices that first \n     turned South Korea into an economic power, and have now led \n     to its humiliating downfall.\n       Cho's was one of the numerous companies confiscated during \n     the South Korean government's ``rationalization'' of industry \n     in the early 1980s. As told by the Cho family, the episode \n     exemplified the history of collusion between South Korea's \n     government and business leaders, whose cozy relationship \n     means that political influence, nepotism and plain old graft \n     enrich the well-connected at the expense of a totally free \n     and open market. The International Monetary Fund, which is \n     now bailing out the nation's economy, has demanded an end to \n     such practices.\n       Critics call the system ``crony capitalism.'' Cho calls it \n     something else.\n       ``This was highway robbery,'' said Cho, now 78. ``And it \n     was a very simple thing: The government just wanted a \n     kickbacks''--which Cho said he refused to pay.\n       What will not be so simple, legal experts say, is proving \n     his case, given that 14 years have elapsed since Samho was \n     swallowed up by a company called Daelim Industrial. Added to \n     that is the difficulty the Cho family may have in arguing \n     that a California court, rather than a South Korean or even \n     U.S. federal court, is the proper forum for them to air their \n     grievances.\n       ``It's certainly an odd and difficult case for a California \n     state court to hear,'' says Greyson Bryan, an international \n     business lawyer in Los Angeles. ``It's a very sensitive \n     matter for an American court to become involved in an area \n     that's essentially diplomatic and political in nature.''\n       But Phil Trimble, a UCLA professor of international law, \n     said there is precedent for plaintiffs to seek justice in the \n     U.S. for illegal actions taken in foreign countries, \n     particularly if the actions violate international law. For \n     example, South American nationals have successfully sued \n     their government in U.S. courts for human rights abuses, such \n     as torture.\n       But those lawsuits filed in federal court and directed \n     against the foreign governments themselves rather than \n     private parties, as is the case in the Chos' lawsuit, which \n     names as defendants the two companies involved in Samho's \n     transfer.\n       The Chos' attorney, John Taylor of Santa Monica, counters \n     that the Chos are now U.S. citizens who are entitled to \n     relief within the state judicial system. According to Taylor, \n     the defendant companies used their ill-gotten gains to expand \n     overseas, including in California, which gives the state a \n     stake in ensuring that the companies doing business here were \n     established legally and that residents like the Chos are \n     compensated for any past wrongs.\n       ``We feel jurisdictionally the money's here, [and] the Chos \n     are in the United States,'' Taylor said. The lawsuit has yet \n     to be assigned to a judge or served on defendants, pending \n     its translation into Korean.\n       At the time of its 1984 takeover, Samho ranked No. 9 on the \n     list of South Korea's biggest chaebols, or conglomorates. \n     Specializing in construction and infrastructure, the company \n     built thousands of housing units in Seoul; helped install the \n     city's subway; owned golf courses and a resort hotel; and had \n     major contracts in the Middle East.\n       Its success represented the rags-to-riches rise of its \n     founder, Cho, the son of minor landlords who fell on hard \n     times when he was a child. After running his first business \n     at age 19, Cho scraped through World War II--he hid in a \n     Buddist monastery to escape the Japanese imperial army \n     draft--then expanded his textile business, set up South \n     Korea's first sheet-glass factory and bet on a land boom by \n     slowly acquiring more than 1,000 undeveloped acres in \n     downtown Seoul by 1960.\n       ``I could've bought more, but something like that would \n     have raised eyebrows,'' he said. ``I was raising eyebrows as \n     it was. That's a pretty massive holding.''\n       In 1970, Cho launched into construction on his many \n     properties in South Korea, amassing a fortune in real estate. \n     In 1975, he founded Samho, which concentrated on lucrative \n     government-ordered housing projects in Kuwait and Saudi \n     Arabia worth more than $1.5 billion.\n\n[[Page S6346]]\n\n       But squabbles with the Kuwaiti and Saudi governments and \n     the headaches of working in an alien environment turned the \n     first two projects into losing ventures, said Yong See \n     (Peter) Cho, who took over Samho in the early '80s while his \n     father sought treatment abroad after a series of strokes. \n     Debts mounted to about $350 million on the Middle Eastern \n     contracts, although Samho was confident that its latest \n     project in Saudi Arabia would soon be turning in a tidy \n     profit.\n       That set the stage, however, for the South Korean \n     government's bankruptcy charge against Samho.\n       On the morning of Aug. 24, 1984, according to the Chos' \n     lawsuit, the South Korean finance minister summoned Peter Cho \n     to his office. The minister, Kim Mahn Je, curtly informed Cho \n     that Samho was on the list of insolvent companies being \n     targeted for ``rationalization'' by the government, part of \n     an effort to shed financially troubled concerns and shore up \n     the economy, Samho was to be taken over by Daelim Industrial, \n     a smaller conglomerate.\n       When Cho protested, Kim advised him to stay silent. An \n     officer with Cho Hung Bank, which worked out the details of \n     the takeover, also warned Cho not to contest the decision or \n     his physical safety would be threatened, the lawsuit alleges.\n       By day's end, Peter Cho has signed over his family's \n     controlling share of Samho.\n       ``I'd been brought up in this country's system, so I knew \n     not to argue,'' the younger Cho recalled in an interview, \n     smiling bitterly at the memory. The next day, ``the 15 \n     executives of Daelim came into my headquarters office to take \n     over, like little Napoleons, in their suits and black \n     neckties.''\n       Samho's assets included ``country clubs, farms, orchards, \n     driving ranges, shopping, centers, apartment [and] \n     residences,'' valued by the bank at a total of $250 million \n     but worth at least three times that, the lawsuit claims.\n       Even the family burial plot was seized, forcing them to \n     exhume the body of a son who had died years earlier and bury \n     him elsewhere. ``We were left with just about nothing,'' said \n     Kyung Ja Cho, 73, Bong Koo Cho's wife.\n       Her husband insists that his personal holdings could have \n     more than paid off the debts from the Middle Eastern \n     projects.\n       Instead, he said, the bankruptcy charge was merely a ploy \n     to oust him for his refusal to make large donations to then-\n     President Chum Do Hwan, and reward another company, Daelim, \n     whose chairman had a brother high up in the South Korean \n     government. The Chos' lawsuit alleges that Daelim agreed to \n     pay bribes to Chun's government and his family in exchange \n     for being given Samho.\n       A spokesman for Daelim in Seoul would not comment directly \n     on the allegations.\n       ``It was such a long time ago,'' the spokesman said. ``Few \n     people in the company know about the alleged takeover, and we \n     do have any official position on the issue.''\n       Skeptics point out that Samho itself has flourished, in \n     part through government contracts, at a time when the South \n     Korean government regularly colluded the business to push the \n     tiny nation to its remarkable economic recovery since World \n     War II.\n       Ultimately, such government-business complicity and \n     cavalier lending practices helped pitch South Korea into its \n     current economic quagmire, requiring a bailout from the \n     International Monetary Fund. As a condition of assistance, \n     the IMF has demanded an end to crony capitalism and easy \n     credit.\n       Cho bristles at suggestions that he ever participated in \n     palm-greasing and cronyism.\n       ``We never benefited from any relationship with the \n     government. We've been completely victimized by it,'' he \n     said, adding that other companies like Daelim have been the \n     ones proven corrupt.\n       Indeed, Lee June Yong, who has been the head of Daelim \n     throughout this period and whose brother was speaker of the \n     South Korean parliament under President Chun, was found \n     guilty in 1996 of paying a bribe to Chun's successor, Roh Tae \n     Woo. Lee was sentenced to 2\\1/2\\ years in prison but received \n     a pardon.\n       Daelim, meanwhile, has expanded significantly since \n     swallowing up Samho in 1984. Once a minor player, it is now \n     South Korea's 17th-largest chaebol, with a subsidiary in \n     Houston that just closed its doors in January because of the \n     escalating Asian financial crisis.\n       Also named as defendant in the Cho family's lawsuit is Cho \n     Hung Bank, which facilitated the takeover of Samho. The bank \n     has also gained a foothold in the U.S., setting up California \n     Cho Hung Bank, based in Los Angeles and worth about $31 \n     million, according to Dun & Bradstreet. The U.S. unit is also \n     a defendant.\n       ``It's groundless,'' California Cho Hung's attorney, Simon \n     Hung, said of the lawsuit. ``The allegations . . . seem to be \n     based on events that occurred many years ago, long before \n     California Cho Hung Bank was established here in the United \n     States. I don't know why they're bringing a lawsuit at this \n     time here in the United States.''\n       In fact, South Korea's own judicial system has already \n     heard a case similar to Samho's--and ruled in favor of the \n     confiscated company. In 1993, the nation's Constitutional \n     Court ruled that the Chun government had illegally dissolved \n     the Kukje conglomerate on trumped-up charges of insolvency in \n     1985. Kukje's previous owners are now demanding compensation.\n       But the Cho family feels that the best chance for \n     recovering what was once theirs now lies in the U.S. Bong Koo \n     Cho and his wife have nursed such hope for years as they \n     shuttled from home to home on the Westside, finally settling \n     in their current Brentwood apartment after giving up a \n     condominium in Santa Monica that they could no longer afford.\n       The Chos maintain their simply furnished one-bedroom \n     apartment with some financial help from their six adult \n     children, who all reside in the U.S. With their savings \n     dwindling, they have applied for low-income assisted \n     housing--a far cry from the days when the two presided over \n     their 15,000-square-foot antique-filled home back in Seoul.\n       Most of the last two decades have been spent trying to \n     restore Cho's health. His strokes left him partially \n     paralyzed, forcing him to walk with a cane.\n       ``I cannot describe the pain of watching the man who built \n     Seoul's subway living out his last years in a small apartment \n     in Los Angeles,'' Sally Cho Seabright wrote about her father \n     in an essay to be published in a South Korean magazine. \n     ``When I think of what my poor parents, indeed my whole \n     family, have suffered, it makes me cry.''\n       For Peter Cho, 47, watching Daelim and Cho Hung Bank \n     prosper in the U.S. has been especially galling. ``They \n     brought their money to this country and expanded their \n     business here. Obviously they must have brought my money in \n     here.''\n       He now lives in Pacific Palisades and stays afloat by \n     managing his father's sole source of income: a couple hundred \n     acres of farmland in Kern County, purchased a few years \n     before Samho's takeover in hopes that the area was ripe for \n     development.\n       ``That's the only business mistake my father's made,'' said \n     Seabright, who lives in Maryland. Seabright has spearheaded \n     the family's efforts to tell its story, enlisting the aid of \n     a public relations firm in Washington and rounding supportive \n     letters from politicians such as U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein \n     (D-Calif.).\n       Her father, who hasn't returned to his homeland since Samho \n     was seized, mostly reads and watches CNN, monitoring events \n     in South Korea such as the inauguration Wednesday of the \n     country's latest president, former opposition leader Kim Dae \n     Jung. Jung has pledged to democratize the country further, an \n     announcement Cho greets with caution.\n       ``I don't believe it's entirely desirable for Korea to copy \n     Western democracy and Western capitalism,'' Cho said. ``We \n     have different cultures. Democracy as it's practiced in Korea \n     will be different.''\n       But some form of democracy--including a free and open \n     business culture--must come, Cho said, if only to prevent \n     another situation similar to his.\n       ``Something like this can never take place in a truly \n     democratic country,'' Cho said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/15/senate-section/article/S6345-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6346-S6347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TEXAS LOW-LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE DISPOSAL COMPACT\n\n  Mr. GORTON Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Chair lay \nbefore the Senate a message from the House to accompany H.R. 629.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist) laid before the Senate a message \nfrom the House of Representatives announcing its disagreement to the \namendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 629) entitled ``An Act to \ngrant the consent of the Congress to the Texas Low-Level Radioactive \nWaste Disposal Compact'', and ask a conference with the Senate on the \ndisagreeing votes of the two Houses thereon.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 629, \nthe Texas Compact Consent Act of 1997, as originally ratified by the \nthree states of Maine, Vermont, and Texas to address the disposal of \ntheir low-level radioactive nuclear waste.\n  The States of Maine, Vermont and Texas are now approaching the end of \na long journey that started in 1980, when Congress told the states to \nform compacts to solve their low-level waste disposal problems.\n  When this Compact is adopted as ratified by the three states, Mr. \nPresident, Texas, Maine and Vermont will become the forty second, forty \nthird and forty fourth states to be given Congressional approval for \nforming a compact and will meet their responsibilities for the disposal \nof their low-level waste from universities, from hospital and medical \ncenters, and from power plants and shipyards.\n  It is very important for my colleagues to know that the language \nratified by each state is exactly the same language, and if any \namendments are included by the conferees, the Compact would have to be \nonce again returned to each state for reratification.\n  For the nine compacts that have been consented to by the United \nStates Congress, not one of them has been amended by Congress. Not one \nof them.\n  Let me be clear: the law never intended for Congress to determine who \npays what, how the storage is allocated, and where the site is located. \nTo\n\n[[Page S6347]]\n\nthe contrary: the intent of the law is for states to develop and \napprove these details, and for Congress to ratify the plan.\n  The Compact before us does not discuss any particular site for the \ndisposal facility, but only says that Texas must develop a facility in \na timely manner, consistent with all applicable state and federal \nenvironmental, health, and public safety laws. It is the decision of \nTexas as to where the facility will be sited and is not within the \npurview of the U.S. Senate to decide for them.\n  Further, absent the protection of the Compact, Texas must, I repeat \nmust, open their borders to any other state for waste disposal or they \nwill be in violation of the Interstate Commerce Clause of the U.S. \nConstitution. The Compact gives Texas the protection that oversight \ncommissioners, mostly appointed by the elected Governor of Texas but \nalso with a say from Maine and Vermont, will decide what is best for \nTexas.\n  As we send the Texas Compact to a Senate-House conference, I ask my \ncolleagues to keep in mind that all that is required is the prompt \napproval of Congress for the Compact as originally ratified by Maine, \nVermont, and Texas so that the Texas Compact members will be able to \nexercise appropriate control over their low level nuclear waste as \nCongress mandated.\n  I thank the Chair and look forward to my colleagues continued support \nof the Texas Compact as ratified by the States when it returns from \nconference.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \ninsist on its amendment and agree to the request of the House for a \nconference; that the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the \npart of the Senate; that upon appointment of the Senate conferees, a \nmotion to instruct the conferees be agreed to which provides that the \nSenate conferees be instructed to include the Wellstone amendments in \nany conference agreement; and that once this consent is granted, \ntogether with other consent items I will go into later, Senator \nWellstone be recognized to speak for up to 1 hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

ROBINSON\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on August 31, 1995, some 1019 days ago, the \nhead of the Department of Justice's Criminal Division, Assistant \nAttorney General Jo Ann Harris, resigned. Since that time, the \nDepartment of Justice has lacked a confirmed leader for this critical \npost. Indeed, the Acting Assistant Attorney General has had to recuse \nhimself from one of the most important matters to come before the \nDepartment: the Clinton Administration's fund-raising abuses. The \nfailure of the Clinton Administration to fill this crucial position has \nhad, in my mind, a serious impact both on the performance of the \nCriminal Division and the credibility of its decisions. Over two and a \nhalf years later, I am glad to support the nomination of James K. \nRobinson to be Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division. \nThis nomination was reported out of the Judiciary Committee in April by \na unanimous vote, and I believe should receive the support of all \nSenators.\n  The Criminal Division represents the front line of the federal \ngovernment's commitment to fight crime. We rely on the Criminal \nDivision to enforce over 900 federal statutes and to develop \nenforcement policies to be implemented by the 94 U.S. Attorneys around \nthe country. Within the division are sections that carry out national \nresponsibilities crucial to protecting our citizens and property, \nincluding: Asset Forfeiture/Money Laundering, Child Exploitation and \nObscenity, Fraud, Computer Crime and Intellectual Property, Narcotics \nand Dangerous Drugs, Organized Crime and Racketeering, Public \nIntegrity, Terrorism and Violent Crime, and the Organized Crime Drug \nEnforcement Task Force. The importance of each of these sections cannot \nbe overstated.\n  I believe that this nominee is up to this demanding task. James \nRobinson has compiled an impressive record of achievement. Following \ngraduation from Wayne State University Law School, he clerked on the \nMichigan Supreme Court and then for Judge George Edwards of the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. He served with \ndistinction as United States Attorney for the Eastern District of \nMichigan during the Carter Administration. Both before and after his \nservice as U.S. Attorney, Mr. Robinson was a member of the Detroit law \nfirm of Honigman Miller Schwartz & Cohn, first as an associate and then \nas a partner. Since 1993, he has been Dean and Professor of Law at his \nalma mater, Wayne State University Law School. Finally, Mr. Robinson \nhas served on and often chaired numerous bar and civic associations, \nmany of which related to his expertise in the law of evidence. He will \nneed all of this experience and more to fulfill such a demanding \nposition.\n  One of the most important duties assigned the head of the Criminal \nDivision is to advise the Attorney General on the appointment of \nindependent counsels. In my mind, Attorney General Reno was very poorly \nserved by the Criminal Division over the past year while considering \nwhether to appoint an independent counsel related to the fund raising \nefforts made by the President and Vice President in conjunction with \nthe 1996 elections. While I was pleased to see the Department secure \nthe indictments of Johnny Chung and Charlie Trie, I believe both the \nDivision and the Attorney General misapplied the independent counsel \nstatute by taking into consideration factors which the law does not \nallow.\n\n[[Page S6348]]\n\nThere are many both inside and outside Congress, including this \nSenator, who believe that the statute has many flaws, but so long as \nthe law is on the books it must be applied fairly and consistently. \nThis Department of Justice has not done so, and I place a large part of \nthe blame on the Criminal Division.\n  Congress has responded to the unacceptable levels of crime by \nincreasing the Department of Justice's budget: in fact, the \nDepartment's budget has skyrocketed since 1994, rising from under 11 \nbillion dollars in FY 1994 to over 20 billion dollars in FY 1998. \nHowever, I am concerned about the decline in federal prosecutions in \nseveral critical areas despite this increased funding. First, at a time \nwhen the administration is calling for more gun control, I am concerned \nthat the Department of Justice is not adequately enforcing current gun \nlaws. The annual number of weapons and firearms prosecutions brought by \nthis Administration has plummeted. For example, federal weapons and \nfirearms prosecutions are down 18.7 % since 1992.\n  More importantly, I am concerned that the Department of Justice is \nnot enforcing current laws meant to punish gun-toting criminals. \nSpecifically, the number of prosecutions made under Project Triggerlock \nhas collapsed. Initiated by the Bush Administration, Project \nTriggerlock targets federal prosecution and tough federal sentences on \nthe worst violent offenders committing crimes with guns. In its first \nyear, FY 1992, the program worked remarkably well: 4,353 federal cases \nwere brought against 7,048 defendants for violations of federal law \ninvolving the use of a firearm. Yet, the number of these cases has \nfallen throughout the Clinton Administration, and in FY 1997 the \nDepartment of Justice reported only 2,844 cases under Project \nTriggerlock, a stunning 34.6% decrease since 1992. Through the \neffective use of federal powers and resources, U.S. Attorneys can \ngreatly assist state and local law enforcement in keeping the most \ndangerous offenders off the streets. Unfortunately, this extremely \neffective program has lost priority in the Clinton Administration.\n  I have been concerned about the performance of the Criminal Division \nand the United States Attorneys in a number of additional areas over \nthe past several years. Whether it has been the intentional failure of \nU.S. Attorneys in California to enforce Indian gaming laws, the \nunfortunate surrender of our borders to drug trafficking, the recent \ndecision to distort the Controlled Substances Act to allow doctors to \nuse drugs to assist suicides, or the repeal of a memorandum by Attorney \nGeneral Richard Thornburgh which ensured federal prosecutors did not \nsettle with charging defendants with lesser violations while more \nserious offenses were ignored, the administration's crime fighting \ndecisions have, in some areas, not met the high standard the public \ndeserves. These concerns, however, do not diminish my recognition of \nthe work of the thousands of federal law enforcement officials who ably \ncarry out the responsibility of enforcing our federal laws.\n  As I pointed out at his confirmation hearing, Mr. Robinson has been \nnominated to a position of great trust. If confirmed, he will play a \nkey role in advising the nation's chief law enforcement officer on \nmatters of serious national concern. Mr. Robinson assured the Judiciary \nCommittee that although he naturally would feel loyalty to the \nadministration which selected him, he would stand above politics and \nserve the public.\n  During his confirmation hearing, I raised many of these important \nissues with Mr. Robinson. Although he was not in a position to have \nformed concrete opinions on some issues which have been debated between \nthe Congress and the administration, I was heartened by his promise to \nwork with the Congress and to bring fresh approaches to tough issues. \nBy moving this nomination without further delay, the Congress will \nensure that the Criminal Division once again will have the leadership \nit sorely needs to play a leading and effective role at the vanguard of \nfederal law enforcement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/15/senate-section/article/S6347-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to speak out this evening \nabout an enormously important issue that has seldom, if ever, been \naddressed on the floor of the United States Senate. I understand my \ncolleague needs to leave at 7, and I am going to try to figure out a \nway to accommodate him if at all possible. My understanding is, I will \nalso have a chance to speak more about this in morning business.\n  This issue I want to address tonight has variously been called \n``environmental discrimination,'' ``environmental equity,'' \n``environmental justice,'' or ``environmental racism.'' These terms are \nused interchangeably to describe the well-documented tendency for \npollution and waste dumps to be sited in poor and minority communities \nwho lack the political power to keep them out.\n  Environmental justice has been at the center of the debate over H.R. \n629, legislation granting congressional consent to the so-called Texas \nCompact. If passed unamended by this Congress, the Texas Compact would \nresult in the dumping of low-level radioactive waste from nuclear \nreactors in Texas, Maine, and Vermont--and potentially from nuclear \nreactors all over the country--in the poor and majority-Latino town of \nSierra Blanca in West Texas.\n  Environmental justice is an issue that demands the full attention of \nthe Senate. If we pass this legislation unamended, we can no loner \npretend to be innocent bystanders as one poor, minority community after \nanother is victimized by political powerlessness--and, in some cases, \nby overt racism. We can no longer pretend that a remedy for this basic \nviolation of civil rights is beyond our reach. That is the ultimate \nsignificance of this legislation--and of this debate.\n  The moral responsibility of the Senate is unavoidable and undeniable. \nIf we approve H.R. 629 without conditions, the Compact dump will be \nbuilt within a few miles of Sierra Blanca. There's really very little \ndoubt about that. And if that happens, this poor Hispanic community \ncould become the premier national repository for so-called ``low-\nlevel'' radioactive waste.\n  If we reject this Compact, on the other hand, the Sierra Blanca dump \nwill not be built at all. The Texas Governor has said so publicly--more \nthan once. It's as simple as that. The fate of Sierra Blanca rests in \nour hands.\n  Compact supporters would prefer that we consider the Compact without \nany reference to the actual location of the dump. But that simply \ncannot be done. It's true that H.R. 629 says nothing about Sierra \nBlanca. But we know very well where this waste will be dumped. In that \nrespect, the Texas Compact is different from other compacts the Senate \nhas considered.\n  The Texas legislature in 1991 already identified the area where the \ndump will be located. The Texas Waste Authority designated the site \nnear Sierra Blanca in 1992. A draft license was issued in 1996. License \nproceedings are now in their final stages and should be completed by \nsummer. Nobody doubts that the Texas authorities will soon issue that \nlicense.\n  There's only one reason why this dump might not get built--and that's \nif Congress rejects the Texas Compact. In an April 1998 interview, \nTexas Gov. George Bush said, ``If that does not happen,'' meaning \ncongressional passage of the Compact, ``then all bets are off.'' In the \nEl Paso Times of May 28, Gov. Bush said, ``If there's not a Compact in \nplace, we will not move forward.''\n  For these reasons, we cannot fairly consider H.R. 629 without also \nconsidering the dump site that Texas has selected. Sierra Blanca is a \nsmall town in one of poorest parts of Texas, an area with one of the \nhighest percentages of Latino residents. The average income of people \nwho live there is less than $8,000. Thirty-nine percent live below the \npoverty line. Over 66 percent are Latino, and many of them speak only \nSpanish.\n  It is a town that has already been saddled with one of the largest \nsewage sludge projects in the world. Every week Sierra Blanca receives \n250 tons of partially treated sewage sludge from across the country. \nDepending on what action Congress decides to take, this small town with \nminimal political clout may also become the national repository for \nlow-level radioactive waste. And I understand plans for building even \nmore dump sites are also in the works.\n  Supporters of the Compact would have us believe that the designation \nof Sierra Blanca had nothing to do with the income or ethnic \ncharacteristics of its residents. That it had nothing to do with the \nhigh percentage of Latinos in Sierra Blanca and the surrounding \nHudspeth County--at least 2.6 times higher than the State average. That \nthe percentage of people living in poverty--at least 2.1 times higher \nthan the State average--was completely irrelevant.\n  They would have us believe that Sierra Blanca was simply the \nunfortunate finalist in a rigorous and deliberate screening process \nthat fairly considered potential sites from all over the State. That \nthe outcome was based on science and objective criteria. I don't \nbelieve any of this is true.\n  I am not saying science played no role whatsoever in the process. It \ndid. Indeed, based on the initial criteria coupled with the scientific \nfindings, Sierra Blanca was disqualified as a potential dump site. It \nwasn't until politics entered the picture that Sierra Blanca was even \nconsidered.\n  I think it is worth taking a moment to review how we got to where we \nare today. The selection criteria for the dump were established in \n1981, and the Texas Waste Authority hired engineering consultants to \nscreen the entire state for suitable sites.\n  In March 1985, consultants Dames & Moore delivered their report to \nthe Authority. Using ``exclusionary'' criteria established by the \nAuthority, Dames & Moore ruled out Sierra Blanca and the surrounding \narea, due primarily to its complex geology.\n  Let me quote from that report. Features ``applied as exclusionary as \nrelated to the Authority's Siting Criteria'' included ``the clearly \nexclusionary features of: complex geology; tectonic fault zones,'' et \ncetera. ``The application of exclusionary geological criteria has had a \nsubstantial impact'' in screening potential sites, the report observed.\n  In its final composite, the report explained, ``Complex geology and \nmountainous areas in West, West-Central, and the Panhandle of Texas \nwere excluded,'' including the Sierra Blanca dump site.\n  The report also fund, ``Many tectonic faults occur in West Texas \nwithin massive blocks of mountain ranges. This area includes El Paso \n[and] Hudspeth'' counties ``and has undergone several phases or \nepisodes of tectonic disturbance.''\n  Finally, it went on to observe that, ``Although not excluded, the \nremainder of Hudspeth Country does not appear to offer good siting \npotential.''\n  So much for the science. Repeatedly since the early 1980s, the Waste \nAuthority has come back again and again to this politically powerless \narea. It has designated four potential sites in all, and--with one \nrevealing exception--all of them were in Hudspeth County. There are \nonly three communities in the entire County, all of them poor and \nheavily Latino, and all of them targeted by the Authority.\n  A 1984 public opinion survey commissioned by the Texas Waste \nAuthority provides some useful context for the Authority's site \nselection process. The report, called ``An Analysis of Public Opinion \non Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal in Selected Areas,'' noted the \nbenefits of keeping Latinos uninformed.\n  The report states, ``One population that may benefit from [a public \ninformation] campaign is Hispanics, particularly those with little \nformal education and low-incomes. The Authority should be aware, \nhowever, that increasing the level of knowledge of Hispanics may simply \nincrease opposition to the [radioactive dump] site, inasmuch as we have \ndiscovered a strong relationship in the total sample between increased \nperceived knowledge and increased opposition.''\n  The first site to be targeted was Dell City in Hudspeth County. The \nEl Paso Herald-Post of March 6, 1984 recounts the controversy over that \nsite selection. ``The [Texas Waste] Authority has set up certain \ncriteria as guidelines for choosing a disposal site. It appears\n\n[[Page S6350]]\n\nto be ignoring its own rules.'' ``The Authority, instead of abiding by \nits written criteria, has set up an unspoken, alternate rule for \nlocating the site. That is, `The site shall be located where there are \nthe fewest possible number of registered voters to protest.''' A \ndisproportionately high number of Latinos in Hudspeth County are not \nregistered to vote.\n  The Herald-Post goes on to describe some of the political maneuvering \nbehind the initial selection of Hudspeth County. ``The plot thickens. \nThe University of Texas system owns 500,000 acres of land around Dell \nCity. Mrs. Dolph Briscoe, wife of the former governor, sits on the \nsystem's Board of Regents. Briscoe has extensive land holdings close to \nthe other proposed site. So at a public meeting on October 25, 1983, in \nDimmit County, Briscoe said he was encouraging the Authority to locate \nthe site `on state lands in Hudspeth County.' '' The editorialists at \nthe Herald-Post conclude, ``We haven't exactly got any heavyweights \ndefending our interests in this matter.''\n  The one exception to the Authority's pattern of targeting the poor \nLatino communities in Hudspeth County was in 1985, after completion of \nthe engineering consultants' report. Dames & Moore concluded that the \n``best'' sites were in McMullen and Dimmit Counties, and the Waste \nAuthority settled on a site in McMullen County. But this decision met \nwith fierce opposition from politically powerful individuals. So the \nAuthority decided once again to move the dump back to Hudspeth County.\n\n  At this point all pretense of objectivity was abandoned. The \nselection criteria were changed in 1985 so as to rule out the two \n``best'' sites identified by Dames & Moore. The new criteria gave \npreference to sites located on state-owned land. This change had the \neffect of virtually guaranteeing selection of a site somewhere in \nHudspeth County, large portions of which are owned by the state of \nTexas.\n  So the Waste Authority proceeded to designate, based on an informal \nand cursory process, five sites in Hudspeth County. Its clear choice, \nhowever, was Fort Hancock, one of the County's three poor Latino \ncommunities.\n  Unfortunately for the Authority, the more politically powerful city \nof El Paso next door decided to fight back. Together with Hudspeth \nCounty, El Paso filed suit against the site selection. They argued that \nthe Hancock site was located in an area of complex geology--much like \nSierra Blanca, incidentally--and lay on a 100-year flood plain. The \namazing thing is that they won. In 1991 U.S. District Court Judge Moody \nruled in their favor and ordered no dump could be built in Fort \nHancock, Hudspeth County.\n  But the county's court victory was short-lived. The Waste Authority \nwas clearly not about to give up. The Authority went back to the state \nlegislature to get around Judge Moody's decision by once again changing \nthe rules. A legislator from Houston, far to the East where the big \nutilities are based, proposed a bill that ignored all previous \nselection criteria and designated Fort Hancock once and for all. \nInterestingly enough, this maneuver aroused a great deal of public \nindignation, precisely because of the Authority's perceived \ndiscriminatory practice of dumping on Latino communities.\n  There was an impressive show of force against discrimination, but the \noutcome was not exactly what Hudspeth County had in mind. After Judge \nMoody's remarkable decision, lawyers for El Paso and the Waste \nAuthority worked out a compromise. Fort Hancock would be saved, but a \n400 square mile area further north in Hudspeth County would take its \nplace. This oblong rectangle imposed on the map--an area that included \nSierra Blanca--was subsequently dubbed ``The Box.'' The Texas \nlegislature passed the so-called ``Box Law'' by voice vote only days \nbefore the end of session in May 1991.\n  Once again, the previous site selection procedures were stripped \naway. The Box Law repealed the requirement that the dump had to be on \npublic land, the very requirement that has pointed the Authority \ntowards Hudspeth County in the first place. This was necessary because, \nat that time, the Sierra Blanca site was not public land at all.\n  Most importantly, to prevent another troublesome lawsuit like the \nFort Hancock debacle, the Box Law essentially stripped local citizens \nof the right to sue. It denied them all judicial relief other than an \ninjunction by the Texas Supreme Court itself, and for this unlikely \nprospect citizens would be required to drive 500 miles to Austin.\n  This story is depressingly familiar. A similar scenario unfolds over \nand over again in different parts of the country, with different names \nand faces in every situation. Sometimes there is no intention by anyone \nto discriminate. But pervasive inequalities of race, income, and access \nto the levers of political power exercise a controlling influence over \nthe siting of undesirable waste dumps.\n  The people who make these decisions sometimes are only following the \npath of least resistance, but in far too many instances the result is a \ntargeting of poor, politically marginalized minority communities who \nlack the political muscle to do anything about it.\n  The remarkable thing about this story is that some people in Hudspeth \nCounty did fight back. Dell City fought back and won in the early \n1980s. Fort Hancock fought back and won their court case in 1991. And \nmake no mistake, the people of Sierra Blanca are fighting back, too.\n  Many of them have been here on the Hill. Father Ralph Solis, the \nparish priest for Sierra Blanca and Hudspeth County, was here in \nFebruary, and visited many Senate offices. These people know that the \nodds are stacked against them, but they are persevering just the same.\n  One of the amendments I included in this bill is intended to give \nthem a fighting chance. It gives them their day in court--the right to \nchallenge this site selection on grounds of environmental justice. It \nsays that the Compact cannot be implemented in any way--and that would \ninclude the siting process, the licensing process, or the shipment of \nwaste to that site--that discriminates against communities because of \ntheir race, national origin, or income level.\n  If local residents can prove discrimination in court, then they can \nstop the Compact Commission from operating the dump. They don't have to \nprove intent, by the way, although that certainly would be sufficient. \nAll they have to show is disparate treatment or disparate impact.\n  I believe very strongly that the Compact raises important and \ntroubling issues of ``environmental justice.'' And a diverse array of \ncivic organizations agree with me about this.\n  The Leadership Council on Civil Rights, the Texas NAACP, the Sierra \nClub, the League of United Latin American Citizens (or ``LULAC''), \nGreenpeace, the Bishop and the Catholic Diocese of El Paso, the House \nHispanic Caucus, the United Methodist Church General Board of Church \nand Society, Friends of the Earth, Physicians for Social \nResponsibility, the Southwest Network for Environmental and Economic \nJustice, and the National Audubon Society, to name just a few, agree \nwith me. I ask unanimous consent that a letter signed by these and \nother organizations be printed in the Record at the end of my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I know some of my colleagues don't \nbelieve issues of environmental justice are implicated here. Or they \nmay think this is not a question for the Senate to decide. I believe \nthis amendment meets those concerns. All my amendment does is give \nlocal residents the right to make their case in court. There is no \nguarantee they will win. After all, it is extremely difficult to prove \nenvironmental discrimination. I don't see how anyone would want to deny \nthese people a chance to make their case.\n  Short of defeating the bill outright, I believe passing this \namendment is the only way for us to do right by the people of Sierra \nBlanca.\n  Yet, as amazing as it sounds, Compact proponents also claim to have \nthe best interests of Sierra Blanca at heart. They claim the Compact \nwill protect local residents because it keeps out waste from states \nother than Maine and Vermont. They have used this argument again and \nagain, in Sierra Blanca, in the Texas legislature,\n\n[[Page S6351]]\n\nin the House of Representatives, and they're using it again in the \nUnited States Senate.\n  Supporters of the Compact are trying to have it both ways. When \nchallenged about the environmental justice of targeting Sierra Blanca, \nthey respond that no site has been selected, and environmental justice \ncan only be addressed if and when that ever happens.\n  Then in the same breath they insist that the dump in Sierra Blanca is \ndefinitely going forward and the Compact is therefore necessary to \nprotect local residents from outside waste. So which is it? Either the \nSierra Blanca dump is a done deal or it's not.\n  The truth is, the most likely scenario is that the dump will be built \nin Sierra Blanca if Congress approves this Compact, subject to any \nlegal challenges, but the project will not go forward if Congress \nrejects the Compact.\n  The claim that the Compact will protect Sierra Blanca makes no sense \non its face. The dump is unlikely to be built without congressional \nconsent to this Compact; it does not need to be built; and the Compact \nwould not protect Sierra Blanca in any event.\n  The simple fact of the matter is that the dump will most likely not \nbe if the Compact fails. Governor Bush has made it very clear that the \ndump will not be built if Congress rejects the Compact. So the argument \nthat Sierra Blanca needs the Compact for protection against outside \nwaste is nonsensical. If Texas does not build a dump in Sierra Blanca, \nlocal citizens do not need to be protected from anything. Far from \nprotecting Sierra Blanca, the Compact only ensures that a dump will be \nbuilt in their community.\n  An article from the Texas Observer of last March explains why the \nCompact is necessary for the dump to go forward. ``Texas generates \nnowhere near enough waste on its own to fill a three million cubic feet \ndump, and by its own projections [the Texas Waste Authority] could not \nsurvive without Maine and Vermont's waste.''\n  Moreover, the Texas legislature has indicated it will not appropriate \nfunding to build the dump if Congress rejects this Compact. Texas \nlawmakers refused the Waste Authority's request for $37 million for \nconstruction money in FY 1998 and FY 1999. In fact, the Texas House \ninitially zeroed out all funding for the Authority, but funding for \nlicensing was later restored in conference committee. My understanding \nis that construction funding was made contingent on passage of the \nCompact, whereupon Maine and Vermont will each be required to pay Texas \nover $25 million.\n\n  In fact, the Sierra Blanca dump does not really need to be built. You \nmight have seen the headline in the New York Times on December 7 of \nlast year: ``Warning of Excess Capacity in Nation's Nuclear Dumps--New \nTechnology and Recycling Sharply Reduce the Volume of Nuclear Waste.''\n  The article discusses a study by Dr. Gregory Hayden, the Nebraska \nCommissioner for the Central Interstate Compact Commission. Dr. Hayden \nfound that ``there is currently an excess capacity for low-level \nradioactive waste disposal in the United States without any change to \ncurrent law or practice.''\n  He went on to explain, ``These disposal sites have had low \nutilization due to falling volumes since 1980. Thus, a high capacity \nremains for the future, without any change to the current configuration \nof which states may ship to which disposal site.'' Let me repeat the \nessential point: there is no compelling need for any new low-level \nradioactive waste dumps in this country. And if no new dump is built, \nnobody can argue that the Compact is needed to protect Sierra Blanca.\n  The most popular argument for building another dump involves disposal \nof medical waste. I'm sure all of you have heard it. It's claimed that \nwaste from medical facilities and research labs is getting backed up--\nthat it has to go somewhere.\n  But let me emphasize one central and indisputable fact: over the last \nfew years, over 99 percent of the waste from Maine and Vermont has come \nfrom nuclear reactors. Less than one percent has been from hospitals \nand universities. And from all three states, 94 percent of the low-\nlevel waste between 1991 and 1994 came from reactors. This dump is \nbeing built--first and foremost--to dispose of radioactive waste from \nnuclear reactors, not from hospitals.\n  So why are the nuclear utilities hiding behind hospitals and \nuniversities? It's not very hard to figure out. In 1984 the Texas Waste \nAuthority hired a public relations firm to increase the popularity of \nnuclear waste. The PR firm recommended, ``A more positive view of safe \ndisposal technologies should be engendered by the use of medical \ndoctors and university faculty scientists as public spokesmen for the \n[Texas Waste] Authority.'' ``Whenever possible,'' the report said, \n``the Authority should speak through these parties.''\n  Well, that advice has been followed to the letter. We all have \nsympathies for hospital work and university research. I know I do. But \nthat's beside the point. This controversy is really about waste from \nnuclear reactors.\n  If a dump is built nevertheless, the Compact offers little protection \nfor local residents. The Compact Commission would be able to accept \nlow-level radioactive waste from any person, state, regional body, or \ngroup of states. All it would take is a majority vote of the \nCommissioners, who are appointed by the Compact state governors.\n  Why should the people of Sierra Blanca expect unelected commissioners \nto keep waste out of their community? Is there anything in their recent \nexperience that would justify such faith?\n  The fact is, the state will have every economic incentive to bring in \nmore waste. The November 1997 report by Dr. Hayden concluded that ``the \nsmall volume of waste available for any new site would not allow the \nfacility to take advantage of economies of scale. Thus, it would not \neven be able to operate at the low-cost portion of its own cost \nfunctions.''\n  The new dump will need high volume to stay profitable. The Texas \nObserver reports, ``A 1994 analysis by the Houston Business Journal \nsuggests that the Authority would open the facility to other states to \nkeep it viable.''\n  We have here the potential for establishing a new national repository \nfor low-level nuclear waste. Not only will Texas have an incentive to \nbring in as much waste as possible, but the same will be true of \nnuclear utilities. The more waste goes to Sierra Blanca, the less they \nwill be charged for disposal.\n  Rick Jacobi, General Manager of the Texas Waste Authority, told the \nHouston Business Journal: ``The site is designed for 100,000 cubic feet \nper year, which would be about $160 per cubic foot. But if only 60,000 \ncubic feet per year of waste arrives, the price would be $250 per cubic \nfoot.'' That's a big difference.\n  As Molly Ivins says, ``That sure would drive up costs for Houston \nLighting and Power and Texas Utilities.'' And the going rate at one \nexisting dump is a whopping $450 per cubic foot. In the end, it will be \nin the economic interest of everyone--from the nuclear utilities to the \nWaste Authority--to ship as much waste to Sierra Blanca as they can.\n  My second amendment addresses this problem. Throughout the process of \napproving the Compact, supporters claimed the waste would be limited to \nthree states. I want to hold them to that promise. My amendment puts \nthat promise in writing.\n  I doubt anyone would disagree that this understanding was shared by \neveryone who participated in the Compact debate. If Compact supporters \ntruly plan to limit waste to three states, which has been everyone's \nunderstanding all along, they can have no objection to my amendment. \nIt's nothing but a protection clause. A nearly identical amendment--\ncalled the Doggett Amendment--was attached to the bill passed by the \nHouse.\n  There are other issues I was not able to address with amendments. I \nthink there is a fundamental concern about whether this kind of \ndisposal is safe at all. The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) warns \nthat, despite the hazards involved, waste will be buried in \nsoil trenches destined to leak, as have nuclear dumps in Kentucky, \nIllinois; and Nevada. LCV did score the House vote on final passage, \nand has announced that it may score Senate votes as well. I ask \nunanimous consent to place the LCV letter in the Record.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S6352]]\n\n\n\n\n                                League of Conservation Voters,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 1998.\n     Re oppose the Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal \n         Compact Consent Act.\n\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator: The League of Conservation Voters is the \n     bipartisan, political arm of the national environmental \n     movement. Each year, LCV publishes the National Environmental \n     Scorecard, which details the voting records of members of \n     Congress on environmental legislation. The Scorecard is \n     distributed to LCV members, concerned voters nationwide and \n     the press.\n       Soon the Senate may be voting on S. 270, The Texas Low-\n     Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact Consent Act. LCV \n     urges you to vote against this bill, which is the key to \n     opening a new nuclear dump near Sierra Blanca, Hudspeth \n     County, Texas.\n       More than 99% of the radioactive waste shipped from Maine \n     and Vermont in recent years was generated by nuclear \n     reactors. Despite the misleading classification of ``low-\n     level,'' many of these wastes are highly concentrated and \n     some can give a lethal dose in about five minutes. Atomic \n     power plant waste in this category includes long-lived \n     elements like plutonium-239, which remains hazardous for \n     240,000 years, and cesium-135, which remains hazardous for 20 \n     million years.\n       Despite its hazards, the waste would be buried in Texas in \n     unlined soil trenches destined to leak, as nuclear waste \n     dumps in Kentucky, Illinois and Nevada have. A survey of 27 \n     other nations with radioactive waste programs found that not \n     one of these nations allows shallow land burial of such long-\n     lasting nuclear materials.\n       The selection of a poor Mexican-American community (which \n     is already the site of one of the largest sewage sludge \n     projects in the U.S.) has caused local environmentalists to \n     file a civil rights complaint against the Texas. Maine and \n     Vermont radioactive waste agencies. Furthermore, dumping \n     radioactive waste near Sierra Blanca, approximately 16 miles \n     from the Rio Grande River, would violate the 1983 La Paz \n     agreement between the U.S. and Mexico, which commits both \n     countries to prevent, reduce and eliminate pollution \n     affecting the border area.\n       LCV's Political Advisory Committee will consider including \n     votes on S. 270 in compiling LCV's 1998 Scorecard. Thank you \n     for your consideration of this issue. If you need more \n     information please call Betsy Loyless in my office at 202/\n     785-8683.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Deb Callahan,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, there is also an obvious concern about \nthe unsuitability of Sierra Blanca's geology--the exclusionary \ncriterion from the 1985 Dames & Moore report. Sierra Blanca is situated \nright in the middle of the state's only earthquake zone. Its 1993 \nlicense application stated that this is ``the most tectonically active \narea within the state of Texas.'' In April 1995 there was a 5.6 \nearthquake 100 miles away, in Alpine, Texas. And there have been two \ntremors in the area in the last four years.\n  Radioactive Waste Management Associates (RWMA) of New York has \nconducted an independent investigation of the dump site and found its \ngeology unsuitable for disposal of radioactive waste. RWMA notes that\n\n     research by the Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal \n     Authority has found that [there is] a fault in the bedrock \n     buried beneath the Sierra Blanca site. Groups of earth \n     fissures up to seven feet deep occur nearby.\n\n  RWMA concludes that\n\n     some important natural features of the site--its seismic \n     hazard, its buried fault, and nearby earth fissures--are not \n     suited to radioactive waste isolation. In our professional \n     opinion, these are fatal flaws which mean that the proposed \n     Sierra Blanca site cannot provide a high degree of assurance \n     of waste containment.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to enter the letter from RWMA into the \nRecord.\n  The concern about the environmental impact of this dump extends well \nbeyond the border. The Mexican equivalent of the EPA announced its \nopposition on March 5 on grounds that the Sierra Blanca dump poses an \nenvironmental risk to the border region. On February 11, the Mexican \nCongress, represented by its Permanent Commission, declared\n\n     that the project in Sierra Blanca in Texas, and all such \n     dumping projects along the border with Mexico, constitute an \n     aggression against national dignity.\n\n  Moreover, the project apparently violates the 1983 La Paz Agreement \nbetween Mexico and the US, which commits both countries to prevent \npollution affecting the border area. I ask unanimous consent to enter \nthese statements by Mexican authorities into the Record.\n  The environmental justice amendments I proposed have been endorsed by \nseveral newspapers and civic organizations. The Fort Worth Star-\nTelegram of May 1, 1998 reads,\n\n       The amendment to the Texas/Maine/Vermont Compact by \n     Minnesotan Sen. Paul Wellstone is a good one. Too often in \n     our country's industrialized history, poor, politically \n     powerless minority communities have been targeted for \n     unwanted hazardous waste dumps. . . . The Wellstone amendment \n     needs to stay in the final version of the bill.\n\n  The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights wrote to likely conferees \non May 14, 1998,\n\n       The Senate-passed bill contains two amendments sponsored by \n     Sen. Paul Wellstone that we urge the conferees to include in \n     any final conference report.\n\nThe Leadership Conference states that\n\n     a matter of increasing concern to the civil rights community \n     [is] the disparate treatment of poor and minority communities \n     regarding environmental siting issues, also known as \n     environmental justice.\n       In recent years, our nation has gained a better \n     understanding of the national pattern of discrimination in \n     the placement of waste and pollution sites in \n     disproportionately poor and minority communities.\n\n  By the end of their letter, the Leadership Conference ``strongly urge \nthe inclusion of the Wellstone/Doggett amendments in any final bill \napproved by Congress.''\n  The Methodist Church's General Board of Church and Society wrote on \nApril 30, 1998, ``We applaud and support these [Wellstone] amendments. \nThey are a small victory for the victims of environmental racism.''\n  The Sierra Club wrote on June 4, 1998, ``Sen. Paul Wellstone has \nintroduced two amendments that would improve the bill,'' though the \nSierra Club believes the bill remains deeply flawed. I ask unanimous \nconsent that all these statements be placed in the Record.\n  Not everyone has been so supportive, of course. I think it would be \nappropriate for me to respond to some of the arguments that have been \nraised against my amendments.\n  First, it's been suggested that passage of my amendments would \nrequire states to reratify the Compact. Second, a recurring theme \nechoed by Compact supporters is that Congress has never before attached \nthese kinds of conditions to a state compact. Third, Senators from \nCompact states have suggested that no environmental discrimination \ncould possibly have occurred in this case because residents of Sierra \nBlanca actually support the dump. Finally, it has also been claimed \nthat the Compact is a state or local matter, in which people from other \nstates have no business interfering.\n  As a preliminary matter, I question the relevance of these \narguments--at least with respect to the Wellstone/Doggett amendment. \nThis question has already been settled. Both the House and Senate have \nagreed to limit waste to the three Compact states. There really is very \nlittle for the conference committee to decide. I do not understand why \nwe are even having this discussion at this stage in the process.\n  Nevertheless, I do want to respond to some of these arguments \nindividually. First: the reratification argument. I believe there may \nbe some confusion as to what my amendments actually do. As the House \nparliamentarian found with respect to the Doggett amendment, these \namendments do not actually alter the Compact itself. Instead, they \nimpose conditions on the consent of Congress.\n  The Compact, for constitutional reasons, cannot go into effect \nwithout that consent. And Congress has already conditioned its consent \non certain other requirements. My two amendments simply add to that \nlist of congressional conditions.\n  With regard to the Wellstone/Doggett limitation, there's no reason \nwhy this amendment should require reratification. When the Compact made \nits way through the legislative process the first time, everybody \nunderstood that waste would be limited to the three states. My \namendment only reaffirms the common understanding of everyone involved. \nWhy should states be required to reaffirm a principle to which they \nhave already given their consent?\n\n  I'm not sure this conclusion is really so controversial--even within \nthe Compact states themselves. I have in my hands an internal \nmemorandum from Roger Mulder of the State Energy Conservation Office of \nthe Texas General Services Commission. Mr. Mulder was an environmental \naide to Gov. Richards and handled Compact issues in the Richards \nAdministration. His memo is addressed to John Howard, an environmental \nadviser to Governor Bush. It is\n\n[[Page S6353]]\n\ndated October 10, 1997, just days after passage of the Doggett \namendment in the House.\n  The first line of the memo reads, ``There appears to be a unanimous \nagreement that the Doggett amendment does not require the Texas Compact \nto be returned to the state legislatures.'' ``Unanimous agreement.'' \nThat's not just the view of Mr. Mulder. According to his memo, that \nview is universally held.\n  The Mulder memo goes on to note that ``Maine appears to be leading \nthe charge in the effort to drop the Doggett amendment.'' The reason? \n``There is speculation that Maine believes it can send its \ndecommissioned waste to Barnwell, South Carolina,'' get credit for the \nwaste it otherwise would have sent to Texas, and ``then sell that \ncredit at a substantial profit for Maine.'' That's what Mr. Mulder's \nmemo says, at least.\n  Nevertheless, I have been willing--and remain willing--to allay any \nlegitimate concerns Compact supporters may have about the need for \nreratification. I offered to instruct conferees to put Congress on \nrecord--in the statement of managers--that no reratification is \nrequired. My offer was rejected.\n  The second argument advanced by Compact supporters is that no \nprevious Compact has received such shabby treatment at the hands of \nCongress. Even if Congress had never before attached these kinds of \nconditions, that would say nothing about how Congress should treat THIS \nCompact. Why should we be bound by what prior Congresses have done?\n  And besides, this Compact is different from previous ones. We know in \nadvance where the Texas dump will be located. And this particular site \nselection raises important questions of environmental justice.\n  Third, Compact supporters go so far as to claim that local residents \nactually support the Compact, and therefore no discrimination could \nhave been involved in the site selection. Even if it were true that the \ndump enjoyed local support, I don't see what this has to do with site \nselection.\n  But more importantly, my argument that local residents should have a \nchance to challenge the dump site does not depend--one way or the \nother--on whether the proposed Compact dump is popular in Hudspeth \nCounty. I am simply saying that there should be some forum to resolve \nthe claims of environmental discrimination that have been raised. I \ncannot say for certain what the outcome of such a challenge would be. \nBut local residents should at least have a chance to make their case.\n\n  In any event, the argument that local residents support the dump is \nsimply not true. I am surprised to hear it being made. Local \ncongressmen of both parties seem to agree on this point. The Republican \ncongressman who represents Hudspeth County, Henry Bonilla, wrote to the \nSenate on March 13, 1998: ``My constituents adamantly oppose this \nlegislation.''\n  In a letter to senators dated February 2, Democratic Congressmen \nDoggett, Reyes, and Rodriguez wrote,\n\n       The [House] bill passed despite overwhelming opposition by \n     the residents in Hudspeth County, Presidio County, Jeff Davis \n     County, Culberson County, Val Verde County, Reeves County, \n     Webb County, Brewster County, the cities of Sierra Blanca, \n     Del Rio, Brackettville, Marfa, Van Horn, and Alpine, and the \n     governor of the neighboring state of Chihuahua.\n\n  In fact, 22 of the surrounding counties have passed resolutions \nopposing the dump, as have 11 nearby cities. No city or county, to my \nknowledge, has passed a resolution in favor.\n  Jeff Davis County did pass a resolution of support while under the \nimpression that the Compact would keep waste out of Texas. When \ninformed that the Compact would do no such thing, they reversed their \nvote almost immediately. Compact lobbyists nevertheless continue to \ncite the first resolution.\n  The only poll ever taken in Hudspeth County showed massive opposition \nto the dump. In 1992 the Texas Waste Authority commissioned K \nAssociates of El Paso to conduct a telephone poll. That poll found 64 \npercent of Hudspeth and Culberson County residents opposed the dump.\n  Opposition was surely even stronger than that, since poor residents \nwithout telephones were greatly underrepresented in the survey. Only 33 \npercent of respondents to this poll were Hispanic, while Hispanics \naccount for 66 percent of the local population. As a general \nproposition, I understand that the dump is much more unpopular with the \nLatino majority than with the white minority.\n  I don't know anyone who has ever attended a local meeting over the \ndump could have any doubts about how local residents feel. Over 700 \ncounty residents showed up at a public hearing on April 21, 1992. While \n90 people spoke, only two supported the dump. At another public hearing \nin August 1996, over 80 percent of those attending spoke out against \nthe dump.\n  Local opponents of the dump have collected an overwhelming number of \nsignatures in opposition. Over 800 local residents, all of them adults, \nhave signed petitions opposing the dump. These include two out of four \ncommissioners on the County Commissioner's Court--Wayne West and Curtis \nCarr. (A third commissioner--Jim Kiehne--has publicly stated his \nopposition).\n  My understanding is that dump supporters have only managed to collect \naround 30 to 40 names. Many who signed the petitions in support of the \ndump later said they were confused; the petition claimed to be \nprotecting Sierra Blanca from outside waste. Some of them have also \nsigned petitions opposing the dump.\n  I think the most reliable testimony about local opposition to the \ndump comes from Father Ralph Solis, the Catholic parish priest for \nSierra Blanca and Hudspeth County. He visited Washington in February to \nlet Senators know how much his parishioners oppose their dump:\n\n       Before leaving for Washington D.C., the people of the \n     parish said to me, ``Please, father, make them understand \n     that we do not want radioactive nuclear waste.'' All of us in \n     far west Texas implore the Senate to take a good look at us \n     and realize that we are real people in danger and without any \n     real voice. . . . We beg the Senate to stand with us as like \n     our sisters and brothers from other faiths and Christian \n     denominations from across the country. I am here with this \n     group from West Texas, a few small voices trying to speak for \n     so many. Please, we beg you, do not abandon us.\n\n  Citizens across the state seem to feel the same way. In a state wide \npoll conducted in October 1994, 82 percent of Texans opposed ``the \nproposal to store out-of-state radioactive materials in Texas near \nSierra Blanca.'' Only 13 percent favored the proposal.\n  Senators from Compact states have touted the views of two local \nfigures as proof of Sierra Blanca's support for the dump. One of these \nindividuals is a banker who heads the local economic development \ncommission, which is funded by the Texas Waste Authority. My \nunderstanding is that he is a resident of Santa Teresita, not of Sierra \nBlanca. He developed a connection to Sierra Blanca in 1994 when he \nbecame president of the local bank.\n  The other local figure is Judge James Peace, the County Judge who \npresides over the County Commissioners' Court. Both Judge Peace and \nother Compact supporters have claimed his reelection in March of this \nyear, with 54 percent of the vote, is proof that local voters support \nthe Compact. But can anyone honestly claim that the dump was an issue \nin his reelection campaign, or that local residents were aware of his \nposition on the dump?\n  An editorial in the Hudspeth County Herald of April 17, 1998, \naddresses Judge Peace's claims. It says that the March elections were \nnot a referendum on the dump, and that many other issues were involved. \n``In no way, Judge Peace, was the dump implied in the last election.'' \nMore importantly, it says, ``Your letter states that you have always \nbeen a vocal supporter of the dump . . . which is not true. Do you \nremember your first campaign? You told the folks when you sat in their \nliving rooms that you were opposed to the dump.''\n  Judge Peace recently traveled to Washington and met with me in my \noffice. He is a very nice man, and I very much enjoyed our meeting. \nIndeed, Judge Peace told me directly to my face that he supports the \nWellstone/Doggett amendment. He later wrote me a letter reversing \nhis position. I can see why local residents might be a little confused \nabout where he stands.\n\n  Finally, it is argued that the Compact is a matter for the three \nstates to decide, that selection of the dump site is Texas' business, \nand that outsiders should mind their own business. More specifically, I \nhave been asked why, as\n\n[[Page S6354]]\n\na senator from Minnesota, I should have such a deep and abiding \ninterest in this matter.\n  The simple answer is that, if this were only a matter for the three \nstates to decide, H.R. 629 would not be before the Senate. The Compact \ncannot go into effect without the consent of Congress. And the dump \nwill not go forward without the Compact.\n  The decision whether to build this dump depends on how we decide to \nproceed on this bill. That's what it boils down to. It is quite obvious \nto me that we cannot avoid responsibility for our votes and our actions \nin this matter.\n  My driving concern has always been very simple. I cannot stand by and \nwatch while a poor, politically powerless, Latino community is targeted \nto become the premier repository of low-level nuclear waste for the \nentire country. Much less give it my blessing. Not when I have the \npower to do something about it.\n  As a very basic proposition, I think we can all agree that it's wrong \nfor poor, politically powerless, minority communities to be singled out \nfor the siting of unwanted hazardous waste dumps. It's wrong when that \nhappens in Sierra Blanca, and it's wrong when it happens in hundreds of \nother poor minority communities all across this country.\n  I want to do whatever I can to stop it, and I don't see why every one \nof us should not want to do the same. I don't understand why it should \nbe considered unusual for a senator to care about these things. On the \ncontrary, I think it should be unusual for a senator not to care about \nthese things.\n  The broader point is that environmental justice is not just a local \nissue, but a national one. There are some issues of fundamental justice \nthat rise to a level of national importance, and this is surely one of \nthem.\n  I think it's high time for the Senate to just say ``no.'' Not just to \nthe Sierra Blanca dump, but to a national pattern of discrimination in \nthe location of waste and pollution. We have to face up to these urgent \nissues of environmental justice--sooner rather than later.\n  The primary reason I came to the floor today was to draw my \ncolleagues' attention to the pressing issue of environmental justice. \nBut I had another motive as well. I wanted to explain the history of \nthe debate over this bill.\n  I wanted to make sure there is no confusion over what agreements have \nbeen made, how the Senate amendments would work, what the mandate of \nthe conference committee is, and what we can expect if the conference \nviolates that mandate.\n  Let us step back for a moment and review how we got to where we are \ntoday. Over the past year I expressed vehement opposition to any \nCompact legislation that did not address the issue of environmental \njustice. I offered my two amendments in an effort to do just that. The \nresulting standoff prevented this bill from coming to floor for almost \na year.\n  Finally, about three months ago, senators from Compact states agreed \nto include my two amendments. On April 1 of this year, the Senate \nunanimously approved them both.\n  Unfortunately, however, after agreeing to my amendments, senators \nfrom Compact states suggested publicly that the amendments should be \nstripped in conference committee. So as a condition of going to \nconference, I insisted that conferees be instructed to keep the \namendments in any bill reported back to the Senate.\n  Let me, since I will have time to talk more about this and I want to \naccommodate my colleague, talk about one other amendment that we have \nalso attached to this piece of legislation.\n  This amendment, Mr. President, essentially says, if colleagues are \ngoing to say that there should only be radioactive waste from Maine and \nVermont, if that is what the Texas legislature intended, then we should \nmake it clear when we pass this compact that that will be the case. \nThis was the Doggett amendment in the House of Representatives which \npassed the House, and this was also a part of an amendment that has \npassed the Senate as well.\n  Let me just kind of be clear about what this unanimous consent says. \nWe are now instructing the conference committee that they are to \nsupport these two amendments, which the Senate has now gone on record \nsupporting. All of my colleagues are on record, because the Senate has \nvoted to support these two amendments, that the people at least should \nhave a chance to go to court. And, if they can prove discrimination, \nthey ought to be able to make their case.\n  They ought to at least be able to make that appeal. And secondly, if \nwe are saying that this waste is only going to come from Maine and \nVermont because the people in Sierra Blanca and people of Texas are \nworried this will become a national repository site for nuclear waste, \nthen we make it clear in the amendments that, indeed, will be the case.\n  Now, Mr. President, in conclusion, although I will have more to say \nall week about this, Senators from the compact States were first \nreluctant to give those instructions. Their objections have delayed the \nconference for the last month. Then last week--and I am glad they did \nso--they withdrew their objections and agreed to insist on the \nWellstone amendments. It was this agreement that will allow H.R. 629 to \ngo to conference.\n  In other words, I will keep my word all the way through. I said I was \njust trying to get these amendments onto the bill because I think these \namendments would lead to much more fairness and much more justice for \nthe people in Sierra Blanca.\n  Well, now we are about to go to conference and I only want to \nemphasize one point. The Senate has now agreed unanimously, including \nSenators from the compact States, to instruct conferees on the \nWellstone amendments. Conferees should not report back to the Senate \nany bill that has been stripped, where the amendments have been taken \nout. Without those environmental justice amendments, there should be no \nbill. If there is a compact which is approved without the people in \nSierra Blanca having the right to challenge this in court, if they can \nshow discrimination, and without the assurance that this waste will \nonly come from Vermont and Maine, then this will be an injustice and \nthe Senate should not let that happen. Any attempt to strip these \namendments from the bill, which is what the nuclear utilities would \nlike conferees to do, would make a mockery of the House and Senate \nvotes to include the Wellstone and the Doggett language. It would make \na mockery of Senate instructions and would make a mockery of our \nprofessed concern for environmental justice.\n  When the House and Senate have both decided to include these \namendments, the conference committee really has no business trying to \nstrip them out. I think that would be the kind of backroom deal that \nmakes Americans disgusted with politics. That would be the legislative \nprocess at its worst--serving the interests of the nuclear utilities \nover interests of people who lack comparable access to the levers of \npolitical power.\n  If that happens, Mr. President, not only would Congress be denying a \nremedy for environmental discrimination, not only would Congress be \ngiving a green light to the Sierra Blanca dump, not only would Congress \nbe giving a seal of approval to the targeting of a poor majority-Latino \ncommunity for disposal of radioactive waste, if the conference \ncommittee proceeded to drop these amendments, they would provide a \nstriking example of unequal access to political power here in \nWashington that produces environmental discrimination in the first \nplace.\n  The issue of environmental justice deserves better than that. The \npeople of Sierra Blanca deserve better than that. And the American \npeople have a right to expect a higher level of conduct from their \nelected representatives. I will take advantage of every procedural \nmeans at my disposal to make sure that does not happen.\n  Mr. President, to accommodate my colleague's schedule, the Presiding \nOfficer, I conclude my remarks and yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S6355]]\n\n                             EXHIBIT NO. 1\n\n         Sierra Club, League of United Latin American Citizens \n           (LULAC), Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR), \n           National Audubon Society, Friends of the Earth, U.S. \n           Public Interest Research Group, Public Citizen, \n           Greenpeace, Greenpeace Mexico, Catholic Diocese of El \n           Paso, Save Sierra Blanca, and 109 National, \n           International, Regional, Statewide and Local \n           Organizations,\n                                                   March 11, 1998.\n     Senator Paul D. Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: We ask that you vote against S. \n     270, the ``Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact \n     Consent Act'' because it:\n       Approves of what appears to be environmental racism that \n     resulted in selecting a poor \\1\\ Mexican American community \n     \\2\\ which does not want the dump \\3\\ and is already the \n     location of one of the largest sewage sludge projects in the \n     country.\\4\\ It is one of numerous proposed radioactive and \n     hazardous facilities along the Mexican border.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of letter.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Although the Compact does not expressly designate Hudspeth \n     County, the Faskin Ranch near Sierra Blanca clearly has been \n     chosen and a draft license approved. The decision Congress \n     now faces on Compact approval cannot be made in a vacuum, \n     ignoring serious environmental justice questions that have \n     been raised about the site selection process. Congressional \n     approval would make challenging the unjust procedures that \n     have been carried out, in apparent contradiction of the 1994 \n     Executive Order on environmental justice, more difficult \n     because more out-of-state money, pressure and legal \n     commitments will come to bear.\n       We caution Congress not to be complicit in what has become, \n     whether intentional or not, a repulsive trend in this country \n     of siting the most hazardous and undesirable facilities in \n     poor communities with high percentages of people of color. \n     Texas is second only to California, another proposed \n     radioactive dump state, in the number of commercial hazardous \n     waste facilities located in communities with above-national-\n     average percent people of color.\\5\\\n       Deals with intensely radioactive materials which, despite \n     their classification as ``low-level,'' are not low risk and \n     include all the same elements as high-level waste from \n     nuclear power and weapons. Nationally, nuclear power waste \n     comprises the vast majority and medical waste consistently \n     comprises less than one tenth of a percent of the \n     radioactivity in so-called ``low-level'' waste.\\6\\ For Main \n     and Vermont, 99.5% to 100% is from nuclear reactors \\7\\ and \n     lasts for centuries. In contrast, medical treatment and \n     diagnosis wastes characteristically have tiny amounts of \n     relatively low-concentrations of radioactivity with very \n     short hazardous lives.\\8\\ Options other than burial with \n     reactor waste are technically viable and need exploration.\n       Potentially threatens the Rio Grande by permitting burial \n     of long-lasting (hundreds to millions of years hazardous \n     \\9\\), highly concentrated wastes (some can give a lethal dose \n     in about 5 minutes \\10\\) in soil trenches destined to leak \n     \\11\\ and requiring only 100 years of institutional \n     control.\\12\\\n       According to the 1993 license application for the Sierra \n     Blanca site, it is part of ``the most tectonically active \n     area within the State of Texas.'' The atomic waste is \n     proposed to be buried directly above a fault. This presents \n     an unacceptable risk from earthquakes.\n       Violates the 1983 La Paz Agreement with Mexico in which \n     both countries agreed to cooperate to ``. . . prevent, reduce \n     and eliminate sources of pollution . . . which affect the \n     border area . . .'' The site, approximately 16 miles from the \n     Rio Grande, is well within the ``border area'' (63 miles on \n     each side of the border).\n       Opens the door to waste from all over the country, despite \n     claims to the contrary. The Compact has numerous provisions \n     \\13\\ for importing radioactive waste from more generators \n     than those in Maine, Vermont and Texas. The Compact \n     Commission (governors' appointees from Texas, Maine, Vermont \n     and any future party states) will have the power, without \n     legislative or local approval, to enter into agreements to \n     take waste from out of compact.\\14\\ With a majority vote of \n     the Compact Commission and the Texas legislature, other \n     states may become party states. So, to claim that the Compact \n     protects from other states dumping is misleading and false.\n       Has numerous loopholes in the provisions that are touted to \n     limit out-of-compact waste volume to 20% of the amount Texas \n     dumps. This is misleading because it is the amount of \n     radioactivity that is of concern. There is no limit on the \n     amount of radioactivity that can be imported into the \n     proposed Texas dump. Wastes imported from non-party states \n     via agreements are not subject to the 20% limit. The limit is \n     only an estimate based on a 50-year projection and it can be \n     changed.\\15\\ It does not apply to wastes brought in for \n     ``processing.'' A major radioactive waste processor has \n     entered into an option agreement \\16\\ to lease property \n     neighboring the proposed dump, thus indicating another avenue \n     for unlimited volumes of radioactive waste going to Hudspeth \n     County.\n       Appears to violate Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act \n     passed by Congress to prevent discriminatory activities and \n     prohibiting use of federal money for programs that \n     discriminate.\\17\\\n       Will result in thousands of miles of unnecessary \n     transportation of dangerous radioactive materials including \n     plutonium, cesium, and strontium from atomic power plants. \n     Wastes will be trucked from Maine, Vermont, east Texas and, \n     very likely, other locations, to the border area.\n       For these reasons, we urge that you give S. 270 close \n     scrutiny and a ``No'' vote.\n       For further information (including contact information on \n     the following signers) please contact Diane D'Arrigo at \n     Nuclear Information and Resource Service (202) 328-0002 (ext \n     2).\n           Thank you,\n       Signers Opposing S. 270, The Texas Compact and Sierra \n     Blanca Nuclear Waste Dump:\n       ACES/Hudspeth Directive for Conservation, Alliance for \n     Survival, Americans for a Safe Future (CA), Arizona Safe \n     Energy Coalition, Asociacion Mexicana de Estudios para la \n     Defensa del Consumidor, Asociation Ecologica Santo Tomas, \n     Audubon Council of TX, AWARE, Andrews, TX, Blue Ridge \n     Environmental Defense League, Border Coalition Against \n     Radiation Dumping, Border Environmental Network, California \n     Communities Against Toxics, Catholic Diocese of El Paso, \n     Center for Environmental Health, Citizen Alert (NV), Citizen \n     Action Coalition of Indiana, Citizens Awareness Network (New \n     England), Citizens Protecting Ohio, Citizens at Risk: Cape \n     Cod (MA), Citizens Energy Coalition (NJ), Coalition for \n     Nuclear Power Postponement (DE), Comite de Derechos Humanos \n     de Tabasco, Committee for a Safe Energy Future (ME), \n     Communities Helping Oppose Radioactive Dumping (NJ), \n     Connecticut Opposed to Waste, Consejo Ecologico de Mazatlan, \n     Conservation Council of North Carolina, Crescere, Desert \n     Citizens Against Pollution, and Donald Judd Foundation (TX).\n       Earth Day Coalition (OH), Earth Island Institute, \n     Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund, EarthWINS (WI), \n     Environmental Coalition on Nuclear Power (PA), Fort Davis TX \n     Chamber of Commerce, Friends of the Earth, GE Stockholders \n     Alliance, Global Resource Action, Grandmothers for Peace \n     Internat'l., Greenpeace, Greenpeace Mexico, Grupo De Los \n     Cien, Grupos de Estudios Ambientales, Hightower Radio, \n     Hoosier Env'tal Council (IN), HOPE (NE), Houston Audubon \n     Society, Indigenous Environmental Network (AK), Indigenous \n     Environmental Network, Internatl'l Env'tal Alliance of the \n     Bravo, League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), \n     Madres de East Los Angeles, Marfa TX Chamber of Commerce, \n     Mennonite Central Committee, Wash.
