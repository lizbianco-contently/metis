Mr. President, we have the opportunity this week, I \nbelieve, to complete action on the Interior appropriations bill and on \nthe Food and Drug Administration reform package. There has been a lot \nof work done on FDA, and I believe a consensus is evolving. Hopefully, \nwithin a day or day and a half, we could complete action on that bill \nthis week. And if time permits, we will also take up the D.C. \nappropriations bill which would be the last of the 13 appropriations \nbills the Senate needs to pass.\n  Today, though, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 2107, the \nInterior appropriations bill. As announced earlier, there will be no \nrollcall votes today. Any votes ordered on amendments to this bill, \nH.R. 2107, will be set aside to occur at a time to be determined by the \nmajority leader in consultation with the minority leader. Presumably, \nthat would be in the morning, hopefully even early in the morning. The \nSenate will be able, hopefully, to conclude debate on the Interior bill \nby Tuesday. We have one of our most outstanding chairmen who is \nmanaging this bill. I think this one is going to be a handful for him, \nbut they have worked out a number of issues. I feel like we will be \nable to get an early resolution and complete action on the Interior \nappropriations bill. Members are encouraged to contact the managers of \nthe bill to schedule floor action on any possible amendments. I hope \nMembers will not wait until sometime Tuesday afternoon or late Tuesday \nnight, or whenever, when it is convenient for them to drop by if they \nhave any amendments. If you have a good amendment, you get more \nattention, you get a better chance to have it properly considered and \neven get a vote if you show up early for work and offer your amendment.\n  As Members are aware, then, there will only be one appropriations \nbill left, and we will take it up later on this week or the D.C. \nappropriations bill will come up perhaps early next week. We need \nMembers' cooperation in scheduling floor action, and we will attempt to \nconclude action on both these bills this week. We will notify the \nMembers when rollcall votes are agreed to.\n  Under rule XXII, all first-degree amendments to S. 830, that is the \nFDA reform bill, must be filed by 1 p.m. today. I want to remind \nMembers of that deadline.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention, and I wish the chairman \nand manager of the bill, the great Senator from the State of \nWashington, good luck in completing his work.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/15/senate-section/article/S9303-4", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9303-S9332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  1998\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of H.R. 2107, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2107) making appropriations for the Department \n     of the Interior and related agencies for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 1998.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n\n            Excepted Committee Amendment on Page 46, Line 15\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the committee \namendment on page 46, line 15.\n  The distinguished Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the majority leader has already pointed \nout what he hopes will be the schedule in connection with this and \nother bills during the course of the week. As he said, there will not \nbe any votes on any amendments to this bill today, but\n\n[[Page S9304]]\n\nthrough most of last week, we expressed our views that today would \npresent a wonderful opportunity to debate what may very well be the \nmost controversial of all of the elements in the bill: the \nappropriation for the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\n  The notices that I have received in connection with amendments \ninclude more on that subject, those which are to be more liberal with \nthe National Endowment than the bill has been and those wishing to be \nmore conservative or to restrict its use or even to abolish its \nappropriation, have stated that they will produce such amendments.\n  We have asked as many of those Members to be present sometime during \ntoday's session of the Senate as possible. Most of them on Friday \nindicated that they would be able to be here today. Obviously, as the \nmajority leader said, today gives them an opportunity to debate their \namendments and to state their views on the National Endowment for the \nArts in full and at leisure, where tomorrow may be somewhat more \nhectic.\n  So I hope that all of them who are in or around the Capitol and the \nstaffs of all of those Senators who have an interest in the subject \nwill urge them to come to the floor, offer their amendments, speak to \nthe National Endowment for the Arts, complete much of the debate on the \nsubject today so that we can vote tomorrow on that subject.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, noticing that no such Senators are \npresent today, I have remarks on a subject of importance--vital \nimportance--to the people of the State of Washington, one that has a \nhigh local profile and one that has also been of interest to the \nadministration to the extent that it made a specific reference to it in \nits budget presentation this year. So I will ask the indulgence of the \nPresident and will make my remarks with respect to the Elwha River dams \nat this point.\n  Mr. President, during the course of the last week, I said publicly \nthat I would consider supporting removal of one of two dams on the \nElwha River on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State. Specifically, \nwith important conditions attached, I can support legislation that \nwould allow the removal of the smaller downriver dam. As this \nrepresents something of a change in my position, it warrants a more \ndetailed explanation on my part--what this new position means and, just \nas importantly, what it does not mean.\n  For many years, national environmental groups, the Clinton \nadministration, much of the media in the Pacific Northwest, and many \nNorthwest elected officials have pushed for the removal of both dams on \nthe Elwha River.\n  In 1992, I reluctantly supported legislation to begin the process of \nhaving the Government study and acquire both of these dams with an eye \ntoward removing them at some time in the future. Even so, it is no \nsurprise to anyone from Washington State to hear me say today that I \nhave been less than excited about this proposal. While I always have \nbeen enthusiastic about the Federal Government's purchasing these two \ndams from a local paper company, I have been skeptical that Elwha River \ndam removal will provide significant benefit to our salmon resources.\n  For years, I have been told that 100-pound salmon used to fill the \nElwha River, and that if we just removed these two dams, those big \nsalmon would return.\n  While that is the proponents' most compelling argument--perhaps their \nonly argument--for removal, I fear that it is one with the promises \nthat have caused us to spend some $3 billion on the Columbia River, \nwith little discernible effect, except on our power costs. If dams are \nthe reason that there are no 100-pound salmon swimming in the Elwha \nRiver, why are there no huge salmon in dozens of other Olympic \nPeninsula rivers that have never been dammed? Will we waste our money \non the Elwha as we have on the Columbia?\n  As you can tell, I have severe doubts about the wisdom of knocking \ndown either of these dams under the guise of benefit to the salmon. I \nam quite certain, however, that there are other clear costs to their \nremoval. Taxpayers must pay the huge costs of that removal. Power \ngeneration will be lost, and in the case of the Elwha River Dams, \nserious questions remain about potential damage to the city of Port \nAngeles' water supply. As I weigh these costs against the potential \nbenefits to salmon, I have almost always sided against dam removal.\n\n  Unfortunately, the issue isn't as simple as a cost-benefit analysis. \nIf it were, the costs of removing the two dams would certainly outweigh \nthe potential benefit to the salmon. But, as I say, it is not just that \nsimple anymore. There is a wild card to this issue that makes me \nnervous, a wild card that makes me want to act now, a wild card that, \nif played, could have a devastating effect on the Port Angeles \ncommunity.\n  The desire of the Interior Secretary to tear down a dam, a proposal \nhe has advocated consistently, together with the very real and growing \nthreat that a Federal judge, or the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, may order the removal of Elwha River Dams without \ncongressional approval, present real threats to the community, are \nbeyond our control and cannot be ignored.\n  A court- or agency-ordered removal may well impose all of the costs \nof removing the dams on the local community. Jobs would be destroyed, \nand Port Angeles' supply of clean drinking water would be threatened. \nThe risk of court or agency action is too great and will leave the \nlocal community in a terrible position if a judge or Washington, DC, \nbureaucrat were to suddenly decide that he or she could take charge of \nthis issue.\n  The lower Elwha River Dam produces only a modest amount of power, \nabout a third of that produced by the upper Elwha River Dam, and a \nminuscule amount in comparison to our productive Snake and Columbia \nRiver Dams. In addition, Mr. President, the lower Elwha River Dam is in \nbad physical shape.\n  So, if Congress acts properly, we can remove the wild card from the \ndeck and assure an important level of community protection. As a \nconsequence, my support for this lower dam's removal is conditioned on \nlegislated protection for Port Angeles' water supply and protection for \nthe jobs created by the local mill. No legislation to remove an Elwha \nRiver Dam will pass the U.S. Senate without these protections, except \nover my strong objections, while I am a Member.\n  Mr. President, I must tell you that while I believe the course of \naction I am taking on the issue is the right one, I am disturbed by \nwhat is forcing me to take this step in such a hasty manner. I am \ndriven by the threat of court action, or the possibility that the \nFederal Government might just step in and remove the dams on its own \nwith no thought given to the concerns of the local community.\n  While I have come to this agonizing decision after years of internal \nand public debate about the fate of these dams, my decision has been \ndriven by the unilateral activism this administration has demonstrated \nwhen it comes to complex environmental issues.\n  Based upon the Clinton administration's actions last year in Utah, \ncan anyone not justifiably worry that a similar overreaching Federal \nGovernment authority will take place on the Elwha River? Is there any \ndoubt that when this administration is faced with deciding between the \ndesires of national environmental organizations and the needs of local \ncommunities, it always sides with the national environmental groups?\n  This is not an easy decision for me--it is made difficult by the \ndozens of meetings I've had with people most affected by this issue. \nI've listened to hundreds of local people who live near the Elwha River \nexpress their concerns with dam removal and what it means to the local \ncommunity.\n  To be fair, I am also impressed by the work of a broad-based \ncoalition of residents who have studied the issue and who may have \noriginated the proposal to deal with the two dams separately, in a \nstaged process. I want to commend the Elwha Citizens' Advisory \nCommittee for its work on this issue, and all of the hard work that \nwent into developing the committee's report, ``The Elwha River and Our \nCommunity's Future.''\n  I've also listened to the concerns of my constituents in eastern \nWashington, who while not immediately impacted by the removal of the \nElwha River dams, are watching this debate closely because of their \nconcern that something similar could happen on the Columbia or Snake \nRivers.\n\n[[Page S9305]]\n\n  I want to speak specifically to those people right now, Mr. \nPresident, and to anyone who might attempt to use my position on this \nissue as a justification for removing other dams in the Pacific \nNorthwest, or as asserting that I believe the idea to be worth \nconsidering.\n  Because of the controversial nature of this issue, I think it is \nimportant that people understand what my position on the Elwha River \ndams does not mean. Some groups and elected officials support removal \nof Elwha River dams as a first step, a practice run, toward removing \nColumbia River system hydroelectric dams. Those who want to make a \nhabit of dam removal should understand this proposition: I will never \nsupport their proposals to remove Snake or Columbia River dams--never.\n  Our Northwest forebears built for us the world's most productive \nhydroelectric system. It is our great economic legacy and continues \ntoday as part of the reason families in the Northwest enjoy the \nNation's lowest power rates. This clean and renewable resource does not \npollute.\n  These dams also irrigate productive farmland in Idaho, eastern \nWashington, and eastern Oregon. These dams have created an enormous and \nproductive aquatic highway that moves our agricultural products to our \nports. These dams save Portland, Oregon, and hundreds of other \ncommunities from disastrous flooding.\n  Of course, the Columbia River System dams exact an environmental \nprice. They hurt our salmon runs. That damage was felt primarily in the \n1930's and 1940's. Since the last Columbia River dam was constructed we \ncontinued to have large and healthy salmon runs. The last decade's \nalarming decline in Columbia River salmon runs obviously has more \nprofound causes than our hydroelectric facilities alone.\n  We can do more for salmon especially by acting in a more intelligent \nand coordinated way to restore our Northwest salmon resources. But the \ncosts associated with removing dams on the Snake or Columbia Rivers \nwill always dwarf the potential benefit to salmon.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I intend this year to work with my \ncolleagues to complete acquisition of the two Elwha River dams with \ndollars from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. In addition, I will \nintroduce legislation authorizing the removal of the lower Elwha River \ndam. But that bill will also contain three vital conditions I believe \nto be absolutely necessary at the same time:\n  First, a 12-year study of the impact of lower dam removal on fish \npopulations before any consideration of removing the upper dam;\n  Second, a guaranteed hold harmless for the Pot Angeles water supply;\n  Third, no dam on the Columbia or Snake Rivers System can be removed, \nbreached, or modified in a way that substantially destroys its ability \nto produce power, and provide irrigation, transportation or flood \ncontrol without the prior authorization of Congress.\n  I think it is vitally important to America's taxpayers that the first \ncondition be met. This is a very costly proposition--the Government \nestimates that it will cost as much as $60 million to remove the lower \nElwha River dam. My sources tell me that those estimates are way too \nlow and that the final cost could be much higher. Of course, no one \nreally knows what this project might cost, which is why only the lower \ndam should come down now.\n  I want to be sure that when the inevitable day comes when national \nenvironmental groups and editorial writers push for removal of the \nupper dam, they have a true idea of what it will cost and whether the \nremoval of the dam will actually work. The best way to do that is to \nstudy what happens when the lower dam is removed. We will be able to \nfind out exactly what it costs to take out this dam, and, even better, \nwe can find out once and for all whether removing a dam will actually \nbring back salmon.\n  I believe my second condition is only fair to the people of Port \nAngeles, and is one that should be met with little, or no, opposition.\n  As for my third condition, I think it is vital to my constituents in \neastern Washington, and to my colleagues who represent Montana, Idaho, \nand eastern Oregon, that we in the Congress, and in the administration \nmake the important statement that the dams on the Columbia and Snake \nRivers are not to be touched in the immediate future, unless Congress \nhas debated the issue and agrees.\n  Radical revisionists in the media, national environmental groups, and \nin the administration are actually talking more and more about tearing \ndown 1 of the 11 dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers. Just last week, \na prominent Northwest newspaper had a lengthy story about the dam \nremoval movement, and how the proposition for tearing down a dam on the \nColumbia River System was gaining momentum. As you can imagine, even \ntalking about this subject causes huge concern in the communities that \ndepend upon the river for their livelihoods.\n  It also causes a profound concern to this Senator, which is why I \nthink it is important that we nip such a proposal in the bud, and nip \nit now. This legislation is the most appropriate place to do so.\n  With that, Mr. President, I have completed my thoughts on the policy \nof this proposal. Let me now discuss the practicality of getting this \ndone in a reasonable amount of time.\n  Many of the advocates for Elwha River Dam removal think Congress \nshould be able to fund the entire project out of the remaining money in \nthe land and water conservation fund. Because I am chairman of the \nInterior Appropriations Subcommittee, these people believe that I can \nsimply tell my colleagues that I intend to take $18.5 million of this \nmoney to complete acquisition, and then grab another $60 million for \nremoval of lower dam, leaving the remaining dollars--after the $315 \nmillion for the acquisition of the Headwaters Forest in California and \nthe New World Mine in Montana, and the $100 million in State \nacquisition grants--for division among the other 49 States.\n  To those back home who believe that it is either fair or possible \nthat I should be able to do that with a snap of my fingers, I suggest a \nlack of understanding of how Congress works.\n  Today we start in earnest on working through this year's Interior \nappropriations bill. In this bill, I have dealt with Washington State \nprojects in a fair and generous fashion. We have been able to fund an \nadditional $2 million for the Forest Legacy Program, $8 million for \nland acquisition in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, and \nan additional $3 million for forest health research at the Pacific \nNorthwest Research Station.\n  Other priority projects which have been funded in the Senate Interior \nappropriations bill and directly benefit Washington State include: An \nincrease of $3 million over the President's budget request for trail \nmaintenance in the Pacific Northwest; $2.5 million to develop a \nvisitors center, interpretive center, and educational center at the \nVancouver National Historic Reserve; $500,000 in support of Lewis and \nClark National Historic Trail activities; $2,452,000 to replace the \nParadise employee dorm at Mount Ranier National Park; $750,000 for \nregional fisheries enhancement; $840,000 for construction of a \ntrailhead and information station at the Steigerwald National Wildlife \nRefuge; and $275,000 for the North Cascades National Park to fulfill \nits obligations under various settlement agreements relating to the \nrelicensing of hydroelectric projects.\n  I feel comfortable with what I have accomplished for my State, and \nproud of that work. I must admit that I would not feel comfortable \nsimply demanding from my colleagues that the remaining acquisition \nfunds come out of the land and water conservation fund without a strong \nstatement of support from the administration and the entire Congress.\n  I believe such a statement is needed so that my colleagues from \naround the Nation can understand why their priority items are being \nplaced behind spending an additional $18 million to complete the \nacquisition of the Elwha River Dams, and another $60 million to remove \nthe lower dam. And Washingtonians may well ask themselves if they are \nwilling to give up new projects like those I have already discussed for \nseveral years in order to put all of our fair share into Elwha River \nDam removal.\n  Second, there is little chance that funds for removal of the lower \ndam will come from the land and water conservation fund. Frankly, I \nwould be\n\n[[Page S9306]]\n\nembarrassed to ask for such a sum. Out of fairness to other States \naround the country, I believe the funds for removal of the lower dam \nneed to move through other channels, or at least be specifically \nauthorized to come out of a land and water conservation fund primarily \nfor land acquisition rather than capital improvements.\n  Just as the original legislation sponsored by Senator Brock Adams \nneeded the authorization of the Energy Committee and the entire \nCongress, the extraordinary level of funding requested for this project \nneeds to be authorized by Congress as well. My legislation will propose \njust that. And I hope that this legislation will be considered as \nswiftly as possible.\n  I realize that back home I will be criticized for not grabbing all of \nthe funding for this project in this year's appropriations process. To \nthose critics, I suggest an absence of rational thought and fairness.\n  Washington State does quite well under this year's Interior \nappropriations bill. Funding the removal of the lower Elwha River Dam \nwould dramatically tip the scales away from fairness, and rightly cause \njustifiable and successful opposition from my colleagues around the \ncountry who have vital programs in their States that need funding.\n  All of us want to get the most for our States, and in our hearts, we \nbelieve that every request for our State is an urgent priority, but in \nour minds we also know that we can't fund every request. That means we \nmust balance our desire to help our States with the reality that \nCongress can only fund so many projects for each State.\n  As I said at the beginning of this debate on Friday, Mr. President, I \nhad 1,800 requests from the 100 Senators in this body for projects in \nwhich they had a great interest, the huge majority of which were home-\nState projects.\n  That is the reality I face as I work to resolve this difficult issue \ninvolving the Elwha River dams. I know it is a reality that critics \ndon't want to hear or acknowledge, but the simple truth is this--full \nfunding of acquisition and removal this year is highly unlikely, and \nimpossible without setting aside almost all other important Washington \nState projects, and something I am not willing to do.\n  Therefore, the best solution is to complete acquisition this year, \nand for that I need the administration to state publicly that this \nremains one of its top priorities. At the same time, I will start the \nprocess for removing the lower dam by introducing legislation for \nconsideration by the Energy Committee, the administration, and the rest \nof Congress.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for giving me this time this morning to \ndiscuss an issue important for my home State. In summary, I guess I \nwould finish by saying that on this issue of Northwest dam removal, \ntally me this way: ``once, with conditions.''\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchsion). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    National Endowment for the Arts\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise today to speak on the importance \nof funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, otherwise known as \nNEA. This endowment makes a tremendous impact on my State, and it \nworries me greatly that Congress is considering slashing it, or \notherwise killing it through block grants.\n  I think President John Kennedy said it best when he said--and I will \nquote him now:\n\n       When power leads man toward arrogance, poetry reminds him \n     of his limitations. When power narrows the areas of man's \n     concern, poetry reminds him of the richness and diversity of \n     his existence. When power corrupts, poetry cleanses, for art \n     establishes the basic human truths which must serve as the \n     touchstone of our judgment.\n\n  The people of my State understand that. Montana boasts a rich \ncultural heritage which can be seen in the work of such notable artists \nas Charlie Russell and Kevin Red Star. Our love of the arts can also be \nseen in the rich crop of literary talent that blankets the State.\n  I had a chance to witness that love of the arts firsthand last year \nwhen I worked with the National Symphony Orchestra on their trip to \nMontana. They broke into many, many groups--I think there were 120 \ndifferent ensembles spread across our State--and I was fortunate to be \nable to conduct the National Symphony Orchestra in their encore \nperformance in Billings, MT.\n  I think it is even more instructive to look at a smaller, more \nconstructive event where the NEA makes a real difference every year in \nMontana. Shakespeare in the Park is a group of talented actors who \ntravel around the State every summer offering free productions of \nShakespeare to the public. And every July, for over 20 years now, they \nhave come, for example, to Birney, MT. Guess what the population of \nBirney is. Seventeen.\n  The troupe of actors sets up their stage just outside of town on \nPoker Jim Butte. They perform two nights, and it is a big deal for the \npeople of Birney. They hold their annual Birney Turkey Shoot for \nSpakespeare in order to help subsidize the productions. Every year they \nattract crowds of 100 to 200 people. Not bad for a town with a \npopulation of 17. The audience usually consists of farmers, ranchers, \nand native Americans. They are people who, without this event, might \nhave to travel over 100 miles to see a Shakespearean play. This year's \nproductions were Shakespeare's ``Love's Labor Lost'' and Moliere's \n``Learned Ladies''--two classic works that everyone should have a \nchance to see.\n  The Shakespeare in the Park program relies on the NEA grant they \nreceive every year, and without it they would have to limit where they \ncan go. That means that Birney might not get to see its yearly \nproductions on Poker Jim Butte.\n  I think the responses to the Shakespeare in the Park productions \nspeak for themselves. One parent, for example, said:\n\n       I want to thank you so much for coming to Richey. We are a \n     small community with a total enrollment, grade and high \n     school, of 91. It was great to introduce our children, \n     especially the high schoolers, to Shakespeare and acting. It \n     is rare for them, and us, to attend something other than a \n     sports event.\n\n  Or listen to what another student had to say:\n\n       I have never had an interest in Shakespeare until I saw \n     your program.\n\n  Madam President, I think this last quote is particularly insightful, \nparticularly in this day and age when many people are afraid that the \nvalue of our great works has been diminished. Funding the NEA shows our \ncommitment to the classics like Shakespeare, and it helps make sure \nthat our kids can learn firsthand about these valuable works.\n  There are some in this body, however, who believe that Federal \nfunding for the arts should end. These people believe that Federal \nfunds can be replaced by contributions from private citizens and \ncorporations. While this might be true in populated areas like New York \nand California, States like mine would have no way of making up the \nloss. I make that very clear. It just is not possible.\n  Quite simply, without the NEA, there are no arts in places like \nBirney, MT, or countless other communities across the country.\n  There are some who argue that we cannot afford to fund arts programs \nwhile we are cutting the budget. But when one looks at the total amount \nof money we spend in our budget, the figures for the NEA are rather \nsmall. The $99 million the NEA received last year was merely a small \nfraction of the total budget. That comes to less than 40 cents per \nperson. But when one looks at all the great returns from our investment \nin the NEA, I believe it is money very well spent.\n  Finally, there are others who say the NEA should be defunded, \neliminated, because it funds obscenity. I believe those are valid \nconcerns, and I have to admit there have been a few poor choices in the \npast. But I believe that those problems have been addressed, and it \nwould be a shame to focus on a few mistakes when there are so many \ngood, worthwhile projects that the NEA has made a reality.\n  A complete list of Montana projects, museums, and artists who benefit \nfrom the NEA grants would be too long to\n\n[[Page S9307]]\n\ngive, but the following is a small example of the recipients:\n  Eight symphony orchestras in cities like Billings, Bozeman, Butte, \nand Missoula; over 20 nonprofit art museums and galleries such as the \nLiberty Village Art Center in Chester, the Jailhouse Gallery in Hardin, \nand the Hockaday Center for the Arts in Kalispell; and nearly 20 \nperforming arts groups like Shakespeare in the Park and the Vigilante \nPlayers who tour to communities all across Montana.\n  In addition, the NEA funds go to organizations which make an effort \nto reach out to children, to educate them on the importance of arts in \nour society.\n  Without a doubt, NEA funding has made a real, positive difference in \nMontana. That is why I believe we should continue funding this \nworthwhile program.\n  My basic philosophy toward the budget is this. We must have a budget \nthat reflects our values. To have no funding for the arts truly takes \naway some of our humanity, some of what makes our Nation great. Those \nare not the values I want my budget to reflect. That is why I urge my \ncolleagues to support full funding, with no block grants, for the \nNational Endowment for the Arts.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I also ask unanimous consent I might proceed as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Thomas pertaining to the introduction of S. 1176 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask that it be filed.\n  I just ask the distinguished manager of this bill if I could work \nwith him to have it brought up at the appropriate time.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Texas in \nproceeding in this fashion. As I announced previously, there are a \nnumber of amendments we expect with respect to the National Endowment \nfor the Arts. I believe that the proposal by the Senator from Texas \nwill be a perfecting amendment, that she is attempting to improve it.\n  The logic in dealing with these amendments will be to deal with those \namendments that strike or substantially cut funding for the endowment \nfirst. And so the willingness of the Senator from Texas to speak, as I \nam sure she will quite eloquently, to her proposition but not to \nintroduce it yet will facilitate dealing with the matter when it comes \nto a vote in a more logical way.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will leave it to the discretion of the manager what \nis the right order because of course there will be a number of \namendments dealing with the NEA.\n  My particular amendment takes the dollar amount that is in the bill \nand reallocates it and established a way to spend it. There will be \namendments offered that will do other things. And I think it is really \na healthy thing that we are going to be debating the NEA and what kind \nof funding the NEA has and how it is allocated, because I think a \nnumber of people in our country have concerns about some of the types \nof grants that the NEA has approved.\n  There have been inappropriate uses of NEA funding. The National \nEndowment for the Arts I think is a program that everyone hoped would \nestablish as a priority a commitment to the arts in this country. I \nbelieve that is a proper commitment for our country to encourage arts \nin our country, to make arts accessible to all the people of our \ncountry, to educate our children in the importance of the arts.\n  All of these things are worthy goals. But because we have seen the \nfunding of obscenity, of pornography, of things that you could not even \nin your most modest attempts to describe as art, many people have \nopposed the NEA. And many people have said, ``We don't need it. Why \nwould we want the Government involved in this?'' I certainly have great \nrespect for that view.\n  I do believe that there should be a commitment in this country to the \narts. I speak as a person who grew up in a town of 15,000. My parents \nwere very careful to try to make sure that I had access to the arts. \nThey gave me ballet lessons for 13 years. You would have thought it \nwould have taken. But after 13 years, I decided that maybe there was \nsomething else in my life that would be more successful than ballet.\n  They also made sure that I went to the nearest big city, when \npossible, to go to the symphony. They drove me to Houston, sometimes to \nGalveston, to see plays or to go to an art museum.\n  But, you know, many children in America are not as fortunate as I was \nbecause perhaps they do not have parents who thought this was important \nor that this would make their education more complete. Some children do \nnot have that opportunity.\n  I want all children in America to have this opportunity, whether they \ncome from families that do not have time to appreciate the arts because \nthey are working so hard to make ends meet; or whether they come from a \nrural community that does not have easy access to a major city or \nregional arts center. I want to try to give that same opportunity that \nI think was important in my life to every child in America.\n  I would like to see school districts adopt arts appreciation programs \nbecause it is proven in the testing of our children in school that \nwhere children do have access to the arts, where they have arts \nappreciation or arts classes in their school curricula, they also do \nbetter in math and science and reading. That is a proven fact.\n\n  So we are not talking about something that is just extra that would \nbe nice if we could afford it. We are talking about giving children a \nmore well-rounded education and giving children the chance, by having \nthe full range of education, to do better in the basic subjects.\n  So that is why I believe it is important for our country to have a \ncommitment to arts education and to provide access to the arts for all \nthe children so that some of them can grow up to be artists or to \nappreciate the arts and pass that involvement or appreciation on to \nfuture generations. I cannot imagine a country that is as developed, as \ntechnologically advanced as ours, that does not also have an \nappreciation for and a commitment to the arts.\n  That is why I am putting forward an amendment to this bill that would \nkeep the allocation for 1998 exactly where the committee has it, \n$100,060,000 to be exact. But under my amendment, I would rearrange the \npriorities.\n  Instead of having the NEA make all of the grants with this money, I \nthink it is time that we allocate to the States, in block grants, the \nbulk of the money. I think it is time that we have a more just and \nequitable distribution of arts funding.\n  For one thing, I think giving the money in block grants to the \nStates--and I will talk about the very few restrictions we would put on \nthis--gives the States the ability to fashion programs that will best \nmeet the needs and priorities of their States. They can divide this \nmoney among, for example, arts access or education in the schools, \ntransportation from rural areas to regional arts centers, or insurance \nprograms for art museums to be able to sponsor national exhibitions \nthat would otherwise not be seen by the citizens of that region outside \nof New York or Washington, DC, or California or Texas. I think it is \nimportant that states have that flexibility.\n\n[[Page S9308]]\n\n  Also, under my amendment States would have the flexibility to invest \nup to 25 percent of their Federal funding in an endowment. I think that \nis important because I would like to see more States have permanent \nendowments for funding of arts and access to the arts within the State.\n  So here is what my amendment does.\n  First, it limits the administrative costs of the NEA. Instead of \nallowing the 17 percent of the funding that the NEA now uses for \nadministrative costs, my amendment would set a cap of 5 percent, \nreducing the money spent on administration to $5 million down from \napproximately $17 million. I think 5 percent should be enough for the \nallocation that the NEA would be able to grant to national art works.\n  The NEA grants to national groups or institutions would be 20 \npercent. The NEA would be allowed 5 percent for administrative costs to \nadminister 20 percent of the total for grants to national groups or \ninstitutions.\n  My amendment would not allow grants to individuals, but only to \ninstitutions or groups. NEA would absolutely be prohibited from \ngranting any obscene works. NEA could also not grant seasonal grants \nsuch as, for example, giving the Metropolitan Opera $1 million for its \nseason, whatever works might be performed during that season. Grants \nwould be for a specific project that the Metropolitan Opera would have \nto specify, so that the NEA would be able to know exactly what it was \nfunding.\n  My amendment would also prohibit grantees from giving subgrants to \nother groups.\n  In other words, 20 percent, or $20 million, would be available for \nnational grants to groups or institutions. Such groups would be opera \ncompanies, symphonies, art museums, ballets, or other groups or \ninstitutions that clearly serve a national purpose or exhibit a \nnational stature.\n  These national grants would require matching grants. If the grantee--\nan art museum, for example--had a total budget of $3 million or less, \nit could cover up to one-third of the art project with Federal grant \nmoney. This way, two-thirds of the cost of the project would have to \ncome from the local community or State.\n\n  If the grantee--for example, an art museum--has an annual budget of \nover $3 million, the maximum Federal funds the grantee could use for \nthe project would be one-fifth of the total cost of the project. So for \nlarge institutions, the maximum contribution of Federal dollars would \nbe 20 percent and the other 80 percent would have to come from local or \nState matching funds. These matching requirements would apply to the \n$20 million allocated national grants.\n  However, under my amendment the bulk of the Federal funds would go to \nthe States in block grants, namely 75 percent or $75 million. That will \nguarantee level funding from fiscal year 1997 for every State and \nterritory of the United States, up to 6.6 percent of the total funds \navailable to the States for fiscal year 1998. The only two states that \nwould not be guaranteed level funding from fiscal year 1997 would be \nNew York and California. However, those States would be expected to \nseek a large portion of the $20 million in national grants. So under my \nproposal 75 percent of the Federal funds would go to the States in \nblock grants, and almost every State in this country will get more of \nthe arts funding under this allocation.\n  Behind me on the charts you will see the differences in the funding \nfor each State. Most States will have a significant amount of funding \nbeyond fiscal year 1997. I think it is time that States have more \nopportunity to support their school systems or their regional arts \ncenters and provide more access to the arts by more people in this \ncountry.\n  States may use up to 25 percent of their funds to establish or \nenhance a permanent arts endowment. I think it is a worthy goal to give \nStates this incentive. Under my amendment, States may contribute any \namount of money in addition to the 25 percent, but they must match \nwhatever portion they use for an endowment by at least 1 to 1. In other \nwords, if the State of Oklahoma decides to have an endowment for the \narts, it can take up to 25 percent of its Federal allocation but it \nmust match that amount, dollar for dollar, with funds from other State, \nlocal, or private funds.\n  Of course, my hope is that eventually every State will have a \npermanent arts endowment so that they will be able always to ensure \naccess to art that is available within their own communities and within \ntheir own States. But permanent endowments will also in the long run \nassure the States will be able to attract from the outside some of the \nnational touring art shows, such as the wonderful Monet exhibition that \ntraveled to the Fort Worth Kimball Art Museum. Many people in my part \nof the country would not have been able to see that exhibition had it \nnot traveled to Fort Worth, TX. This is the case all over the country.\n  Right now the NEA serves a valuable role in supporting an insurance \nindemnity program that has allowed international blockbuster shows, \nsuch as the Jewels of the Romanovs, to travel around the country. \nPeople all over America, because of this insurance program, will have \naccess to see the jewels from the Romanov dynasty in Russia that I hear \nare really incredible. Thanks to NEA funds, Americans have also had the \nopportunity to see the presentation of Tennessee Williams' ``The Glass \nMenagerie.'' Shakespeare's ``As You Like It'' went to 45 communities in \n26 States because the NEA helped them with the cost of touring. Those \nproductions traveled to Cincinnati, OH; Keene, NH; and Orange, TX.\n  I think Senator Baucus earlier today talked about the Shakespeare \nplays viewed in Montana would not have traveled to Montana but for the \nhelp from the NEA. I think it is exciting when Senator Baucus says that \nsomeone in Montana said he had never even thought of reading \nShakespeare until he was able to attend his first Shakespeare outdoor \nplay and began to love Shakespeare and studying Shakespeare seriously. \nThese are the kind of things that I think having a small national \nfunding priority will continue to do for this country.\n  In Abilene, TX, the NEA has been helpful in starting the Abilene \nopera. There are so many people in west Texas who had never seen the \nopera and, in fact, thought the opera was a stuffy event that nobody \nwould really enjoy but would just attend for social purposes. When they \nwent to their first opera, the first opera they have ever had in \nAbilene, they came back just thinking, ``what a joy, what a treasure.'' \nThese people are now going to encourage people to contribute locally so \nthat they can enjoy more opera productions. NEA funds were the seed \ncorn that gave access to people who had never even seen an opera who \nnow not only have seen one, but loved it and are contributing to \nbringing that experience to other people, especially children, in the \nwest Texas area.\n\n  Regional touring by the best American dance companies to rural towns \nand small cities has been helped by the NEA. The production of \nperformance specials and art documentaries by the Education \nBroadcasting Corp., WNET, in New York are now viewed by millions of \nAmericans because that seed corn was planted by the NEA.\n  So that is why I am not among those who want to just do away with the \nNEA, because I believe that Americans overall will be more culturally \naware and enjoy culture more, if they have the opportunity and exposure \nto the arts, which is ensured by our having a national commitment to \nthe arts. I don't want to do away with that. Do we need to change the \nNEA? Yes. Do we need to impose strict prohibitions against obscenity \nand pornography? Absolutely, because it has been shown that because \nthere have not been enough limits on the NEA, truly inappropriate use \nof our tax dollars has occurred. But I don't think that means we walk \naway from this commitment. I think it means that we change NEA, that we \nget control of it, that we make sure that the money is being used for \nwhat we intended it to be used for. But we don't walk away from it.\n  Let me give another example: Del Rio, TX, is on the border of Mexico. \nThe average per capita income of Del Rio is about one-half of the \nnational per-capita income. The population of Del Rio is 80 percent \nHispanic. Yet, despite the economic difficulties that Del Rio faces, \nthe people have a long history of commitment to the arts. In 1992, they \nconverted their old firehouse into an arts center. The new arts center \nnow holds free exhibitions of work\n\n[[Page S9309]]\n\nof national, regional, and local artists. It conducts art instruction \nclasses. It offers free children's classes in the summer and supports a \nchildren's dance troupe that performs at civic and cultural events. All \nof this is helped by seed money from the NEA.\n  Mr. President, I think we have an opportunity here to get control of \na funding program that has been abused in the past. But it has not been \nabused 100 percent. It has been abused but it has also done so much \ngood for places like Del Rio, TX, like Beaumont, TX, like Cincinnati, \nOH, like Keene, NH. There are so many wonderful stories of young people \ngetting their first access to the arts and their first appreciation for \nthe arts because the NEA gave some grant money, some seed corn, to a \nlocal community, which was matched by that local community. Something \nwas made possible because of the national commitment to the arts that \nhas spurred many young people to go into arts as a profession. Artists \nor dancers or musicians who now belong to a symphony--all of these \ncontributors to the arts in America began their careers from seed corn \nthat came from a national commitment to the arts.\n  Now, I do understand how people have become very frustrated. But \nlet's do something positive and productive with this frustration. Let's \nmake something very good out of a modest commitment to national arts. \nLet's give our young children a chance either to excel in the arts or \nby an appreciation of the arts to make them more well rounded, to allow \nthem to be literate in whatever circles they may walk. Let's allow them \nto have the same access that their European counterparts have. Many \ntimes I have been told that our young people do not have the cultural \nawareness that many of their age group in European countries have. I \nthink they should. I think they should also appreciate the contribution \nof Americans to the great art of the world. The more young people to \nwhom we can offer arts access and appreciation, the more of a \ncontribution America will make to the world art community.\n\n  I think we have something that is worth keeping, and I think it is \nour responsibility to support it in a responsible way. That is why \nunder my amendment I preserve the allocation of dollars but \nredistribute those dollars to allow the States to use arts funds in the \nway that will best give access to all people in their State. I oppose \nthrowing out the national commitment to the arts, because we have proof \nthat it helps our young people in all of their educational endeavors to \nhave an appreciation and an awareness of the arts. We also know that \nart adds to the quality of life in our country.\n  If we are the greatest, freest, fairest nation on the Earth, which I \nbelieve we are, I think a commitment to the arts is part of keeping the \nwell-rounded, cultural, thorough education of our young people at the \npremier level that we also value for the preservation of our freedom \nand democracy that are beacons to the world.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to sponsor an amendment. I will look \nforward to working with the manager of this bill to introduce it at the \nmost appropriate time. I think this is an important debate that we \nshould be having. I hope in the end when all is said and done that the \nbill we send to the President will say we have a national commitment to \nthe arts in this country. We want to make sure it is done in the way \nthat will give the most access to the arts to the most people of our \ncountry and that will give Americans an appreciation for what America \ncontributes to the world art community.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I do not think it would be possible for a \nMember of this body to defend more eloquently the mission of the \nNational Endowment for the Arts or the place that the arts in the \nbroadest sense of that term play in our society than we have just heard \nfrom the Senator from Texas.\n  From the beginning of the debate over this issue she has taken a \nconsistently supportive position but not a position that simply \nsupports the status quo blindly. She helped draft the conditions a year \nor 2 or 3 years ago that prohibited the National Endowment for the Arts \nfrom making a broad range of individual grants that were the source of \nmost of what the vast majority of the American people regarded as \noutrageous misuses of the taxpayers' money. And here today, she does \nnot defend the status quo--though, essentially, the status quo is what \nis proposed by this bill in its present form--but is attempting to \nstrengthen the Endowment by decentralizing the granting process to a \nsignificant degree, and by spreading it in a way that she feels is more \nequitable across all of the States and jurisdictions of the United \nStates.\n\n  So this is one of the amendments that is a friendly amendment, one \ncan say, and it was for that reason that I asked her to defer formally \nintroducing it until we could hear from the opponents of the Endowment \nitself and deal with the several amendments on this subject in logical \nfashion.\n  As the Senator from Texas knows, the committee bill that is on the \nfloor at the present time simply makes a very modest--probably less \nthan inflation--increase in the Endowment, maintains essentially the \nsame conditions that have been imposed on it over the last 2 or 3 \nyears, but does not attempt to change the structure of the way in which \nthose grants are made. I think that the proposal of the Senator from \nTexas is likely to be considered very carefully and thoughtfully by her \ncolleagues here on the floor and, if not here on the floor, perhaps in \na conference committee where, as all Senators are quite well aware, we \nwill be faced with a House position that is essentially to abolish the \nNational Endowment, and which will almost certainly require us to make \nsome changes in the proposal that is here before the Senate in order to \nassure an acceptable compromise.\n  So, without at this point taking a position on the specific amendment \nproposed by the Senator, I do want to say that I am convinced that it \nis a constructive contribution to a very important debate.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator for those \nremarks. I think that he, too, is approaching this in a positive way. \nLike the Senator from Washington, who is chairing this very important \nsubcommittee, I don't have ideas that I consider to be in concrete and \nI am not unwilling to change allocations or hear other views. But I \nthink if you are going to make constructive change, you have to start \nwith an outline. I think that is what the Senator from Washington has \ndone. While he has brought the bill to the floor, essentially not \nchanging the status quo, he has always been open to suggestions on ways \nto make it better. I think, in the end, in conference, if the Senate \nwill speak in what I hope is a decisive way on the approach that it \nwants to take, then I would like to see us work with the House to do \nsomething that will be constructive that will preserve our national \ncommitment to the arts. But I would hope that whatever we do, we make \nthe American people feel comfortable and give them something they think \nis worth their hard earned tax dollars, something that will give their \nchildren better access to the arts and enhance their education, if you \nwill, something that the American people would write if they were \nstanding here on the floor.\n  I am speaking from my roots. I am speaking as a person who has \nbenefited greatly from growing up in a town of 15,000, with the strong \nvalues that this small town gave me, but with wonderful parents for \nwhom I can never fully express my appreciation. They knew that while I \nlearned the values represented in that small town, there were other \nimportant things for my education, such as appreciation for the arts, \nfor which they would have to make an extra effort to give me. They did \nmake that extra effort. But, Mr. President, not everyone has parents \nlike I had.\n  What I want when we finish this bill is for us to have made up for \nthe fact that every parent is not as responsible as mine were and does \nnot give every child the same access that I had, the same opportunities \nthat I had. I want to see that we in the Congress kept our commitment \nto funding of the arts for our children all over America, from whatever \npart of the country. If we can take that responsible action, then every \ngirl who grows up in a town of 15,000 with no arts of its own will have\n\n[[Page S9310]]\n\nthe same access that I was fortunate enough to have, and I think we \nwill be a better country and make a stronger contribution to the arts \nof the world if we keep this commitment. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I have an amendment that I would like to file. I will \nnot offer it at this time, but I would like to file it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be received.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. We have heard many arguments over the years that the \nNational Endowment for the Arts [NEA] is not living up to its original \nintent of ``broadening public access to the arts.'' In fact, in NEA's \noriginal mandate and mission statement, they are charged with the \nresponsibility of broadening public access to the arts. That is the key \nquestion: Have they really fulfilled that? We have heard a lot of \ndebate through the years as to whether the NEA has really fulfilled \nthat mandate.\n  In fact, one-third of the Federal share currently goes to six of the \nlargest cities in the country. The agency, in addition to sending most \nof those direct grants to six large cities, has also demonstrated \nsoaring administrative costs. Nearly 20 percent of every dollar that \nthe National Endowment for the Arts expends is spent in overhead here \nin Washington, DC--much more than most of the Federal agencies--even \nmore, for instance, than the National Endowment for Humanities (NEH). \nNEH's overhead costs are much, much less than that 19 to 20 percent \nfigure.\n  Furthermore, the NEA continues to fund what many Americans believe is \nobjectionable art. While we have heard a lot of debate on those \nissues--the administrative costs, the formula, whether or not it is \nfulfilling its mandate--very few actual solutions have been offered.\n  So, this afternoon, I want to present what I think is a common-sense \nsolution to the problems that we have seen in the National Endowment \nfor the Arts. I ask the question: What happens to the novice artist, or \nthe songwriter in middle America, when the NEA funnels one-third of its \ndirect grant funds to only six cities? Those cities are New York, \nBoston, MA, Los Angeles, CA, Chicago, IL, San Francisco, CA, and the \nDistrict of Columbia. Each one of these six cities already has well-\nestablished arts communities. Yet, the NEA continues to pour a huge \namount of its limited resources--over one-third of its direct grants--\nto those six cities.\n  So what happens to that new artist, that songwriter just starting out \nin Arkansas, or in the State of Oklahoma, or in Iowa, or the startup \nband in Small Town, U.S.A., who doesn't have their dreams realized, \nwhen one-fifth of direct grants are sent to multimillion dollar arts \norganizations who already benefit from over $11 billion in private \ngiving each year? In fact, the private giving to the arts, combined \nwith what is spent and purchased on tickets, is almost equal to that \nwhich is spent on professional sports in this country.\n  And most tragic of all, I believe, is: What about the children? As my \ncolleague, Senator Hutchison from Texas, spoke so eloquently on, the \nchildren in rural towns across this Nation who only dream of ever \nseeing the lavish theaters in New York City--what happens to them when \nthey are denied the opportunity to perform a school play because \nbureaucrats in Washington awarded $400,000 to the Whitney Museum for \none single exhibit rather than their school play?\n  Mr. President, how can we justify this kind of very, very selective \nspending? For instance, in the State of Arkansas, the average per-\nperson expenditure from the National Endowment for the Arts amounted \nto, if you divided it up for every man, woman, and child in the State, \n17 cents per person. The State of Arkansas has a per capita income of \nabout $18,000. My home State received, out of the $99.5 million \nappropriated for fiscal year 1997, approximately 17 cents per person. \nAnd then we turn around and look at the State of Massachusetts, which \nhas a per capita income of $30,000--not quite, but almost twice the \nincome in the State of Arkansas--and the National Endowment for the \nArts has decided in its infinite wisdom to spend 60 cents per person in \nthe State of Massachusetts.\n\n  That is what I regard as very selective spending. In the State of \nMississippi, with a per capita income of about $18,000 per person, they \nreceived about 25 cents per person from the NEA last year, while the \nState of New York, which has a per capita income of $29,000 per person, \nreceived $1 per person from the National Endowment for the Arts. After \nlooking more closely at the per capita numbers, the NEA used very \nselective funding. The Midwestern State of Iowa, with a per capita \nincome of $22,000, received 20 cents per person, while the State of \nMaryland, with a higher per capita income of $27,000, received more \nthan twice the per capita expenditure than the State of Iowa--Maryland \nreceived 45 cents per person. That is very, very selective spending on \nthe part of the National Endowment for the Arts. How can we justify \nthat?\n  Then when you break it down by political party, it becomes even more \nintriguing. Last year, NEA funding totaling close to $45 million was \nsent to congressional districts represented by Democrats in Congress, \nwhile about $14 million was sent to congressional districts represented \nby Republicans across the country. If you break that down by the number \nof direct grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, you find \nthat almost 1,300 direct grants went to congressional districts \nrepresented by Democrats, while only 408 went to congressional \ndistricts represented by Republicans.\n  When the funding is broken down per district, on average, about \n$223,000 was sent to districts represented by Democrats, and on \naverage, about $60,000--almost one-fourth--went to congressional \ndistricts represented by Republicans. And you can go on and on.\n  The fact is that $3 out of every $4 going to the States is going to \ncongressional districts represented by Democrats. That is very \nselective funding. As one observer in Arkansas said, ``Why not send the \n$100 million to the Democratic National Committee and cut out the \nmiddle man?'' It has become a very selective funding formula used by \nthe National Endowment for the Arts.\n  Well, I cannot and will not justify what I think is inequitable and \nout-of-control spending by an elitist agency rife with problems and \nabuses.\n  So, Mr. President, it is time to bring this funding into line and it \nis time for a solution. So I rise today, along with several of my \ncolleagues, to offer a solution. I see Senator Sessions here on the \nfloor. I hope he will speak as a cosponsor of this amendment. I offer a \nsolution that gets the money down to the artists, the songwriters, that \nstartup band, that local writer, the painter on the local level and, \nmost importantly, down to our children--a solution that fulfills the \nNEA's original mandate and mission statement of ``broadening public \naccess to the arts.''\n  When you look at what is spent in Mississippi as compared to what is \nspent in New York, or in Massachusetts as compared to what is spent in \nIowa, I think there is no one who can, with a straight face, defend the \nNational Endowment for the Arts and say they are fulfilling their \nmission statement of broadening public access to the arts.\n  So the amendment I am offering today supports my belief that there \nare potential artists everywhere and in every corner of every State. \nFrom the plains of Wyoming to the mountains in West Virginia, from the \nMississippi Delta to the potato fields of Iowa, we have budding \nartists, potential artists, everywhere.\n  Contrary to Jane Alexander's notion that ``the areas of nurturing and \ndevelopment of artists tend to be located in a few States . . . ''--by \nthe way, Jane Alexander made that statement in our April hearing before \nthe Labor and Human Resources Committee.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that her statement made before \nthe Labor and Human Resources Committee be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the excerpt was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Ms. Alexander. Let me suggest an analogy here with regard \n     to the arts. You are correct that Arkansas received very \n     little in the way of awards and dollars this year. Again, \n     they would have received more, of course, had we had the \n     budget that we had before. However, an analogy that might be \n     appropriate is that there are apples grown in practically \n     every State of the United States,\n\n[[Page S9311]]\n\n     but there are few States that have the right conditions for \n     nurturing and developing apple trees; and then, they are \n     distributed all throughout the Nation.\n       The same is true of the arts. The talent pools, the areas \n     of nurturing and developing of artists tend to be located in \n     a few States--but there are artists everywhere.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Ms. Alexander said, ``* * * the areas of nurturing \nand development of artists tend to be located in a few States * * *'' I \ntake great exception to that. In fact, I take great offense to that \nstatement. I believe artists are everywhere--in every city, town, and \ncounty across this Nation, in every home, in every schoolyard, in every \nplayground in America. It is time that talent is recognized and \nrealized. It is time that the elitist attitude that says that the pools \nof artistic talent in this country are restricted to a few small States \nis rejected once and for all. In fact, my home State of Arkansas is the \nhome State to many famous artists; John Grisham, author; William \nMcNamara, painter; Billy Bob Thornton, Academy Award winner for his \nrole in ``Slingblade''; Mary Steenburgen, actress; Vance Randolph, \nfamous folklorist; and Maya Angelou, famous poet. On and on the list \ngoes.\n  So the pool of talent in this country is not restricted to a few \nStates where we should put our limited resources from the National \nEndowment.\n  Simply put, my proposal would cut out the Washington middleman and \nsend the arts dollars down to the States so that those who are closest \nto the unknown writer, the start-up band, or the schoolchild, can make \nthe decisions as to where those wise investments will be made to those \nindividuals who might otherwise have been passed over for the well-\nendowed Whitney Museum or the Boston Symphony, which has a $43 million \nannual income, or the Art Institute of Chicago, which has a $96 million \nannual income, or the Metropolitan Opera, which has $133 million in \ntotal annual income. In giving grants to those great, but well-endowed \ninstitutions, we rob from those who need it most and who would best \nfulfill the mandate that the National Endowment espouses.\n  Additionally, by getting the decisionmaking out of Washington, the \nnearly 20 percent in administrative overhead the agency currently \nmaintains is virtually abolished. That 20 percent currently being spent \non administrative overhead in Washington would be awarded back to the \nStates. It is the artists all across America who win under this \nproposal, who stand to be recognized by their home State rather than by \na bloated bureaucracy in Washington.\n  In fact, as we will demonstrate on this chart--and I hope that all of \nmy colleagues in the Senate will take a look--we will have a handout \nfor them--45 out of 50 States will gain under this block grant \nproposal. Cut out the 20-percent administrative overhead, limit \nadministrative costs to 1 percent, write the checks to the Governors, \nsend it to the States' art councils or to the State legislatures, and \nin so doing we will have more resources to send directly to those who \nwill benefit most from them.\n  In fact, all but a few States--45 out of 50--will increase arts \ndollars compared to last year. Most notably, for Senators Mack and \nGraham from the State of Florida--Florida will receive almost $3.4 \nmillion more than last year, while the artists in Texas, Senator \nHutchison's State, will benefit from close to $3 million more than in \nfiscal year 1997. How do we do that? We take that 20 percent bloated \nadministrative cost in Washington, eliminate the National Endowment, \nlet the Secretary of the Treasury write a check to the Governors to go \nthrough the legislature or the State arts councils, limit State \nadministrative spending to 15 percent, impose strict auditing \nrequirements, award a $500,000 basic grant to each State, and then \nexpend the remainder of those dollars under a per capita formula--45 \nout of 50 States will be winners. Florida, $3.4 million; Texas, $3 \nmillion. This commonsense solution seeks to give the dollars directly \nto the States in an equitable fashion, particularly to many underserved \nareas, and, most importantly, permits more local control of this money.\n  Moreover, this proposal includes clear and precise language requiring \nStates to conduct strict audits on the Federal dollars they receive, as \nwell as submit a report for public inspection within that State. Let \nthe public know how the money is being spent. Let the public have the \nreassurance that audits are being performed and that strict accounting \nmeasures are being followed. Any State found to have misused their \nFederal funds under the guidelines set forth in this amendment will be \nrequired to repay the money, plus a 10-percent penalty, to the \nTreasury.\n  Mr. President, in my efforts to find a solution to the current \ninequities that exist in the distribution of arts dollars, I solicited \nfeedback on this proposal from a number of individuals, including our \ncurrent Governor of the State of Arkansas, Gov. Mike Huckabee. We had \nstaff talk with his staff. I personally talked with Governor Huckabee, \nand was encouraged by his enthusiastic response to this block grant \napproach. I asked him point blank, ``Would Arkansas benefit from having \nmore control over arts dollars for the budding artists, musicians, \nwriters, and actors in Arkansas?''\n  I am very pleased to report that he gave a resounding thumbs-up to \nthis proposal. He believes very much that this proposal will benefit \nthe State of Arkansas. I quote from Gov. Huckabee's letter. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the \nentire letter from Governor Mike Huckabee from the State of Arkansas.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                State of Arkansas,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                              Little Rock, AR, September 11, 1997.\n     Hon. Tim Hutchinson,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Little Rock, AR\n       Dear Tim, I am in full support of the proposed amendment \n     regarding the manner in which grant funds from the National \n     Endowment of the Arts will be distributed to the states. I \n     believe states have a better understanding of their needs and \n     a much closer relationship with our constituents at the state \n     level than a bureaucracy in Washington.\n       As you are aware, the citizens of Arkansas have recently \n     voted for an increased tax upon themselves, part of which is \n     going to the Department of Heritage, the state agency that is \n     responsible for distributing funds for development of the \n     arts in Arkansas.\n       As a state, we have a need for the continued support of \n     developing art talents, as well as making the Arts available \n     to the public. I appreciate your leadership on this, and I am \n     in full support. If I can assist this effort in any way, \n     please let me know.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                    Mike Huckabee.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, Governor Huckabee wrote, ``As a State, \nwe have a need for the continued support of developing art talents, as \nwell as making the arts available to the public.'' Then Governor \nHuckabee went on to state that he ``believes States have a better \nunderstanding of their needs and a much closer relationship with our \nconstituents at the State level than a bureaucracy in Washington.''\n  I think what Governor Huckabee said would be echoed by Governors--\nboth Democrat and Republican--all across this country; that, if they \ncould receive those funds directly, have control over them, be able to \nmake the decisions as to where those grants should go, we will have a \nmore productive arts community in each one of our States.\n  Mr. President, it becomes increasingly harder to justify the \nexistence of the National Endowment for the Arts' Washington \nbureaucracy when one takes a more careful look at the overhead and the \nsalary costs of this agency.\n  For example, from 1994 to 1996, the administrative costs of the \nNational Endowment for the Arts went from a little over 14 percent in \n1994, 14.4 percent, to almost 19 percent in 1996, at a time when the \nagency was cut by 39 percent, and was faced with a loss of 89 \npositions. The administrative costs amount to almost 20 cents on the \ndollar. At a time when the NEA was cutting budgets and the number of \npositions at the agency, administrative costs as a percentage of their \nbudget went up to nearly 20 cents on every dollar of our constituents' \nhard-earned paychecks.\n  My constituents in Arkansas wonder why it costs almost $19 million to \ndistribute just over $50 million in NEA direct grant funds. They wonder \nfor good reason--$19 million to distribute $50 million. These are their \nhard-earned\n\n[[Page S9312]]\n\ntax dollars on the line. I don't doubt that many of my colleagues' \nconstituents have exactly the same questions.\n  A closer analysis of how the NEA spends its administrative budget \nraises even further questions about the efficiency and effectiveness of \nthe agency. While the agency repeatedly complains of the draconian \neffects of the budget cuts on its staff, over 68 percent of the 154 \nindividuals currently employed by the NEA earn over $50,000 per year. \nLet me repeat that. The agency complains about the burden that they are \nfacing under the budget cuts that have been imposed over the last \ncouple of years, but at the same time over 68 percent of their staff \nout of 154 individuals employed by the NEA, are earning over $50,000 \nper year. That is the equivalent of an average constituent in Arkansas \nearning three yearly salaries in just 1 year.\n  To make matters worse, the NEA's own inspector general uncovered \nsignificant problems, deficiencies, and abuses during its audit of \ngrantees from 1991 to 1996. This chart demonstrates some of the \ninspector general's findings--not a Republican committee nor a \nRepublican chairman--but the NEA's own inspector general found this:\n  Sixty-three percent of the grantees had project costs that were not \nreconcilable to their accounting records. That is well over half. \nSixty-three percent of the grantees could not reconcile their \naccounting records.\n  Seventy-nine percent, over three-fourths, had inadequate \ndocumentation of personnel costs charged to the grant. That is money \ngoing to individuals. That is personnel salaries that are \nunaccountable, according to the NEA's own inspector general.\n  Fifty-three percent had failed to engage independent auditors to \nconduct grant audits as is required by OMB guidelines. The Office of \nManagement and Budget requires that these audits be conducted, and over \nhalf did not do so.\n  I am curious. Those who are advocates of the National Endowment, \nthose who are advocates of maintaining the status quo--and I heard them \nspeak on the floor of the Senate today--they speak eloquently on behalf \nof art; they speak eloquently on behalf of culture. But I have not \nheard any of them respond to these findings conducted by the inspector \ngeneral that find blatant misuse of taxpayers' funds. Fifty-three \npercent--over half--not even complying with the Office of Management \nand Budget's requirement for independent audits.\n\n  These numbers are alarming. They are intolerable. They compel us to \nchange the status quo. The best way we can change it is to rid the \ncountry of the National Endowment and send the money down to the States \nwhere it can truly go to benefit arts on the local level and fulfill \nthe original intent and mandate of the NEA. As if this scenario is not \ngruesome enough, how is it justifiable that the NEA assisted in \npromoting the President's William D. Ford Federal Direct Student Loan \nProgram? That is correct--the NEA, under an interagency agreement with \nthe Department of Education, provided design assistance for marketing \nmaterials promoting the President's Direct Student Loan Program. This \nis the National Endowment for the Arts. This is the agency originally \nestablished to broaden access to the arts in this country. This was the \nagency established so that underserved areas like Virginia, Arkansas, \nOklahoma, and Alabama with start-up artists who want the opportunity to \nbuild a future in the arts community, would receive funding for these \npurposes. Instead, we find a grant going for surely a strictly \npolitical and not arts-oriented program--the promotion of the \nPresident's Direct Student Loan Program. You can take any position you \nwant on the President's Direct Student Loan Program, whether that is \nthe right way to go or not, but to use NEA funds to promote it--that is \nindefensible.\n  Although the NEA claims that the Department of Education reimbursed \nthe agency $100,000 under this agreement, the NEA reports that they \nhave no accounting of the time or expenses they incurred in providing \nthose services.\n  Mr. President, how much more mismanagement of taxpayer money will we \ntolerate? When is enough, enough? Well, enough is enough for me.\n  Mr. President, I cannot sit idly by while our tax dollars are used \nand abused by a Washington bureaucracy.\n  The proposal I am offering today, along with several of my \ncolleagues, is the fair solution to an agency run amok. It sends arts \nmoney directly to the States, eliminating the high administrative costs \ncurrently plaguing the agency. It shifts control from Washington \nbureaucrats to those closest to our artists and calls for strict \nauditing by the States. It initiates a more equitable distribution of \nFederal arts dollars on a per capita basis, benefiting more currently \nunderserved areas, and significantly increasing the award amounts for \nall but a few States. Most of all, it makes good on the original \nmission of the NEA--to broaden public access to the arts.\n  The horrendous realities I have outlined today have compelled many, \nincluding myself, to the conclusion that, over the years, the NEA has \nfailed to live up to its legislative mandate of increasing access to \nthe arts and has gotten into the business of picking favorites--making \nthe National Endowment the arbiters of art in our culture.\n  In summary, the NEA is rife with abuses: extravagant administrative \ncosts; poor management, and a vacuum of oversight, according to the \nGAO; glaring inequities in distribution; a biased process where the \nEast does better than the South, the big cities do better than rural \nAmerica, Democratic districts do three times better than Republican \ndistricts, higher-income States fare better than lower-income States, \nand the haves get more and the have-nots continue to have \nnot; wholesale failure to fulfill its original mission to broaden \npublic access to the arts, and the adoption of a kind of trickle-down \narts theory in which the arbiters of art reside primarily in \nWashington, DC. My amendment would end publicly subsidized cultural \nelitism by sending these decisions back to the States, more money for \nthe arts and less for the bureaucrats, more resources for 45 of the 50 \nStates and less for 5 States, more accountability and more local \ncontrol.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is fair. It is \nequitable. It is common sense. And the artists, musicians, and writers \nin your home State depend upon the resources that this amendment will \nmake available.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Warner pertaining to the introduction of S. 1177 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to be \nhere today to join with my good friend from Arkansas, Senator \nHutchinson in cosponsoring what I think is an outstanding amendment to \nthe fiscal year 1998 Interior Department appropriations bill, an \namendment which will do more for the arts in America than we have ever \ndone before. Simply put, the Hutchinson/Sessions amendment will produce \nmore diversity and quality in the arts. We need and I strongly support \na healthy arts community in America. It is important and it is \nvaluable.\n  Madam President, I attended a liberal arts college. I believe in \nhaving quality arts to lift and improve the lives of American citizens. \nI think we ought to strengthen it. I encourage and salute those who \ncontribute selflessly to the symphonies and museums and all sorts of \nartistic activities in their communities. This is what helps make us \nthe great culture and Nation that we are. I want to make sure that \npeople understand that our goal in passing this amendment is one and \none goal only, to eliminate the Washington waste, bureaucracy and \nmismanagement while continuing to support in a very real way the arts \nin this country.\n  Madam President, I oppose the systematic elitism in funding for the \narts. I oppose funding of the arcane, the pornographic, the bizarre and \njust plain silly. I oppose funding to the politically correct crowd and \nI oppose the partisan funding, as the Senator from Arkansas has so \neloquently pointed out. So many of these funds go for partisan reasons. \nWe can do better with\n\n[[Page S9313]]\n\nour funding process, and we have far too much money going in directions \nthat are not healthy for America.\n  I know everybody has a different opinion of art. There is a piece of \nart work in my hometown of Mobile, AL, a metal structure that is now \nrusted that a distinguished artist in town was recently commenting \nabout. Someone said, ``Well, they wanted something that would attract \npeople's attention.'' And he said, ``Well, you can hang a dead horse in \nthe square and that will attract people's attention but it won't be \nart.''\n  Now, I know there is difference of opinion as to what art is and what \nwe should do about it, but I feel very strongly that we can do better \nin managing our moneys.\n  I am very familiar with the situation of the museum in Mobile, which \nwanted and sought a grant to receive funding to do art work in the \nfoyer of their auditorium. They got the money, but they were told by \nthe NEA that the artist had to be from New York, and by a NEA \npreselected artist, and she chose some art work on a burlap type of \nmaterial. It stayed up for a few years and has now been removed and is \ncurrently being stored in the basement of the museum.\n  But again, I suppose that expenditure was counted as an expenditure \nto Alabama when in fact it was really an expenditure to New York. So I \nsubmit to the Members of this body that we can be for the arts, but we \nmust make sure that the moneys we spend are spent wisely on the arts.\n  As to the National Endowment for the Arts, I say it has had its \nchance. Year after year after year they have come before this body, and \nthey have faced strong criticism and questions about their \nmismanagement and poor funding decisions and still nothing has changed. \nMadam President, I submit that we can do more and that we can do better \nwith this money.\n  The sad fact is that the National Endowment for the Arts is captive \nof an artistic elitism complicated by an insider cronyism and political \nfavoritism undermined by mismanagement and wholly without a vision to \nmake a difference for arts in America. In fact, we have learned, as we \nhave studied the numbers, that only 15 percent of the grants, in fiscal \nyear 1997, by the NEA went to new groups; 85 percent of the grants are \njust the re-funding of the same old art programs which the NEA has \nfunded before.\n  The Hutchinson-Sessions amendment does more for the arts. It takes \nthe Senate appropriations figure, $1,060,000, which has already been \npropounded in the bill before us today and it eliminates the Washington \nbureaucracy and sends all the money down to the people. It expands the \nmoney to all the regions and States in this country.\n  I would like to show you a chart that indicates the mission statement \nof the NEA. The mission statement clearly states:\n\n       To foster the excellence, diversity and vitality of the \n     arts in the United States, and to broaden public access to \n     the arts.\n\n  Madam President, when you have only six cities receiving one-third of \nthe national expenditures, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, \nNew York, and Washington, DC, we are not broadening public access to \nthe arts. And when we have one city, New York City, in fiscal year 1997 \nreceiving more money than a total of 29 other States, including my home \nState of Alabama, something is wrong. The National Endowment for the \nArts is not administering these grants fairly, wisely, or effectively.\n  Madam President, these are not just my figures or some Republican \nagenda. NBC's ``Dateline'' with Jane Pauley on July 17, 1997, exposed \nthese very figures. They pointed out just how disproportionate the \nfunding is. They pointed out that the NEA provided a $31,000 grant for \na film called ``Watermelon Woman'' which involved sexually explicit \nhomosexual activities, which was paid for entirely by the American \ntaxpayer.\n  People say, Well, you don't believe in the first amendment, Jeff. You \ndon't respect freedom of the arts.\n  I respect the freedom of the arts. I respect the first amendment. I \nam an attorney, and I believe very deeply in the first amendment, but I \nmust say I don't think the hard-working taxpayers of Alabama, who are \ngetting drastically shortchanged in this funding process, ought to be \nrequired to fund things that simply offend their sense of decency and \ntheir standards of ethics and faith. It is just not the kind of thing \nwe ought to do, and we have every right as representatives of the \npeople to come before this body and demand that governmental agencies \nadhere to proper standards and spend their money wisely and \neffectively. And when they do not, we have every right to abolish those \nagencies and shift that money in a way which will improve the \nlivelihood of the people.\n  NBC's ``Dateline'' talked about the Whitney Museum in New York, which \nhas a $30 million endowment, receiving a $400,000 NEA grant last year. \nThat is nearly as much money as the entire State of Alabama received \nlast year from the National Endowment for the Arts, and I am also \noffended by Chairman Jane Alexander's suggestion that artistic \nendeavors only appear in certain select areas of the country.\n  The distinguished Senator from Montana, Senator Baucus, discussed the \nShakespeare in the Park festival in his home State of Montana. I would \njust point out to the Senator, that under this amendment, as we propose \nit, the State of Montana would receive a $165,000 increase in funding. \nIf Alabama only had 8 or 10 projects approved by the NEA--Montana with \nless people probably has about the same number--that would be $16,000 \nadditional for each grant recipient in the State of Montana under our \namendment. State after State after State shows benefits and funding \nincreased under our proposal. Over 12 or more States receive twice as \nmuch funding. States like Michigan, Alabama, Florida, Indiana receive \ntwice as much funding under the Hutchinson-Sessions amendment as under \nthe present NEA formula for distributing grants. This is an outrage, I \nsubmit, in the that way we have allowed for this funding formula to \ncontinue.\n  Madam President, our amendment will eliminate unnecessary \nbureaucratic spending. It eliminates the arcane, pornographic, bizarre, \nand just plain silly projects that are being funded by the National \nEndowment for the Arts. It ends the political favoritism that is being \nuncovered, which clearly shows that we are not spending the money in an \neffective way.\n  So this, I submit to the Members of this body, is a very important \nvote. We have the opportunity today without any increase in taxes, to \nprovide a historic infusion of funds to local artists in every State \nacross this country. It is critical that we send the money to the \nStates where they can wisely and effectively spend it.\n  Madam President, if the money is sent directly to my home State of \nAlabama, the Alabama Shakespeare Festival in Montgomery, one of the \nfinest facilities in the world--a facility which Sir Anthony Hopkins \nreferred to as the finest Shakespeare facility he has ever performed \nat--would receive more than the $15,000 they received last year from \nthe National Endowment for the Arts.\n  Madam President, I feel very strongly about this amendment. I salute \nmy colleague from Arkansas, Mr. Hutchinson, for the hard work he has \nput into it, and I am honored to be an original cosponsor of it.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, may I inquire of the Chair if there is \nanother amendment pending?\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. As manager of the bill, I say to my colleague from North \nCarolina, I asked both the previous two Senators who spoke, and Senator \nHutchison who preceded them, not to introduce their block grant \namendments because it seemed to me most logical that the proposal of \nthe Senator from North Carolina, which would effectively reflect the \nHouse position of abolishing an appropriation for the National \nEndowment for the Arts, logically ought to go first. So I believe the \nanswer to the Senator's question is a committee amendment is the \nbusiness and the amendment that the Senator from North Carolina \nproposes, I think, would be in order.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The first committee amendment is the pending \nbusiness.\n\n[[Page S9314]]\n\n  Mr. HELMS. I am sorry, I did not understand the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the first committee \namendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. That is subject to amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n  Mr. HELMS. I am sorry, I just walked into the Chamber. Is it \nnecessary to set aside that amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may either offer an amendment to \nthe first committee amendment, or he may request that all six committee \namendments be set aside.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, Senator Ashcroft of Missouri is on an \nairplane at this moment, which I hope is approaching Washington. It has \nbeen delayed, but he will be here shortly to offer the amendment on \nwhich I desire to speak.\n  I am honored to cosponsor this amendment, which would eliminate \nfunding for the National Endowment for the Arts. Other Senators will \nvoice their support, I believe, for the Ashcroft-Helms amendment; \ncertainly the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], and the \nsenior Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback]. In any case, I commend \nSenator Ashcroft's willingness to exercise strong leadership on this \nissue. We will proceed while looking forward to his arrival on the \nSenate floor.\n  The other day, John Ashcroft and I were visiting on this subject, and \nwe were reflecting upon the fact that more than 8 years have passed \nsince an award-winning, blasphemous, and--how to put it--stomach-\nchurning photograph of a crucifix soaked in urine alerted this Senate \nto the disgusting decision by the National Endowment for the Arts to \nreward the so-called artist who conceived the concept and submitted it \nfor a grant with a substantial amount of the taxpayers' money.\n  Along about the same time I came into possession of copies of the so-\ncalled, now well-known, Mapplethorpe artistry, which was a homosexual \ndisplay. I recall bringing that to this floor. The distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia was sitting right over there, and another \nSenator was speaking. I don't remember which one. I asked Senator Byrd \nif he would consider an amendment to outlaw something that I thought \nwas grievously blasphemous, and I thought that he might think so, too. \nI remember that I showed Senator Byrd the Mapplethorpe photos. I will \nsay that he exclaimed very definitely that he found them repulsive. The \nbottom line is that he took my amendment and it was accepted on the \nlegislation. That is when the hard feelings developed with certain \npeople who favored not restraining the National Endowment for the Arts.\n  During the 8 years that have elapsed since that evening that I came \nand spoke to Senator Byrd, the Senate has learned a very great deal \nabout the way the National Endowment for the Arts conducts its affairs, \nand, thank the Lord, so have many millions of Americans found out about \nit across the land. They constitute loud voice to echo exactly what the \nHouse of Representatives did the month before last, I believe it was, \nin cutting off all funding, zeroing the National Endowment for the \nArts. For one thing, it is self-evident that many of the beneficiaries \nof NEA grants are contemptuous of--how to say it--traditional moral \nstandards.\n\n  Now, we have stripped the phony veneer from the curiously elitist \nnature of those people who are self-selected arts experts. I run into \nthem frequently. I hear from some in North Carolina, one in \nparticular--he was born rich, never did a day's work in his life. He \nspends much of his time writing letters to me complaining about my not \ncaring about the arts. Well, of course I do care about the arts. I have \ngrandchildren who participate, and I think very well, in the arts. But \nthey don't participate in the kind of things that I am talking about \nhere today.\n  We have stripped, as I say, the phony veneer from those people. Above \nall, we have learned the lengths that this crowd supporting the \nNational Endowment for the Arts will go, and has been going, in order \nto preserve their access to millions of dollars of the taxpayers' \nmoney.\n  I am going to get down to the nitty-gritty. It is going to offend \nsome people here and there. Once the true nature of the National \nEndowment for the Arts became clear, more and more Senators have joined \nin supporting simple, commonsense measures to ensure that the NEA is \noperated in a reasonable manner. We have endeavored, sometimes \nsuccessfully, sometimes not, to put an end to Federal grants, spending \nthe taxpayers' money rewarding obscene or patently offensive work. We \nhave worked to try to make sure that the NEA grants go to institutions \nrather than to individual artists. At every step, the arts \nestablishment and its defenders in the left wing media--and in \nCongress, I might add--have vigorously opposed those reasonable \nreforms, often implying or downright declaring that anybody opposing \nsuch Federal grants is ignorant and indifferent to culture and art.\n  There is a fellow in Massachusetts who used the words, phony baloney, \nthe other day. I am going to borrow those two words from him and apply \nit to that kind of stand. I suppose this sort of opposition will \ncontinue just as long as the Congress allows the National Endowment for \nthe Arts to cater to phony, self-appointed artists who insist on using \nthe American taxpayers' money to finance anything they want to drag up \nfrom the sewer and declare to be art.\n  But enough is surely enough. Millions of Americans have come to the \nconclusion that the National Endowment for the Arts is beyond salvation \nas a reasonable Federal agency. The amendment which the Senator from \nMissouri will a little later on send to the desk proposes to fund the \nNEA at a deserving level, exactly what it deserves--zero. To put it \nbluntly, I propose that none of the taxpayers' money be wasted by this \nagency anymore.\n  I have done my best to work in good faith with administrators, past \nand present, of the National Endowment for the Arts. The present \nadministrator, Jane Alexander, is a gracious lady. I like her \npersonally, and I think she means well. But the problem persists: \nDespite all of the rhetoric, despite all the promises, the National \nEndowment for the Arts continues to underwrite projects that offend the \nsensibilities of millions of American taxpayers who resent the NEA's \ngiving the taxpayers' money to self-styled artists whose art comes \nstraight from the gutter and the sewer.\n  So, this amendment that Senator Ashcroft and I will formally offer \nshortly keeps faith with the courageous decision of the House of \nRepresentatives to withhold funding from the National Endowment for the \nArts during the House consideration of H.R. 2107, the Interior \nappropriations bill. The Senate, simply said, ought to do what is right \nand follow suit.\n  Following that vote in the House of Representatives, the NEA's \nsupporters did the usual thing. They trotted out their customary \nabsurdities in describing an America without art, an America without \nculture unless the Senate restores full funding to the NEA. And they \ndid that with violins being played and weeping voices. Baloney. Perhaps \nthe Senate will default on its responsibilities, but it will have to do \nit after a number of Senators have made clear why the House action with \nreference to the NEA was entirely justified.\n\n  Madam President, Americans watching and hearing this Senate session \nthis afternoon on C-SPAN should be prepared, sooner or later, for \nanother dose of the same old, tired rhetoric about how the survival of \narts in America depends upon the NEA--when the truth of the matter is \nthat American arts were thriving long before the agency received its \nfirst penny, its first appropriation, back in 1966, and the arts will \ncontinue to flourish and flower long after the NEA has disappeared from \nthe radar screen.\n  In any event, the American people may be forgiven for wondering \nprecisely how do the powers-that-be at the National Endowment for the \nArts define--define--American arts and culture. Let's do a little \nthinking about that. The agency's recent grant to the Whitney Museum \nmay provide a useful clue. On July 15, 1997, the news program \n``Dateline'' NBC reported that the NEA had given a grant of--now get \nthis--$400,000 to the Whitney Museum. As NBC pointed out, the Whitney \nMuseum is the beneficiary already of an unusually large private \nendowment. Yet the museum is nevertheless\n\n[[Page S9315]]\n\ndeemed by the NEA to be a worthy recipient for Federal taxpayers' \ndollars.\n  What exactly is it about the Whitney Museum that makes it so \nworthy? Certainly, one must hope, not the 1997 biennial exhibition.\n\n  The average taxpayer sitting in North Carolina or Idaho, or wherever, \nwill never know anything about this unless the news media tells them or \nunless they are watching C-SPAN at this moment. But this year's \nbiennial--and this is just an example --this year's biennial featured \nan exhibit that launched an attack on Santa Claus. The Kansas City Star \nnewspaper reviewed the show and included this observation:\n\n       The myth of Santa propounded by Disney and Hallmark is \n     rendered all but unrecognizable by Paul McCarthy's video \n     installation of a wildly perverted Santa's workshop. The main \n     players, raunchy art-girl elves dressed in skimpy elf tunics \n     and sticky-dirty with chocolate sauce, alternately devote \n     themselves to creating confections and performing lewd acts \n     with stuffed animals, one of them large and animate.\n\n  Oh, boy, Madam President, if that is art, then the sewer is a \nswimming pool. In awarding the show's ``booby prize'' to Mr. McCarthy, \nthe Wall Street Journal's Deborah Solomon wrote this:\n\n       Reader, I can only hope you're not eating your breakfast \n     when I tell you that his ``Santa's Workshop'' revolves around \n     the theme of Christmas personalities doing weird things with \n     excrement.\n\n  Indeed. And I hope anyone listening to this debate in this audience \nthis afternoon will inquire of the Senators from their States why they \napprove of a Federal agency that awards $400,000 of the taxpayers' \nmoney to the curators of a museum who countenance such an exhibit.\n  Oh, I can hear it, Madam President. I have been hearing it for over 8 \nyears. ``Oh,'' they say, ``such grants of questionable taste are purely \nisolated incidents.'' The trouble with that is that the evidence \nsuggests otherwise, because last year, $150,000 of the NEA's funds went \nto a project by a choreographer named Mark Morris, and he is the very \nsame Mark Morris who once staged a homosexual version of ``The \nNutcracker Suite,'' called ``The Hard Nut.'' The taxpayer will be \nforgiven for wondering whether Mr. Morris' future work will deal with \nsimilar material.\n  I believe we already heard all we want to hear about last year's \n$31,500 grant for the production of the film ``Watermelon Woman,'' to \nwhich two or three Senators have already alluded on this floor this \nafternoon. This film was made by and about lesbians and featured in the \nwords of the reviewer ``the hottest lesbian sex scene ever recorded on \ncelluloid.'' And this is one of the art projects that the National \nEndowment for the Arts, Madam President, said we must have in order to \npreserve art and culture in our society.\n  Perhaps worst of all, however, is a travesty that emerged from a \n$25,000 grant to an organization called FC2, a bunch of weirdoes \nresponsible for publishing, among other sickening things, Doug Rice's \nbook entitled ``Blood of Mugwump: A Tiresian Tale of Incest.''\n  Oh, boy, what an artistic achievement that is. According to the back \ncover of the book, the plot, if you can call it a plot, describes ``[a] \nmember of a clan of Catholic, gender-shifting vampires [setting] out to \ndiscover himself in his sister's body.''\n  Twenty-five thousand dollars of your money, Mr. and Mrs. America, \ngoes so we can keep art flourishing in the United States.\n  That is not the half of it, Madam President. Suffice it to say that \nour staff members were--and I am talking about the folks I work for in \nmy office, the finest young people you ever saw--they were just about \nready to throw up earlier today after they had glanced through this \nwretched book's description of incestuous sexual activity, paid for \nwith the taxpayers' money, mind you.\n  Whether all this garbage is metaphorical or literal or whatever, I \ndon't know, I don't care, and I don't want to know. What I want to know \nis how long we are going to tolerate the National Endowment for the \nArts continuing to fund this kind of garbage. I do know, and I have \nknown this for a long time, and I have said it a thousand times on this \nfloor--and maybe if I live long enough I will say it another thousand \ntimes: the American taxpayers should not be forced to pay for stuff \nlike this. But if one opens this book to the copyright page, there it \nis: The seal of approval from and by the National Endowment for the \nArts.\n\n  Let me say that again--and I like Jane Alexander, she is a nice \nlady--but she is not controlling that shop down there. I cannot believe \nthat she is. Let me be clear. I am not calling for censorship. I come \nfrom the news business. I made my living that way for most of my life \nbefore I came here. But this is not censorship to say we are not going \nto pay for this kind of mess anymore. I say again what I have said many \ntimes, I don't have any problem with some guy going in the men's room \nand scrawling dirty words on the wall, provided he pays for his own \ncrayons and provided he owns the men's room. Making the taxpayers pay \nfor it is what I object to.\n  This Doug Rice is entitled to write whatever he pleases. He may try \nto shock and offend whatever poor souls across America run across his \nfoul literary pretense, but let me reiterate, again and again, the \nAmerican taxpayers should not be forced to subsidize such sewage as \nthis work.\n  But you know, Madam President, many Americans believe--and I agree \nwith them--that grants such as these are sufficient reason to end, once \nand for all, funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. I suspect \nthat the American people would be even more resolute in their \nopposition to the NEA if they were aware of other practices of the NEA \nthat bring the NEA's legitimacy into question.\n  To begin with, the American public needs to know about the NEA's \npractice of carefully rewarding its supporters and past beneficiaries. \nFor example, even the New York Times, liberal as it is, loving the NEA \nas it does, has reported that 85 percent of this year's recipients have \npreviously fed at the NEA trough.\n  How have they done it? I will tell you. The NEA does not consider the \nfinancial position of its applicants. That would step on some toes, you \nknow. Instead, the NEA continues to hand out money to institutions that \nhave a conspicuous lack of need--they don't need it--for being handed \nlarge sums of the taxpayers' money.\n  Harvard University--now get this, Harvard, which has in its bank \naccounts an endowment of more than $6 billion--billion with a ``b''--$6 \nbillion; nevertheless, it was sent $150,000 by the National Endowment \nfor the Arts. What for? I will quote it to you:\n\n       To support augmentation of the Harvard University Art \n     Museum's endowment.\n\n  Doesn't that grab you? That just makes me tearful with joy. If you \nbelieve that, you will believe anything.\n  Phillips Academy, one of the most prestigious boarding schools in the \ncountry, received $125,000 from the NEA this year.\n  The University of California at Berkeley received $135,500.\n  Princeton University, with its total endowment exceeding $2.6 billion \nthat they have already gotten from private sources, nevertheless the \ngood old NEA sent them $20,000 of taxpayers' money. Now, how do you \nlike them apples?\n  Yale University--I am not going to let them get off the hook--with a \ntotal endowment fund of $3.5 billion which it had gotten from private \nsources, received $100,000 from the NEA for the Yale Repertory Theater \nfor--I want you to guess what for--a celebration of the 100th birthday \nof a Marxist playwright, Bertolt Brecht.\n  Boy, I know the people in Shetland Switch will be delighted to hear \nthat their money was sent there. That is exactly what we count on our \nFederal Government to do.\n  Additional scrutiny of NEA grants provides countless examples of such \nfinancial judgment. For one example, bureaucracy being piled upon \nbureaucracy. How do they do it? Very simple. The NEA gives grants to \nthe Federal Government itself. That is a neat trick, isn't it? For \nexample, the Federal Facilities Council of the State Department--and I \nam going to speak to Madeleine Albright about this--will receive from \nthe NEA up to $10,000--now stay with me--up to $10,000 ``to support a \npartnership of Federal agencies convened to identify and advance \ntechnologies, processes and management practices that improve the \nplanning, design, construction, operation, and evaluation of Federal \nfacilities and enable more effective utilization of limited \nresources.''\n  Madeleine, you better come home.\n\n[[Page S9316]]\n\n  Seriously, Madam President, what does all of this mean? For those of \nus not fluent in the language of bureaucrats, your guess would be as \ngood as anybody's, but only in Washington would one Federal agency fund \nanother Federal agency for a study on how to increase efficiency.\n  Finally, there are the so-called planning and stabilization grants \nfor which the NEA spent more than 10 million bucks this year. And what \nis the purpose of those grants? Mostly for giveaway gambits like the \n$125,000 grant to Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, Inc., in Lee, MA, \nwhich was given the money not because it needed the money, but they \nwanted to increase their cash reserve a little bit.\n  Well, I expect there are some Senators around here who would like to \nhave their cash reserves increased a little bit.\n  This, to be serious about it, I say to Senators and ladies and \ngentlemen who may be listening, this is your tax money. And I want to \nask you, How's your cash reserve?\n\n  But let us be very clear about what the NEA is doing. It is putting \nyour tax dollars--no questions asked--into the bank accounts of artists \nand institutions for which there is simply no precedent--no precedent--\nfor these handouts.\n  Even disadvantaged businesses that qualify for low-interest loans \nfrom the Government must pay back the money, but not these rich folks. \nIf any of these struggling small businesspeople asked for a cash-direct \nhandout from the Federal Government, they would be laughed off the \npremises and they would be recommended for a medical examination.\n  Madam President, I am not going to belabor the subject anymore except \nfor one closing observation. I say this with all seriousness. What does \nor does not constitute art is not decreed from on high by the National \nEndowment for the Arts. Art and culture--for better or worse--should \nremain in the hands of the American people, not bureaucrats. Continued \nfunding of the NEA not only wastes the taxpayers' money on a small \ncontingent of wealthy elitists, it also continues the arrogant \nassumption that a Government-funded arts establishment must--must--\ndetermine what art is fit for public consumption.\n  I think there is no exaggeration involved in saying that this \nassumption is contrary to the Founding Fathers' notions of freedom and \nliberty on which I was taught as a little boy that this Nation was \nbuilt. In fact, I think that if Jefferson and Franklin and all the rest \ncame around here one of these afternoons, I suspect they would agree \nwith millions of Americans who have so little regard for the entity \nknown as the National Endowment for the Arts.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n\n           Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I would like to take a moment to discuss \na project of great importance to me and to the people of the State of \nOhio. I am referring to funding for the Dayton Aviation Heritage \nNational Historical Park. This project is currently included in the \nHouse version of the bill that we are currently debating. I am very \nhopeful that it will receive full consideration by the conference \ncommittee and be included in the final bill that is reported by the \nconference committee.\n  Madam President, on October 16, 1992, Congress established the Dayton \nAviation Heritage National Historical Park to commemorate the legacy of \ntwo Daytonians, Orville and Wilbur Wright and their significant \ncontribution to human history through their pioneering exploration of \nflight.\n  Madam President, in an effort to create a single coordinated facility \nrecognizing the Wright Brothers' work in Dayton, in 1994 the National \nPark Service assumed responsibility for the remains of the brothers' \nbicycle company. And then 2 years later, in 1996, the Park Service \nobtained the surrounding property which is known locally as the Hoover \nblock.\n  Madam President, the Hoover block has been designated as the core \nsite for Federal management of the Dayton Aviation Park and will be the \npark headquarters and will also be the primary visitor center.\n  From 1890 to 1895, this very site served as the location of the \nbrothers' print shop, the print shop called Wright & Wright Job \nPrinters, which, by the way, printed the Tattler, a newspaper founded \nby the famous Daytonian and Ohioan black poet, Paul Laurence Dunbar.\n  Madam President, timely restoration of these sites is critical to \nensure the building will be renovated and open to the public by the \nyear 2003 when Ohio and the rest of the Nation and the world will \ncelebrate the centennial of powered flight.\n  Trying to meet this deadline, Madam President, I have been working \nwith my colleagues in the Ohio delegation in the House, most notably, \nCongressman Ralph Regula, Congressman David Hobson, and Congressman \nTony Hall, working with them to ensure and secure funding for the \nupcoming fiscal year so that renovations can proceed without delay.\n\n  Madam President, I think that this project has national significance. \nIt has significance for my home community, the Miami Valley in Ohio, \nand the entire State of Ohio. I grew up about 20 miles from where the \nWright Brothers really learned to fly and where they did their pioneer \nwork, where they did their studies, and where they prepared to fly.\n  Madam President, I note the presence on the floor of my good friend \nfrom Washington, Senator Slade Gorton, who is of course the chairman of \nthe appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior. I already have had \nseveral conversations with my friend and colleague regarding this \nparticular project. He knows well of my personal interest in the \nproject. I really wish to express to him my appreciation for his \nwillingness to pursue this matter in the conference committee.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator from Ohio for his eloquent statement. \nI know how important this project is to Senator DeWine. As he has \nstated, we have talked about this project on several occasions over the \npast 2 months, and I must confess that the Senator's enthusiasm for his \nproject has rubbed off on this Senator. As my colleagues may know, the \nSenator from Ohio grew up not far from where the Wright Brothers made \ntheir dreams of powered flight a reality. It also is no secret that the \nlegacy of the Wright Brothers is very much alive and well in my own \nState of Washington.\n  Madam President, I want to assure the Senator from Ohio that he has \nconvinced me of the merits of this effort to restore this important \nhistorical landmark in time for the centennial celebration of powered \nflight less than 6 years from now. I am strongly inclined to support \nhis position in our inevitable conference with the House of \nRepresentatives on the subject.\n  I also urge my friends from Ohio to keep me and the members of my \nsubcommittee informed of his continued efforts and those of the Dayton \ncommunity as it prepares for the celebration in the year 2003.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague for his work on this bill and for \nhis commitment to pursue this issue in conference. I appreciate that \nvery, very much. It means a great deal to me and to our community and \nto our State. I thank him very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Madam President.\n\n\n                    National Endowment for the Arts\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I rise today to speak about a topic \nwhich has been ostensibly discussed this afternoon, namely, the portion \nof the Interior appropriations bill devoted to the National Endowment \nfor the Arts. It is my plan--and still in the process of being \ndrafted--to offer a slightly different type of an amendment from the \nones which have been discussed already. I do not have that amendment \nhere, so I will not be introducing it at this time. I am going to be \ntrying to work with some of the others who have concern about this \nissue to determine exactly how we might finally present\n\n[[Page S9317]]\n\nthe proposal I am going to discuss here today.\n  I rise as a Senator who finds himself, and has since he arrived in \nthe Senate, somewhat perplexed as to how we should proceed with regard \nto funding for the arts. I am an enthusiastic supporter of the arts. I \nthink that it is in the Nation's interest, certainly, to do the most we \ncan with scarce resources to try to encourage young artists, regardless \nof their specialties, to pursue their interests and their creative \nskills. And at the same time it is quite clear that the method that has \nbeen used recently, at least, has prompted a great deal of controversy \nand, in my judgment, to a large extent set back the progress with \nregard to our Nation's artistic activities.\n\n  Because what we have had for too long, it seems, is this ongoing \ndebate between whether or not the National Endowment for the Arts is \nproperly funded by the Federal Government or whether it should be \neliminated.\n  What we have is a debate that essentially, on the one hand, argues \nthat taxpayer dollars should not be used to support what many consider \nto be obscene activities or inappropriate activities, and, on the other \nhand, we hear from the arts community--and I have certainly heard from \na number of individuals representing that community since I have gotten \nto the Senate--that the efforts on the part of Congress to either limit \nthe funding or to put strings on the funding constitute, if not an \nexplicit form of censorship, certainly an implicit form of censorship.\n  In addition, I hear in my State a lot of concerns because, as the \ncharts which were here earlier indicate, our State is not getting the \nsort of revenues and resources to work with as many other states of \nequivalent size. So there is a frustration both with the inadequacy of \nthe resources which come back to my State of Michigan as well as some \nconcern about whether or not Washington expertise is in the best \nposition to determine which projects in our State should be supported.\n  In my judgment, the logical solution to all of this is to maintain a \nnational entity which oversees various arts activities and supports \nthose which are worthy of such support but to not have it funded by the \ntaxpayers' dollars. In other words, what we ought to do, in my \njudgment, is to privatize a national program, an American endowment, if \nyou will, for the arts, one which receives no direct taxpayer support \nbut one which nonetheless can perform some of the national \nresponsibilities that have been outlined by advocates of the existing \nNEA.\n  If it were done in that fashion, Madam President, we would be in a \nposition where at a national level determinations could be made as to \npriority arts programs. Those priorities could be given support, and \nthe support would not necessarily therefore have to come with a lot of \nstrings attached. If performing artists became a priority, individual \nartists became a priority, a national endowment not supported by \ntaxpayers' dollars would be able to support such efforts.\n  Today, because of the handcuffs which have been attached in recent \nappropriations bills, that cannot happen. In short, we can get away \nfrom this debate between obscenity on the one hand and censorship on \nthe other and support the arts in a private fashion.\n  Some have argued this is not feasible, that there is no way to come \nup with the resources required. But in my judgment that is wrong. Just \nas a starting point, it is currently the case that over $9 billion a \nyear is expended in support of arts activities across this country. \nIndeed, a number of the individual arts organizations have larger, \nsubstantially larger, annual budgets than the National Endowment for \nthe Arts. Indeed, the amount of money that we currently spend in the \nNEA on an annual basis--$100 million--is just a fraction of the $9 \nbillion which is annually expended on these types of programs. It is \nsmaller than that expended by the Lincoln Center, by a variety of other \nvery large and well-known arts organizations.\n  Indeed, I believe, as we have seen by the remarkable outpouring of \nsupport from the arts community itself, whether they are famous artists \nindividually or national organizations, corporations who deal in arts \nand entertainment, it would seem to me that the ability to raise funds \nfor such an independent entity would be rather within our reach.\n  My plan basically is to privatize the NEA over the next 3 years. In \nthis year's appropriations bill we would, consequently, reduce funding \nby approximately one-third, although we would make it feasible for the \nNEA to expend a percentage of its dollars it has to begin a fundraising \nprogram to find ways to privatize the entity at the end of the 3-year \nperiod. In other words, we would begin the process. It would not be \ndone overnight. It would allow for existing institutions, who are \nbeneficiaries of NEA support, to not find themselves overnight without \nany support but on notice that in 3 years the support would be coming \nfrom a private entity.\n\n  In exchange, what I would envision is to spend these dollars, which \nwould be reduced on an annual basis, on other very important national \ntreasures. It is currently the case, for instance, Madam President, \nthat the Star-Spangled Banner, the actual flag that prompted Francis \nScott Key to write our Nation's national anthem, is in desperate need \nof financial support for purposes of preserving that flag.\n  Ellis Island, the site of the arrival of millions of immigrants to \nthis country--one of the true historical treasures--is in decay and in \ndesperate need of support. The Presidential Papers of many of our \nNation's Chief Executives are in a position where the preservation of \nthose documents is at risk.\n  My amendment will allocate the funds that are being reduced from the \nNEA to the support of these national treasures, treasures which I think \nvirtually every Member of Congress could agree deserve support.\n  If my amendment were to pass this year, my plan would be to follow up \nwith a variety of very specific actions designed to be consistent with \nthe support for a privatized NEA, including a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment which I will be offering to specifically express the Senate \nsupport for a private ongoing NEA outside of taxpayer support, and \nother ideas such as a checkoff plan by which taxpayers could direct \nindividual contributions to an independent entity.\n  The bottom line is this, Madam President, we have to make decisions \nall the time about priorities. It seems to me in the area of the \nNational Endowment for the Arts, the logical thing is to preserve it in \na way that allows it to function in its fullest sense, and to function \nindependently and privately. When I offer my amendment, I will discuss \nthis in greater detail.\n\n  In the meantime, I think we have an obligation, whether it is to \npreserve the Star-Spangled Banner itself, or to renovate Ellis Island \nso it can be preserved, or to make sure the papers of our Presidents \nare preserved, we have an obligation to preserve them.\n  I believe the amendment I will be offering strikes the right balance. \nMy amendment is quite consistent with that offered earlier by Senator \nHutchison. I have indicated I would support that approach as well, \nbecause it does not immediately phase out the support which many of our \nState and local arts organizations receive. I think my amendment moves \nus in the right direction because it brings us to a point, in a short \nperiod of time, over 3 years, where the National Endowment for the Arts \nwould not have to be here each year trying to justify itself on Capitol \nHill, but could operate with unfettered discretion and make its own \njudgments and eliminate the debate between censorship and obscenity.\n  The best way to do that is to take the taxpayers out of the picture \nso they can make independent decisions and not worry about the \npolitical debate it finds itself in. Then we can direct the resources \nwhich our taxpayers send to Washington to preserve items such as a \nPresident's papers, Ellis Island and a variety of other national parks \nand national institutions in desperate need of support. This would be \nthe most sensible way to approach it.\n  It is my plan currently to offer an amendment, once it is fully \ndrafted, to that effect.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I have the honor to rise in support of \nthe distinguished chairman's remarks in regard to the proposed \nallocation of appropriations for the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\n[[Page S9318]]\n\n  I will presume upon the Senate's time on a relatively quiet afternoon \nto give just a little background of the measure that is before the \nSenate today.\n  Once again we seem to be doing a major disservice to ourselves with \nthe politicization of matters that ought to be as far from politics as \never is possible: the support the Government provides, not expensive \nbut nonetheless critical, for the arts of our Nation.\n  It would seem that the National Endowment for the Arts is challenged \non three fronts: first, whether our Nation even needs Federal funding \nfor the arts, second, that the Endowment should do more to reduce \nobjectionable art, and third, that the current grant apparatus \ndisproportionately funds some regions more than others. If I might, I \nmay be able to shed light on this triumverate.\n  I was present at the creation of the National Endowment for the Arts \nwhich we are debating today, which we debated last year, and which we \nwill debate henceforth how long, who knows.\n  It was begun in a time of great national agreement on this subject \nand a rather clearer understanding, if I may say, than we sometimes \nhave now, on the nature of this subject. This all began in the summer \nof 1961 when the musicians in the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra in New \nYork announced they could not continue under the contract they had with \nthe trustees. They were members of local 802 of the American Federation \nof Musicians.\n  Indeed, the prospect confronted us all that the Metropolitan, the \nMet, as we say in New York, would have to cancel its 1961-62 season. \nThen some inspired person had the thought, why not ask the newly \nappointed Secretary of Labor, Arthur J. Goldberg, to arbitrate the \ndispute? It was a natural thing for him to do; he was Secretary of \nLabor, this was a labor dispute. He was a great supporter of activities \nof this kind, a man of huge, varied talent. As an American Jew, he had \nserved in the OSS behind German lines during World War II. He had been \nvery close to the steelworkers. He had helped bring about the merger \nbetween the AFL and the CIO, what we now call the AFL-CIO, the American \nFederation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations.\n\n  His wife Dorothy was a supremely gifted artist. He moved easily in \nthe world of the arts, as well as of business and labor and government. \nHe went on, of course, to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, \nand then in an act of great self-sacrifice--and he knew it at the time; \nI was with him at the time--he accepted the demand, if you put it that \nway, from President Johnson that he leave the Court and go to New York \nto be the United States permanent representative at the United Nations \nat a time of cold war crisis. It was his way to do such things and to \naccept such assignments.\n  Now, in the life of the things he had done, arbitrating a dispute \nbetween, I believe, some 62 musicians and a well-established and \nattractive, civic-minded charity was not especially challenging, except \nhe found something out. He found, as he put it, ``Mrs. August Belmont \nand Mrs. Lewis W. Douglas, who were the leaders of the trustees, didn't \nhave any money.'' With the best will in the world, they could not meet \nthe requests that the union was making. They were then making $170 \ndollars a month. That comes to about $45 a week. That, sir, amounts to \nabout $1 an hour. The minimum wage was twice that, or thereabouts, at \nthat time. They were persons of world standing in the arts, but the \narts could not provide them a living. What they were asking for was \n$268 a month--something like $60 a week, something like $1.50 an hour. \nWith the best view in the world, all that Secretary Goldberg could do \nwas to offer them a $10 a month raise. They made their living teaching \nand doing other things. They were devoted to music, but they had \nfamilies, too, and the ordinary interests of persons who live an \nordinary life, an ordinary citizen.\n  What they were caught up with--and I do not want to take the Senate \ninto a long discourse on economics, but it is a matter which comes to \nthis floor in one mode or another almost every day--they were caught up \nwith what came to be known as the cost disease of the personal \nservices. This was a concept worked out by a great American economist, \nhappily still vigorously pursuing his works, William Jay Baumol, then \nat Princeton University. He and his wife were opera lovers, as it \nhappened, and he, too, noticed about this time that the Metropolitan \nOpera orchestra always seemed to be about to go on strike--this \nproblem, that problem--and what was the matter here?\n  His main field in economics is deeply abstract, hugely influential \nstudies of transaction costs and things like that. But he said, well, \nlisten, if I'm an economist, I ought to be able to understand some of \nthis, and he came up with the idea of the cost disease. His colleagues, \nas is frequently the case in medicine and physics and economics, began \nto call this Baumol's disease.\n  It can be very easily explained. The productivity of personal \nservices does not grow, or grows very slowly compared to the \nproductivity generally in the economy. You could put it this way. In \n1797, if you wished to perform a Mozart quartet, you needed four \npersons, four stringed instruments, and 43 minutes. Two centuries go by \nand to produce that stringed quartet you need four persons, four \nstringed instruments, and 43 minutes.\n  If the great Mormon Temple Choir undertook to do a Bach oratory when \nit was founded, I believe there are 350 members of that choir, so to do \na Bach oratory in 1897, that would take 350 musicians an hour and a \nhalf. A century goes by and it still takes 350 persons and an hour and \na half. That is called Baumol's disease. If you play the ``Minute \nWaltz'' in 50 seconds, you speed up productivity but you do not get \nquite the same product.\n  That is why teachers are relatively more expensive than farmers. \nFarmers have quadrupled and quintupled and quintupled again their \nproductivity, but a first-grade teacher can handle about 18 young 6- or \n7-year-olds in 50-minute classes; you can put 190 kids in that class \nand it would not be the same.\n  That is why we always have friction in our economy between those \nactivities where we depend very much on the personal services and those \nwhich involve the mechanized services or the electronic services--think \nwhat we have seen in productivity in computation in the last 20 years.\n  Secretary Goldberg thought what to do, and I think at this removed \nplace in time it is no indiscretion to say he called me in and said, \n``Pat, I have no money for these musicians. We have to give them \nhope,'' and he said, ``Write a portion of my arbitration decision which \nsays it's time the Federal Government gets into the business of helping \nwith the arts.''\n  This is not a new idea. George Washington wrote to a Rev. Joseph \nWillard, March 22, 1781, and said, ``The arts and sciences are \nessential to the prosperity of the state and to the ornament and \nhappiness of human life. They have a claim to the encouragement of \nevery lover of his country and mankind.'' It was as clear to George \nWashington as a matter could be. A few years later--that was in 1781. \nIn 1785, Jefferson wrote to Madison:\n\n       You see, I am an enthusiast on the subject of the arts, but \n     it is an enthusiasm of which I am not ashamed, as its object \n     is to improve the taste of my countrymen to increase their \n     reputation, to reconcile them to the respect of the world, \n     and to procure them its praise.\n\n  And so, Mr. President, on that occasion, the arbitration decision was \naccompanied by a statement urging U.S. support for the performing arts. \nThe New York Times--and forgive my provincialism, as that is where I \ncome from--announced this on the front page, and this was Friday, \nDecember 15, 1961:\n\n       Goldberg Urges U.S. To Subsidize Performing Arts. He Asks \n     Business and Labor To Help as He Gives Pay Increase in Met \n     Dispute.\n\n  Then it says, ``Excerpts from proposals aid for the arts * * *.''\n  Inside, they printed the text of Goldberg's statement urging U.S. \nsupport for performing arts.\n\n       Washington, December 14--Following is the text of Secretary \n     of Labor Arthur J. Goldberg's statement on ``The State of the \n     Performing Arts,'' which was included in his findings in the \n     Metropolitan Opera dispute.\n\n  The statement begins.\n\n       The financial crisis of the Metropolitan Opera, which \n     raised the prospect that the 1961-62 season might not take \n     place, may prove to have been an event of larger significance \n     in this history of American culture.\n\n\n[[Page S9319]]\n\n\n  And, sir, it has. As the Senator from Vermont and Senators supporting \nthis measure on both sides of the aisle will know, the National \nEndowment moved in direct sequence from the Goldberg finding to \nPresident Kennedy to the White House where President Kennedy \nestablished an advisory commission on the arts and humanities. Let's \nremember that the humanities are still part of this. Earlier, we heard \nthe distinguished Senator from Michigan talking about the public papers \nof Presidents, which are now being very steadily published and \ncompiled--they had not been, but now they are.\n  Now, the question is, were we aware that one day we might be on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate facing charges like that? Sir, I would like to \nsay with considerable vigor--if that is the term--of course, we were. \nWe knew perfectly well that once the Federal Government got into the \nquestion of funding for the arts, we would get into the question of \nwhat arts to fund. It is not a very complicated sequence. This \nstatement says,\n\n       President Kennedy observed not long ago that the Federal \n     Government ``cannot order that culture exist, but the \n     Government can and should provide the climate and the \n     freedom, deeper and wider education, and the intellectual \n     curiosity in which culture flourishes.''\n\n  And then Secretary Goldberg's prescient finding on the nature of our \ndebate today:\n\n       The issue of Federal support for the arts immediately \n     raises problems. Many persons oppose Federal support on \n     grounds that it will inevitably lead to political \n     interference. This is by no means an argument to be \n     dismissed, and the persons who make it are to be honored for \n     their concern for the freedom of artistic expression. In an \n     age in which a third of the globe languishes under the \n     pathetic banalities of ``Socialist realism,'' let no one \n     suppose that political control of the arts cannot be \n     achieved.\n\n  I might say that again.\n\n       In an age in which a third of the globe languishes under \n     the pathetic banalities of ``Socialist realism''--\n\n  As it was called in the Soviet Union--\n\n     let no one suppose that political control of the arts cannot \n     be achieved.\n\n  As we look in that direction in the world right now, we realize that \nthere are limits to such control, and the efforts of Government to \ncontrol the arts will never, in the end, succeed. I will go back to our \nstatement, sir.\n\n  Justice Goldberg said, ``The overwhelming evidence is that the free \nAmerican society has shown deep respect for the artistic integrity of \nthe artist. Every attempt to interfere with that freedom has been met \nwith vigorous opposition, not least from the artistic community * * * \nArtists are as susceptible to pressure as the next person, but for \nevery artist who capitulates there is another from that unruly band to \ntake his place, which the late Russell Lynes has described as the \n`uncaptured, the disrespectful, and the uncomfortable searchers after \ntruth.' ''\n  I don't want to make any special case for work that has no real \npurpose, save to shock--although some work that shocks in one \ngeneration is revered in the next. We would be very wrong to forget \nthat. Artists have always sort of known it. In 1939, one of the great \nAmerican painters, John Sloan, one of those who organized the armory \nshow of 1913 in Manhattan, which brought the postimpressionist French \npainters from the School of Paris to Manhattan, and it shocked \neverybody. Picasso was shocking, as were the others. But in very short \norder they came to be revered. It took a generation, but it did happen.\n  Sloan once said, in 1939--and he had a particular kind of humor in \nthis regard, also a kind of clairvoyance. He said:\n\n       It would be good to have a Ministry of Fine Art. Then we \n     would know where the enemy is.\n\n  Indeed, I can recall an occasion when this subject was raised in a \nhearing before the Finance Committee and some witness, someone out of \npatience, said, ``All right, Senator, what would you do to have the \nGovernment encourage the arts?'' I said, ``Well, offhand, the only \nthing I can think to do would be for the Government to forbid them.'' \nThat always has a lively effect, as we can look around the history of \nthe world and the history of the 20th century and find out. But what we \nare doing here is supporting the arts.\n  The National Endowment began as an effort to provide a living wage \nfor musicians in a situation where, through no fault of their own, \nthrough the workings of the economic system--I mean the laws of \neconomics, of productivity change, they needed public support, and it \nhas flourished. It was a very interesting fact that after President \nKennedy's assassination, the first thing this body did was to propose \nthat a cultural center that was being discussed for the arts be named \nthe John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. That was a center \nthat needed public support to make it possible in the present day. \nThose resources were there, and that activity has become part of the \nlife of our Capital.\n  Nonetheless it remains the case, inevitably it is the case, that \nthere are places where particularly intensive activities in the arts \noccur--our third proposition at issue today. It is somehow in the \nnature of creative work that it tends to concentrate in one place and \nbring people to it. It is the normal experience of the arts, \nparticularly large and expensive activities which involve musicians and \nperformers and composers, as well as audiences. New York has been such \na place since the beginning.\n  It has been argued that it cannot be fair that one third of NEA \ngrants go to six cities--with New York at the top. As it was when we \nexamined this subject three decades ago, New York is the center of the \narts--as it is of the visual arts, as it is of publishing--as it has \nbeen from the time we started our Nation with New York as the Capital.\n  The purpose of culture is not to serve the Nation, but we speak \nproudly of our role in the last two centuries. And to the extent that \nwe do, we speak of the things that have happened, to an extraordinary \ndegree, things that have happened in the city of New York by people who \ncame from all over the country--and the world--to that center of \ncreative activity.\n  Some propose that we take money away from the city of New York and \ndistribute it elsewhere. This idea is very different. The idea is to \nstrike at the artistic activities and expressions which are found at \nthe center of the Nation's art world. There is something foreboding \nhere. Do we break up the country into its competing parts? Do we want \nto go back to a time when those who had kept? They did not share--to \nreach out and bring to a place that did not have things they might need \nin health, in education, in standards of relations between labor and \nmanagement--in a sense of sharing of common culture, of diffusing, and \nenriching of culture. I do hope not.\n  It all began, sir--and I will conclude on this thought--at a time of \npromise in our Nation--great threat and danger, good God, yes, but \npromise, good spirits and creativity in Government. The Government \nthought through a problem that the public had, that the polity had, \nthat the culture had, and came up with some answers. They have proven \nthemselves powerfully important in what has now been almost two \ngenerations. And I would hope that this moment of unparalleled \nprosperity, with the United States--we wrote of a third of the world \n``languishing under the banalities of Socialist realism,'' all that \ngone, and could we not relax a little bit and do what the chairman and \nable committee wishes done and get on with the other matters of State. \nThe arts will be there whether we wish them or not and, in the main, I \nthink we do wish that they will be.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, I thank my colleagues for their \ncourtesy. May I ask unanimous consent, sir, that the text of Secretary \nGoldberg's decision on the arts be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 15, 1961]\n\n  Text of Goldberg's Statement Urging U.S. Support for Performing Arts\n\n       Washington, Dec. 14.--Following is the text of Secretary of \n     Labor Arthur J. Goldberg's statement on ``The State of the \n     Performing Arts,'' which was included in his findings in the \n     Metropolitan Opera dispute:\n       The financial crisis of the Metropolitan Opera, which \n     raised the prospect that the 1961-62 season might not take \n     place, may prove to have been an event of larger significance \n     in this history of American culture.\n       In an age when we must accustom ourselves to a welter of \n     untoward and unwelcome events, there are yet some things that \n     are unthinkable. It was unthinkable that the Metropolitan \n     Opera season should not take\n\n[[Page S9320]]\n\n     place. Yet suddenly that very prospect faced us. Few events \n     could have produced so instant a national awareness that an \n     artistic calamity of the first order was in the offing. The \n     insistent, repeated warning of artists, critics and \n     benefactors as to the financial crisis of the performing arts \n     in America were confirmed in the most dramatic possible way.\n       It is worth emphasizing that this situation was confirmed \n     rather than discovered. The problem has been well known to \n     and thoroughly expounded by any number of persons in \n     responsible positions in cultural affairs. This, happily, is \n     a positive factor in the present situation.\n       We are fortunate in having the present crisis brought \n     vividly to the national attention without any actual loss--\n     the Metropolitan Opera season is taking place. We are doubly \n     fortunate that, confronted with the need to act, we have at \n     hand an abundance of thoughtful, constructive proposals for \n     action. This is perhaps notably true in Congress where \n     legislators such as Senators William Fulbright and Jacob K. \n     Javits, and Representatives Frank Thompson Jr., of New Jersey \n     and John Lindsay of New York have devoted a great deal of \n     attention to this important public issue.\n\n\n                            PROBLEM OUTLINED\n\n       It is not necessary to review the full range of information \n     which is available on the financial condition of the \n     performing arts, nor to recapitulate the many valuable \n     proposals that have been put forth to improve that situation.\n       One central fact, however, is worth emphasizing. The \n     problems of the performing arts in America today are not the \n     problems of decline. They are the problems of growth: A \n     growth so rapid, so tumultuous, so eventful as to be almost \n     universally described as an explosion. The specifics have no \n     parallel in history.\n       America today has some 5,000 community theatres--more \n     theatres than radio and television stations. There are better \n     than 500 opera-producing groups--seven times as many as \n     fifteen years ago. Symphony orchestras now total 1,100--twice \n     as many as only ten years ago, and fifty in the suburbs of \n     Los Angeles alone.\n       Resources such as these for the consumption of artistic \n     creation do not of themselves insure creativity, but one \n     could hardly hope for a climate more receptive to the \n     creative artist. An era of unequaled achievement may well be \n     upon us.\n\n\n                         LONDON STATEMENT NOTED\n\n       Recently the times Literary Supplement observed from \n     England, ``If neither a Bach nor a Michelangelo has as yet \n     appeared in Detroit, a splendid mass of evidence has been \n     assembled to point the way. Not only is the talent visible in \n     ever-increasing quantity but the facilities for using it \n     exist as nowhere else.''\n       The American artistic scene today is alive and vibrant. At \n     the same time, some of the foremost institutions of American \n     culture are in grave difficulty. The Metropolitan Opera is \n     not alone, Other opera companies, and a number of our leading \n     symphonies, share in a substantially similar financial \n     plight. The artists, moreover, are generally underpaid. The \n     details may differ, but the general condition is the same. \n     The problem, of course, is money. The individual benefactors \n     and patrons just aren't there, as they once were. Just as \n     importantly, as we become more and more a cultural democracy, \n     it becomes less and less appropriate for our major cultural \n     institutions to depend on the generosity of a very few of the \n     very wealthy. That is a time that has passed, and the fact is \n     evident.\n\n\n                             HOW TO SAVE IT\n\n       The question before the nation, then, is how to restore the \n     financial viability of these institutions and to promote the \n     welfare of the artists upon whom these institutions in the \n     final analysis do and must depend.\n       It is, to repeat, unthinkable that they should disappear at \n     the very moment when they have achieved an unprecedented \n     significance to the American people as a whole. They are a \n     heritage of the past. They are equally an earnest for the \n     future: they stand as our expectation of the quality of the \n     American creative artists whose works they will perform.\n       The answer to this question is evident enough. We must come \n     to accept the arts as a new community responsibility. The \n     arts must assume their place alongside the already accepted \n     responsibilities for health, education and welfare. Part of \n     this new responsibility must fall to the Federal Government, \n     for precisely the reasons that the nation has given it a role \n     in similar undertakings.\n       The issue of Federal support for the arts immediately \n     raises problems. Many persons oppose Federal support on \n     grounds that it will inevitably lead to political \n     interference. This is by no means an argument to be \n     dismissed, and the persons who make it are to be honored for \n     their concern for the freedom of artistic expression. In an \n     age in which a third of the globe languishes under the \n     pathetic banalities of ``Socialist realism,'' let no one \n     suppose that political control of the arts cannot be \n     achieved.\n\n\n                         respect for integrity\n\n       The overwhelming evidence, however, is that the free \n     American society has shown a deep respect for the artistic \n     integrity of the artist. Every attempt to interfere with that \n     freedom has been met with vigorous opposition, not least from \n     the artistic community. Artists are as susceptible to \n     pressure as the next person, but for every artist who \n     capitulates there is another to take his place from the \n     unruly band which Russell Lynes has described as ``the \n     uncaptured, the disrespectful, and the uncomfortable \n     searchers after truth.''\n       The answer to the danger of political interference, then, \n     is not to deny that it exists, but rather to be prepared to \n     resist it. A vigorous, thriving artistic community, close to \n     and supported by a large portion of the public, need not fear \n     attempts at interference. Let our writers and composers and \n     performers give as good as they get. Indeed, when have they \n     done otherwise? The situation is no different from that of \n     academic freedom in our colleges and universities: it is by \n     defending their rights that our faculties strengthen them. \n     This is ever the condition of freedom.\n       This is not an area in which we are without experience or \n     precedent. For many years the arts have received support from \n     public funds in many different forms. Much experience \n     supports the general proposition that public support is most \n     successful when it represents only a portion of the total \n     funds involved. The principle of matching grants has clearly \n     proved its validity, and should be the basic principle of any \n     Federal participation in support of the arts. The variations \n     of this arrangement are many, and perhaps as a general rule \n     it may be said that the more levels of government, \n     institutions and individuals involved, the more likely it is \n     that the artists themselves will retain control over their \n     work.\n\n\n                          6-point partnership\n\n       The principle of diversity of support for the arts should \n     accompany the principle of community responsibility. Our \n     objective should be the establishment of a six-point \n     partnership that will provide a stable, continuing basis of \n     financial support for an artistic community that will at once \n     be responsive to the needs and wishes of the public and at \n     the same time free to pursue its own creative interests\n     I\n       The principal source of financial support for the arts must \n     come, in the future as in the present, from the public. Art \n     is consumed in many forms, by a vast and widely diverse \n     audience. The essence of a democratic culture is that the \n     artistic community should have a large audience, drawn from \n     all areas of the society, which returns value for value in a \n     direct and equal relationship.\n       While, if anything, greater provision should be made for \n     special children's concerts and below-cost performances for \n     special groups, the general musical and theatrical public \n     must expect to provide a greater portion of the costs of the \n     performing arts, through devices such as season subscriptions \n     and special associations for the support of particular \n     activities.\n     II\n       The patrons and benefactors of the arts have a continuing \n     and vital role to play. It is inevitable that in an age or \n     esthetic creativity the interests and tastes of many of the \n     best artists will run ahead of, or even counter to, the \n     general standards of the time. Here the support of the \n     enlightened patron can have the most profound and fruitful \n     consequences.\n       Similarly, there are many artistic forms of the past, of \n     which opera is but one; which are simply too expensive to be \n     supported entirely by ticket sales or general purchases. In \n     such instances the support of art patrons makes it possible \n     to preserve for the present and future many of the most \n     profound creative achievements of the past.\n     III\n       Private corporations must increasingly expand their support \n     of community activities to include support for the arts. One \n     of the hallmarks of American free enterprise is the \n     remarkable extent to which business has voluntarily \n     contributed to educational, charitable and health activities \n     in localities throughout the nation.\n       In line with the wider recognition of community \n     responsibility for the arts, business corporations would do \n     well to consider allocating, as a matter of course, a portion \n     of their total contributions to these activities. The Texaco-\n     sponsored broadcasts of the Metropolitan Opera, the \n     television dramas sponsored by the Westinghouse Corporation \n     and the makers of Hallmark Cards, and the institutional \n     advertisements of the Container Corporation of America, using \n     modern art, are good illustrations of another and important \n     form of support which business corporations can give to the \n     arts.\n     IV\n       The American labor movement has a responsibility for \n     support of the arts similar to that of American business. \n     This has been recognized to some degree, as in the \n     contributions several unions have made to support children's \n     and other special concerts, but on the whole the community \n     contributions of American trade unions have been directed for \n     activities similar to those which have attracted business \n     support. A parallel adjustment is in order.\n     V\n       Local governments, and to a lesser extent, state \n     governments are already providing a considerable measure of \n     support for the arts,\n\n[[Page S9321]]\n\n     in line with the clearly manifested interest of the American \n     people in expanding the artistic resources available to the \n     general public.\n       The support of art museums is already a general practice. \n     Everyone accepts the fact that it is appropriate for a state \n     or local government to provide housing and custodial support \n     to such museums. The question naturally arises why this \n     support should not be provided for our operas and symphonies \n     as well. Of course, the main source of public support for the \n     arts should continue to arise from the spontaneous, direct \n     desire of local and state governments to provide for the \n     needs of their own communities. This is an ancient tradition \n     in the arts, one on which we might draw more extensively.\n       For example, the practice of universities of making \n     provisions for artists-in-residence might profitably be \n     adopted by municipalities--one recalls that Bach for the last \n     quarter century of his life was the Municipal Cantor of \n     Leipzig.\n     VI\n       The Federal Government has from its beginning provided a \n     measure of support for the arts, and there can be little \n     question that this support must now be increased. This can \n     and should be done in a variety of ways.\n       The Federal Government may be a direct consumer of the \n     arts, by commissioning sculpture, painting, and awarding \n     musical scholarships.\n       One of the most important, and perhaps most proper role of \n     the Federal Government is to help state and local governments \n     and private nonprofit groups build and maintain the physical \n     plants required by the arts. Theaters, concert halls, \n     galleries are the precondition of many of the arts. Public \n     support at all levels of government in the area of helping \n     provide and maintain art facilities poses the minimum danger \n     of Government interference with the arts themselves. A \n     splendid example of such cooperation is the Lincoln Center \n     for the Performing Arts, where city, state and Federal funds \n     are all being combined to provide a magnificent cultural \n     center in New York.\n       The concentration of public support upon providing physical \n     facilities for the arts should not preclude programs of \n     direct Federal subsidy for theatrical and musical \n     performances and similar activities. However, Federal \n     subsidies of this kind should be granted on a matching basis, \n     with much the larger proportion of funds provided by private \n     sources, or by other levels of government.\n\n\n                            larger duty seen\n\n       The Government has a larger responsibility toward the arts \n     than simply to help support them. President Kennedy observed \n     not long ago that the Federal Government ``cannot order that \n     culture exists, but the Government can and should provide the \n     climate of freedom, deeper and wider education, and the \n     intellectual curiosity in which culture flourishes.''\n       Our concern with the condition of the arts in America must \n     ultimately and principally take the form of concern for the \n     position of the artists. Our principal interest is that the \n     American artist should remain a free man. Without freedom \n     there is no art or life worth having. That there are more \n     comfortable conditions than freedom has no bearing on the \n     central fact.\n       However, we may also legitimately concern ourselves with \n     the status of the artist in our society. An artist may be \n     well fed and free at the same time. That an artist is \n     honored and recognized need not mean he is any the less \n     independent. America has a long way to go before our \n     musicians, performers and creative artists are accorded \n     and creative artists are accorded the dignity and honor to \n     which their contribution to American life entitles them.\n       The President and Mrs. Kennedy have greatly advanced this \n     cause by the inclusion of artist and writers such as Pablo \n     Casals and Robert Frost in a number of the most solemn as \n     well as the more festive occasions of state. The proposal of \n     the President to consider the establishment of a national \n     honors system clearly presents an important area in which \n     Artistic achievement can be further recognized by the nation.\n\n\n                        advisory council sought\n\n       The most important immediate step which the Federal \n     Government may take is the establishment of a Federal \n     advisory council on the arts. Such a measure has been \n     introduced by Representative Frank Thompson Jr. and others, \n     and is now before the Congress.\n       The functions of such a council would be fourfold:\n       (1) Recommend ways to maintain and increase the cultural \n     resources of the United States.\n       (2) Propose methods to encourage private initiative in the \n     arts;\n       (3) Cooperate with local, state, and Federal departments \n     and agencies to foster artistic and cultural endeavors and \n     the use of the arts both nationally and internationally in \n     the best interest of our country, and\n       (4) Strive to stimulate greater appreciation of the arts \n     within the councils of Government.\n       If it were composed in large part of working artists and \n     artistic directors, it could have important influence on \n     Government policies which have a direct bearing on the \n     resources available for support of the arts. A number of \n     proposals which have come to my attention are perhaps worth \n     noting as instances of a very considerable body of ideas that \n     are worthy of consideration.\n\n\n                            taxes discussed\n\n       Mr. John D. Rockefeller 3d, has pointed out that under \n     present Federal income tax law, a deduction for charitable \n     contributions by an individual is limited to 20 per cent of \n     his adjusted income, or in the case of gifts to churches, \n     operating schools and colleges, and certain types of \n     hospitals and medical research organizations, the limitation \n     is 30 per cent instead of 20 per cent.\n       Congressman Keogh of New York has introduced legislation \n     which would extend this added 10 per cent to include \n     libraries and museums of history, art or science.\n       Senator Javits has proposed to add symphony orchestras or \n     operas to this list.\n       Mr. Rockefeller has suggested it be further extended to \n     include ballet, repertory drama and community arts centers. \n     While it is not possible to forecast with any precision just \n     how much extra support would be forthcoming as a result of \n     such a measure, it is obviously a matter worthy of the \n     attention of an advisory council on the arts.\n       Another tax matter which merits careful consideration is \n     the problem of artists generally, and performing artists in \n     particular, whose earnings are frequently concentrated in a \n     comparatively short period of years, with the result that \n     they are taxed at a much heavier rate than if their earnings \n     were spread over a normal life employment span.\n       This is a hardship to the artists, it is also a burden to \n     the managers of theatrical and musical enterprises, who \n     frequently are required to make up some of the difference by \n     paying stars higher salaries than would be required if their \n     tax payments were lower.\n       Recently forty nations met in Rome to negotiate an \n     international convention for the protection of performers, \n     producers of phonograms and broadcasting organizations. Parts \n     of this convention concern the protection of performing \n     rights, which correspond for performing artists to the \n     copyright protection now enjoyed by authors. These rights do \n     not exist for performers under United States law. It would \n     seem quite in order for this subject to be given careful \n     consideration.\n\n\n                         royalty proposal given\n\n       Mr. Robert Dowling has recently brought up to date a \n     proposal introduced in Congress in 1958 by Senator Fulbright \n     which would make it possible for the Federal Government to \n     collect royalties on music which is now in the public domain, \n     or becomes so in the future.\n       Senator Fulbright's bill provided that ``all music now or \n     hereafter in the public domain shall be the property of the \n     United States as copyright owner, and be used by it for the \n     benefit of the public.''\n       Although this is a new concept in the United States, the \n     arrangement has been followed for years in other countries, \n     notably France. Senator Fulbright proposed that an \n     administrative body be established which would be authorized \n     to administer the licensing of such music, utilizing the \n     proceeds for the support of the arts, much in the manner of a \n     private foundation devoted to this work.\n       The sums involved in such an arrangement, while not \n     enormous, are nonetheless considerable. Mr. Dowling has \n     estimated that the total potential income from royalties on \n     music in the public domain, calculated on the same percentage \n     basis as copyrighted material would be $6,520,000 annually, \n     distributed as follows:\n\nPopular music (records)......................................$1,100,000\nSheet music (classical).......................................3,420,000\nClassical music (records).....................................2,000,000\n\n       At this period when the entire body of copyright law is \n     under study, it would seem appropriate to give further \n     attention to this attractive proposal for supporting the \n     arts.\n       I commend these observations on the state of the arts to \n     the earnest consideration of an advisory council on the arts, \n     when constituted, to the Administration, the Congress, state \n     and local governments and the public.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       In concluding this award it would not, I feel, be \n     inappropriate to make special note of the needs of the \n     Metropolitan Opera itself. For years this grand institution \n     had had the unfailing support of a great and varied number of \n     New Yorkers and persons from all parts of the country.\n       The generosity--the magnanimity--of such splendid \n     benefactors as Mrs. August Belmont and Mrs. Lewis W. Douglas \n     is matched only by the devotion of the everyday opera lovers \n     who fill and overflow the galleries. Try as, everyone does, \n     the deficit is always there, and somehow ever more difficult \n     to meet.\n       An outpouring of support for this great cultural resource \n     would be an inspiring affirmation of the public interest in \n     the preservation and encouragement of cultural activities \n     throughout the nation. It would be an altogether appropriate, \n     and most influential, beginning of an era of widely based and \n     sustained support for the arts in America.\n       In his message of greetings and good wishes on the occasion \n     of the opening of the 1961-62 Metropolitan Opera season in \n     October, the President said: ``The entire nation rejoices \n     that this distinguished cultural asset in our national life \n     will again be bringing the splendid performances of great \n     artists to millions of American homes. For the music of the \n     Metropolitan reaches far beyond the hearing of those gathered \n     in this great hall. It endures, captured and held by human \n     memory, a pleasure and inspiration for years.''\n\n[[Page S9322]]\n\n       For myself, I would wish to thank all those of both parties \n     who have helped me with courtesy and assistance, and who have \n     suffered this entire undertaking with a deep and fully mutual \n     devotion to the art of the opera. I am fully confident that \n     relations between the orchestra and the opera association can \n     reach the level of confidence and cooperation that this \n     shared devotion entirely warrants.\n       The difficulties of the present have proved the needed \n     stimulus for a large and promising future. We look to the Met \n     with high expectations for ever greater achievement in the \n     musical arts.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. First of all, Mr. President, I want to thank the \nSenator from New York, the ranking member of the Finance Committee, for \nhis excellent presentation on the history of the Endowment. I think it \nis important that we dwell on that a while, or just a few minutes here \nanyway, because we have heard some rather severe condemnations of a \nprogram of which, in the final analysis, after review, would show has \nbeen very helpful in enhancing the availability of the arts in this \nNation. I find it problematic that even though we seem to have \neliminated all of the policies that have caused problems as part of the \n1996 appropriations act, to some, they still seem to exist. Let me talk \na little bit about that, after again, thanking the Senator most \nsincerely for that historical presentation, which was most helpful.\n  Back in 1996, when we passed the appropriations legislation, we \nplaced prohibitions on policies that have caused difficulty with the \nSenator of North Carolina and others, on the utilization of funds from \nthe Endowment. First, we placed a prohibition on subgranting. Now, \nsubgranting was a practice in which the Endowment itself would give a \ngrant to an institution and that institution would in turn make grants \nfor other things or to individual performances. An example of such a \npractice was raised with regard to a program mentioned by the Senator \nfrom North Carolina with respect to the Whitney Museum. It is \nillustrative because it points out how far we would have to go in order \nto satisfy those who are concerned about painting the Endowment out to \nbe making inappropriate grants--some time, some place, somewhere, some \nperformance will be what someone might call pornographic. Most often, \nit is that subgrant or another activity, separately funded, which was \nnot issued by the Endowment, like the example of a performance at the \nWhitney Museum. The Whitney Museum did get a grant for its building, \nbut not for the performance that the Senator from North Carolina \nmentioned. Now, the Senator from North Carolina would say that because \na performance was done in that building, which had received a grant for \nits construction, it should have been prevented because it, in his \ndetermination, would have been offensive. That is an unrealistic \nstandard and I would hate to think that of the programs that we fund in \nthe United States, that we would go to the extent of censoring what \npeople there participated in or what happens in our places of \nenjoyment, museums, or any place else.\n  Another thing we did to prevent some of the types of programming \nwhich had become offensive was to prevent seasonal support. \nInstitutions must now specify what specific projects they will support \nwith the funds they receive from the Endowment. And also, even more \nimportant from the perspective of trying to prevent the kinds of \nperformances which the Senator from North Carolina was pointing out, \nwas to prevent grants to individuals.\n  In the House when the issue of some of these grants was raised, Jane \nAlexander, the Chairman of the NEA--and I will make this a part of the \nRecord--pointed out in the House definitively that they were not grants \nmade by the NEA. Still, those are the ones that are used to condemn the \nNEA.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter from Jane Alexander \nto Representatives in the House be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              National Endowment for the Arts,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 1997.\n       Dear Representative: In recent days you may have received a \n     videotape produced and distributed by the American Family \n     Association (AFA) which contains film scenes that the AFA \n     says were supported by the National Endowment for the Arts \n     during my administration of the agency.\n       The video apparently contains scenes from five specifically \n     named films. I want you to know that the NEA did not in any \n     way pay for the production of three of the films entitled \n     Access Denied, Coconut/Cane & Cutlass and Bloodsisters. The \n     fourth film entitled Nitrate Kisses was supported by means of \n     an NEA production grant to an individual filmmaker during the \n     previous administration before I became Chairman.\n       NEA did support production during my chairmanship of the \n     fifth film, The Watermelon Woman, by means of a grant to \n     Woman Make Movies/Cheryl Dunye in 1995. For your information, \n     The Watermelon Woman has been reviewed very favorably, and is \n     showing to audiences in theaters and film festivals \n     throughout the country.\n       You should know that the NEA has not made any grants to \n     individual filmmakers since 1996, because grants to most \n     individual artists were abolished by Congress that year. We \n     also have not supported the general distribution of films \n     since 1996, because those grants fall into the category of \n     general seasonal operating support, which Congress also \n     abolished in 1996.\n       The AFA also criticized the agency for supporting Fiction \n     Collective 2 (FC-2), a small publisher at the University of \n     Illinois, which has introduced some of our newest minority \n     writers of quality to the American public. Over the years, \n     FC-2 has sustained a commitment to intellectual challenge, \n     and some of America's greatest writers have supported it.\n       As you may know, the AFA has a long record of distributing \n     purposefully inaccurate information about the NEA. The fact \n     remains that this agency has made more than 112,000 grants \n     over the course of its thirty-two year history, and fewer \n     than forty of them have caused some people some problems. \n     That's a record of excellence that any private business or \n     government agency would envy.\n       I hope you find this information helpful, and hope that I \n     can count on your support.\n       Sincerely;\n                                         Jane Alexander, Chairman.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to point out that we should not \nget off track of what the Senator from New York has attempted to do, \nand that is to remember why the Endowment was created and what is the \nimportance of the arts, what is the importance of the Federal support \nfor the arts.\n  We have a huge Nation, a wonderful Nation, and a nation with diverse \ncultures with wonderful things occurring from one coast to the other, \nfrom the North to the South. The arts help us understand life and the \nNEA help the Nation learn about the good things that are going on in \nthe arts across the country--the good things that will help us \nunderstand where we are going, what our society is about, and what we \nneed to do to be happy, to have a good life, and to be able to solve \nour problems.\n  The purpose of the Endowment is to allow those areas--those things \nthat are successful, those things that appeal to us, that make our \nculture rich--our art--to be shared from State to State. The Federal \nrole encourages this exchange and supports all States by collecting, \ndisseminating, and allowing programs to tour all around the country, \nmaking sure that programs which are important and essential to \neducation or to assist those in depressed areas that are impoverished \nare shared.\n  So I will be offering an amendment which will say that at this time \nin our Nation we recognize that we have two very serious problems, and \nthey are very closely related:\n  Education. We know that we must improve education in our Nation. It \nis essential that we do that. It is essential because in this day and \nage competition from international economies has created real problems \nfor us, with jobs in the thousands leaving this country and going to \nothers, threatening our Nation's ability to compete right now. For \ninstance, we have 190,000 jobs in the technology area that are going \nunfilled because we do not have the young people or older people with \nthe skills necessary to perform those jobs. We had one CEO who \ntestified before the Labor Committee who said that he had seriously \nconsidered, like others are moving centers of their manufacturing from \nthis Nation to other nations because people there have the skills, they \nare ready, they are available, and the cost is cheaper.\n  So one of the purposes and an important function of the Endowment is \nto try to see how we can help solve that problem of education.\n  In addition to that, we also have the problem of welfare reform. Some \nof the greatest problems this Nation faces are in the inner cities with \nour poor, with violence, and with the incredible problems that people \nface trying to find direction and meaning in their lives.\n\n[[Page S9323]]\n\n What can you do? How can you escape from the pressures that you have \nin the ghettos?\n  I have traveled around this Nation and have observed education and \nwelfare programs. Many of these are programs were enhanced by programs \nput on or financed in part by the National Endowment for the Arts. Let \nme give you a few of those to demonstrate what I mean.\n  The thing I would like to talk about first is education; and \nlearning. It is so much easier to understand and to learn if what you \nare doing is relevant, or in some way relevant, to your life, making it \na little bit better, or giving you a way to make it a little bit \nbetter.\n  Let me go through some of the programs that I have witnessed. These \nwere funded by the Endowment, or assisted by the Endowment. Let me take \nyou to the inner city of New York City in the Hispanic area where some \nof the highest crime rates and some of the highest poverty rates exist.\n  I visited Ballet Hispanico on a weekend morning where young kids of \n5, 6, 7, or 8 years old received instruction in ballet, participating \nwith all the enthusiasm that young kids can have, knowing that when \nthey left there they were going to have just a little bit more hope. \nThis program provided a way that they could see a window through all of \nthe chaos that they live in to be able to take them to a better life.\n\n  A more dramatic exhibition of that, also in New York City was a \nprogram that I visited--again, a program which was supported by the \nEndowment--where I saw these young children all drawing kind of \nfrantically on the papers that were in front of them. I asked, ``What \nis going on here?'' The teacher informed me that each one of those \nchildren had lost a member of their family, by violence, that they had \nblocked off reality, and they could not communicate about what happened \nto them. But by drawing and by artistic expression they could let their \nfeelings out, they could break through, there was hope for those \nchildren that their life could break away from this poverty and \nviolence which they were in.\n  Also, one only has to go to listen to the Harlem Boys Choir or so \nmany other demonstrations of what has gone on with the individuals who \nhave participated in NEA funded activities. I also went out to San \nDiego, CA, and went to a school out there which was an incredible one, \na music magnet school, but again in one of the depressed areas of San \nDiego. This was a middle school of seventh, eighth, and ninth grades, \nwhere they had an orchestra, a band, a jazz band. Almost everyone in \nthat school had arrived there in the seventh grade without any skills \nin music. When I listened to them play, it brought tears to my eyes. To \nthink that these young people when they came to that school did not see \na purpose in life but perhaps now saw that there could be some beauty \nin their lives. I could go right here to Washington, DC. In Washington, \nDC, we have a school that is under the tutelage of the Kennedy Center. \nI was amazed with that one. I found they had artists there who were \nteaching, but they weren't teaching art. They were teaching math, and \nthey were teaching science. How were they doing that? I went, and I \nwatched these young kids making little pianos. They were learning how \nto measure them, construct them, and learning their geometry. Then they \nlearned how the sounds came out differently from the little thing they \nhit it with. They could make music. They understood why the frequencies \nwere different and why the frequencies were made different by the \nlengths of those strings.\n  What happened to those students? The math rates went up in that \nschool--not so much for the reading scores, but the math rate went \nclimbing upward.\n  So we know that using the arts, there are ways in which we can break \nthrough to things which are interesting and relevant--music as well as \nthe performing arts and the graphic arts.\n  So we have a way to realize improvement here. So that is why my \namendment would say that what we need in this country is to identify \neach of these programs all throughout the country and to let other \npeople know in other States what programs are working, what are the \nones that break through to those young kids who had suffered from \nviolence and loss in their families. Which ones broke through to help? \nIs there further evidence of how this could work?\n  Statistics based on College Board figures, the organization that \nperforms the SATs, show a difference between those students who \nparticipated in music and the arts as compared with students who did \nnot. They found there was a dramatic difference. With those who had 4 \nor more years in music or art, verbal SAT scores went up almost 60 \npoints and math SAT scores went up over 40 points. To a young person \nwho is hoping to break out of poverty, to not get caught on welfare, \nthe thought that by participating in music and art, the window of \nopportunity could be enlarged and the doors of college or university \ncould be opened wide to them gives you an idea of what can happen if we \nstructure the NEA better so that it identifies, helps fund and allows \nus to share throughout this broad Nation of ours those successful \nprograms.\n  I have done a rough analysis and summary of just a few of the \nsuccessful kinds of programs that we have like this in this country. \nThey are very different. Some use the arts secondarily. Some in \ndifferent ways teach math or science. Roughly 1 percent of our schools \nare good; 1 percent are doing the job; 1 percent of our students are \ngetting that kind of education that we need. Ninety-nine percent need \nto learn from somebody, somewhere, or somehow how they can improve \ntheir results. The way they can do it is by being able to know where \nthose programs are, who has them, so that they can identify and look at \nthem and replicate them.\n\n  I think the Endowment, by helping identify, perhaps in cooperation \nand coordination with the States and the Department of Education, can \nmake those programs available for others to see and to utilize.\n  One of the advantages of this great Nation is that we have people who \nare innovative, who can design and find ways to solve these problems. \nThe disadvantage we have over foreign nations is that of replication, \ngetting the people who are in charge of the programs, who are trying to \ndesign these things well to become aware of successful programs that \nalready exist.\n  Let me give you an example of how we differ from other nations, and \nwe have to analyze it as to whether we should be looking at this \nproblem and see if we can correct it. I think we should. We have a \nprogram in the area of work force improvement called TECH PREP. It is \nin combination with the secondary schools and junior colleges or \ncommunity colleges, and how they can work together and bring some of \nthe courses down into the high school and to pull the students up to \nthe level where when they graduate they will have the ability to get \nthose jobs that I was talking about those\n$30-, $40-, $50-an-hour jobs paying $100,000 or $90,000 that are \navailable in this Nation.\n  Malaysia came over and took one look at our program, TECH PREP, and \nsaid this is a great idea. Look how well it is working. They went back \nand overnight Malaysia adopted our TECH PREP program. We are still at 1 \npercent. About 1 percent of the schools in this country have the TECH \nPREP linkage with other higher educational institutions.\n  Those are just examples of why it is necessary for us to have \nprograms and methodology to be able to share those great things which \nare occurring throughout the Nation so that they can be available to \nall. Those things will not be readily located or identified or provided \nunless we have some way to collect, to identify, to evaluate, and to \nlet others know about them. I believe the Endowment could help us \nimmeasurably in that area.\n  Mr. President, I have gone on longer than I wanted to. I suppose I \nwill be back tomorrow when we take this up. I hope that my colleagues \nwill share some other examples of NEA-funded programs that demonstrate \nthe advantage of a Federal system which tries to enhance the arts and \nour culture, enhances enrichment and educational activities as well as \nto show what positive results can be achieved by giving young people, \nat an early age, an interest in learning. The NEA has been successful \nin these areas.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to make some comments about funding\n\n[[Page S9324]]\n\nthe arts, and I rise in strong support of the amendment offered earlier \ntoday by my friend and colleague from Arkansas, Mr. Hutchinson. I \ncommend him for taking such an active role in the issue. It is an issue \nthat people have very strong and very divergent feelings about. It is \nthat divergence of opinion that brings me to the floor to support this \namendment.\n  In the House, it is my understanding that there is a majority in \nfavor of eliminating funding. We will be voting on that, too. Senator \nHutchinson is offering an alternative. He has done a lot of research on \nfunding equity to meet the purpose of arts, of getting it out as \ndivergent as possible across the United States, and we have not been \ndoing that with equity.\n  During the course of this debate we have heard example after example \nof successful and valuable local projects. We hear about Shakespeare in \nthe Park and we hear about traveling museums, we hear about folk \nfestivals and chamber music, and visiting artists. These are very \nworthwhile programs, and they yank at the rural heartstrings of both \nliberals and conservatives alike, but the survival of those activities \nis not the subject of this amendment. In fact, this amendment would \nstrengthen those programs.\n  The variety of approaches today alone for funding the arts shows that \nwhat we are doing has some major flaws, and there is a saying that if \nyou keep on doing what you have always been doing, you are going to \nwind up with what you have, or less.\n  Everyone in this Chamber is familiar with the past trouble \nsurrounding funding for the national endowments. There are too many \nexamples of poor judgment in the granting process, too many examples of \ntaxpayers' money wasted on projects with absolutely no redeeming social \nor cultural value. There are also those who argue that art is \nsubjective, that Congress should refrain from limiting expenditures in \norder to foster freedom of expression.\n  This is not a debate about censorship. It is a debate about spending \nthe people's money. It is a debate about who gets to make the \ndecisions. It is a debate about who can most encourage art \nparticipation and who should make those decisions.\n  Is there any reason why national panels are more qualified to fund \nart than State or local panels? If the strongest justification for \ncontinued arts funding is the value of local programs, then we should \nrecognize that and strengthen what works, eliminating what does not.\n  Last week the Senate took a historic step in the right direction when \nwe voted to return K through 12 education spending decisions to the \nlocal school boards. That vote indicates a frustration we all feel with \nthe abrogation of local decisionmaking authority, with the dissolution \nof American democracy. Programming decisions, on programs such as \neducation and the arts, must be subject to local sensitivities and \nneeds. Federal bureaucrats have no accountability to people because \nnobody lives at the Federal level. People live at the local level, \npeople learn at the local level, and people appreciate and produce art \nat the local level. Even the Smithsonian, National Gallery, and the \nKennedy Center produce and display collections of local art. So if we \nare going to fund our cultural resources with taxpayers' dollars, then \nlet us give the taxpayers the opportunity and the responsibility to do \nit right.\n  In my hometown of Gillette, for example, where I served as mayor for \n8 years, we are particularly fond of Camplex--the Campbell County Arts \nand Activities Center. Representatives from all over northeastern \nWyoming take advantage of the performances and exhibits offered at \nCamplex, and many of those productions are made possible using Wyoming \nArts Council support to leverage additional matching funds from local, \nState, and national sources. In fact, they leverage the resource about \n10 to 1. That is local participation, local approval, and local \ndecisionmaking.\n  I understand the importance of arts and humanities funding in places \nlike Wyoming. I know about the distances between small towns that would \nnever get to participate in the arts if it were not for some funding \nthat helps to get it to them over those distances.\n\n  Seeing the arts encourages the talent that lives there. It brings out \nthe talent of the kids, and we do have some very talented kids. Every \nSenator in this Chamber could point to some successes in their States. \nThere is some misconception out there that conservatives do not \nappreciate the value of the arts and humanities in our society, but \nthat is not an accurate view. This conservative Senator believes there \nis a place for arts funding, but that place is not in Washington. This \nis about an equal chance throughout the United States for equal funding \nin the arts.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Arkansas for his middle of the road \napproach, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Helms \namendment to the Interior appropriations bill. The Helms amendment, \nwhich abolishes the National Endowment for the Arts, is the only \nfiscally responsible approach to the funding of the arts by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The Federal Government truly has to be downsized and more limited. \nSome on the Senate floor today have argued, and rightfully so, that the \nNational Endowment for the Arts would function much better as a private \nendowment funded with private dollars, and I agree. We cannot let the \nFederal Government continue growing unabated, swallowing up the private \nfunction of our society as it grows. We have been given stewardship \nover the public purse, and we cannot abdicate that responsibility just \nto placate some of the special interests in Washington. We cannot \ncontinue wasting taxpayer dollars on the National Endowment for the \nArts.\n  NEA funding in this appropriations bill is over $100 million. I \nsupport the arts, but the simple truth is our Federal Government is \nbroke. We simply cannot afford to keep on funding art when we are in \nthis type of fiscal condition and when we have other programs that do \nstruggle which we should be funding.\n  Before we vote on this issue, I simply ask my colleagues to consider \na simple question. If your family was broke, if they were in a tough \nfinancial circumstances, if they were looking at an enormous mortgage \non their house, enormous debt that they have, would they be out buying \nart? The simple answer to that is no, they would not.\n  We are in a similar situation here. We are still struggling to get \nthe budget balanced, and we are going to get there. But once we balance \nit, we are still over $5 trillion in debt. That is how big the mortgage \nis on the country.\n  We are talking about a program that I just do not think can justify \nitself, given the financial conditions that we are in and given the \nrole of a limited and focused Government. I do think we ought to \nsupport the arts, and that should be done privately. That can occur and \nshould occur. But when we are in this type of fiscal condition, funding \nart is clearly not an essential. Subsidizing artistic endeavors, \ninspiring artists is a worthwhile project but not for the Federal \nGovernment. The House has seen the wisdom to abolish this Government \nprogram. We should have the wisdom to do the same.\n  In considering this amendment, there are a lot of things that it \nseems to me the Federal Government could do without--a smaller, better \nfocused Federal Government, a more limited Federal Government--and have \na better Federal Government at the end of the day. Here is one clear \nexample. It is one we do not need. It is one we have had extended \ndebate about. It is not as if this is a new topic coming up. It is time \nto do it, and that is why I am supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\nExcepted Committee Amendment Beginning on Page 96, line 12 through Page \n                               97, line 8\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate\n\n[[Page S9325]]\n\nproceed now to the committee amendment on page 96.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                    National Endowment for the Arts\n\n\n                       grants and administration\n\n       For necessary expenses to carry out the National Foundation \n     on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965, as amended, \n     $83,300,000 shall be available to the National Endowment for \n     the Arts for the support of projects and productions in the \n     arts through assistance to organizations and individuals \n     pursuant to section 5(c) of the Act, and for administering \n     the functions of the Act, to remain available until expended.\n\n\n                            matching grants\n\n       To carry out the provisions of section 10(a)(2) of the \n     National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of \n     1965, as amended, $16,760,000, to remain available until \n     expended, to the National Endowment for the Arts: Provided, \n     That this appropriation shall be available for obligation \n     only in such amounts as may be equal to the total amounts of \n     gifts, bequests, and devises of money, and other property \n     accepted by the Chairman or by grantees of the Endowment \n     under the provisions of section 10(a)(2), subsections \n     11(a)(2)(A) and 11(a)(3)(A) during the current and preceding \n     fiscal years for which equal amounts have not previously been \n     appropriated.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1188\n\n(Purpose: To eliminate funding for programs and activities carried out \n                by the National Endowment for the Arts)\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 96, strike line 14 and all that follows \n     through page 97, line 8.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Helms from North \nCarolina for having participated and spoken in advance about this \namendment. This amendment relates to the funding of the National \nEndowment for the Arts. It's a means whereby arts are subsidized by the \nFederal Government, where the citizens of this country are asked to \nparticipate in funding a variety of things which are designated as art \nor as worthy of being supported by the Government. I appreciate the \nleadership of Senator Helms in this matter. I thank him for his \noutstanding remarks which he has made earlier today.\n  On the tomb of English architect Sir Christopher Wren, there is an \ninscription which reads, ``If you would see his monuments, look around \nyou.'' Each day I am moved by the beauty of the monuments of this \nhistoric city, monuments to Washington, to Jefferson, to Lincoln. They \nare emblematic of what is great in the art and architecture history of \nthe United States. For years we will stand looking at these monuments \nas testaments to our faith. Further, they serve to remind us of the \ncentral role that artistic and scholarly expression can and should play \nin our lives.\n  It is within this context that we must determine what involvement, if \nany, the Federal Government should have in the arts. It is my belief \nthat arts and humanities funding is primarily a matter for private and \nlocal initiatives. There are, however, some areas that do merit Federal \nassistance. For example, the Smithsonian plays an important part in \ntransmitting the cultural heritage of Americans from one generation to \nthe next. We appreciate the fact that we can learn about what has \nhappened in America by visiting the Smithsonian Institution museums. I \nthink they are of great value.\n  Conversely, a number of federally funded programs, from, one, for \ninstance, labeled ``A Theater History of Women Who Dressed as Men,'' to \nprojects representing various manifestations of political correctness, \nare a waste of our taxpayers' resources.\n  Begun in 1965 as part of President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society \nProgram, the National Endowment for the Arts was supposed to raise the \nlevel of artistic excellence and promote a wide variety of art. The \nagency's budget reached a high of $176 million just 5 years ago, in \n1992, and it is slated to receive $99.5 million in fiscal year 1997. \nAlthough the NEA has funded some worthwhile programs around the Nation, \nit has managed to create an unbroken record of special favors and \nembarrassments. Year after year, the NEA has doled out money to shock \nartists who produce obscene, antifamily, antireligious, so-called \nworks. I will not say they are works of art. Nonetheless, President \nClinton has continued his efforts to secure tax dollars for the NEA, \nrequesting $136 million for the agency in his proposed funding for \nfiscal year 1998.\n  Since the beginning of my tenure as a U.S. Senator, I have opposed \nFederal funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. I believe that \nCongress has no constitutional authority or valid role to play in \nfunding the NEA. For example, during the 104th Congress, I offered, \nthough unsuccessfully, an amendment in the Senate Labor and Human \nResources Committee to reduce authorization levels for the NEA by 50 \npercent.\n  On July 15 the House passed legislation eliminating, this year, \nfunding for the National Endowment for the Arts. However, on July 22 \nour Senate colleagues in the Senate Appropriations Committee took a \ndifferent approach from the House by providing $100.06 million in \nfunding for the NEA for fiscal year 1998. This reversed a trend of \ndeclining amounts from 1992, and sends the dollar amounts back up \nagain. I was disappointed by this action. That is why I am here today. \nI am here today to attempt to persuade my colleagues to end funding for \nthe National Endowment for the Arts.\n  There are numbers of reasons why we should end funding for the \nNational Endowment for the Arts. Earlier today, Senator Helms \neloquently discussed one of those reasons, that the NEA has \nconsistently funded art that is antifamily, morally objectionable, and \nobscene. There has been much debate on this point, and this debate, I \nam sure, will continue. I would like now to discuss some of the other \nreasons why we should stop funding the NEA.\n\n  In a time when we are paying the highest taxes in the history of the \nUnited States, why should we continue funding the National Endowment \nfor the Arts? I think our priorities should be to balance the Federal \nbudget as quickly as possible and deliver deep across-the-board tax \nrelief to the American people. Another public gift to the NEA \nbureaucrats would be a slap in the face of millions of taxpayers who \ndeserve tax relief but were told this year we just don't have enough \nresources to be able to accord you the relief you deserve. Frankly, \nthat is an inadequate response to individuals while we are funding a \nvariety of art projects which qualify on the basis of their political \ncorrectness; art projects which would undermine the very things that \nparents are trying to teach their children about the values that have \nmade this Nation great.\n  Second, Congress should not be in the business of making direct \nsubsidies to free speech. I really question whether it is the proper \nrole of the Federal Government to directly subsidize free speech as we \ndo through the National Endowment for the Arts.\n  Government subsidies, even with the best of intentions, are dangerous \nbecause they skew the market. They tend to allocate resources to \nsomething that would not be or could not be supported on its own. And \nthey skew the market toward whatever the Government grantmakers prefer. \nIt says that we think a certain kind of art is best and we will pay for \nthat kind of art but we won't pay for other kinds of art. It seems to \nme, to have the Federal Government as a giant art critic, trying to say \nthat one kind of art is superior to another, one kind of speech is \nsuperior to another, one set of values is superior to another, is not \nsomething that a free nation would want to encourage.\n  National Endowment for the Arts grants placed the stamp of official \nU.S. Government approval on funded art. This gives the Endowment \nenormous power to dictate what is regarded as art and what is not. \nFrankly, I believe they have made serious mistakes in the past, \nsuggesting, of things that were nothing more than offensive, obscene \nmaterial, that they were in fact art.\n  The Los Angeles Times critic Jan Breslauer demonstrates that the \nNEA's subsidization of certain viewpoints poses great problems. The Los \nAngeles Times critic writes:\n\n\n[[Page S9326]]\n\n\n       [T]he endowment has quietly pursued qualities rooted in \n     identity politics--a kind of separatism that emphasizes \n     racial, sexual and cultural difference above all else. The \n     art world's version of affirmative action, these policies . . \n     . have had a profoundly corrosive effect on the American \n     arts. . . .\n\n  Here is a critic, accustomed to evaluating art, saying that the \nNational Endowment for the Arts and its subsidies have had a profoundly \ncorrosive effect on the American arts. All too frequently, Government \nprograms, even well-intentioned ones, have a reverse effect, an \nunintended consequence, an unanticipated impact. And that is what we \nhave here. Critics, understanding, aware, in tune with what is \nhappening in the art world, say that what we are doing with $100 \nmillion of taxpayers' money is having a ``profoundly corrosive effect \non the American arts.''\n  Here is how the Los Angeles Times critic says it is happening:\n\n       . . . pigeonholing artists and pressuring them to produce \n     work that satisfies a politically correct agenda rather than \n     their best creative instincts.\n\n  What the critic has really talked about here is that, instead of \ncreating to express himself or herself, the artist ends up trying to \ncreate to express or impress Government.\n  When you have a sale of what the communication is and a subsidy that \nreinforces the fact that someone is willing to sell their idea and to \ndistort their idea for purposes of selling it, that is nothing more \nthan a prostitution of the arts. It changes arts from their purity--\nfrom purity to pandering. It panders after the bureaucracy and has, \naccording to this well-known critic, ``a profoundly corrosive effect on \nthe American arts.''\n  Despite Endowment claims that Federal funding permits underprivileged \nindividuals to gain access to the arts, it is important to look at what \nactually happens. The NEA grants offer little more than a subsidy to \nthe well-to-do. One-fifth of the direct NEA grants go to multimillion-\ndollar arts organizations, $1 out of every $5 goes to the multimillion-\ndollar art organizations.\n  Harvard University political scientist Edward C. Banfield has noted \nthat the ``art public is now, as it has always been, overwhelmingly \nmiddle and upper middle class and above average in income--relatively \nprosperous people who would probably enjoy art about as much in the \nabsence of the subsidies.'' The poor and the middle class thus benefit \nless from public art subsidies than do the museum- and symphony-going \nupper middle class.\n  Economist David Sawers of Great Britain argues that ``those who \nfinance the subsidies through taxes are likely to be different from and \npoorer than those who benefit from the subsidies.'' In fact, the $99.5 \nmillion that funds the NEA also represents the entire annual tax burden \nfor over 436,000 working-class American families. To say to nearly half \na million American families, everything you have as an annual tax \nburden will be taken and spent to subsidize art, or so-called art, or \npolitically correct expression which has been distorted by the \nbureaucrats that have demanded that things be politically correct, is \nan affront to hard-working American families. I think we either ought \nto spend the money far more wisely or, preferably, we ought to say to \nthose families, we will not tax you so we can demand and elicit from an \nart community politically correct statements in which they do not \nnecessarily believe but for which they will seek to alter their art in \norder to get the Federal funding.\n  In short, the Government should not pick and choose among different \npoints of view and value systems. Garth Brooks' fans pay their own way, \nwhile the NEA canvasses the Nation for politically correct ``art'' that \nneeds a transfusion from the Treasury.\n  If country music folks can spend their own money to enjoy the art \nthey enjoy, I don't know why those who would patronize the ballet or \nthe symphony or would somehow want to induce the support of politically \ncorrect art can't support their own version of what they enjoy in the \nfield of art or performance. It is bad public policy to have these \ndirect Federal subsidies of free expression.\n  Third, Congress had no constitutional authority to create or fund the \nNEA.\n  Although funding for the NEA is small in comparison to the overall \nbudget, elimination of this agency sends the message that Congress is \ntaking seriously its obligation to restrict the Federal Government's \nactions to the limited role envisioned by the Framers of the \nConstitution. Nowhere in the Constitution is there any grant of \nauthority that could reasonably be construed to include promotion of \nthe arts.\n  There has been a little debate about this. I would like to point out \nthat during the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787, \ndelegate Charles Pinckney introduced a motion calling for the Federal \nGovernment to subsidize the arts in the United States. Although the \nFounding Fathers were cultured men who knew firsthand of various \nEuropean systems for public arts patronage, they overwhelmingly \nrejected Pinckney's suggestion because of their belief in limited, \nconstitutional government. Accordingly, nowhere in its list of the \npowers enumerated and delegated to the Federal Government does the \nConstitution specify a power to subsidize the arts. It was considered \nand overwhelmingly rejected by the founders.\n  Fourth, the arts receive funding from a variety of other sources, and \nthey really don't need the NEA money. The arts in America have \ntraditionally been funded by the private sector. Up until the creation \nof the National Endowment for the Arts in the mid-1960s, the arts \nflourished in this country. As a matter of fact, from my perspective, I \ndon't think we have had a superior development of arts in America with \nFederal subsidies or Federal funding. And, if we can believe the \ncriticism of federally funded art as being art which has been distorted \nin order to follow the dollars of the Federal bureaucrats, insincere \nart that comes as a result of an enticement to be politically correct \nand doesn't really represent the expression of the artist, it can't, by \ndefinition, be art which would be as sound in quality as art which \nwould have emanated from the conviction of one to convey what one \nbelieved.\n  As a matter of fact, if one was to compare the art generated prior to \nthe NEA to art that has come after NEA, I don't think it would be any \nproblem to see we have had great art throughout the history of the \nUnited States and worthy art for our consideration and our heritage in \nthe absence of the subsidy of the Federal Government.\n  The growth of private sector charitable giving in recent years has \nrendered the NEA funding relatively insignificant to the arts \ncommunity. Private funding of the arts has been rising consistently \nsince 1965. It is estimated that individuals alone will donate nearly \n$1 billion to the arts and humanities this year. That is the estimate \nof the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, Subcommittee on \nOversight and Investigations.\n  Overall giving to the arts in 1996 totaled almost $10 billion, up \nfrom $6.5 billion in 1991, dwarfing the NEA's Federal subsidy. This 40-\npercent increase in private giving occurred during the same period that \nthe NEA budget was reduced by 40 percent from approximately $170 \nmillion to $99.5 million. Thus, as conservatives had predicted, cutting \nthe Federal NEA subsidy coincided with increased private support for \nthe arts and culture.\n  Let me make a point here. When the Government tries to elicit \npolitically correct art through the NEA, it distorts what happens in \nthe artistic community. It distorts it in the favor of a few who would \ngain a majority in Government. When the private marketplace supports \nart based on the quality of the art, I believe that is a superior way \nto do it, and I believe it is superior for art. It is a way of \npromoting the arts through the private sector and the marketplace which \ndoesn't have the pernicious impact of promoting art which is not for \nart sake or not for communication sake, but is for the purpose of \nattracting from the bureaucrats a Federal subsidy.\n  So not only is it better to have increasing funding coming from the \nprivate sector, in terms of providing adequate resources for the arts, \nbut it provides the validity of which and the integrity of which I \nbelieve is much more to be desired.\n  Let me give you an example. National Endowment for the Arts funding \nis just a drop in the bucket compared to giving to the arts by private \ncitizens. In 1996, the Metropolitan Opera of New York received a \n$390,000 grant\n\n[[Page S9327]]\n\nfrom the Endowment. That is a Federal subsidy of $390,000. That \namounted to less than three-tenths of 1 percent of the opera's annual \nincome of $133 million, and it amounts to less than the ticket revenue \nof a single sold-out performance.\n  State and local governments outspend the NEA, and their funding of \nthe arts has been increasing. The arts are a healthy industry, if you \nwould call it such in this country. Employment and earnings of artists \nare rising. Art attendance is up in virtually every category, and the \neducational level of artists is rising, too. Ticket receipts for arts \nare rising.\n  The National Endowment for the Arts is not operating in an efficient \nand effective manner. Let me just indicate to you we have a lot of \nwaste in this program. There is a lot of overhead. There is a lot of \nineffective spending here. The NEA is not subject, for example, to the \nChief Financial Officers Act, the Government Corporations Control Act, \nor other strict accounting standards. The NEA has not been subject to \nany outside reviews of its management or accounting procedures. And--\nlisten to this--the NEA has an unusually high administrative cost for a \nGovernment agency which now approaches 20 percent.\n  We talked about whether or not the Endowment's budget would carry \nfunding to common, average people, wage earners. Twenty percent of it \ngoes just to fund the salaries of bureaucrats in Washington, DC, who \nmake the demand that politically correct art be produced by artists who \nwould otherwise paint or otherwise provide other artistic work.\n  We earlier learned that 20 percent of the budget goes to \nmultimillion-dollar art agencies. So you have 20 percent that goes to \nthe multimillion-dollar art agencies, another 20 percent that goes to \nthe bureaucrats here in Washington, DC, and almost half the budget so \nfar is in categories that clearly aren't going to benefit people, even \nif the nature of the art produced was valid and had the integrity that \nart ought to have. Then you have art critics saying that the remaining \n60 percent is used to distort what would otherwise be produced in the \nmarketplace.\n\n  The National Endowment for the Arts recently wasted millions of \ndollars of taxpayers' money on a failed computer upgrade. And according \nto the NEA's own inspector general, a large percentage of grantees fail \nto document properly their use of Federal funds. So even when they send \nmoney out under the agenda of the bureaucracy and there are \nrequirements there be documentation for the utilization of the funds, \nthe NEA's own enforcement office, the inspector general, says, ``Well, \na large percentage of the people never really explain adequately how \nthey use the resource.''\n  The NEA is not operating in accordance with congressional intent. \nAccording to its mission statement, the NEA is to foster the \nexcellence, diversity, and vitality of arts in the United States and to \nbroaden public access to the arts.\n  One-third of direct NEA grant funds go to six large cities. One-third \nof all the funds find their way to New York, Boston, San Francisco, \nChicago, Los Angeles, and Washington, DC. The rest of the country is \nleft holding the bag, having made these other locations substantial \nbeneficiaries of the tax resources of America.\n  Those six cities really leave much of the country without. One-third \nof the congressional districts fail to get any direct NEA funding. We \nhave 435 districts. We have a lot of folks. So 140 districts, \nbasically, get nothing. And, there is a large disparity in the amount \nof funding in districts that do receive funding. One-fifth of the \ndirect NEA grants go to multimillion-dollar arts organizations. I \nalready said that.\n  Moreover, the NEA continues to fund objectionable art, continues to \ndo so despite the attempts by Congress to limit such funding.\n  I support and I appreciate the arts. Anybody who spent as much time \nwith his mother standing behind him breathing down his neck as he sat \non the piano bench and she counted the music and insisted on practicing \nhas developed some appreciation for the arts. I don't play any of them \nwell, but I manage to play three or four instruments. I have had the \nprivilege of cutting a couple records and had a few people record songs \nI have written myself, but I never expected the Federal Government to \ncome and subsidize what I do. Even the singing Senators don't want a \nsubsidy for what we do. Of course, no one, not even the National \nEndowment, would construe what we do as art.\n  But I support the arts and I know that arts enrich our lives and make \nus better citizens, arts that are created and developed by individuals \non the basis of their own sense of communication and not as a source of \nchasing Federal funding.\n  I believe we are challenged by the creative efforts and the talents \nof artists. Sometimes art doesn't have to be magnificent in order to be \nchallenging or inspiring. I have seen inspiring art by children. I have \nseen inspiring art by those who are less fortunate than most of us, by \nthose who are handicapped, because it represented some sincere \nexpression from them as individuals. That art can teach us, it can help \nus, it can shape us, and it can challenge us.\n  No doubt, the abundance and variety of artistic expression in America \nplays a significant role in shaping our culture. My position in regard \nto eliminating the NEA should not be interpreted as a repudiation of \nthe arts. It should be interpreted as a means of supporting the arts.\n  It must be clear that Congress should act pursuant only to its \nconstitutional authority and not simply when Members of this body \nbelieve that it is a good idea for Congress to support something. \nAmidst all the rhetoric and all of the accusation lies a central \nsalient fact: that the U.S. Government is a profoundly poor patron of \nthe arts, it is a poor judge of beauty and it is an even poorer judge \nof inspiration. If we had at our disposal all the money in the world, \nit would not change this reality.\n\n  Our resources should not be devoted toward subsidizing one kind of \nspeech or expression over another, toward saying your sense of \ncreativity is superior, your idea is superior to another. Rather, we \nshould allow as many of those resources to remain in the hands of those \nwho have earned them. When we have sought to elicit artistic \nachievement by governmental subsidy, according to some of the very best \ncritics, we have distorted and profoundly impaired the ability of \nartists to operate. They have called our impact a corrosive impact on \nwhat would otherwise be art of greater integrity.\n  With that in mind, I thank Senator Helms for his eloquent statement \nand his joining me in this amendment which would allow the Senate to \njoin the House in declining to fund the National Endowment for the \nArts.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have listened with great interest to \nthe debate this afternoon, hearing interesting comments by the senior \nSenator from New York who, as he said, was present at the creation of \nthe National Endowment, hearing now this eloquent and well-reasoned \nattack on the National Endowment by the junior Senator from Missouri, I \nfind myself compelled to make a few comments from my own observation \nthat I think will be a little different from some that we have heard.\n  The Senator from Missouri talks about distorting the arts by virtue \nof Federal involvement and Federal subsidization. I can only say that \nis not what happens in my State. The main impact of the National \nEndowment for the Arts in the State of Utah has been to spread the \narts; that is, make them available in areas in rural Utah and in poorer \nschool districts where they would not be available otherwise.\n  I find no distortion of the arts when a Federal grant goes to support \nthe establishment of string quartets playing Bach and Beethoven and \nMozart in areas where the people would not of themselves be able to \nsustain that kind of musical organization coming into their community. \nI don't think it is a distortion of good art to have this kind of \nspreading effect take place in the rural areas of our country.\n  The Senator from Missouri makes the point that the vast amount of \nfunding for the arts does, indeed, come from the private sector and \nthat the amount of Federal contribution is so small as to be almost \nnegligible, and he uses as his example the Metropolitan Opera.\n\n[[Page S9328]]\n\n  I would be happy to stipulate that if the National Endowment for the \nArts went away, the Metropolitan Opera clearly would not. The \nMetropolitan Opera has the ability and the visibility to raise the \nmoney necessary to stay viable if the NEA were to disappear.\n  But I stand here as a supporter of the NEA not because I love the \nMetropolitan Opera. I have been to a few performances. I think it is \nfine. I would go to more if I had the opportunity to be in New York \nmore often. It is the Utah opera I am concerned about and, yes, the \nUtah opera would probably survive without support from the National \nEndowment for the Arts, but the fundraising efforts of those who put on \nand produce the Utah opera would be hampered.\n  The National Endowment for the Arts is something like a ``Good \nHousekeeping Seal of Approval'' put on a local effort which allows the \npeople who are running that local effort to then go out and do their \nfundraising and say, ``You see what we have here is really a class \noperation. It's something worthy of your support, worthy of your \nprivate contributions. Look. It's good enough that the National \nEndowment for the Arts has put their seal of approval on it.''\n\n  There are organizations in Utah that compete heavily for that seal of \napproval, not because they are involved in any distortion of what they \nare doing for purpose of seeking a Federal grant.\n  The Utah Shakespearian Festival, for example, is not going to rewrite \nShakespeare's plays just in an effort to get a Federal grant. But if \nthey can get just enough seed money out of the National Endowment for \nthe Arts that says to the people of southern Utah, ``The Utah \nShakespearian Festival has arrived, the Utah Shakespearian Festival is \na first-class operation important enough to come to the attention of \nthe National Endowment for the Arts,'' they can then take that \nstatement, along with what little amount of money that came along with \nit, and redouble their fundraising efforts to make sure that the Utah \nShakespearian Festival will thrive.\n  If I may, for just a moment, talk about the Utah Shakespearian \nFestival. It started as almost a class project at the College of \nSouthern Utah in Cedar City for something to do during the summer. The \nfounder of the festival would probably be a little more grandiose in \nhis description of what he was getting started. This was roughly 30 \nyears ago. It has grown to be one of the top five Shakespearian \nfestivals in the country. People come from all over the country to \nattend it. And we have a marvelous, marvelous cultural experience in \nsouthern Utah as a result of its existence.\n  Do they need money from the National Endowment for the Arts to \nsurvive? No, they do not. But they compete for the money as often as \npossible even though they are now a multimillion-dollar operation \nbecause they want the seal of approval that comes with the recognition \nby a centrally located Government agency that says, ``You are quality. \nYou have reached the point where you justify our kind of concern.''\n  So those who are involved in the Shakespearian festival are grateful \nto me for speaking out in their behalf on behalf of the NEA. They are \nnot seeking to distort what they do. They are not, as I say, rewriting \nShakespeare's plays so some bureaucrat will love them. They are simply \nseeking the credibility that comes with association with the National \nEndowment for the Arts.\n  I have talked to school districts around the State of Utah. In every \ncase, they have the same story to tell. ``If we can just get a few \nhundred dollars that has the NEA seal connected with it attached to our \nprogram, we can then raise far more easily the local money that we \nneed.''\n  No, the Utah Opera will not disappear. The Utah Shakespearian \nFestival will not disappear. The Utah Symphony will not disappear. \nBallet West will not disappear. These are the leading arts \norganizations in Utah. But the school music programs will be hurt. The \norchestras--they are not even big enough to be orchestras. The school \nmusical activities that go on throughout rural Utah will be hurt if the \nNEA disappears. I think that is something to be concerned about.\n  The Senator from Missouri says, well, the art in this country was \njust as good before the NEA as it has been afterward. I will not \ndispute that. I do not think the NEA has funded the creation of a new \nBeethoven or a new Michelangelo or a new Shakespeare. But it has made \nit possible for people to enjoy the productions of the old Michelangelo \nand Beethoven and Shakespeare in places where they had not had that \nopportunity previously.\n\n  Of course, in my State there is a long history of public funding for \nthe arts. This is, as people perhaps are beginning to get tired of \nbeing reminded, the sesquicentennial of the arrival of the Mormon \npioneers in Salt Lake Valley; 150 years ago this group trekked across \nthe plains, came in to found what is now the State of Utah. And there \nhas been a great deal of national publicity about that, a great deal of \ndiscussion about the difficulties and hardships that they went through.\n  In the context of this debate, I point out that within weeks after \ntheir arrival in the Salt Lake Valley, which was about as inhospitable \na place as they could possibly have arrived, they put on a production \nof the ``Merchant of Venice.'' In their total poverty, having walked \nacross the plains, now exhausted, faced with the possibility of \nstarvation because they were not sure they could get their crops in in \ntime to get any kind of a harvest before the winter set in, in a \nhostile environment where no crops had ever been grown before, they \nturned their attention to put on a production of the ``Merchant of \nVenice''--public support for the arts.\n  You say, ``Oh, that was all private money.'' Well, that is true. They \ndid not have any Federal money. They did not have any money at all. And \nI am sure it was not the most wonderful production of the ``Merchant of \nVenice'' that has ever been put on. But they focused on the renewing, \nenriching circumstance of the arts. Brigham Young, when he arrived in \nthe valley, planted his cane in the ground and said, ``Here we will \nbuild a temple to our God,'' establishing his first priority, which was \nworship in the manner that they saw fit. That is why they went there, \nbecause they were prevented from worshiping the way they saw fit when \nthey had been in the United States. And so they went to leave the \nUnited States. When they started out for that part of the world it was \npart of Mexico.\n  But the temple was 40 years in the building. Long before the temple \nwas built, they had built the Salt Lake Theater. And they were having \nplays. They were supporting the arts with public funds.\n  We recently passed a tax increase in Salt Lake County for one \npurpose, and one purpose only, to support the arts--public funding \ngoing for arts support. The Utah Symphony probably would not survive \nwithout that tax increase. And there was a recognition that what the \nUtah Symphony does for the school children of Utah, what the Utah \nSymphony does for the cultural atmosphere of the entire State of Utah, \nthe concerts they give all up and down the State that are attended free \nby schoolchildren and others is worth public funding for the arts.\n  That is a precedent that I think we cannot lose sight of when we are \nhaving this debate here on the floor and saying, ``The public has no \nbusiness funding the arts. Let the private people take care of it.''\n  The public has an enormous stake in seeing to it that the arts \nflourish in our society, that if we ever get to the point where our \nschoolchildren have no appreciation for Shakespeare, have no sense of \nexcitement when they hear the ``Ode to Joy'' from the last movement of \nBeethoven's 9th Symphony, because they have never heard it before--oh, \nif they live in a major metropolitan area they will hear it, if they \nlive within the sound of public radio, which some of our colleagues in \nthe House want to destroy as well, they may hear it--but there is \nnothing quite like hearing it live in your own rural community, maybe \nbadly played, put on by the local folk, and only a few hundred dollars \nfrom the National Endowment for the Arts that made it possible, that \nstarted the ball rolling, but essential, vital, important to the lives \nof all of us.\n\n  The public, as a whole, has a stake in seeing that the arts flourish. \nThose who would cancel any kind of Federal participation in the arts \nwill be sending a powerful message that the public\n\n[[Page S9329]]\n\nin the United States wants to turn its back on any kind of public \ninvolvement in disseminating the impact of the arts throughout our \nsociety.\n  So, Mr. President, with all due respect to my colleagues for whom I \nhave great personal affection who are on the other side of this issue, \nI make it clear that I stand for funding for the National Endowment for \nthe Arts.\n  Out of that general statement, let me make some specific comments \nabout the debate we are having.\n  Is the National Endowment for the Arts the perfect vehicle for this \nfunding activity that I have just defended? Probably not. There are \nalways improvements that can be made in the bureaucracy.\n  Has the National Endowment for the Arts funded art with which I am \ndisappointed? Absolutely. There is no question that the sense of \noutrage that has been raised on the floor of this House and the other \nover the years about some things that have been funded by money from \nthe Federal Government is a legitimate sense of outrage.\n  Unfortunately, we have ourselves in the circumstance where if you are \nfor the arts you almost have to stand up for this appropriations, in \nthe way the public perceives it. And if you think that there is a \nproblem, you almost have to be with Senator Helms and opposing \neverything. I would hope we could get away from that. And I know there \nare a lot of amendments on the floor.\n  Senator Hutchison from Texas has one that I am almost tempted to vote \nfor, maybe with some tweaking I might be able to vote for it. I wish we \ncould be in the atmosphere where we started out with the amendment of \nthe Senator from Texas and said, ``OK, this is a description of where \nwe want to be. Now let's try to work from here towards solution.''\n  But unfortunately, the matter has been so polarized you almost have \nto pick a side and stand on that side and say, ``Any movement away from \nthis side opens me up to misinterpretation,'' any movement away from a \nstand for the full amount approved by the subcommittee that Senator \nGorton chairs, and on which I serve, is a demonstration you are not in \nfavor of the public support for the arts; or, on the other side, any \nmovement away from total elimination is a demonstration that you are in \nfavor of filthy art. I do not think either of those extremes is \naccurate in the legislative situation in which we find ourselves.\n  I would hope that in this Congress we would pass the bill as it came \nout of the subcommittee--I voted for it in the subcommittee and support \nit strongly on the floor--and then move toward a more reasoned or, if \nyou will, less emotional analysis of what should be the future of \nfunding for the arts, what should be the restructuring of the National \nEndowment for the Arts.\n  Could we perhaps combine the National Endowment for the Arts and the \nNational Endowment for the Humanities in a single endowment, overseeing \nboth activities, and see if we can't achieve some efficiencies in \nadministration, that some of the same administrative functions could \ntake place to support both activities, and do that in a much less \nemotionally charged atmosphere that seems to surround this debate?\n\n  For that reason, I will support the amendment by the chairman of the \nfull committee, Senator Stevens, that says once this is all over in \nthis appropriations bill, Congress should hold some hearings on this \nissue and see where we really ought to go.\n  But in this emotionally charged atmosphere that we find ourselves, I \nfind that those kinds of conversations get lost in the rhetoric and you \nhave to chose either one side or the other. The highly polarized \natmosphere of this debate is, I think, unfortunate.\n  But in that atmosphere I have made my choice, true to the traditions \nof the State that I represent, going back 150 years. I have decided to \nsupport public funding for the recognition that it is the spreading of \nthe arts throughout all of society that is the great benefit of the \narts.\n  It is not for the elite, who sit in the concert hall and listen to \nthe Metropolitan Opera, to say, ``That is a magnificent operatic \nexperience''; it is for the people in the small towns of Utah, who sing \nthose operatic arias, usually rather badly, but are nonetheless \ninspired by the experience of coming in contact with that which the \nMetropolitan Opera itself helps preserve for the Nation as a whole.\n  Would I like to have more money for my State out of the National \nEndowment? Of course. What politician would not, but not at the expense \nof dismantling the great artistic organizations that are at the core of \nthe spreading of art throughout our society as a whole.\n  So I look forward to the passage of Senator Stevens' amendment, for \nthe coming of some kind of hearings for the examination of the \nparticulars of how we deal with this. But I repeat again, in the \npolarization that has occurred here where you have to ultimately say \nyou are on one side or the other, I have chosen the side that I have \nbeen on. And I wish to make that clear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I was particularly moved by the remarks of \nthe Senator from Utah and decided I would come to the floor at this \ntime and add my own thoughts, which are in support of the funding for \nthe National Endowment for the Arts.\n  Mr. President, support for the arts and the humanities, in my \njudgment, characterizes a civil society. It establishes in many \nrespects that Nation's place in history. We read so much about wars and \npoliticians, but I find that the search for the arts is what really \nleaves the strongest impression about a Nation's contribution to \nmankind.\n  Throughout our Nation's history, the arts have held a very valued \nplace in our country. I listened earlier to our good friends and \ncolleagues speak, and I went over to my reception room and lifted this \nvolume entitled ``The Art in the United States Capitol.'' Would it not \nbe hypocrisy for those who feel so inclined to no longer help the \ncommunities have their own arts, would it not be somewhat hypocritical \nfor us, since we live in and work in this collection of buildings, \namidst one of the greatest collections of art in the world, and we are \nso proud that we put this book out?\n  Let me read the preface. It is 1976, the year of our bicentennial. \n94th Congress of the United States, concurrent resolution.\n\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, the Senate \n     concurring, That there be printed with black and white and \n     color illustrations as a House document, a volume entitled \n     ``Art in the United States Capitol,'' as prepared under the \n     direction of the Architect of the Capitol; and that there be \n     printed 36,400 additional copies of such document, of which \n     10,300 will be for the use of the Senate, 22,100 copies will \n     be used for the House of Representatives, and 4,000 copies \n     for the use of the Architect of the Capitol.\n\n  It is a beautiful volume, Mr. President. I urge those who enjoy, as I \ndo, these magnificent paintings in this great institution to get a \ncopy, if we can find it for them, and place it in their reception room. \nAs the visitors come from all across my State, and indeed from other \nStates, this is the volume which they pick up and go through with great \npride. I am astonished we would enjoy what we have and at the same time \nnot try to take the proper steps to provide for the rest of the country \na comparable enjoyment.\n  As my distinguished colleague said, while we may not have, thus far, \nwith the NEA created a Michelangelo, perhaps we have instilled in men \nto study his works. I often take time to go through our galleries and \nmuseums all across this country to enjoy the great contributions of \nthose in our Nation who have placed in history this Nation's \ncontribution to the arts.\n  I feel it would be a sad contradiction were Members of Congress to \nturn their back on funding for the arts at the same time we work among \nthis marvelous collection of art and buildings, some of the most \npriceless pieces of art work in the country and enjoyed by millions of \nvisitors every day to the Capitol of the United States.\n  The Rules Committee, of which I am a member, has oversight \nresponsibility for these buildings and the works of art proudly \ndisplayed. We have a curator, a very knowledgeable individual with whom \nI have had many, many, enjoyable conversations. Each day our own \ncollection is checked. Often it has to be refurbished. The Capitol \nBuilding itself is one of the finest examples of 19th-century \nneoclassical architecture, and it is noted in the hallways and \nthroughout some 540 rooms of the Capitol that there are over 677 works \nof\n\n[[Page S9330]]\n\nart, including portraits, major paintings, statutes, reliefs, frescoes, \nmurals, sculptures, and other miscellaneous items.\n\n  The National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for \nthe Humanities were founded some 30 years ago with the passage of the \nNational Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act of 1965. Since their \ninception, the NEA and the NEH have funded numerous museums, \nsymphonies, and projects of historical and cultural significance.\n  In my State, the economic wealth of Virginia has been the beneficiary \nof many of those contributions.\n  In addition, the NEA and NEH grants served as a catalyst for \norganizations by assisting them in fundraising efforts in their own \ncommunities.\n  How often have I attended these events. And the fact that the \nNational Endowment for the Arts in Washington, DC, recognizes that this \nparticular entity in Virginia is eligible for a grant has enabled them \nto raise additional funds. It is a force multiplier in the all-\nimportant work of raising private contributions.\n  Have the NEA and the National Endowment for the Humanities made \nmistakes? Oh, yes, Mr. President, very, very serious errors in judgment \nand mistakes. But show me any other department or agency of the Federal \nGovernment that has not likewise made serious mistakes in the course of \ntheir history. We learn by our mistakes. I was here at the time a very \nserious problem arose with the National Endowment, and I say to my good \nfriend from North Carolina--and I am privileged to sit in front of his \ndesk, a dear and valued friend--how properly he brought that to the \nattention of the American people. That was a serious example. But I am \nconvinced we have learned from these mistakes, and they shall not be \nrepeated. Fundamental change, nevertheless, is needed, Mr. President.\n  In July, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, of which I \nam privileged to be a member, had the opportunity to review, mark up \nand report legislation reauthorizing the NEA and the NEH.\n  This measure, the Arts and Humanities Amendments of 1997 (S. 1020) \nmakes progress toward the structural reforms many of us believe need to \nbe made. It focuses the mission of the agencies, while broadening the \npopulations served. It reduces bureaucracy, while increasing \naccountability. And it sets in motion a process by which a true \nendowment can be established.\n  This reauthorization bill represents the bipartisan work of the \ncommittee with jurisdiction. During markup, there were three areas of \nthe measure that I believed merited the committee's attention. I put \nforth three amendments, all of them being adopted.\n  First, I expressed concern with the authorization levels contained in \nthis bill. Given the current climate, working toward a balanced budget, \nwhich I support, we need to provide a realistic authorization level for \nthe NEA. I offered an amendment to reduce authorization level for the \nNEA from $175 to $105 million, which was successful. Granted, I \nrecognize that permanent reauthorization of these agencies is unlikely \nat best. But we must be realistic.\n  I am pleased that the Appropriations Committee has likewise come to a \nsimilar level of funding.\n  Second, I stated that the NEA's advisory panels need to be more \ngeographically representative. Currently, membership on the panels is \nconcentrated in two States: New York and California. Again, I offered \nan amendment to ensure that no more than 10 percent of panel members \nwere from one State. We need to ensure that America's geographic \ndiversity is represented on these panels, for it is they who determine \nwhich works are funded.\n  Finally, I remain convinced that administrative costs must be \nlimited. Every dollar saved on administrative costs is another dollar \navailable for grantmaking activities. This panel recognized that fact \nlast Congress, when it favorably reported a reauthorization bill with a \n12-percent cap on administrative expenses. We need to get to that \nlevel. I outline these points simply to illustrate that the reported \nmeasure, represents, in my  view, a balanced, thoughtful approach to \nthe dilemma of the NEA. As I said, at the hearing before the Labor \nCommittee nearly 2 months ago, I want to express my support for the \narts and the maintenance of a national presence. But I also wish to \nexpress my strong support for a thorough review of the agency policy.\n\n  The Labor and Human Resources Committee put forth a bipartisan \nconsensus predicted on the hearing and amendment process. The framework \nof S. 1020 represents a solid basis for handling these issues on this \nbill. I hope that the leaders of both committees of jurisdiction can \nset forth a consensus that builds on the work done in the Labor \nCommittee and can come together and craft a measure to be put in this \nbill that reflects and takes into consideration, I think, the very \nconstructive considerations that have been offered by many of my \ncolleagues this afternoon, and can put together a framework predicated \non the foundation set in S. 1020.\n  I understood the desire to report from the Senate Labor Committee and \nfrom the Senate the most favorable bill possible from the agencies' \nperspective. However, presenting the most realistic measure possible \nwill ensure that our priorities are preserved.\n  As a new member of the Senate Labor and Human Resources, I was \npleased to work with Chairman Jeffords and other members of the \ncommittee to craft this proposal. This measure meets the need for \nstructural reform, provides appropriate funding levels, and maintains \nour commitment to the arts.\n  It is my hope that the work of the committee will be recognized and \nincorporated in the final legislation funding these agencies.\n  One thing that this debate makes clear is the need for a thorough \nrevamp of this process. I would support funding for 1 more year with \nthe commitment to evaluate, through hearings before the Labor \nCommittee, appropriate policy changes. It is my hope that a \ncomprehensive review of Federal funding of the arts and the proposed \nalternatives--several of which have been offered on the floor--will \nresolve this annual debate.\n  The United States is the world's leading economic and military \nsuperpower, and as we enter the second millennium, I believe we have a \nspecial obligation to ensure that the arts are not neglected.\n  Mr. President, we are approaching the millennium. It would be tragic, \nI think, for the United States of America to begin to celebrate the \nmillennium having abandoned public support for the arts and, yet, we in \nthe Capitol will still remain in this magnificent set of buildings \ncontaining this magnificent art, which were contributions of previous \ngenerations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Enzi pertaining to the introduction of Senate \nResolution 122 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                      THE BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, with all of the discussions that have \noccurred in recent weeks regarding the Bureau of Indian Affairs [BIA], \nit seems that every year about this time, we in Congress scratch our \nheads and wring our hands over how to improve efficiency with this most \ncumbersome of Federal bureaucracies. I want to share with my colleagues \nan experience that one of my constituents recently had with the BIA. It \ndeals with Hodges, Inc., a small construction firm with home offices in \nSandy, UT. This is a case with a long and complicated history, but I \nwant my colleagues to have a better understanding of what it is like \nfor a small contractor to conduct business with the BIA.\n  On June 20, 1994, the BIA awarded to Hodges, Inc., a contract for the \nrenovation of the Taos Pueblo Day School in New Mexico, in the amount \nof $649,541. According to this agreement, the renovation work was to \nhave been completed within 120 days from July 5, 1994.\n  The first problem occurred when the architect of the project was also \nselected to be the contracting officer's\n\n[[Page S9331]]\n\nrepresentative [COR] creating several built-in conflicts of interest. \nWhen Hodges, Inc., the primary contractor, pointed out several \ndeficiencies in the design, the COR unfortunately interpreted these \ncomments as personal attacks. Problems escalated as the COR visited the \njob site only three or four times, and failed to take into account \ndiffering site conditions, changes, and payment clauses of the \ncontract. The COR never attempted to determine if the work was \nsatisfactorily completed at the time of invoice preparation.\n  Unfortunately, the COR and the contracting officer also failed to \nunderstand the significance and importance of issuing change orders to \nthe contractor. Numerous incidents occurred during the renovation when \nchange orders were issued to the contractor, directing him to perform a \nspecific repair and to submit a proposal for that work. Under the terms \nof the original contract, Hodges, Inc., had no choice but to perform \nthese tasks as directed and, in return, the contracting officer was to \npay the contractor an equitable adjustment, covering any increased \ncosts and recognize the additional contract performance time as a \nresult of the directed change.\n  However, the BIA did not always agree with the invoices submitted by \nHodges, Inc., and arbitrarily determined the amount it would pay with \nno attempt to negotiate the payment or understand the nature of the \nexpenses incurred by the contractor.\n  Mr. President, competent architects and engineers know that \nrenovation of an existing building is frequently far more complicated \nthan new construction projects. Consequently, extra care should be \ntaken to ensure the accuracy of the contract documents. The number of \ncomplications during renovation of the Taos Pueblo Day School that can \nbe traced to defects in the plans and specifications led to significant \nchanges to the contract. Singularly, these defects might not have been \nsignificant, but the considerable number of defects hindered the \ncontractor's ability to perform in a timely and cost-efficient manner.\n\n  Throughout all the performance process, there was no sense of urgency \non the part of the BIA in responding to several concerns raised by the \ncontractor, with delays in answering critical correspondence of up to \n45 days. The BIA's failure to respond to requests for clarification or \ndirection in a timely manner impacted Hodges, Inc.'s ability to perform \nits contractual obligation. By September 1994, the antagonistic \nrelationship between the BIA and Hodges, Inc., was so strained as to \nmake any sort of amicable solution very difficult. Rather than having \nmeaningful discussions to resolve the differences, the remaining \nperformance period became a nonproductive paper war.\n  The contract was terminated for default by the BIA on April 6, 1995. \nIn accordance with the disputes clause of the contract, Hodges, Inc., \nappealed the termination for default to the Interior Board of Contract \nAppeals [IBCA] on June 6, 1995. In October, Hodges, Inc., filed a \ncomplaint with the IBCA alleging they were delayed in performing the \ncontract by the BIA's improper administration of several contract \nclauses. Hodges, Inc., filed claims against the BIA in the amounts of \n$16,627.39 for improper administration of payments during contract \nperformance, $82,394.53 in documenting costs because of equitable \nadjustments to the contract under the changes clause of the contract, \nand $573,398.28 requesting termination for convenience costs.\n  In December, BIA agreed to a termination for convenience rather than \nthe termination for default, with an effective date of April 6, 1996. \nOn December 12, 1996, the BIA and Hodges, Inc., settled the termination \nfor convenience costs with a payment due to Hodges, Inc., in the amount \nof $495,000.00. During the course of the negotiations the parties \nagreed that payment would be made by the middle of January 1997, the \nbecause the project was not yet completed by the construction \ncontractor performing on behalf of the bonding company, the costs that \nthe bonding company incurred would be paid directly to them by BIA.\n  To almost no one's surprise, BIA did not fulfill its obligation of \npaying by mid-January. Only after my office contacted the BIA in behalf \nof Hodges, Inc., and with the oversight of the Department of the \nInterior, were payments made. The first $145,000 payment was received \non April 2, 1997, a second $300,000 payment was received on April 16, \n1997, and a third $50,000 payment was received on May 6, 1997. All \npayments were made well after the convened date, causing undue hardship \non the contractor who had made arrangements with its subcontractors in \norder to clear its own debts.\n  Unfortunately, chapters in this strange saga continue to be written. \nBIA has denied the contractor claim to recover interest penalties owed \nthem, and because the bonding company has not received payment from BIA \nfor work beyond the conversion, they have been forced to withhold \nHodges, Inc.'s performance and payment bonds with the Small Business \nAdministration. As a result, Hodges, Inc., is limited on the size of \ncontracts it can bid, hindering its ability to do business.\n  Mr. President, this whole episode has escalated the cost of the \nrenovation of the Taos Pueblo Day School from about $650,000 to $1.1 \nmillion--$500,000 over the original amount awarded. That is a half a \nmillion dollars that could better be spent improving education, law \nenforcement or housing. And we wonder why things don't seem to be \ngetting any better for the tribes over the years.\n  In the coming days, we will discuss the future of tribal funding. As \nthis debate is conducted, I ask my colleagues to also keep in mind that \nno matter how funding formulas are changed, failure to force BIA to \nimprove efficiency will only hinder efforts to improve conditions for \nthe tribes. A new funding formula administered by an old, inefficient, \nand unresponsive bureaucracy is the equivalent of putting new wine in \nold bottles. I encourage my colleagues to seriously consider the need \nto restructure BIA in addition to the need to restructure current \nfunding formulas.\n\n\n            the grand staircase-escalante national monument\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as my colleagues know nearly a year ago, \non September 18, 1996, President Clinton announced the creation of the \nGrand Staircase-Escalante National Monument under the authority of the \nAntiquities Act, declaring 1.7 million acres in the State of Utah as a \nnational monument. The majority of the citizens in southern Utah were \nunderstandably distressed that they were left out of the designation \nprocess. Today, those local citizens continue to be alarmed by the \npotential negative impact this designation may have on their counties' \neconomies. While we may not wish to reverse the President's \ndesignation, we must ensure that the Grand Staircase-Escalante National \nMonument is sufficiently funded and managed in a way that ensures the \nintegrity of the public comment process.\n  I have included specific language included in the committee report \naccompanying H.R. 2107 represents the first opportunity we have to \nappropriate funds for this monument. I would like to express my \nappreciation to the chairman, Senator Slade Gorton and the \ndistinguished ranking member, Senator Robert Byrd, for working with me \nto address the immediate needs of the monument.\n  The language included in the committee report identifies $6,400,000 \nin funding for the monument. This amount, rather than been consolidated \nin a single line item, has been distributed among 20 different \nsubaccounts within the Bureau of Land Management's budget under \n``Management of Lands and Resources'' account. Because these funds are \nappropriated through so many separate budget functions, it is extremely \nimportant that the moneys allocated for the monument be clearly listed \nin the report by line item, so that funds are not diverted to other \nagency programs. In order to ensure that sufficient resources are \navailable during this planning stage, the report language mandates that \nall of the funds designated in this bill are to be allocated to the \nUtah BLM office and the on-ground field office. I thank the chairman \nfor his help in this matter.\n  Mr. President, it is also important that Congress provide maximum \nflexibility at the field office level to utilize these funds in most \neffective way. The report language expresses the expectation that funds \nwill be relocated as\n\n[[Page S9332]]\n\nneeded, with an emphasis on the provision of visitor services. On this \nmatter, the committee directs the BLM to work cooperatively with Kane \nand Garfield Counties and the State of Utah in accommodating the \ndiverse range of visitor expectations. The agency should look first to \nthe capabilities and expertise of local citizens, private and \ngovernment entities in addressing the issue of safety, access, and \nmaintenance of the areas visited by the public. The two impacted \ncounties have already signed cooperative agreements with the BLM \noutlining the goals, expectations and deliverables and defining the \ncounties' participation in the planning process. The reports I have \nreceived of this cooperative effort have been encouraging.\n  The committee is appropriating ample funds to continue the \ndevelopment of a management plan and allow the continuation of the \nexisting cooperative agreements with Kane and Garfield Counties. \nHowever, the committee has expressed that the cooperative relationship \nmust not be limited to the management plan, as it has been already \nexpanded to include some short-range search and rescue and other \nrelated concerns.\n  Mr. President, regarding the ever critical matter of schools, \nPresident Clinton assured the people of Utah that ``the creation of \nthis monument will not come at expense of Utah's children'' and that \nonce land exchanges were underway, ``the differences in valuation will \nbe resolve in favor of the school Trust.'' However, the committee \nrightly so, has expressed its concern that the Department of Interior \nmay be undervaluating school trust lands within the monument. We have \nbeen very specific in our instructions to the BLM that this is \nunacceptable.\n  In closing, I would like again to thank my distinguished colleagues, \nSenators Gorton and Byrd and their staff for their assistance in \nforging the directives that will guide the BLM and the Department of \nInterior in the planning and management of the Grand Staircase-\nEscalante National Monument in the next fiscal year.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/15/senate-section/article/S9303-5", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

A bill to guarantee that Federal agencies indentify State \nagencies and counties as cooperating agencies when fulfilling their \nenvironmental planning responsibilites under the National Environmental \nPolicy Act; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n        THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTICIPATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I come to the floor to introduce a piece \nof legislation which I will submit. It is called the State and Local \nParticipation Act of 1997.\n  What I would like to do, Madam President, is to introduce a bill that \nwould provide for the opportunity for State, local, and county agencies \nto participate in the National Environmental Policy Act [NEPA]. This \nbill is to guarantee that local agencies have\n\n[[Page S9333]]\n\nan opportunity to be identified as cooperating agencies in the NEPA \nprocess, as it takes place in the various locations throughout the \ncountry. All of us know that NEPA was passed in the late 1960's, \ndesigned to provide for full study before activities are undertaken \nwhich affect the environment, and I support that idea. It has been an \ninteresting topic over the years. NEPA, of course, is a relatively \nsmall, simple piece of legislation--less than three pages, which is \nunusual in this place, to have a bill that is that short. But \nfortunately or unfortunately, over the period of the 20 years or more \nthat have gone since the introduction and passage of this bill, a great \nmany changes have been made, not by amendment, not even by regulation, \nbut in fact by court decisions. So now we have a very complicated, very \nexpensive, very time-consuming process that is still designed, as it \nwas originally, to make sure that studies are completed, EIS's are \ncompleted--environmental impact statements or environmental \nassessments, whichever is appropriate. I support that idea. But we have \nbeen very involved, in our committee, Energy and Natural Resources--\nbeen very involved in my State of Wyoming in the use of NEPA to provide \nfor mineral exploration, to provide for roads in the public areas, to \nprovide for grazing, to provide for the number of uses that take place \non public lands.\n  As you can imagine, when you have a State that is 50 percent public \nlands, these kinds of processes are particularly important. We want to \nmaintain them. We want to strengthen them, in fact. After 20 years of \nexperience, there are some things that we can change. So NEPA was \ndesigned to ensure the environmental impacts of proposed actions are \nconsidered and minimized by the Federal agency that is responsible for \ntaking the action.\n  It is also designed to provide for adequate public participation in \nthat decision, in the decision process that is undertaken by the \nFederal agencies. This sounds pretty simple. As a matter of fact, it \nsounds pretty basic and reasonable. And it is. Unfortunately, the \nregulations--have caused it to be something other than simple.\n  For example, we had the question of exploring for gas in an area \nnorth of Casper, WY--a relatively small area. It would have made a \ngreat deal of difference to that county in terms of employment, a great \ndeal of difference to that county in terms of tax base and all the \nthings that affect a community. So the county commissioners felt as if \nthey ought to be a part of this process, and I certainly agreed with \nthem. They had more knowledge about that than any other agency, they \nhad more caring about that than any other agency, yet this area was in \ntheir county so they also cared, of course, equally as much about \ntaking care of the environment and the natural resources.\n  Unfortunately the BLM, in this instance, would not make this county \ncommission a cooperating agency. And they turned to the current law \nwhich says, basically, ``Prior to making any detailed statement, the \nresponsible Federal official shall consult and obtain the comments of \nFederal agencies which have jurisdiction.''\n  We are simply suggesting that there be added the words, ``and State \nand county agencies.'' So it would read, ``. . . obtain the comments of \nFederal and State agencies and counties which have jurisdiction.'' We \nthink that is a reasonable thing to do. I think it is a reasonable \nthing to do. As a matter of fact, most people think it is a reasonable \nthing to do.\n  We also had a forest study that is now underway, in the Medicine Bow \nForest, in Wyoming. I talked to the regional forester. And we had \nanother forest in the Black Hills where the counties and local people \nwere not made a cooperating agency. So the regional director said, \n``Yes, this one we will.'' Unfortunately, when it came to it, they \ndidn't. And they put them in, in some other category, but not as a \ncooperating agency. And as a cooperating agency you can participate \nwith the Federal agencies, put your comments in the report rather than \njust submitting them as any other citizen.\n\n  So that is basically what we do with this legislation. It is designed \nto provide for greater input of State and local governments in the NEPA \nprocess. This measure will be known as the State and Local Government \nParticipation Act of 1997. It will simply guarantee that States and \ncounties are given an opportunity to participate, and participate in \nthe decisions that affect the areas over which they have jurisdiction, \nwhether it be in New York, whether it be in Wyoming, whether it be in \nTexas.\n  Madam President, I would like also to have unanimous consent that \nSenator Craig, from Idaho, be listed also as a sponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair very much for the time. I certainly \nurge my associates in the Senate to take a look at this opportunity to \nprovide for one of the things that we talk about as much as anything in \nthis Senate, and that is providing local input into the decisions that \nare made by the Federal Government. Let me tell you, that is \nparticularly important to those of us from the West--Idaho, Nevada. In \nNevada, some 80 percent of the land in Nevada belongs to the Federal \nGovernment. So the decisions that are made on Federal lands by Federal \nagencies have a tremendous impact on the future of those States and the \nfuture of the economy, and on the future of citizens. It is my belief, \nand the belief of many others, that local governments, the people that \nhave been elected from these areas, should be participating, \ncooperating agencies in the determination of the NEPA arrangement. We \nthink that is what this bill will do and we certainly urge support for \nit.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1176\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n\n                              short title\n\n       Section 1. This Act may be cited as the ``State and Local \n     Government Participation Act of 1997.''\n       Sec. 2. Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental \n     Policy Act of 1969 (43 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``any Federal agency which has'' in the \n     first full sentence after subparagraph (v); and\n       (2) inserting in lieu thereof ``Federal and state agencies, \n     and county governments which have''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER:\n  S. 1177. A bill to prohibit the exhibition of B-2 and F-117 aircraft \nin public air shows not sponsored by the Armed Forces; to the Committee \non Armed Services.\n\n\n         THE PUBLIC AIR SHOW EXHIBITION PROHIBITION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I am going to momentarily send a bill to \nthe desk which will prohibit the use of F-117 aircraft and B-2 aircraft \nin public shows.\n  Madam President, I was stunned to learn last night of this tragic \naccident, and in no way does my action reflect any discredit on the \npilot or in any way prejudge the outcome of this tragic accident. \nIndeed, there are facts at this moment which indicate this pilot took a \nrisk of life to possibly avoid a greater degree of risk to others. As I \nlistened to that report, I thought back to my own experience in Korea \nin 1951. My commanding officer--I remember him very well--Lt. Col. Al \nGordon, U.S. Marine Corps, took off in his AD-1 bomber, and he \nexperienced fire over a community. He stayed with his aircraft in order \nto avoid that aircraft going into a community, and as a consequence it \nlost altitude. When he finally bailed out, there was insufficient \ndistance between the aircraft and the ground. His chute streamed and he \nlost his life. I remember it so well because I was detailed to go out \ninto the mountains and collect that brave officer.\n  I believe that we as a nation should not be using this type of \nmilitary asset in this type of show. This airplane, on a unit program \ncost, costs the taxpayers $100 million a copy. We only have 53 \nremaining, and they are needed for special missions in the national \nsecurity interests of this country. I just do not believe that type of \nasset can be put at this type of risk. The B-2 bomber is $2 billion a \ncopy.\n  Madam President, I stand with some embarrassment because I realize my \noffice and others are besieged with requests from communities and \nconstituents to provide these aircraft for air shows. The aircraft do \nenhance an air\n\n[[Page S9334]]\n\nshow a great deal, but I feel it is a matter of principle that this \nNation cannot subject that costly an aircraft, one that is essential to \nthe performance of specialized missions, in this type of circumstance. \nAs a result, I will submit this bill. Further, I am going to consider \nthis issue in the course of the conference between the House and the \nSenate on the 1998 authorization bill. It will undoubtedly provoke some \ncomment which I will listen to very carefully. I just wanted to express \nthe heartfelt feelings of one Senator that we have to look more \ncarefully at the use of these very costly systems in connection with \npublic air shows such as this.\n  I yield the floor and thank my colleagues.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Leahy, \n        Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Reed, Mr. Gorton, \n        Mr. Inouye and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 1178. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nextend the visa waiver pilot program, and for other purposes; read \ntwice.\n\n\n       THE VISA WAIVER PILOT PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould reauthorize the current Visa Waiver Pilot Program, which is \nscheduled to expire on September 30, 1997. Senator Kennedy has joined \nme in developing this reauthorizing legislation, and I am pleased to be \nintroducing it with him. I am also pleased to have Senators Hatch, \nLeahy, Murkowski, Durbin, Stevens, Reed, Gorton, Inouye and Torricelli \nas original cosponsors.\n  The Visa Waiver Pilot Program permits aliens from designated \ncountries to enter the United States as temporary visitors for up to 90 \ndays with a passport, but without the additional visa that normally \nwould also be required to enter our country. The program became \neffective in 1988, and was originally limited to eight countries and \nfor a duration of three years. Twenty-five countries now participate, \nand the program's authorizing statute has been amended and extended \nfive times--a clear tribute to the program's success. Last year's \nimmigration reform law, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996, extended the Visa Waiver Pilot Program \nthrough September 30, 1997. The program was extended for only 1 year so \nthat we could consider related issues in more detail and apart from the \nmultitude of immigration issues Congress was considering last year.\n  Visa waiver countries are now selected by the Attorney General in \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, a change that was instituted \nthrough last year's immigration reform law. In order to be eligible for \nthe program, countries must meet a number of statutory requirements, \nwhich aim to ensure that aliens admitted under the program are \ngenerally low risk and will not overstay their authorized period of \nstay in the United States.\n  Mr. President, this program has proven a great success. It has \nsignificantly furthered international travel and tourism. Nonetheless, \nI believe the program's authorizing statute can be improved in a number \nof ways to address administrative failings and, more generally, some of \nour Nation's very serious illegal immigration problems.\n  For instance, under the program, any country designated a Visa Waiver \nProgram participant may be placed in probationary status if it does not \nmaintain a low disqualification rate and may eventually be removed from \nthe program. The disqualification rate represents the percentage of \nnationals from a particular country who applied for admission to the \nUnited States. at a port of entry as non-immigrants and who violated \nthe terms of their nonimmigrant visas, were excluded from admission \nupon trying to enter or withdrew their applications for admission. But, \ndue to problems in the administration of the program, no country has \never been removed from the program, and countries' continuing \neligibilities have not even been assessed.\n  What can we do to improve this situation? First, we simply must \nimprove the current abysmal record of tracking--and even counting--visa \noverstayers. Estimates released earlier this year by the INS put the \nnumber of illegal aliens in the United States at 5 million; 41 percent \nof these illegal aliens entered the United States legally but \noverstayed their authorized period of stay.\n  Moreover, we recently learned that the INS cannot even accurately \nassess overall numbers of those who enter legally and overstay, despite \nthe current use of an entry-exit matching system through the I-94 \ncards. The current paper-based entry-exit control system relies on a \ncard, the I-94 form, half of which is collected upon entry and the \nother half of which is collected by the airline or other carrier on \nexit. Ideally, the INS then would match up the two halves of the card. \nThis system should permit the INS to identify individual overstayers. \nYet the INS has used it only to collect aggregate numbers of \noverstayers. Even for that limited purpose the system has failed. We \nrecently learned that INS data based on the I-94's has been virtually \nunusable since 1992.\n  The inspector general of the Department of Justice recently issued an \nalarming report on the subject of nonimmigrant visa overstayers. In \nthat report, which was issued on September 4, the inspector general \nfound that INS's primary information system on nonimmigrants, is not \nproducing reliable overstay data, either in the aggregate, or on \nindividual nonimmigrants, and noted that INS is unable to perform its \nresponsibilities for monitoring the Visa Waiver Pilot Program, \nincluding determining whether a country should be placed on probation \nor terminated from the program. We need to take immediate action to \ncorrect these failings and require INS to carry out its \nresponsibilities.\n  Mr. President, on July 17 I held a subcommittee hearing to examine \nthis program. In addition to learning about weaknesses in the INS's \nmonitoring of visa overstayers, we also learned that, in the view of \nmany nations, the visa refusal rates countries must meet to gain \nadmission to the program are set too low given the somewhat subjective \nnature of the visa awards process. Since the program's inception, \nefforts to modify numerical criteria have continually resurfaced. Some \nnarrow efforts have been successful for a time, but none have resolved \nthe issue on a more permanent basis. Rather than have any sort of \nspecial probationary status reappear from time to time or create any \nspecial status for particular countries, in my view it is better to set \nthese criteria at a more fair level once and for all and to apply the \nrequirements of the Visa Waiver Pilot Program rigorously to newly \nadmitted countries and to countries already in the program.\n\n  This legislation addresses the problem of numerical criteria by \nslightly broadening potential eligibility for the Visa Waiver Program. \nAt the same time, this legislation contains three provisions tightening \nthe program, along with a provision improving administration and one \nextending the program for 5 years.\n  Allow me to be specific:\n  First: The bill would modify the refusal rate countries must meet to \nbe eligible for the Visa Waiver Pilot Program. Under current law, 8 \nU.S.C. 1187(c), in order to be eligible for pilot program status, a \ncountry must have a low nonimmigrant visa refusal rate of 2 percent per \nyear on average over the previous 2 fiscal years, and its refusal rate \nmust not exceed 2.5 percent in either year. The refusal rate is the \npercentage of nonimmigrant visa applications that are rejected at U.S. \nEmbassies and consulates overseas. Our legislation would change those \nnumbers to 3 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively.\n  Our goal here in changing the numbers should not be to guarantee that \nany particular countries will be admitted into the program or to \nincrease participation generally for its own sake. Rather, we should \nseek to make the criteria more fair and as a whole more reflective of \nreasons for which a country should be entitled to visa waiver status. A \nnumber of witnesses testified at our hearing that the Republic of \nKorea--commonly referred to as South Korea, should be admitted to the \nprogram. While I am confident that South Korea will eventually be \nadmitted to the Visa Waiver Pilot Program, I should note that, since \nSouth Korea's refusal rate numbers may exceed 3 percent for the current \nfiscal year, South\n\n[[Page S9335]]\n\nKorea may not be eligible for admission to the Visa Waiver Pilot \nProgram immediately.\n  Mr. President, increasing the refusal rate numerical cutoffs from 2 \npercent/2.5 percent to 3 percent/3.5 percent will not have a dramatic \neffect on the number of countries eligible for the Visa Waiver Pilot \nProgram. Fourteen countries meet the current refusal rate criteria but \nhave not been admitted to the program for other reasons. Four others--\nBotswana, Chile, Greece, and South Korea, do not meet the current \ncriteria, but may meet a modified cutoff of 3 percent/3.5 percent, \ndepending on what happens with their FY97 numbers. Changing the \nnumerical cutoff by 1 percent would thus mean that 18 rather than 14 \ncountries not admitted to the Visa Waiver Pilot Program might now meet \nthe refusal rate criteria. Of those four additional countries, only \nSouth Korea is likely to meet other program requirements in the near \nfuture.\n  The second reform in this legislation will improve reporting of visa \noverstayer numbers and disqualification rates. Current law provides \nthat countries can be removed from the Visa Waiver Pilot Program if \ntheir visa overstay and disqualification rates--i.e., the rate of those \nturned away at ports of entry as inadmissible, exceed 2 percent of \nthose seeking admission as nonimmigrants under the Visa Waiver Pilot \nProgram. Yet the INS has produced no data on overstay numbers since \n1992 and has accordingly been unable to fulfill its statutory duties.\n  To address this serious shortcoming in administration of the Visa \nWaiver Pilot Program, the bill would require that the Attorney General: \nFirst, make precise numerical estimates for each pilot program country \nof that country's visa overstay and disqualification rates, and second, \nreport those estimates to Congress within 30 days after the end of each \nfiscal year. In addition, for any new country to be admitted under the \nslightly revised refusal rate criteria, the Attorney General would have \nto certify that the country's visa overstay and disqualification rates \nhad been within the statutory limits.\n  Third, this legislation provides for enhanced passport security \nrequirements. Under current program requirements, a country may not be \nadmitted to the Visa Waiver Pilot Program unless it certifies that it \nhas or is in the process of developing a program to issue machine-\nreadable passports to its citizens. At the subcommittee hearing we held \non this issue in July, the INS suggested that participant countries \nalso be required to issue fraud resistant passports. This legislation \nactually builds on the INS's proposed requirement. It would require \nthat countries seeking admission to the program issue machine-readable \nand highly fraud-resistant passports. It would no longer be enough for \ncountries to certify that they were moving toward issuing these \npassports.\n  The proposed bill would also extend this requirement to countries \nalready in the program. Despite the requirement in current law that \ncountries at least be developing machine-readable passport programs, \nthere is no requirement that they follow through. Likewise, there has \nbeen no follow-up by the State Department to ensure that they \neventually meet the requirement. For countries in the program as of \nSeptember 30, 1997, the bill provides that the Attorney General may not \nredesignate a country as a pilot program country unless the country \ncertifies that it has issued or will issue as of a date certain \nmachine-readable and highly fraud-resistant passports and unless the \ncountry subsequently complies with any such certification commitments.\n\n  Fourth, this legislation links expansion of Visa Waiver Pilot Program \nwith INS development of an automated entry-exit control system. The \nillegal immigration reform bill requires the Attorney General to \ndevelop, by September 30, 1998, an automated entry-exit control system \nthat will match arrival and departure records and make possible \nidentification of individual aliens who overstay their visas. INS \nindicates that they will have this system up and running on time for \nports of entry other than our land borders. To ensure that the Visa \nWaiver Pilot Program will not be expanded before INS complies with \nthose requirements--and to add some incentive for them to do so--the \nAbraham-Kennedy bill would require that no new country be admitted to \nthe program until 30 days after the Attorney General certifies to \nCongress that the automated entry-exit control system mandated by the \nillegal immigration reform law is operational at all ports of entry \nexcluding the land borders. I note that there may be some question as \nto whether last year's law intended to have the automated entry-exit \ncontrol system apply to the land borders, and I will be working \nseparately to clarify that Congress intended the provision to apply \nonly to entry and exit at ports of entry excluding the land borders.\n  Fifth, this legislation provides modified roles for the Secretary of \nState and Attorney General to reflect their respective Agency's \nexpertise. Last year's immigration reform law also altered the \nrelationship between the Secretary of State and the Attorney General \nwith respect to decisions under the Visa Waiver Pilot Program. That \nprogram previously provided that relevant determinations would be made \njointly by the Secretary and the Attorney General. The illegal \nimmigration bill provided that such determinations are to be made by \nthe Attorney General in consultation with the Secretary. Under the \nAbraham-Kennedy bill, the Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney \nGeneral, would have the lead role only in terms of initially allowing a \ncountry into the Visa Waiver Pilot Program.\n  The Secretary is given this role because she compiles the refusal \nrates and is in a better position to assess a country's passport \nprogram than the Attorney General. Once countries are admitted to the \nprogram, however, the Attorney General would play the lead agency role \nin determining whether a country will remain in the program or be \nplaced on probation for having excessive overstay and disqualification \nrates. This is in keeping with the Attorney General's responsibility \nfor determining these figures and over aliens once they arrive at a \nport of entry to the United States.\n  Finally, the proposed bill includes a 5-year extension of the Visa \nWaiver Pilot Program, setting an expiration date of September 30, 2002.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the extension of this \nimportant program in conjunction with the changes that Senator Kennedy \nand I have developed. This legislation will rationalize an important \nprogram that has brought significant benefits to our Nation, while \ninstituting important safeguards to protect that program's integrity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1178\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am honored to join Senator Abraham, the \nchairman of the Immigration Subcommittee, in introducing legislation to \nextend the Visa Waiver Program for 5 additional years. The programs \nserves the Nation well, and deserves to be extended.\n  I am particularly pleased that the bill we introduce today would \ncreate a pilot program to expand the number of countries able to \nparticipate in the Visa Waiver Program. I am optimistic that Portugal, \nfor example, will qualify for the waiver program under the legislation \nwhich Senator Abraham and I propose today. I have advocated Portugal's \ninclusion in this program for several years because of the close ties \nbetween the people of Massachusetts and that country. Its inclusion in \nthis program will allow Portuguese citizens to come to the United \nStates to visit relatives or conduct trade and business without facing \nthe often time-consuming task of obtaining a visa.\n  This Visa Waiver Program started as a pilot program in 1988 with only \none country, the United Kingdom. Today, it has grown into an important \npart of overall U.S. immigration policy. Twenty-five countries now \nqualify for the program, and it brings significant benefits to the \nUnited States as well as to visitors from those nations.\n  Almost half of those who visit the United States for business or \ntourism now enter under this program. Billions of dollars in \ninternational transactions are facilitated by the ease of travel that \nit makes available. According to the Travel Industry Association of \nAmerica, tourists coming to this country under the program contribute \n$84 billion to the economy and help support 947,000 American jobs in \nthe tourist industry.\n  The Visa Waiver Program also strengthens immigration enforcement. \nRather than spending tax dollars to conduct needless visa interviews, \nthe program enables us to concentrate scarce resources on the serious \nimmigration problems of keeping criminals and terrorists out and \ndealing more effectively with visa fraud. As a result of the program, \nmillions of dollars and hundreds of consular personnel have been \nreallocated to target the most serious immigration threats.\n  Countries must meet strict criteria before they are eligible to \nparticipate in the waiver program, in order to prevent illegal \nimmigration to the United States. The Attorney General may cancel a \ncountry's participation at any time if she believes a waiver \ncompromises law enforcement or national security.\n  Travelers from participating countries may come to the United States \nwithout visas, but they still must be interviewed by U.S. immigration \nofficials at the airport or other points of entry before they are \nadmitted to this country. According to INS statistics, few travelers \nabuse the program to enter the United States illegally. INS has turned \naway less than 1 percent of those seeking entry under the Visa Waiver \nProgram.\n  The bill we introduce today makes a good waiver program even better. \nIt builds on the success of the current waivers by establishing a small \npilot program to enable certain countries that do not currently qualify \nto participate if they meet certain strict requirements. A precondition \nfor the pilot program is for INS to develop and implement an automated \nentry-exit control system. Today, we know who comes to America, but we \ndo not always know who leaves. We need this information in order to \ntrack down visitors who remain in this country illegally after their \nvisas expire, and to ensure that countries are abiding by the \nrequirements of the program, and\n\n[[Page S9337]]\n\nare not contributing to illegal immigration.\n  In order to participate in the new pilot program, a country must have \na low visa refusal rate at our consulates abroad. Under the normal Visa \nWaiver Program, qualifying countries must have a refusal rate of less \nthan 2 percent over the past 2 years. The Abraham-Kennedy pilot program \nwould set the requirement at 3 percent for countries to enter the \nprogram on a pilot basis. In recent times, Portugal's refusal rate has \nbeen below the 3-percent threshold, so unless Portugal's refusal rate \nrises, I would look forward at long last to welcoming Portugal into \nthis program.\n  Mr. President, the Visa Waiver Program works, and I urge Congress to \nextend it. I commend Senator Abraham for offering this timely \nlegislation, and I am proud to be a sponsor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to support Senator Abraham \nand Senator Kennedy's efforts to amend and reauthorize the Visa Waiver \nPilot Program [VWPP]. The Visa Waiver Pilot Program has been highly \nsuccessful program, freeing up embassy staff, promoting tourism and \ntrade, and fostering closer ties between our country and her allies. \nChairman Abraham has made a number of important changes to the VWPP \nwhich I believe will make this program even more successful. The \nchanges include tightening controls so that there will not be abuse of \nthe program, and adjusting the admission criteria to include deserving \ncountries.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have been a strong advocate of \nincluding South Korea in the Visa Waiver Pilot Program. I believe no \nother country, not currently included in the pilot program, represents \nas close an ally as South Korea. As our fifth largest export market, \nhome to 37,000 of our troops, and with an economy larger than all but 5 \nof the current visa waiver countries, this democratic country deserves \nthe right to participate in this program. With a 1996 unemployment rate \nof 2 percent, lower than all but one of the VWPP countries, the \nburgeoning middle class in South Korea should be able to travel to the \nUnited States without the cumbersome restraints associated with \ncitizens traveling from high-risk countries.\n  The Abraham legislation is a positive step, but it is unclear if \nSouth Korea will be eligible for the VWPP in the short term because of \nthe bill's continued reliance on refusal rates as the defining criteria \nfor admission. However, under this legislation Korea stands a much \nbetter chance of becoming eligible than under current law. For this \nreason and the fact that Senator Abraham and Senator Kennedy have \nstrengthened the safeguards in the VWPP, I am supporting this \nlegislation.\n  This bill expands along the concept of promoting tourism and trade \nand fostering closer ties between our country and our allies by \nincreasing the refusal rates needed to become eligible for inclusion \ninto the Visa Waiver Pilot Program. The bill also addresses many of the \nconcerns raised by the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the \nJustice Department by including additional safeguards to ensure that \nthe program is not abused and becomes a vehicle for illegal \nimmigration.\n  For instance, in order for a visa waiver country to be redesignated \nas a visa waiver country, under this legislation the Attorney General \nmust make precise estimates, based upon data collected from an \nautomated entry-exit control system, of the overstay rates of each \ncountry. If the Attorney General cannot make an estimate for a country, \nthat country will lose its privilege to travel to the United States \nvisa free.\n  In the past, Congress could not adequately monitor the effectiveness \nof the Visa Waiver Pilot Program. With the requirements for overstay \nrates, Congress will have analytical evidence that countries are not \nabusing this privilege and that the Visa Waiver Pilot Program works. \nCoupled with the additional safeguards, including the requirement for \nmachine readable and highly fraud resistant passports for countries \nentering the program, the entry-exit control system, already being \nimplemented by INS, will ensure that the VWPP continues to be \nsuccessful.\n  I would like to see further changes. For example, changing the \nreliance on arbitrary refusal rates decided in many cases by overworked \nstaff in our embassies and consulate offices abroad. Examples where \nembassy staff have mistakingly denied visas, abound. They include:\n  President Kim Young Sam's sister rejected the first time she applied \nfor a tourist visa.\n  The daughter of the chairman of the multibillion-dollar company, \nHyundai, was rejected for a student visa based on insufficient \nfinancial resources.\n  The son of the president of IBM Korea was rejected because the \nconsular office did not believe the son would be a good student. He had \nalready been accepted in the school in the United States.\n  For South Korea, where our United States Embassy processes more \nnonimmigrant visa applications than any other country in the world, the \nuse of the refusal rate automatically puts South Korea at a \ndisadvantage. This needs to be corrected. Perhaps with the \nestablishment of a working entry-exit control system required in this \nbill, the overstay rate coupled with other objective criteria can be \nused to determine eligibility.\n  I would like to commend Senator Abraham and Senator Kennedy for \ntaking such an active role regarding Korea and the Visa Waiver Pilot \nProgram. The Subcommittee on Immigration on the Judiciary Committee has \nworked closely with my staff to try to accommodate my concerns. I look \nforward to working closely with both Senators in the future regarding \nthis issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

122--DECLARING SEPTEMBER 26, 1997 AS AUSTRIAN-\n                              AMERICAN DAY\n\n  Mr. ENZI submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 122\n\n       Whereas 1997 marks the 50th anniversary of General George \n     C. Marshall's plan for assisting the free countries of Europe \n     in their post-World War II rebuilding process;\n       Whereas on September 26, 1945, upon the insistence of the \n     United States, a conference was held in Vienna by the Allies \n     and the 9 Austrian Federal State Governors, that laid the \n     foundation for the first post-war Austrian government \n     recognized by the United States and the other Allied Forces;\n       Whereas this treaty saved Austria from being divided into \n     an East and West, as in Germany;\n       Whereas Austrians are thankful for the generosity \n     demonstrated by the citizens and the Government of the United \n     States after World War II;\n       Whereas Austrian-Americans have made important \n     contributions to the American way of life as well as in \n     industry, education, culture, and the arts and sciences; and\n       Whereas Austrian born Americans, or Americans of Austrian \n     descent, have brought prestige and recognition to the United \n     States as Nobel laureates in medicine, economics, and the \n     sciences: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) declares September 26, 1997, as ``Austrian-American \n     Day''; and\n       (2) authorizes and requests the President to commend this \n     observance to the citizens of the United States in honor of \n     this momentous occasion.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to join my friend, the Honorable \nSenator from Indiana, Richard Lugar, in the submission of a resolution \ndeclaring September 26, 1997, Austrian-American Day. We are also joined \nby many distinguished colleagues from both sides of the aisle in \nsupport of this measure to commemorate and celebrate the strong ties \nthat bind the Government of Austria and the United States and our \npeople. This resolution has deep meaning to me because of my Austrian \nroots and heritage.\n  The year 1997 has special significance in the history of Austrian-\nAmerican relations for it marks the 50th anniversary of what became \nknown as the Marshall plan. It was 1947 when Gen. George C. Marshall \noutlined his vision of a program to rebuild war-torn Europe through a \npolicy of reconciliation and compassion. The Marshall plan that was \neventually implemented by the United States is remembered fondly by the \nfree nations of Europe for its monumental and generous aid that gave \nthe people of these nations hope after the most costly war in the \nhistory of the world--hope for freedom and lasting piece. Without the \nincredible vision of General Marshall the democracies of Europe might \nhave floundered in their rebuilding efforts, creating an avenue for the \nexpansion of communism in the midst of the cold war. Marshall's \nforesight and the willingness of the people and the Government of the \nUnited States to assist all of free Europe, especially Austria, \nresulted in the growth of stable governments in these countries.\n  Austrians have not forgotten the efforts of the United States to \nmaintain the unity of their country after World War II. The United \nStates was instrumental in calling for a conference to be held in \nVienna to debate the future of Austria. On September 26, 1945, this \nconference was convened between the Allies and the representatives of \nthe nine Austrian Federal States, during which a treaty was signed that \nrescued Austria from a fate similar to that of the Soviet-occupied \nEuropean countries and a divided Germany.\n  The resolution I propose today, commemorates the sacrifices Americans \nmade for Austria after World War II, as well as contributions that \nAustrian immigrants and Americans and Austrian decent have made to the \nAmerican way of life in industry, education, government, culture, and \nthe arts. Austrian-Americans that have earned the Nobel Prize include \nVictor Franz Hess in physics, Karl Landsteiner in medicine, and \nFriedrich von Hayek in economics. Austria has produced the likes of \nUnited States Supreme Court Justices Felix Frankfurter and Earl Warren; \nthe originator of the Pulitzer Prize, Joseph Pulitzer; John David \nHertz, the founder of today's Hertz-Rent-A-Car and the well-known \nYellow Cab system; Estee Lauder, maker of leading cosmetics; and Raoul \nFleischman, cofounder of the New Yorker magazine and member of the \nFleischman yeast family.\n  Through the years, Americans have also enjoyed the work of those \nAmericans of Austrian descent or origin, such as Fred Astaire, Billy \nWilder, and of course ``The Terminator,'' Arnold Schwarzenegger. This \nis but a small sample of the names to be found on a list of famous \nAustrian-Americans who have made heartfelt contributions to the legacy \nof the America they love.\n  Austria and the United States have shared these common ideals and \ninterests, not just in the past 50 years, but for nearly two centuries. \nIt is for these reasons that I feel it is altogether appropriate that \nwe recognize not only the proud people of Austria, but the warm and \ncordial relations that exist between our two countries at this historic \ntime that holds such deep meaning for both our nations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/15/senate-section/article/S9338-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9338-S9345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION MODERNIZATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT \n    OF 1997 PRESCRIPTION DRUG USERS FEE REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1997\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 HARKIN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1137\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Daschle, and Ms. Mikulski) \nsubmitted an amendment intended to be proposed by them to the bill (S. \n830) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public \nHealth Service Act to improve the regulation of food, drugs, devices, \nand biological products, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. ___.

Mr. President, in 1989, I stood on the Senate \nfloor and urged the Senate to enact tax incentives for enhanced oil \nrecovery techniques.\n  At that time, I told my colleagues that traditional drilling \ntechniques were leaving behind 70 percent of the resource when \ntraditional drilling and pumping was completed. To me, this was \nwasteful, foolish, and unnecessary.\n  It is wasteful to leave the oil behind.\n  It is foolish because the United States has a growing appetite for \nenergy. We are currently importing close to half of the energy we use \nfrom an area of the world renowned for political instability.\n  It is unnecessary because we have the technology to recover the \nresource if we would use enhanced oil recovery techniques.\n  In 1989, I also told the Senate that it would be possible to recover \nanother 20 billion barrels of oil from our same oil fields of existing \nwells if enhanced oil recovery techniques were used. Since our known \nrecoverable reserves at that time were in the neighborhood of 28 \nbillion barrels, the potential was, and still is, significant.\n  At that time, the Department of Energy conducted extensive studies \nshowing that if a 15-percent investment tax credits were enacted, it \ncould result in the recovery of additional reserves for as little cost \nto the Treasury as $1 per additional barrel recovered--assuming $20 per \nbarrel oil.\n  For each and every dollar of Federal revenue invested in EOR \nincentives, the trade deficit would be reduced by $24 to $76 dollars \naccording to the same DOE studies.\n  States with significant EOR potential include California, Texas, New \nMexico, and Oklahoma. Other States with reserves include Arkansas, \nColorado, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, \nNorth Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming.\n  In 1990, the Congress enacted tax incentives to encourage enhanced \noil recovery so that more of this vast resource could be recovered and \nput to good use. I am proud to have been the primary sponsor of that \nlegislation.\n  As a Senator, one of the greatest rewards is seeing a new law make \nthe world a better place. During the August recess I had this rewarding \nexperience. I also saw the predictions of the theoretical studies \nproven up in the real world.\n  I toured the Texaco enhanced oil recovery project located in Buckeye, \nNM. The technical name of the project is the ``Central Vacuum Unit \nCO2 project.''\n  This particular oil field was discovered in 1929. Primary oil \nrecovery techniques were used until 1977. Beginning in 1977, the field \nwas transformed into a waterflood operation. Waterflood is a secondary \noil recovery technique. The waterflood technology sustained and \nenhanced production for awhile, but it was evident that either the oil \nwells in the field would be shut-in and the field-shut down leaving \nbehind a significant amount of oil, or enhanced oil recovery methods \ncould prolong economic levels of production. One very promising \nenhanced oil recovery technique involves injecting the wells with \nCO2.\n  CO2 injection is an enhanced oil recovery technique \neligible for a 15-percent Federal investment tax credit. Using \nCO2 is going to significantly extend the life of this mature \nfield by more than 20 years. The project will recover an additional 20 \nmillion barrels of oil and 23 billion cubic feet of gas that otherwise \nwould have been left behind.\n\n[[Page S9352]]\n\n  Texaco is the operator of this project. Marathon Oil, Phillips \nPetroleum, Mobil Exploration and Production U.S. Inc., and 15 others \nare interest owners in the project.\n  New Mexico is blessed with magnificent oil and gas reserves. It is \ndoubly blessed because it is also the home to the New Mexico Institute \nof Mining and Technology Petroleum Recovery Research Center. The center \nhas served as a focal point for development and application of improved \noil and gas recovery processes. They have a world-renowned reputation \nas one of the leading petroleum research centers. They were very \nhelpful in developing the original legislation.\n  In every oil- and gas-producing State, there are aging oil and gas \nfields with declining production, that could be made more productive \nusing enhanced oil recovery techniques. I am pleased that there is a \nfine example in New Mexico. It is providing 100 jobs in addition to \nadding to our energy security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/15/senate-section/article/S9351-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UKRAINIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Ukrainian \nIndependence Day. Since its independence on August 24, 1991, The \nUkrainian Government has taken several bold steps to reform the country \nafter many years of Soviet rule. We should take this opportunity today \nto review the success that Ukraine has recently experienced.\n  In 1994, Ukraine held legislative and Presidential elections. These \nelections were carried out in an open and fair manner that bodes well \nfor stable democracy in Ukraine. Ukraine now exhibits signs of a \nhealthy democracy, including the existence of multiple interests \nrepresented within the Government, and last year, Ukraine \noverwhelmingly enacted a new constitution which guarantees the right of \nprivate ownership.\n  Ukraine has also focused on reforming its economy with some \nsignificant results. The Government has taken steps to improve the \ninvestment climate in Ukraine. In order to further promote \nprivatization, the President of Ukraine signed the State Privatization \nProgram for 1997. Ukraine also launched a new currency, the hryvna, and \ninflation has been reduced dramatically.\n  Ukraine's efforts on security issues may be its most successful. The \nGovernment has been rightfully lauded for its efforts to rid Ukrainian \nsoil of nuclear weapons by faithfully following guidelines under the \nSTART I Treaty and other agreements. And, by joining the Partnership \nfor Peace Program for NATO membership, Ukraine has shown its \ndetermination to contribute to the security of Europe.\n  The people of Ukraine deserve our admiration and support for the fine \nwork they have done in such a short period of time. The Ukrainian-\nAmerican community in Michigan is in the front ranks of such support. I \nknow my Senate colleagues join me in celebrating the sixth anniversary \nof Ukrainian independence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/15/senate-section/article/S9352-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PROTECT TRUTH IN LABELING\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, last Thursday, Senator Hollings \nand I introduced a resolution that aims to protect truth in labeling \nand, specifically, the integrity of the ``Made in USA'' label. It would \nexpress the sense of Congress that the Federal Trade Commission should \nretain the current standard for labeling products ``Made in USA.''\n  For over 50 years now, Mr. President, consumer goods have been \nlabeled ``Made in USA'' when, and only when, they were made all or \nvirtually all in the United States. But recently the FTC announced \nplans to allow companies to use the ``Made in USA'' label on products \nfor which U.S. manufacturing costs represent as little as 75 percent of \ntotal manufacturing costs and the product was last substantially \ntransformed in the United States. Alternatively, a product could be \nlabeled ``Made in USA'' if it was last substantially transformed in the \nUnited States and all its significant inputs were last substantially \ntransformed in the United States.\n  In practice, Mr. President, this means that products containing no \nmaterials or parts of U.S. origin could nonetheless be labeled as \n``Made in USA.'' Should the company expend 75 percent of its \nmanufacturing costs or engage in the final substantive assembly or \nother modification of the product in the United States, it could \ndisplay the ``Made in USA'' label on the product, even if its entire \ncontent, including manufactured parts, came from overseas.\n  In my view, Mr. President, such rules would in effect condone false \nadvertising. Many Americans look specifically for the ``Made in USA'' \nlabel because they want to support American workers. These loyal \nAmericans do not believe that they are purchasing products mostly made \nin the USA, let alone products for which most manufacturing costs were \nincurred in the USA, or which were substantially transformed in the \nUSA. Quite rightly, consumers who look for the ``Made in USA'' label \nbelieve that in purchasing a product with that label they are getting \nsomething made all or virtually all in the United States.\n  Also important, Mr. President, are the expectations of the many \ncompanies that have made substantial investments in plant and \nequipment, as well as hiring and training, in the United States. These \ncompanies have a right to expect that the ``Made in USA'' label, which \nthey have worked so hard to earn and maintain, will continue to apply \nonly to products made all, or virtually all, in the United States.\n  To dilute the requirement for use of the ``Made in USA'' label would \nbe to lower the value of that label. It would allow companies operating \nsubstantially overseas to deceive American consumers who are attempting \nto support truly American made products and workers. It would \ndiscourage companies from investing in this country by telling them, in \neffect, that they will no longer receive any benefit for keeping jobs \nat home. The result would be a loss of American jobs and morale, as \nwell as a critical blow to consumer confidence in the veracity of \nproduct labels.\n  Mr. President, the American people have a right to expect that the \n``Made in USA'' label will mean what it says. For over 50 years they \nhave depended on that label to assure them that they are purchasing \nproducts made all or virtually all in the United States. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in sending the message to the FTC that we must \nkeep things that way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/15/senate-section/article/S9352-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENTS BY THE VICE PRESIDENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I transmit also, for the \ninformation of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with \nrespect to the Mexico Protocol.\n  In concert with a similar Protocol between the Government of the \nUnited States and Canada, the Mexico Protocol represents a considerable \nachievement for the United States in conserving migratory birds and \nbalancing the interests of conservationists, sports hunters, and \nindigenous people. The Protocol should further enhance the management \nof and protection of this important resource for the benefit of all \nusers.\n  The Mexico Protocol is particularly important because it will permit \nthe full implementation of the Protocol Amending the 1916 Convention \nfor the Protection of Migratory Birds in Canada and the United States \n(``the Canada Protocol'') that is pending before the Senate at this \ntime. The Canada Protocol is an important agreement that addresses the \nmanagement of a spring/summer subsistence hunt of waterfowl in \ncommunities in Alaska and northern Canada. The Mexico Protocol conforms \nthe Canadian and Mexican migratory bird conventions in a manner that \nwill permit a legal and regulated spring/summer subsistence hunt in \nCanada and the United States.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                  William J.
