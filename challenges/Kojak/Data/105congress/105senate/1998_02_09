This morning the Senate will be in a period for the \ntransaction of morning business until 12 noon. At noon, as previously \nagreed to, the Senate will proceed to executive session to debate for \nup to 6 hours the nomination of David Satcher to be the Surgeon General \nand Assistant Secretary of HHS.\n  As a reminder to all Members, no rollcall votes will occur during \ntoday's session of the Senate. However, the next rollcall vote will \noccur on invoking cloture on the Satcher nomination Tuesday at 11 a.m. \nIf cloture is invoked on that nomination, then a second vote would \noccur immediately on the confirmation of the nomination.\n  In addition, a cloture motion has been filed, on Thursday, on the \nmotion to proceed to the cloning legislation. Therefore, a cloture vote \nwill occur on Tuesday also. We will announce the exact time after \nconsultation with the minority leader. This cloture motion is on the \nmotion to proceed.\n  Once again, I would like to note I do think this is an issue on which \nwe should go forward. It is a complicated bill. There are some \nlegitimate concerns that need to be addressed, or discussed at least. \nWhen Senators become familiar with the bill that has been crafted by \nSenator Bill Frist, who certainly knows the subject matter of medical \nresearch and science and the cloning issue, and then when they hear \nfrom Senator Bond and Senator Gregg and are able to be involved in \ndiscussion and debate, I think Senators will feel comfortable with what \nwe are doing here and we should move this cloning legislation forward \nso that we will not have even the threat of human cloning.\n  Also this week the Senate may consider the nomination of Margaret \nMorrow to be a district judge in California and the nomination of \nFrederica Massiah-Jackson to be a district judge in Pennsylvania. We \nwill continue to work with the administration and our colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle with regard to a resolution on Iraq.\n  As a reminder to all Members, the next rollcall vote then will occur \nat 11 a.m. on Tuesday morning to invoke cloture on the Satcher \nnomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/09/senate-section/article/S465-5", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S465-S466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       VETO MESSAGE ON H.R. 2631\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, these are very serious times. The \nadministration and America face a complicated and dangerous dilemma in \nIraq. This dilemma must be approached from a framework of both our \nshort-term and long-term foreign policy objectives.\n  As the administration weighs its short-term options, including the \npossibility of military action with regard to the situation in Iraq, I \nbelieve it is very important that we in the Senate keep a steady focus \non the objective before we start playing out these other options.\n  We all know that any military action must have a clear objective. If \nour Nation decides to risk the lives of young American men and women, \nwe must do so for a clear purpose, with a clear understanding of the \npossible intended and unintended consequences and a reasonable \nassurance of success.\n  Let us remember that the original objective in the Iraqi puzzle was \nthe full compliance by Saddam Hussein with the 1991 resolutions that \nended the Gulf war. Most important is Security Council Resolution 687, \nadopted on April 3, 1991, which clearly spelled out Iraq's obligations \nunder the cease-fire agreement that ended the Gulf war. Those \nobligations have the force of international law and still stand today.\n  This has been the U.N.'s primary focus and objective. It was Saddam \nHussein who created this current situation when he invaded Kuwait in \n1990 and the world united against him. This is not the United States \nand Great Britain against Iraq. This has been the civilized world \nunited against a pariah intent on developing and using weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  We have sympathy for the Iraqi people. The U.N., led by the United \nStates, has provided millions of dollars in humanitarian aid for the \nIraqi people. But we must remember that Hussein used chemical weapons \nagainst his own people and has starved his own people in his \nclandestine and relentless pursuit of these weapons.\n  Time after time he has directly challenged the terms of his surrender \nunder the U.N. resolution. What he is now challenging is the resolve of \nthe world community to stand up to him.\n  The members of the international coalition that condemned his actions \nin 1991 and fought against him must remember who is the guilty party \nhere; who is the guilty party. The guilty party is Saddam Hussein.\n  Just as the world stood united in terms of his surrender, it should \nstand united and resolved in action against his defiance of those \nterms. If he refuses to comply with U.N. Resolution 687, he will pay a \nheavy price. And if Saddam Hussein offers his own people as sacrificial \nlambs, their blood surely will be on his hands.\n  Mr. President, there is a growing chorus which suggests that perhaps \nour short-term objective should be more than Saddam Hussein's full \ncompliance with U.N. Resolution 687, that our immediate short-term \nobjective should be to expel Saddam Hussein from Iraq, to sweep him \nfrom the world stage. This kind of talk is very dangerous and inhibits \nthe administration's efforts as it seeks to reconstruct the 1991 \ncoalition united against Saddam Hussein. Let us not be buffeted by the \nwinds of quick fixes, bombing raids and shortsightedness. Saddam \nHussein has cleverly framed this world debate as Iraq against the \nUnited States. We must not play into his manipulative hands. This is \nnot the equation.\n\n  We all would like to eliminate the threat he poses to the civilized \nworld and that should be our long-term goal. That should be our long-\nterm goal. But for the moment we must not forget that from objectives \ncome actions, and from actions come consequences. Every objective \ncarries with it a different set of military options and will have very \nreal consequences. Actions always produce consequences and not always \nthe geopolitical consequences we expect. We must guard against the \nshort-term objective turning into a long-term unexpected problem.\n  After our lightning success in Desert Storm, I fear that we, as \nAmericans, may have been lulled into a false sense of believing that \nmodern wars can be fought relatively quickly and painlessly, with high-\ntech weapons and very limited casualties. This is not the case, nor \nwill it ever be the case in warfare.\n  Those who believe that this greater short-term objective could be \naccomplished without the use of a massive ground force are \nunderestimating the task.\n  We need to be aware of the ``law of unintended consequences.'' There \nare always uncertainties in war. The consequences of any kind of \nmilitary undertaking are far-reaching. With the current tensions in \nthis region and the grim prospects for peace in the Middle East, this \narea of the world could erupt like a tinder box. Whatever military \naction might be taken against Saddam Hussein, it must be surgical, it \nmust be precise, and it must be focused and, above all, well thought \nout. Other nations would undoubtedly seek to increase their spheres of \ninfluence in the Middle East if our immediate objective was to \neliminate Saddam Hussein. If we were to escalate the level of our \nshort-term objective, would we create consequences just as, if not \nmore, dangerous to our national interests in the world than the \nsituation we currently face?\n  As painfully slow as this process seems to be moving, events can \nunfold very quickly and uncontrollably. We cannot allow Saddam Hussein \nto stampede us into precipitous actions. Remember how the Six Day War \nbegan in 1967. Remember other events of this century that engulfed \nnations in wider, larger, and more deadly conflicts than anyone could \nhave predicted.\n  I ask my colleagues in the Senate to keep this in mind when thinking \nabout how to respond to the present situation in Iraq. What chain of \nevents will we unleash with any action we take? Always the question \nmust be asked, what then happens? What happens next? Are we prepared to \nnot only answer this question but deal with the answer? Any short-term \naction must fit into a long-term foreign policy objective.\n  Any short-term action that America takes must fit into a long-term \nforeign policy objective. What is the administration's long-term \nobjective in Iraq? Do we have one? Or are we crafting a long-term \npolicy to justify short-term actions?\n  In the long term, I believe we need to be more creative in reviewing \nour options against Saddam Hussein. We must not allow ourselves to get \ncaught up in the trap of doing something--anything--just because we \nsaid we would and the world expects us to. Our options should be based \non what's right, what's achievable commensurate with the risk we are \nwilling to take with American lives and what will truly have an impact \nin resolving the problem. And the problem is Saddam Hussein.\n  Mr. President, I am a little disturbed about reports over the weekend \nquoting high-ranking administration officials and congressional leaders \nsaying such things as: We may have to face the reality that we will not \nget U.N. inspection teams back into Iraq; any military action would be \nto just slow Saddam Hussein down and we would have to keep going back \nto bomb him again and again every so many months and years; and our \nallies' support of us in Iraq may be tied to our future commitment to \nNATO.\n  These are disconcerting remarks. We owe it to our country and the men \nand\n\n[[Page S467]]\n\nwomen in uniform who will be called upon to fight a war, if that \ndecision is made, to do better than just bomb Saddam Hussein. First of \nall, the military option alone will not work if we truly want a final \nresolution of this problem. Some form of immediate military action may \nwell be required as part of an overall long-term solution but only a \npart, only a part of a long-term solution.\n  Former Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Reagan administration, \nRichard Perle, in a Washington Post op-ed piece yesterday, listed a \nseries of political actions that could be taken along with any military \nactions in Iraq. I believe Secretary Perle's analysis and general \nrecommendations should be taken seriously and I ask unanimous consent \nthat his article be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HAGEL. I find that I am asking myself the unescapable question--\nare we preparing to send our young men and women to war because we just \nall expect that this is the thing to do because we don't know what else \nto do?\n  That is not good enough. There is something very surreal about all \nthe war talk, and war preparation being played out in this matter of \nfact tone on international TV with every talk show panelist in the \nworld presenting his or her theories and options on war in Iraq--when \nmost all of them have never been to war, prepared for war or understand \nthe first thing about the horrors of war.\n  Our national defense is the guarantor of our foreign policy. I don't \nknow if we have a long term policy on Iraq other than maintaining the \nU.N. sanctions and enforcing the resolutions, but that's not a foreign \npolicy. If we are to commit America to war, it should be to enforce our \nforeign policy--just going to war alone is not enough. We must have an \noverall long term policy to enforce. The reason for war must be \nconnected to more than just short-term sanctions enforcement.\n  It is my opinion that if we exercise any military option it must be \naccompanied by and attached to creative geopolitical elements of a \ncomprehensive policy toward Iraq--geopolitical elements such as \nSecretary Perle listed yesterday. In the long run, how do we \nrealistically get rid of Saddam Hussein? That's the policy question we \nshould have been focused on over the last seven years. Sending America \nto war with one ally is no policy. We can do better. We must do better.\n  Nations lead from their strength of purpose, self confidence, and \ncharacter. As President Teddy Roosevelt once said, ``The one \nindispensable, requisite for both an individual and a nation is \ncharacter.'' Allies will follow us if they trust our word and our \npolicy. Bullying allies into submission for agreement is not \nleadership.\n  With regard to the immediate situation in Iraq we need to remain \nfocused on the original objective--the full compliance by Saddam \nHussein with U.N. Resolution 687. We should not act out of frustration \nor impatience. We have to stay focused on the objective and not \noverstate--not overstate expectations to the American people or the \nworld.\n  For the mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and loved ones of \nour men and women in the Gulf--we must proceed with clear eyed realism, \nnot with emotionalism, not with revenge.\n  There are no good options. Saddam Hussein is intent on building the \nmost vile weapons in the history of man, weapons outlawed by nearly all \nthe countries of the world, and is openly defying the will of the \nglobal community. He cannot go unchallenged.\n  Should diplomatic efforts fail, we will be forced to take additional \naction to force Saddam Hussein to comply with the unanimous mandate of \nthe U.N. Security Council. As long as this action meets a clear \nimmediate objective, and the level of force is commensurate with that \nobjective, the American people will come together and be unified behind \nthe action taken.\n  In the future, the American people and the Congress must have a more \nsolid basis for our support. We cannot continue to ricochet from crisis \nto crisis and call that foreign policy. Our nation must develop a long \nterm, coherent policy not only toward Iraq and Saddam Hussein, but \ntoward the entire Middle East. How are we prepared to deal with Iran? \nHow do we plan to help make meaningful and lasting progress in the \nMiddle East peace process? What are our foreign policy objectives with \nregard to North Korea, China, Bosnia, Europe, Russia, Asia, and other \nareas of the world? These policies must be clearly stated and clearly \nunderstood by both our allies and our adversaries.\n  As I said in the beginning, these are serious times. These are \ndifficult times. There are no easy answers, only tough challenges and \ntough questions. They require serious solutions to serious questions \nfrom serious people. America is up to the task.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                            February 9, 1998\n\n          This Time, Help Iraqis to Get Rid of Saddam's Regime\n\n                (By Richard Perle; The Washington Post)\n\n       The immediate provocation is Saddam Hussein's defiant \n     attachment to weapons of mass destruction and his \n     interference with UN inspectors charged with finding and \n     eliminating them. Given the prospect of chemical and \n     biological weapons in his murderous hands, military action is \n     long overdue.\n       But the more fundamental threat is Saddam Hussein himself. \n     As long as he remains in power, it is idle to believe that \n     this threat can be contained.\n       That is why even a massive bombing campaign will fail--\n     unless it is part of an overall strategy to destroy his \n     regime by helping the nascent democratic opposition to \n     transform itself into Iraq's new government.\n       America, alone if necessary, should encourage, recognize, \n     help finance, arm and protect with airpower a provisional \n     government broadly representative of all the people of Iraq.\n       Such a program would not be easy. But it has a better \n     chance and is a worthier contender than yet another failed \n     effort to organize an anti-Saddam Hussein conspiracy among \n     retired Iraqi generals, or another round of inconclusive air \n     strikes.\n       There is no repeat, no--chance that even a carefully \n     conceived and well-executed bombing campaign would eliminate \n     the arsenal of chemical and biological weapons (and the \n     capacity to make more of them) that Saddam has hidden away.\n       There is a real danger that an inadequate bombing campaign, \n     especially if it appeared decisive, would be quickly followed \n     by calls from other nations to lift the UN sanctions on the \n     grounds that the danger was over. This would be the ultimate \n     example of winning the battle and losing the war.\n       A serious Western policy toward Iraq would be aimed at the \n     destruction of Saddam's regime through a combination of \n     military and political measures--with the political measures \n     every bit as important as the military ones.\n       Chief among these would be open support for the Iraqi \n     National Congress, an umbrella opposition group in which all \n     elements of Iraqi society are represented.\n       To be effective, support for the Iraqi opposition should be \n     comprehensive: support given them in the past has been \n     hopelessly inadequate. In fact, help for the Iraqi \n     opposition, administered in an inept, halfhearted and \n     ineffective way by the CIA, has been the political equivalent \n     of the insubstantial, pinprick air strikes conducted against \n     targets in Iraq in recent years.\n       A serious political program would entail five elements:\n       Washington should, first, recognize the democratic \n     opposition as the legitimate, provisional government and \n     support its claim to Iraq's seat at the United Nations.\n       It should begin to disburse to the provisional government \n     some of the billions of Iraqi assets frozen after the Kuwait \n     invasion.\n       It should lift the sanctions on the territory (now \n     principally in the north but likely to spread) not under \n     Saddam Hussein's control. This would catapult these areas \n     into significant economic growth and attract defectors from \n     within Iraq. Much of Iraq's oil lies in areas that Saddam \n     cannot now control or over which he would quickly lose \n     control if an opposition government were established there.\n       It should assist the opposition in taking its message to \n     the Iraqi people by making radio and television transmitters \n     available to them.\n       It must be prepared to give logistical support and military \n     equipment to the opposition and to use airpower to defend it \n     in the territory it controls.\n       This is what should have been done in August 1996 when \n     Saddam's troops and secret police moved into northern Iraq \n     and murdered hundreds of supporters of the opposition Iraqi \n     National Congress. Shamefully, America stood by while people \n     it had supported were lined up and summarily executed.\n       Skeptics will argue that the Iraqi National Congress is too \n     frail a reed on which to base a strategy for eliminating \n     Saddam. It is indeed a small corps (of perhaps a few \n     thousand); it would need to rally significant popular \n     support. But it has been steadfast in its principled \n     opposition to Saddam, consistent in its democratic ambitions, \n     and, when given the chance, able to establish itself in a \n     significant area of Iraqi territory.\n\n[[Page S468]]\n\n       It has earned American support by the sacrifices of its \n     members. And with American backing it has a chance.\n       It would be neither wise nor necessary to send ground \n     forces into Iraqi when patriotic Iraqis are willing to fight \n     to liberate their own country.\n       I would not want to be in Saddam's tanks in the narrow \n     defiles of northern Iraq, or in parts of the south, when U.S. \n     airpower commands the skies.\n       This strategy aims at eliciting a full-blown insurrection, \n     taking off from territory Saddam does not control and \n     spreading as his opponents find security and opportunity in \n     joining with others who wish to liberate Iraq.\n       There can be no guarantee that it will work. But what is \n     guaranteed not to work is a quick-fix air campaign that \n     leaves him in power.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking my colleague from \nNebraska for the eloquent remarks that he just made, to say that I \ntotally agree with his analysis of the situation.

Mr. President, I think it is time for some of us in the \nCongress, particularly some of us who have spent a lifetime in the \njudicial process, to comment upon what has been occurring in the last \nfew days with respect to the special counsel investigating the matter \nof the President and various affairs in which the President may or may \nnot have been involved.\n  This is a most serious matter and I think the time has come for \npeople who believe in the judicial process, who believe in the rule of \nlaw, and who believe ultimately in our justice system in this country, \nto speak out against those who are deliberately attempting to undermine \nthat process. We have something going on today which runs counter to \nthe entire history of the United States of America, a country which is \nbased upon the rule of law, which has established a three-branch \nGovernment in which each branch respects the other and in which we \nsupport each other because we understand that an attack on one of these \nbranches is, in effect, an attack on the entire Government.\n  We have established certain processes for attempting to deal with \nwrongdoing in our country. One of them is the process of investigating \npotential crimes in high places through the independent counsel \nstatute, a statute that has not been without controversy in the past \nbut which has been used to probe potential conflicts of interest and \ncriminal behavior in each of the last administrations, many times \nresulting in indictments or prosecution.\n  I will get back to the point in a moment, but some of us have tried \nto improve the way that statute works. But the way to do that is to do \nit in the legislative process with calm and deliberate debate, to \nensure that justice in the end is always done.\n  What we have today, instead of an effort to look at the independent \ncounsel statute to see where it might need to be modified to operate \nmore appropriately, we have the same kind of tactic being employed by \nthe highest levels of the White House that is employed in typical \nmurder or rape or assault cases where the person charged attempts to \ndefend himself by attacking the prosecution, by attacking the corrupt \npolice, or by attacking the victim's credibility and reputation. That \nis what is happening today by key defenders of the President, including \nthe President's lawyer.\n  Rather than coming out with the President's version of the facts--and \nhe alone knows what the facts are in their entirety, with respect to \nthe matters that have been recently carried in the press, the \nadministration--rather, his lawyers, have chosen to tell him to keep \nquiet while they attack the judicial process that is underway to try to \ndetermine the facts and to bring to justice whoever needs to be brought \nto justice. The most recent deliberate attempt here is to specifically \nattack the reputation and credibility and actions of the Special \nCounsel, Judge Kenneth Starr. Judge Starr cannot defend himself because \nhe is under orders not to talk about what he is doing. The very thing \nthat the President's lawyers accuse him of doing, of talking too much, \nhe cannot, and he is not. Someone has to stand up and say the process, \nthe judicial process, and the people who are doing their best to make \nthat process work, need to be defended.\n  I rise today to say it is time to stop attacking Judge Starr publicly \nand in the media. If you have a beef with him, go to his supervisor, in \nthis case Attorney General Reno, or to the judges who can determine \nwhether or not there is any improper activity within his office. But \ndon't use as a defense in the case an attack broadly upon the \nprosecutor and his individual reputation and credibility. Because he \ncannot defend himself.\n  I said I had a background in law. I practiced law for 20 years, \nincluding practice in the United States Supreme Court. One of my law \npartners was a former Solicitor General of the United States, someone \nwho, as a matter of fact, was well acquainted with Judge Kenneth Starr, \nwho also was a Solicitor General of the United States. That is the \nhighest position that a lawyer can achieve in this country with the \nexception of being appointed to the bench or being the Attorney General \nof the United States. He is the Government's lawyer in the Supreme \nCourt. That is what Kenneth Starr was. Then he himself was elevated to \nthe bench.\n  He has had a solid reputation all his life as a moderate, \nintelligent, capable and fair person. But now, because he is \ninvestigating the President, the President's own lawyer and his attack \ndogs in the media programs have decided to go after the reputation of \nthis man who, as I said, can't defend himself. Those of us who have \nspent our careers in the law understand that you cannot undermine the \nlaw repeatedly and expect to end up having justice in this country. \nThat is why lawyers are taught to respect the judiciary and not to \nattack it directly. If you have a complaint, as I said, you go into \ncourt and try to prove your case. If you can, fine. But if you can't, \nthen you should not be talking about it in public.\n  What has been happening recently? The President's lawyer, David \nKendall, and people like Paul Begala, connected to the administration, \nhave accused Independent Counsel Judge Starr of leaks. One of the \nthings that was done recently is the filing of a letter by David \nKendall, released to the public on Friday, which makes several bold \nallegations. Let me repeat what some of them are. He says the leaking \nof the past few weeks is ``intolerably unfair.'' He continues, ``These \nleaks make a mockery of the traditional rules of grand jury secrecy.'' \nAnd who does he attribute the leaks to? He says Mr. Starr's office is \n``out of control. . . . The leaking by [Mr. Starr's office] has reached \nan intolerable point.''\n  These are unfair and unfounded accusations and somebody needs to \nrespond to them. As I said, Kenneth Starr is very limited in what he \ncan say publicly. He did respond in a letter to attorney Kendall and \nwhat he said in that letter, essentially is as follows. He said, first, \nand I am quoting from his letter to Mr. Kendall:\n\n       First, you elevate mere suspicion to specific accusation \n     without any facts other than the press's often misleading \n     attribution of sources.\n\n  I would make the point that is precisely what administration \nspokesmen are asking us to be careful about doing, and why personally I \nhave absolutely refrained from responding to press inquiries about \nwhether I believe these charges or do not believe them or what might \nhave happened. Because I don't know. All we have is what has been \nreported in the media and I cannot judge whether that is true or not, \nand I should not express it publicly before the process is complete. \nThe administration has been urging us to withhold our opinions until we \ndo know. Well, I have been abiding by their admonishment, but they have \nnot been doing it with respect to Ken Starr. As he says, they have \n``elevated mere suspicion to specific accusation without any facts,'' \nother than what has been reported in the media.\n\n\n[[Page S469]]\n\n\n       Second, [Kenneth Starr says] the timing of your letter--\n     arriving in the midst of what appears to be an orchestrated \n     plan to deflect and distract this investigation--undermines \n     your expression of outrage.\n\n  Certainly I think anyone would have to agree with that, given the \nfact that it is now an acknowledged fact that the administration has \nbeen orchestrating a campaign to discredit Ken Starr. I refer you to \nthe New York Times newspaper today, Headline, ``President's Aides \nExpand Offensive to Counter Starr. Prosecutors Denounced As Corrupt and \nAccused of Leading a Witch Hunt.'' Somebody has to defend this process.\n  The third thing that Mr. Starr said in his letter in response to Mr. \nKendall was:\n\n       [W]e are aware that as of several days ago, the President's \n     defense attorneys had most if not all of the material \n     information (whether true or not) set forth in [Friday's] New \n     York Times article.\n\n  This had to do with the leaks. In other words, what Judge Starr was \nsaying is that the President's own lawyers had talked to the people who \nhad testified in the grand jury, at least those people who were \nconnected in any way with the administration, and knew what had been \nsaid in the grand jury. The implication, of course, is that it is the \nWhite House and its lawyers themselves who could be just as likely the \nleakers as anyone in the special prosecutors office. When a witness \ntestifies before the grand jury the witness is not constrained as to \nwhat he or she can say thereafter. And you have seen some witnesses go \nin, testify, and they come out and talk to the press about what they \nsaid. So these leaks could be coming from all number of people, from \nthe witnesses themselves to the very people in the White House and the \nWhite House lawyers' group who are complaining about the leaks today.\n  In fact, I would suggest it is most unlikely that the source was \nJudge Starr's office.\n  He continues:\n\n       In my service as independent counsel, particularly with \n     regard to secrecy of the grand jury, I have insisted on a \n     high commitment to professional conduct. I have expressed \n     this commitment to you repeatedly. From the beginning, I made \n     the prohibition of leaks a principal priority of the office. \n     It is a firing offense, as well as one that leads to criminal \n     prosecution. In the case of each allegation of improper \n     disclosure, we have thoroughly investigated the facts and \n     reminded the staff that leaks are intolerable.\n\n  Then Mr. Starr makes clear he has no reason to suspect anyone in his \noffice of leaks after those investigations by saying:\n\n       I have no factual basis, as you likewise do not have, even \n     to suspect anyone at this juncture. You do an extreme \n     disservice to these men and women and to the legal profession \n     and the public by your unsupported charges.\n\n  Mr. President, I agree with Judge Starr that this does a disservice, \nboth to the people who are doing their best to uphold the laws of the \nUnited States and to his effort generally to get at the truth here. He \nis supervised by the Attorney General of the United States, and he is \nsupervised by a three-judge court, the members of which have been \nappointed by Presidents Johnson, Nixon and Reagan. If there is any \nwrongdoing, they can see to it that it is stopped and the appropriate \npeople punished in whatever way is appropriate. But instead, the White \nHouse has chosen to make this a media campaign rather than to focus on \nhow any leaks might be stopped within the judicial process.\n  As a matter of fact, we know, because recently Lucianne Goldberg, one \nof the people who had access to the tapes, disclosed the fact that she \nherself had leaked a lot of this information. She had the tapes from \nLinda Tripp, which were given then to the special prosecutor. So it \ndoes not follow that simply because leaks occurred that it had to come \nfrom the special prosecutor's office. Indeed, she herself said, ``I \ntold people about this. It wasn't Kenneth Starr.''\n  So why then do we have this concerted effort on the part of the \nPresident's own lawyer to discredit Judge Starr and his investigation? \nThe reason ought to be obvious. Do anything you can to undermine the \nprosecution in order to cast discredit upon its efforts so that if \nanything ever comes of the independent counsel's investigation and the \nPresident actually has evidence presented against him in this matter, \nit will be previously discredited information.\n  As I said, I think it is time for those of us who have some respect \nfor the judicial process and for this individual himself, Judge Kenneth \nStarr, to make it clear to the American people that the judicial \nprocess must be respected, must be supported and must be upheld if we \nare to ensure that justice prevails in this country and that it ought \nto discredit the people who are attacking that system if the way in \nwhich they do it is so clearly designed to affect public opinion, as it \nappears to have been done in this case, rather than to get at the \nfacts.\n  As I said, there is a process available, if you have evidence that \nsomeone in the prosecutor's office has engaged in conduct, to take that \nto the appropriate authorities, make your case and have them act in the \nappropriate, responsive fashion. It is not at all certain that that is \nwhat the administration is attempting to do in this case.\n  Let me conclude with this point, Mr. President. I think all of us in \nthe Senate are impressed with the awesome responsibility that we have \nunder the Constitution to withhold our own independent judgment because \nof the fact that at least, theoretically, there is a potential for an \nimpeachment proceeding in any case involving accusations of the type \nthat have been made in this case.\n  As I said, I have withheld my judgment, because I have no idea \nwhether these things are true or not, and I am not going to indicate \nwhether I think they are true or not. In fact, I am going to wait \nuntil, in effect, the information is presented to us, if it ever is. I \nthink that others need to make that same commitment. Let's see how the \nfacts come out here.\n  The same thing should be done with respect to Judge Starr. When \npeople say he hasn't produced very much, his investigation has run \namok, he is leaking, he can't defend himself. We don't know whether any \nof those things are true, and he is owed the same sense of justice that \nthe President and anyone else accused is owed; namely, the opportunity \nto present the facts when the process provides that opportunity.\n  In due time, Judge Starr will be able to present those facts. At that \ntime, we will know precisely what he has. Until then, I think it is \nincumbent upon all responsible people in this process to treat the \nindependent counsel as they would treat any other person involved in \nlaw enforcement or the judicial process, with the respect and the \ndignity that the office carries.\n  While I appreciate the fact that defense lawyers will sometimes stoop \nto any tactic to get their client off, it demeans the Office of the \nPresidency in this case for his lawyers to use the same kind of tactics \nthat the lowest kind of defense lawyers would use in defending a party \nwho is probably guilty of a heinous crime when there is no other \ndefense than to attack the victim's credibility or to attack the \nprosecutor.\n  That demeans the Office of the Presidency. It is time for this \nadministration to treat the prosecutor with the same respect that they \nare demanding to be treated. I think that those of us who believe in \nour rule of law and in the system of justice in this country need to \nstand up and speak out and make that point.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to speak to this \nmatter this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia is recognized to speak for up to 20 minutes. The Senator \nfrom West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.

I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Gramm of Texas \nbe recognized for not to exceed 10 minutes following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, only 45 session days remain through May 1, \nthe deadline date, beyond which every State will be prohibited by law \nfrom obligating new Federal highway or transit funds. This past \nThursday, we heard the argument that there is no reason for the Senate \nto rush to the highway bill, because, it was said, the House does not \nplan to act on the highway bill until next month or later.\n\n[[Page S470]]\n\n  Well, Mr. President, I have served in the Congress now going on 46 \nyears. I was 6 years in the House, and this is my 40th year in the \nSenate. I have served both as majority leader and minority leader, as \nwell as majority whip and secretary of the Democratic conference. I \nrespectfully suggest that the Senate must never let itself be governed \nby the scheduling preferences of the other body, especially on \nlegislation as important and as urgent as is the highway bill.\n  I have served in the other body, and so have several other Senators, \nincluding the distinguished Senator, Mr. Pat Roberts, who now presides \nover the Senate with a degree of efficiency and poise and dignity and \nskill, so rare as a day in June. But all other Senators know, as I do, \nthat the House of Representatives is a very different place with very \ndifferent rules.\n  When the House of Representatives takes up the highway bill, the \nHouse Rules Committee will report out a rule that will probably limit \nthe number of amendments that will be allowed to be offered and mandate \nlimitations under which those amendments can be debated. The House can \nwell take up a highway bill and pass it within one day or two days or \nthree days. But who here thinks that the Senate will be able to take up \nand pass the highway bill in two or three days?\n  When the Senate takes up the highway bill, Senators, as always, will \nhave the right under the Senate rules, to offer amendments and to have \nthose amendments debated. It will probably take 2 or 3 weeks for the \nSenate to pass an ISTEA bill. Given all of the competing and \ncontentious amendments that the Senate will likely debate on ISTEA, we \nshould recognize the fact that it will probably take two or three weeks \nfor the Senate to pass an ISTEA bill. One does not have to look further \nback in history than the last time that the Congress authorized our \nsurface transportation programs. Back in 1991, I believe it was, the \nSenate debated the ISTEA legislation for the better part of 3 weeks--\nnot 3 days, but 3 weeks. The other body, however, was able to call up \nand dispense with their version of the ISTEA legislation in two days! \nThe Senate took almost 3 weeks; the House took 2 days. What reason do \nwe have to think that, this time, things will be different?\n\n  I believe that we have an obligation to try to get a complete, \ncomprehensive, six-year highway authorization bill to the President's \ndesk by or before May 1. We owe that to our Governors, our mayors, our \nhighway engineers, our highway departments throughout the country, and \nto our constituents who drive on the Nation's highways every day. If we \nhave any hope of getting a highway bill to the President by or before \nMay 1, the Senate needs to begin now.\n  In November of last year when we took up the short-term highway \nauthorization bill, we were told that it was the intent for the Senate \nto take up ISTEA and address it early in this year in order to put \npressure on the House and also so that when the House acted, we, in the \nSenate, would be ready for conference with the House. Now, however, it \nseems that the pressure is not on the House, but on the Senate. The \nwind has shifted, and we are now on a course that puts pressure on the \nSenate--pressure from the Governors of our States, pressure from our \ntransportation departments throughout the country, pressure from our \ntransit providers--all of whom will be forbidden by law from obligating \nany federal funds after May 1. We are also receiving pressure from our \ncitizens who must endure hazardous driving conditions. Why are we \nwaiting, Mr. President?\n  As I stated last week, the President's budget proposes an absolute \nfreeze on highway spending for the next five years. The President, the \nfirst time he ran for the office, campaigned strongly on a platform of \ninvesting in the Nation's infrastructure. We don't hear that anymore. \nThe President is proposing a freeze on spending while the balances in \nthe highway trust fund skyrocket. Meanwhile, the 6-year highway bill, \nas reported by the Environment and Public Works Committee, will also \nallow unspent balances of the highway trust fund to pile up year after \nyear after year, while the Nation's highway needs go wanting year after \nyear after year. Where else, then, but on a highway authorization bill, \ncan the Senate come forward to make an affirmative statement that the \nexpectations for spending on highways over the next six years will go \nwell beyond the freeze levels proposed by the President?\n  I recognize that there will be disagreements among Senators as to how \nincreased authorization levels for highways can and should be financed. \nSenator Gramm, one of the principal cosponsors of my amendment, has \nstated that he is categorically opposed to moving the caps in order to \nboost spending for highways. We will have that debate through the \nregular budget and Appropriations process. Mr. President, one thing I \nam sure of, if we do not get a 6-year ISTEA bill to the floor, and make \na statement by the full Senate that we do not expect to allow the \nunspent balances of highway trust fund to pile up year after year, as \nthe President proposed and as the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee in its reported bill proposes, highways will be nowhere in \nthe upcoming budget debate. We will be debating direct Federal \nexpenditures for child care and other social welfare programs that are \nbeing pushed by the administration, while the needs of our Nation's \ninfrastructure will be left out, just as they were left out of the \nPresident's budget.\n  Well, let me make one thing preeminently clear. The Byrd-Gramm-Baucus \nshould be called up so that those unspent highway balances, at least to \nthe tune of $31 billion, can be authorized to be spent. We will not \nspend them in the amendment. We only authorize them to be spent. We \nwill not be debating the budget bill. It is the highway bill I am \ntalking about.\n  In last week's remarks on the floor about the highway bill, reference \nwas made to the ``Highways First'' crowd. Well, Mr. President, I plead \nguilty as charged. I make no apologies for standing on this floor and \nsaying we have been remiss in our national investment in surface \ntransportation. At a time when the ISTEA authorization has expired, and \nit did expire on last September 30; at a time when the country is just \nlimping along--limping along--on a stopgap highway authorization bill; \nat a time when the construction season is looming just--just--a few \nweeks away; at a time when Governors and mayors and highway departments \nthroughout the country need to know just what Federal resources they \ncan count on for this year's budget as well as for long-term highway \nconstruction plans; at a time when we should be discussing a long-term, \n6-year highway authorization bill just as the commitment was made to \nthe Senate and to the country that we would be discussing a long-term, \n6-year ISTEA bill; yes, yes, I believe that first things should come \nfirst and that the 6-year highway bill is the first thing that the \nSenate should be debating, and last November we were told just that. \nSo, yes, I am one of the ``Highways First'' crowd. Count me in. Count \nme in.\n  When 42,000 people are dying on the highways of this country every \nyear, and when we are told by the U.S. Department of Transportation \nthat 30 percent of those highway deaths are caused by outdated safety \nfeatures, poor pavement quality, substandard road and bridge designs, \nand other bad road conditions, yes, I am one of the ``Highways First'' \ncrowd. Count me in!\n  What could be more fundamental to our national prosperity, and to the \nquality of our daily lives, than adequate, safe highways? Major \nhighways carry nearly 80 percent of U.S. interstate commercial traffic, \nand, roughly, 80 percent of intercity passenger and tourist traffic--80 \npercent. When it comes to the daily lives and the daily working \nconditions of our constituents, Americans take more than 90 percent of \nall their work trips in cars or trucks.\n  And we hear much from the administration as to how this Nation should \nbetter meet our child care needs, and that is quite appropriate. \nTherefore, I make no apology for taking the floor to point out how the \nfamily lives of millions of Americans would be improved if working \nparents could spend more time at home with their children rather than \nsit in ever-worsening traffic jams. We hear so much talk about \nprotecting our children; and yet, getting them to school to be \neducated, and to hospitals and to clinics to receive healthcare can't \nbe done with efficiency without safe, modern highways.\n\n[[Page S471]]\n\n  Everyone knows that. Twenty-two million people in Appalachia know it. \nTwenty-two million people in Appalachia know the difficulties in \ngetting to work, in getting to school, in getting to hospitals, in \ngetting to child care clinics, in getting to church, and in getting \nback home--22 million people in Appalachia.\n  Highways first? You bet, I believe in highways first as of now under \nthe circumstances that I have outlined. I believe in highways first. \nFixing potholes and pavement may not be glitzy and may not be sexy, but \nattending to our Nation's transportation system is a basic, fundamental \nneed. It is job one, because so much of life in the United States \nabsolutely depends on our ability to get people and goods from one \nplace to another.\n  Francis Bacon, who went to the tower because he was found guilty--and \nhe admitted it--of accepting bribes, said, ``There be three things that \nmake a nation great and prosperous: A fertile soil, busy workshops, and \neasy conveyance of men and goods from place to place.''\n  Well, it was said on this floor last week that two of the few places \nwhere the Government should be involved in spending money were in the \nfield of national defense and in the field of building infrastructure \nbecause people cannot do these things by themselves, it was said. How \ntrue. The Government had to do its part, it was said last week on the \nfloor of this Senate. Well, the unfortunate fact is that the Government \nhas not done its part. The record is replete with evidence that we have \nnot done as good a job as we should have done in maintaining our \nhighway infrastructure. We are letting our National Highway System fall \nmore and more into disrepair. And, as a result, the cost of bringing \nour highways up to an adequate and safe condition grows by billions of \ndollars every year.\n  Mr. President, it was President Ronald Reagan, who, in January 1983, \nsaid, ``Common sense''--``common sense''--perhaps one of the most \nuncommon things that would be found in this city --``Common sense tells \nus that it will cost a lot less to keep the [national highway] system \nwe have in good repair, than to let it disintegrate and have to start \nover from scratch. Clearly''--this is former President Reagan talking; \nI am quoting him--``Clearly, this program is an investment in tomorrow \nthat we must make today.'' How true.\n  Ronald Reagan was right. We must make that investment today. The \ncommitment that the highway bill would be brought up at the beginning \nof this session should be kept, a 6-year ISTEA bill should be made the \npending business of the Senate, and it should be done right today or \nsoon, very soon. The highway needs grow worse day by day; the time \ngrows shorter day by day; and I hope that the Governors and mayors and \nhighway departments throughout this country--and I am speaking to you \nout there--I hope that the Governors and mayors and highway departments \nthroughout this country will join in urging the Senate leadership to \nkeep its commitment, so that we can debate this highway bill--it is \nnumber one on the Nation's business list.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has approximately 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that I may reserve that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from West \nVirginia. In fact, I want to say to him what a great honor it is for me \nto work with him on this amendment. He made a very strong case just a \nmoment ago about building highways, but I believe the case is stronger \nyet because there is one factor that I want to make sure that everybody \nunderstands, that at least in the portion of Senator Byrd's statement \nthat I heard he did not drive home, in my opinion. And that is, it is \nnot just a debate about highways versus other things; it is a debate \nabout basic honesty in Government because, you see, we collect taxes \nspecifically for the purpose of building roads.\n  We do not collect taxes for the purpose of providing child care. We \ndo not collect taxes specifically earmarked for welfare. We do not \ncollect taxes that are dedicated by their source to the United Nations \nor to foreign aid. But we do collect taxes that are dedicated to \nhighway construction, at least in terms of what Americans believe the \npolicy of Government is and should be.\n  If you go to the filling station this afternoon, and you pull up in \nyour car or truck and you get out and you are pumping gas, while you \nare standing there, let me urge people to read what it says on the \ngasoline pump. Basically, what it says on the gasoline pump is, there \nis good news and bad news. The bad news is that about a third of the \ncost of a gallon of gasoline in America today is taxes. The good news \nis, as it says right on the pump, those taxes are dedicated to building \nthe very roads that you are going to burn up this gasoline riding \naround on. So it is a user fee. It is a fee you pay in buying gasoline \nto build the roads that you are going to use.\n  The only problem with that bad news-good news story is the good news \nis not true. The good news is not true because the Federal Government, \nbeginning in about 1990, started diverting substantial quantities of \nfunds collected on gasoline taxes to other uses. Some of it occurred by \njust letting surpluses build up in the highway trust fund, which under \na unified budget in essence meant you could spend more money on other \nthings in Government. Some of the problem resulted in 1993, when, for \nthe first time in American history, we adopted a 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax \non gasoline that went to general revenue and not to the highway trust \nfund.\n  Senator Byrd, I, and others have solved that problem in the tax bill \nby dedicating that 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline to the highway \ntrust fund where it belongs. So let me turn to this chart and really \nexplain how modest the Byrd-Gramm-Warner-Baucus amendment is, how \nmodest it is in terms of what we are asking. In fact, the American \npeople would never believe that we are doing enough.\n  But if you look at this chart, you see where we are. As of today, we \nhave $23.7 billion of surpluses in the highway trust fund. This is \nmoney that we have collected on gasoline taxes that we put into the \nhighway trust fund to spend on roads, but money that has not been spent \non roads. In reality, that money, through our unified budget, in the \ntotal level of spending we could have by running this surplus in the \ntrust fund, that let Government spend that money on thousands of other \nthings.\n  We were successful, as I noted earlier--well, last year; that went \ninto effect on January 1--of being sure that every cent of gasoline \ntaxes, just as the gasoline pump says, goes into the highway trust \nfund.\n  Now, under the bill that will be before us when we get an opportunity \nto consider it, the surplus in the highway trust fund, if my amendment \nwith Senator Byrd was not adopted, would grow from $23.7 billion to $90 \nbillion. In other words, over the 6 years that highway bill would be in \neffect, we would be collecting, in total, looking at all we have \nalready done plus what would occur during that period, $90 billion that \nwe are telling the American people that we were spending on highways \nthat in reality would not be spent on highways and in reality would be \nspent on something else.\n  Here is what Senator Byrd and I are saying: You have already spent \nthis $23.7 billion, and we are not asking for it back; in fact, we are \nsaying that we are going to let the surplus grow under our amendment \nfrom $23.7 billion that should have been spent on roads to $39 billion, \nand that that money will be available, therefore, for general budget \nuses.\n  What we are saying is that this 4.3-cent tax on gasoline, a total of \n$51 billion in spending authority, we want it spent on roads. I have \nlikened this--and I am sure some of my colleagues don't like the \nanalogy, but I think it fits perfectly--I have likened our opponents to \ncattle rustlers. What they have been doing, as you can see from this \nchart, they have been rustling our cattle. They have been taking money \nthat has been collected in taxes on gasoline, put into the highway \ntrust fund to spend on roads, and they have been spending it on other \nthings. In any\n\n[[Page S472]]\n\nother business except government you might actually go to jail for \ndoing something like that.\n  In fact, Senator Byrd reminded one of our opponents of the story in \nthe Bible of Ananias in the book of Acts. In the young church, Ananias \nmakes a big deal about selling all his property and giving it to the \nchurch, but he cheats. The Lord thought so little of that activity that \nhe struck him dead and struck his wife dead.\n  Obviously, we are not talking about striking anybody dead. All we are \ntalking about is the following: We are saying, keep the $23.7 billion. \nIn fact, we are going to let it build up to $39 billion. Just let us \nspend the 4.3-cent tax on gasoline on highways.\n  Their response is, ``Well, you know, we already got the $23.7 billion \nand we were expecting not only $39 billion but $90 billion, and if we \ndon't get to spend that money on all these other programs, on \neverything other than highways, we are going to lose the ability to \nspend that money.''\n  Well, it reminds me of a cattle rustler who has been stealing Senator \nByrd's cattle and my cattle. We call the sheriff out. We confront the \nguy, and we say, ``You stole these cattle, and we are letting you keep \non stealing cattle, but you have to limit the number of stealing. You \ncan't steal any cattle out of this pasture.'' Their response is not, \n``Thank you for not hanging me, thank you for letting me continue to do \nwhat I have been doing''; their response is, ``Where are we going to \nget this extra beef?''\n  That is not our problem. That is their problem. They shouldn't have \nbeen spending this money out of the highway trust fund to begin with.\n  Now, let me turn to several points I want to make. First of all, if \nwe don't pass this amendment, we are going to be locked into this \nhighway bill for the next 6 years with mounting infrastructure needs \nall over the country and with tens of billions of dollars collected in \ngasoline taxes that will be spent on something else.\n  If the American people had a vote on our amendment of whether to \nrequire that gasoline taxes that are collected for the purpose of \nbuilding roads be spent on roads and only on roads, I can't imagine \nthat many people would oppose this provision. But we are only going to \nhave one chance in the next 6 years to do something about it, and that \nis on the highway bill.\n  Now, those who oppose our amendment, those who want to spend that $90 \nbillion on everything but roads say, ``Don't bring up the highway bill \nnow, let us deal with the budget first.'' Now, they are trying to play \non the confusion. Senator Byrd and I have spoken many times, and we \nwill speak many more times until this is settled and until we have \nprevailed on this issue. But they are trying to play on the confusion. \nThey are trying to act as if the proposal the President has made about \nexpanding child care or the President has made about building schools \nor hiring teachers or any of the literally hundreds of programs he has \nproposed to increase spending, $130 billion worth of spending, they act \nas if somehow that is equivalent to what we are talking about. It is in \nno way equivalent to what we are talking about. The President is \ntalking about increasing the total level of spending. We are talking \nabout debating how to spend the money that is currently collected.\n  We have a gasoline tax that is dedicated to building highways, and \nall we are saying is this is not a budget issue. This is an issue of \nhonesty in Government and highway construction. All we are asking is \nthat the money collected in gasoline taxes be spent on highways. In \nterms of setting spending levels, that is something we ought to do in \nthe budget and decide what the total level of spending next year is \ngoing to be. Then any individual Senator--and obviously the majority--\nwill make a determination as to what they want to do. But this is not a \nbudget issue. This is a highway issue and it has to do with spending \nmoney for the purpose that money is collected. So, we don't want this \nto be commingled with the budget. There is no equivalent of what we are \nasking we do here, which is basically a truth-in-Government provision \nwhere you collect money on gasoline taxes, you tell people it is going \nto highways, but you don't do it. We want to fix that. There is no \nequivalent between that and a proposal to raise the total level of \nspending in the Federal budget. We don't believe the two should be \ncommingled.\n\n  Let me turn very briefly to two other issues that a big deal has been \nmade out of, and all of our colleagues will hear about it. I want to be \nsure people understand it. I want to start with the Appalachian \nprogram. That program started in 1965. It has been part of every \nhighway bill since 1965. The President's highway bill, like ours, \ndivides money into two parts, the 90 percent that goes directly to the \nStates, the 10 percent that is spent by the Secretary. Under the \nPresident's budget, 1.6 percent of the highway bill is dedicated to the \n13 States that make up Appalachia as part of a program that was \nauthorized in 1965.\n  Now, those who oppose our amendment say their amendment provides \nfunds for those 13 States under a program that is now over 30 years \nold. But what they don't tell you is the rest of the story, and that is \nwe provide a lower percentage of the money going to those 13 States out \nof the Secretary's discretionary funds than does the President. The \nPresident provides 1.6 percent to those 13 States; we provide 1.4 \npercent to those 13 States.\n  Finally, on that issue, the President's bill, like the bill before \nthe Senate, has this strange provision that says that if we don't have \nenough money in the trust fund and we have a shortage of money, that we \ncut the States first. Senator Byrd and I changed that in our amendment. \nWe treat the Secretary's funds equivalent to the States' funds. So from \nthe point of view of this issue, the issue of Appalachia, it is always \neasy, obviously, in these complicated bills to confuse people, but the \ntwo points every Member of the Senate should understand is that as a \npercentage of the highway bill, less money is going to the 13 States of \nAppalachia in the program, which dates back to 1965, under the \nPresident's amendment; and our amendment eliminates a terrible \ninequity, which says, if there is a shortfall of funds, what the \nSecretary has discretion over is funded first. We eliminate that.\n  A final point, and I will be finished, is that one of our critics has \nsaid that our bill funds interstate corridors of international trade \nand border infrastructure. This was called for under NAFTA. \nInterestingly enough, the bill that is before the Senate, the highway \nbill--or we wish was before the Senate --provides $750 million to \nfulfill the commitments made in NAFTA only by a sleight-of-hand. It \nprovides no real authorization for the money to be spent. So they tell \nyou they are providing $750 million. You can read it right in their \nbill. But elsewhere they have a provision which renders that \nnonexistent. We have provided $450 million which is real. So in reality \nthey claim to be providing more than we are, but their complaint is we \nare basically doing it; whereas they were basically misleading people \nabout what they were doing. So I want people to understand this issue.\n  We need to get on with the highway bill. We have work to do. We are \nrunning out of time. The highway bill is going to expire. Road \nconstruction is going to stop all over the country. We need to bring \nthis highway bill up and we need to do it now. I want to ask our \nGovernors, our mayors, the people who build highways, the people who \nuse highways, we need to hear from you in this debate because your \ninterests are at stake.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my reserved \n2\\1/2\\ minutes be reduced to 30 seconds, and I wish the Senator would \nadd to the list of cosponsors. I believe he has two additional Senators \non this side.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We have gotten the commitment, I think, in writing from \nSenator Thomas; that brings us up to 51. We have one other Member who \nhas said verbally they want to cosponsor, but I want to wait until we \nget that in writing.\n  The point in the 30 seconds is that this is the first legitimate \nbipartisan effort in this Congress. We have 51 cosponsors, Democrats \nand Republicans, because this is a bipartisan issue. People say they \nwant bipartisanship. This is an issue where we are getting it, and what \nwe need is this bill on the floor of the Senate so that we can provide \nthis bipartisan leadership to do what the country needs.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from Texas.\n\n[[Page S473]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a decision to send our military personnel \ninto combat is the most serious policymakers can make. We do not or \nshould not cavalierly discuss military options without losing sight of \nthe human dimension that people, whether our own uniformed personnel or \ninnocent civilians in the country against which we take action, will \ndie.\n  We were correct to strike Libya in 1986, although we mourned the loss \nof lives of innocent people whose sole crime was to live in a \ndictatorship that provoked us to action. We were correct to liberate \nGrenada and Panama, despite the loss of life that accompanied those \nconflicts. And we were correct to conduct overwhelming airstrikes \nagainst Iraq in order to evict it from Kuwait, but we regret the deaths \nof civilians cynically placed in harm's way by that country's regime. \nAnd we have been correct in the past to launch punitive missile strikes \nagainst Iraq in response to its violation of the U.N. resolutions.\n  We now stand on the precipice of yet another military confrontation \nwith Saddam Hussein and the military security forces that protect him. \nIraq has repeatedly, over the span of 7 years, defied U.N. resolutions \nand agreements, negotiated in exchange for the termination of the \nPersian Gulf war. The demands made of Iraq are simple and reasonable \nand, if complied with in good faith, would not have unduly subjected it \nto violations of its sovereignty. Iraq was to destroy its existing \nstockpiles of banned weapons of mass destruction and its capability to \nreconstitute the scientific and industrial infrastructure for their \ndevelopment. It was to repatriate Kuwaiti prisoners after Iraq's brutal \ninvasion and occupation of its smaller neighbor; and it was to \ncompensate the victims of its aggression.\n  Mr. President, it has not done any of these things. Instead, it has \ndemonstrated for 7 straight years its contempt for the United Nations, \nfor the agreements it has signed, and for the most simple norms of \ncivilized behavior.\n  Saddam Hussein has repeatedly pushed the international community to \nthe brink and then pulled back just enough to head off military \naction. He has eluded the scale of punitive measures warranted by \ncalculating the point at which his actions would result in serious \nretaliatory measures by the United States. He has gotten away with this \nbecause in those few instances when military action was taken against \nhim, it was ineffectual. Nowhere was this more evident than the \nSeptember 1996 cruise missile strikes against Iraqi targets following \nthe most egregious violation to date: the large-scale military \nincursion into Kurdish territory and subsequent execution of anti-\nSaddam activists working with the United States. At that time, the \nforces involved in the incursion on what was supposed to be protected \nterritory should have been directly and forcefully attacked.\n\n  The United Nations Special Commission tasked with verifying Iraqi's \ncompliance with U.N. resolutions has been systematically stymied at \nevery point. Saddam Hussein has clearly placed a higher priority on \ncontinuing to develop the means to threaten his neighbors than on the \nwelfare of children the fate of which Baghdad purports to decry. Iraq \nhas received every conceivable opportunity to comply with legitimate \nand lawful demands and to join the community of nations as a member in \ngood standing, and has spurned those opportunities.\n  The nature of the regime of Saddam Hussein is impervious to any \npeaceful effort at resolution of the ongoing conflict. There is every \nreason to believe that Iraq continues to possess chemical and \nbiological weapons and the means to deliver them. There is no \nindication that it aspires to live in peace with its neighbors; on the \ncontrary, I have no doubt that if the opportunity arose, it would again \nattempt to retake Kuwait. It certainly aspires to participate in the \ndestruction of Israel.\n  The time for talk may be over. The chairman of the U.N. Special \nCommission has thrown up his hands in dismay. The approaching option is \nthe large-scale and protracted use of military force. Diplomacy, \ncertainly the optimal approach, has failed thus far. Withdrawing our \nforces and lifting the sanctions would enable Iraq to fully rearm and \nopenly threaten to destabilize the region, brandishing the very banned \nweapons at issue. Not only should sanctions not be lifted, they should \nin fact be tightened. Existing no-fly zones should continue to be \nenforced and expanded, perhaps to include no-drive zones targeted \nagainst Republican Guard armored units.\n  The only viable military option is to inflict serious damage on the \nIraqi Republican Guard and destroy the compounds and ``palaces'' Saddam \nhas sought to protect. Ineffectual cruise missile and air strikes such \nas characterized past punitive actions, particularly in 1996 when 27 \ncruise missiles were launched against largely insignificant targets, \nwill once again prove counterproductive. Domestic communications links \nshould be targeted as well as military ones, in order to sever Saddam's \nability to communicate to the Iraqi people. The expansion of our own \nbroadcasting into Iraq aimed at influencing public opinion there should \nhave been a higher priority all along.\n  And we should be prepared to act alone if necessary. While Britain \nhas stood by us and prepared to act with us, for which we should be \ngrateful, it is disconcerting to witness the paucity of public support \nfor enforcing legitimate U.N. resolutions. While some of us were in \nGermany this past weekend, it was gratifying to hear the German \ngovernment come out in support of our efforts, but European support is \nless important right now than attaining the open support of the Middle \nEastern governments that will play a vital role in dealing with the \npolitical ramifications within that region of any military actions we \ntake against Iraq. In that respect, Saudi Arabia's decision to permit \nonly the use of support aircraft from its territory is deeply \ndisturbing. I understand Saudi, and all Arab, concern for the welfare \nof the Iraqi populace. And I am aware of the domestic and regional \nimplications for the Saudi government of openly supporting air strikes \nagainst Iraq. The threat posed by Saddam Hussein against Saudi Arabia, \nas well as every other country in the region, however, argues \nforcefully for the government in Riyadh to be more openly supportive of \nour measures and to communicate to their people the simple fact that \nmeasures against Iraq occur solely because of that country's \nbelligerent and unlawful stance.\n\n  The military option, should it be chosen, must be designed to \naccomplish meaningful military objectives. Restraints on targeting \nintended to minimize criticism from other nations, whether friends, \nallies or potential foes, will have the effect of reducing the \nlikelihood that objectives will be accomplished. It is clear that the \nUnited States will be widely criticized by many parties should we \nlaunch an attack against Iraq. As stated, it is of little comfort that \nsome of those governments that criticize us publicly applaud us \nprivately, as their populations take their cue from the public posture. \nIraq has provided every incentive for us to strike, and we must not \nsquander the opportunity to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction \nfrom the region by tailoring military actions to minimize the political \noutcry that will follow. Leadership and responsibility often entail \nunpopular actions, and the prosecution of actions that lead to deaths \nof many is a horrible burden to bear. But bear it we must.\n  The key to a long-term resolution of the Iraq problem lies largely in \none man, or, to be more precise given what is known about his sons, one \nfamily. The United States should adopt stronger measures aimed at \nundermining the ruling regime through greater support of dissident \nelements both within and outside of Iraq. Saddam's internal security \napparatus has proven enormously effective at defeating such elements in \nthe past, and I am under no\n\n[[Page S474]]\n\nillusions about the scale of the effort required to get the job done. \nIt is an effort, however, that must be made. Considerable opposition to \nSaddam and his family exists inside Iraq and, particularly, among \nexiled dissident groups. The Administration should organize a more \nconcerted effort at unifying these dissident elements and providing the \nlogistical support needed to bring about the collapse of Saddam's \nregime. Financial support toward this end is already at hand in the \nform of Iraqi assets frozen after its invasion of Kuwait. The current \nand future Administrations should budget appropriately for the costs of \nsuch an operation within the international operations discretionary \nportion of the federal budget--not out of a defense budget already \nsuffering the effects of seeing resources diverted to various \ncontingency operations.\n  I do not adopt this stance lightly. On the contrary, I wish there \nwere another way, but I know there is not. I regret very much that \nAmerican personnel may lose their lives in any military operation we \nconduct against Iraq and I mourn the loss of those innocent Iraqis who \nwant nothing more than to live in peace. But Saddam Hussein has left us \nno choice.\n  Mr. President, it is imperative that this body convey to the \nPresident the support he needs in this time of domestic political \ncrisis to employ the level of force necessary to bring closure to the \nsituation with Iraq. For that to happen, though, the President should \nask Congress for its support, not just welcome it if and when it comes. \nPolitics stops at the water's edge, it is often said in discussions of \nforeign policy. We are at the water's edge, and the currents are \nthreatening to sweep away U.S. credibility in the very region where we \ncan least afford for that to happen. Vital U.S. interests are at stake, \nand it is time to act.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/09/senate-section/article/S473-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             AID TO AFRICA\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and honor \nthe achievement of Assist International, World Serv, the Hewlett \nPackard Foundation, and the Erie Area Chamber of Commerce in delivering \nmedical aid to the people of Ethiopia. This group of organizations has \nworked to provide medical equipment to Ethiopia that can save hundreds \nof lives. This generous gift, valued at over one million dollars, will \nbring hope and health to many in Ethiopia.\n  These organizations and the concerned Americans associated with them \nhave demonstrated the true spirit of charity. The group cooperatively \nhas donated a state-of-the-art cardiac heart monitoring unit to the \nBlack Lion Hospital--Ethiopia's leading teaching medical facility. In \naddition to the cardiac unit, beds, mattresses, and other system \nsupport equipment will be provided.\n  World Serv and Assist International have a strong history of \nproviding humanitarian aid to relieve human suffering in needy \ncountries. Assist International donated medical equipment to a site in \nMongolia which was then approved by the World Health Organization to \nperform open heart surgery. The Hewlett Packard Foundation donated the \nmedical equipment in the Black Lion Project in its goal to ease human \nsuffering internationally. Finally, the Chamber of Commerce of Erie, \nPennsylvania, has joined together with the other organizations and has \nraised the funding for transportation, installation, and training costs \nof this project. Specifically, I commend the Erie Area Chamber of \nCommerce for this cooperative effort and for holding the third annual \n``Aid to Africa'' banquet to raise funds for humanitarian projects.\n  The Black Lion project is an example of the compassion and generosity \nthat other countries appreciate and admire in the United States. It \ngives me great pleasure as the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations \nAfrica Subcommittee to know that Americans are finding ways within the \nprivate sector to aid other countries in Africa. It is my pleasure to \nask the members of the Senate to join me in recognizing and honoring \nthe work of the members and staff of Assist International, World Serv, \nthe Hewlett Packard Foundation, and the Erie Area Chamber of Commerce.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/09/senate-section/article/S474-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the business pending \nbefore the Senate.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of David Satcher, of \nTennessee, to be an Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services, \nMedical Director of the Public Health Service, and Surgeon General of \nthe Public Health Service.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. President, the nomination of David Satcher for U.S. Surgeon \nGeneral has been a matter of significant discussion over the last \nseveral days. I would like to indicate that I rise to oppose this \nnomination. There are a number of very important reasons why I believe \nwe should not confirm this nominee.\n  During the last several days of discussion here on the Senate floor, \nwe have gone through a number of topics, none of which reveals a record \nthat would recommend Dr. Satcher to be the Surgeon General of the \nUnited States of America, none of which would say that this individual \nought to be America's family doctor.\n  We looked at the Third World AIDS studies that have been conducted \nand that are ongoing under Dr. Satcher's supervision at the Centers for \nDisease Control. You will remember that those Third World AIDS studies \nwere the subject of an editorial in the New England Journal of \nMedicine, which has simply said that those studies are not being \nethically conducted, that as a matter of fact, the studies were \nunethical. In short, the New England Journal of Medicine says that to \ngive people sugar pills, or placebos, when there is a clearly \nunderstood and accepted therapy that is available, pharmaceutically or \notherwise, is unethical, and that has been the position of the CDC in \nthis situation. They have simply persisted with the administration of \nplacebos, or sugar pills, for individuals, in spite of the fact that \nthere is proven therapy available that should be or could be given to \nthose individuals. It has been clear, even in the words, I believe, of \nDr. Satcher himself, that these are studies that could not be conducted \nin the United States. It is simply that we don't treat human beings as \nlaboratory subjects--to give them a placebo when there is a known \ntherapy in this country. So the first thing we discussed pretty \nsubstantially last week were the Third World AIDS studies. In these \nstudies the activities of the CDC, under Dr. Satcher, had been labeled \nconclusively, in my judgment, and at least very strongly by the New \nEngland Journal of Medicine, as unethical. They were called unethical \nbecause, in the face of known therapy, individuals were just given \nsugar pills, even though we know that an infection or a virus like HIV \nis often considered a fatal virus.\n  The second item of concern related to the way in which Dr. Satcher \nhas conducted himself as the head of the CDC has related to domestic \nnewborn AIDS studies. In the eighties, there was a program to test the \nblood of newborn infants. It was a test that was conducted after \nidentifying marks were taken off the blood samples so that researchers \njust found out what percentage of the samples were HIV-infected. \nResearchers kept that for epidemiological reasons or for statistical \npurposes, in order to find out in a particular community what \npercentage of the newborns were being born with HIV.\n  Now, since that study began, and during the pendency of Dr. Satcher's \ntenure at Centers for Disease Control, new\n\n[[Page S475]]\n\ntherapies have been developed that could maybe make a difference for \nsome of these children. But Dr. Satcher persisted in doing the tests \nafter the markings were taken off the blood samples, so that no one \nwould be able to know which babies had the HIV and which didn't. We \njust continued to assemble the statistical data in the blind newborn \nstudies.\n  There are individuals who have raised very serious questions about \nthis. Those individuals have been very prominent in the AIDS research \ncommunity and in the medical community. These individuals say it's one \nthing to maintain a statistical basis if there is no known therapy, if \nthere is nothing you can do, but it is another thing after a therapy is \nfound to continue forward in a situation where you don't take the \nidentifying characteristics for the blood and you just persist and then \nyou don't notify--so you don't have any information to give to parents \nbecause you have taken the names and the identifying characteristics \naway from the blood. That was irresponsible. As you well know, there \nwas quite a controversy in the Congress about that. And that whole \nprogram has been shut down.\n\n  But my view is that the leading doctor for American families should \nhave a view toward how to help families understand how to improve their \nhealth standing. When there is a therapy that becomes available, one \nshould not persist in the maintenance of nameless statistical records \nand epidemiological data. One should try quickly to get that data to \nthe people so that they can arrest the development of the disease in \ntheir children, so they can take remedial steps. And not only did Dr. \nSatcher preside over a continuity in the program that ignored the \npotential therapies, but also when the Congress came in to shut down a \nprogram designed for statistics which ignored the potential for helping \nindividuals, Dr. Satcher sought to stop the Congress and lobbied the \nCongress to allow it to continue.\n  I have discussed these two issues: The HIV studies in Africa and the \nHIV studies on newborns in the United States with the epidemiological \ndata and statistics about how many in each town were HIV infected.\n  I think it is important for us to understand that both of these \nstudies place too much emphasis on the data and upon the research \naspects without enough emphasis on the actual health of individuals.\n  In each of those cases, very serious questions have been raised about \nthe ethics and the conduct of those kinds of experiments. There is, \nthough, another area of concern which I hope to be involved in more \nfully today during the debate, and that is the concept of needle \nexchanges for dope addicts. Most Americans do not want their tax \ndollars to support programs which provide drug paraphernalia, needles \nor other things, to drug addicts. There are some of those in the public \ncommunity who think that we can preserve the health of drug addicts if \nwe will provide them with good paraphernalia, if we can just provide \nthem with the right kind of needles we can help them lead healthy \nlifestyles. We could help armed robbers have greater health in the \nconduct of their robberies if we would provide them with bulletproof \nvests. But I don't think we want to do that. As a culture, we are not \nin the business of supporting the administration of illegal drugs.\n  I will spend substantial time later in the day talking about the \ncommitment of Dr. Satcher in promoting needle exchange programs and \nusing public resources to help promote needle exchange programs. There \nhas been substantial debate over this. Frankly, there has been some \nconfusion in the Senate about this, and I think it results from the \nfact that the CDC and Dr. Satcher have not been forthcoming. It is very \nclear to me that they have not been complete in their disclosure of \nwhat they have been doing and what they have been supporting. We have \nasked for document after document and, as previous discussion in this \ndebate revealed, the CDC has been loath to send us information and \ndocuments. But all the trickle of information reveals a greater and \ngreater commitment, on the part of this nominee to be Surgeon General \nof the United States, to support needle exchange programs which would \nprovide those who are breaking the law with the capacity to do so, \nperhaps at less disease risk. But I question whether or not most \nAmericans want to be spending their tax resources to provide needles \nfor dope addicts instead of improving the education of their children \nor pursuing a variety of other objectives which might be undertaken.\n  A fourth, very important item that relates to my reservations about \nDr. Satcher is that the Centers for Disease Control, instead of \nfocusing its energy on diseases and the eradication of diseases, has in \nsome cases diverted its attention to areas far afield from the area of \ndisease control or prevention, or even the development of therapies for \ndiseases.\n  Here is one example of another area they have moved into--the area of \naccidents. The CDC has decided that significant studies related to gun \nownership are the equivalent of the examination of diseases. As Larry \nCraig, the Senator from Idaho, has eloquently argued on this floor, the \nsecond amendment to the Constitution--the right to bear arms--is not an \nepidemic. The second amendment to the Constitution of the United States \nis not a disease. We really do not intend for the Centers for Disease \nControl to be involved in some debate about the politically correct \nresponse to this set or the other about gun ownership. The Centers for \nDisease Control should focus its energy and deploy its resources in a \nway that will help American families have greater health and will help \nthem maintain freedom from disease and the threats that real health \nproblems can bring to them.\n\n  Those are an array of issues which I think will be discussed again \ntoday, and have been discussed in this debate at some level. But I \nwould like to focus my remarks on one additional matter for the next \nfew minutes in this debate. It is simply this: That a Surgeon General \nwho sanctions partial-birth abortions is unfit to serve the people of \nthe United States of America. A Surgeon General who acquiesces in \npartial-birth abortions is unfit to serve as the family doctor for the \npeople of this country.\n  Dr. Satcher, in a letter of October 28th, 1997, to Senator Frist, \nsaid the following:\n\n       I have no intention of using the positions of Assistant \n     Secretary for Health and Surgeon General to promote issues \n     related to abortion. I want to use the power of these \n     positions to focus on issues that unite Americans, not divide \n     them.\n\n  Satcher goes on in his letter:\n\n       As a family physician, medical educator, and public health \n     leader, I have devoted my entire career to mainstream \n     consensus building efforts to improve the health of the \n     American people.\n\n  Yet, Dr. Satcher has stated that he supports the President's position \nregarding partial-birth abortion. On October 21, 1997, in a response \nwritten to Senator Coats of Indiana, Dr. Satcher stated that he \nsupports the President's position on partial-birth abortion.\n  Mr. President, is that a mainstream consensus building position \nshared by America? Is the position of President Clinton mainstream? Is \nthat position supported by most Americans? Does it build consensus? \nThankfully not. This is pretty clear.\n  A recent CNN-Times poll reveals that fully 3 out of every 4 Americans \nbelieve that partial-birth abortion is wrong. Nonetheless, President \nClinton, Dr. Satcher, and their allies on Capitol Hill persist. The \nsuggestion that Dr. Satcher is only going to do things that are \nmainstream to build consensus is immediately belied by his performance \non this issue.\n  Lest there be any confusion, we are talking about an abortion \nprocedure that allows a child to be partially born from a mother's womb \nonly to have its skull crushed by a doctor who pledged to ``do no \nharm.'' Most Americans by now understand the horrors of partial-birth \nabortion. They understand that this is a late-term abortion. They \nunderstand that these abortions are conducted in a way that results in \nthe child being born 80 to 90 percent, and while just a small portion \nof the child remains in the mother's body, the child is then killed. \nThis procedure occurs at a time in the pregnancy when the child could \nsurvive outside the mother's womb.\n  One of the things that really strikes me is that partial-birth \nabortion is revealed on a continuing basis by science\n\n[[Page S476]]\n\nto be less and less acceptable in the American culture, because there \nare so many things known today that weren't known a few years ago. We \nheld hearings in the Senate Judiciary Committee, Constitution \nSubcommittee on Abortion, and we solicited the testimony of Jean A. \nWright, medical doctor and master of business administration. She is an \nindividual who is board certified in pediatrics, anesthesia, and in \nboth sub-boards of critical care medicine. What she pointed out was \nvery important; that is, that these children who are subject to \npartial-birth abortion have an increased sensitivity to pain.\n\n  So much of the argument surrounding abortion has alleged that these \nchildren can feel no pain, that it is not a person, that this is just a \ngroup of cells, and this is not anything to be concerned about. As \ntechnology progresses, science reveals that indeed these young, preborn \nchildren are very sensitive to pain.\n  I just wanted to point out that in our hearings Dr. Wright made a \nvery, very compelling presentation about the nature of this pain. The \nway they found out about pain in preborn infants comes from techniques \nthat have been developed for doing surgery on preborn infants. When \nthese surgeries are performed they sometimes measure things like blood \npressure and the level of hormones and other substances in the blood. \nAnd when a person is undergoing pain, his blood pressure goes up. When \na person is undergoing pain, that person's blood composition changes in \nresponse to pain.\n  Medical personnel have noticed, both when they are doing surgeries on \npreborn infants inside the mother and when they withdraw the child from \nthe mother for later placing it back in the womb to do surgery, that \nthe elevation in the pain levels of these preborn infants is very \nsubstantial, at least as seen in the indicators that are associated \nwith pain. So that the child's blood pressure goes up very \nsubstantially and the blood's hormonal content goes up. As a matter of \nfact, it is not a suggestion that preborn infants feel pain less than \nfull-term infants and newborns. It looks as if prior to being born the \nsensitivity to pain is higher than it is once one is born. That would \nmake sense because the preborn infant is not accustomed to being \nknocked around, or invaded, or cut on, or otherwise injured. So the \nchild's sensitivity is very high.\n  With that in mind, I think this knowledge just dramatizes the whole \nissue of partial-birth abortion--this issue of taking a late-term \nchild, withdrawing that child substantially from the mother, and then \ndestroying that child, which otherwise could survive with the kind of \nmedical help that is frequently attendant to premature births.\n  Dr. Satcher says that he has a mainstream approach and that he is \ngoing to pursue consensus, but he indicates that he favors these kinds \nof abortions. I just do not think that is a very unifying approach. I \ndon't think it is the kind of view that is reflected in the mainstream \nof America. But not only is Dr. Satcher's view outside the mainstream \nof America, Dr. Satcher's view on this issue is also outside the \nmainstream of America's medical community. It is not just that the \nAmerican people broadly defined don't accept his views. Dr. Satcher \ndeparts also from thousands of his colleagues in the medical profession \nwho have declared emphatically that there are no health reasons or \nhealth justifications for performing partial-birth abortions. The \nAmerican Medical Association opposes the procedure.\n  I have to leave it to the AMA, in the face of their opposition to \nthis procedure which Dr. Satcher is willing to embrace, to explain why \nthey would support Dr. Satcher, and I would leave it to them to explain \nthe inconsistency which I believe that particular position reveals.\n  The group called the Physicians Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth is a \nnationwide coalition of doctors now numbering over 600 members. This \norganization has insisted there is no medical need or justification for \nthe partial birth abortion procedure and that it should be banned.\n  So we have a clear indication that not only is partial-birth abortion \nin the mind of the public improper--three out of four people do not \nsupport it--but groups as diverse as the American Medical Association \nand the Physicians Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth say there is no reason \nfor it and reject it. Of course, as I indicated, testimony from Jean \nWright of Emory University about pain in preborn infants provides \nanother basis for the American people to say this isn't the kind of \nthing we want to support.\n  Dr. Roy C. Stringfellow, of Colorado, wrote:\n\n       President Clinton's medical reasoning for his stance on \n     partial-birth abortion has been clearly shown to be flawed \n     and not in any way in touch with reality.\n\n  I am sure Dr. Satcher understands this, and I am sure he is aware of \nthe fact that the AMA as well as many other medical groups and medical \nexperts have recognized President Clinton's flawed reasoning.\n  It concerns me greatly that Dr. Satcher does not have the courage to \ntake an appropriate stance in regard to this issue. If he cannot be \ntrusted to take the side of medical reality versus political expediency \nin this case, how can we trust him to fulfill the office of Surgeon \nGeneral?\n  We haven't had a Surgeon General for 3 years. We did not have a \nSurgeon General for 3 years because the last Surgeon General was so \nirresponsible, so outspoken as to literally wage an assault on the good \njudgment and values of the American people and on the values of the \nmedical community. But I do not think we need a Surgeon General so \nbadly that we will have to embrace a Surgeon General who will be \npolitically instead of medically correct. And I don't think anyone who \nsupports widely-opposed medical issues that are as clear, convincing, \nand consensus oriented as partial-birth abortion, or who will just \ndefer to what political bosses dictate in that respect, should be \nelevated to such a position of high trust and respect as Surgeon \nGeneral.\n  I have just a few exemplary letters that I will be reading. They are \nby individuals from all across the country, from Massachusetts, \nColorado and Montana to Florida and Louisiana.\n  Dr. Helen T. Jackson of Brookline, MA, shares a concern:\n\n       As a practicing obstetrician and gynecologist, I hereby \n     state that there is no place in medicine for partial-birth \n     abortion. This is a barbaric procedure which should not be \n     accepted in any civilized society. No Surgeon General should \n     be a rubber stamp for the President's position.\n\n  This is not just a question here about partial-birth abortion. This \nbecomes a larger question. If a Surgeon General is willing to go \nagainst the best of medicine in order to cave in to political demands \nfrom the President on an issue so important as the life and death of \nunborn children by partial-birth abortion, I think we have to ask \nourselves, will we get the kind of advice and help from the Surgeon \nGeneral that we need and want?\n  Dr. Douglas B. Boyette wrote:\n\n       Please let it be clearly understood that I would oppose the \n     appointment of Dr. David Satcher in his quest to become \n     Surgeon General. He supports President Clinton's veto of the \n     Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Obviously, this physician \n     lacks clear judgment and, therefore, would be an \n     inappropriate candidate for such an important position.\n\n  Let me read a letter from yet another doctor. Dr. John I. Lane of \nGreat Falls, MT, writes:\n\n       I strongly urge you and your colleagues in the Senate to \n     let the President know that this Nation deserves a physician \n     of the highest caliber, not a politician, to serve as Surgeon \n     General of the United States.\n\n  I think Dr. Lane would reflect the concerns of a lot of people in \nthis country. Sure, we would be glad to respond to someone as our \nAmerica's family doctor, as our leader in terms of health concerns, but \nthere is nothing more important between the doctor and the patient than \nthe responsibility of trust. You would hate to think you were going to \nyour doctor and, instead of getting good medical advice, were getting \npolitical advice. The American people want a doctor to lead us to \nbetter health, not to parrot politics. I agree with the letter of Dr. \nJohn Lane of Great Falls, MT, when it says, ``The Nation deserves a \nphysician of the highest caliber, not a politician, to serve as the \nSurgeon General of the United States.'' I think it is pretty clear that \nwe owe a duty of responsibility to the American people in this \nconfirmation deliberation to make sure that we do not confirm someone \nwho is going to advance a political agenda rather than a health agenda.\n\n[[Page S477]]\n\n  Too often I think a lot of people realize this. They feel there are \ngoing to be political health agendas instead of the real health \nagendas. People have had real reservations about the way the research \nfunds of the United States have been allocated. They have had real \nreservations about what has been done in terms of trying to conquer \nvarious diseases. It seems to them that some diseases are more \npolitically popular and get a lot of support and research dollars, in \nspite of the fact that the same number of dollars might really save far \nmore lives somewhere else or might be devoted to developing a promising \ntherapy which is on the verge of complete development and discovery. \nBut, instead, politicians take the resources and redirect them toward \npolitical objectives or to political constituencies instead of having \nthe resources directed in the areas of real medical assistance.\n  In a setting like this, we should find out whether an individual is \ngoing to be subject to political exigencies or whether the individual \nis going to take the direction of medicine. I think a real question is \nraised here when, repudiating the American Medical Association position \non partial-birth abortion, repudiating the advice of the overwhelming \nnumber of experts that it is never medically indicated, the proposed \nSurgeon General of the United States decides to embrace a political \nposition of the President rather than to advocate a medical position \nfor the people. That is troublesome.\n  Or consider the letter of Peggy B. James, a clinical assistant \nprofessor at the University of Florida College of Medicine:\n\n       As a physician practicing for the past 17 years, and as a \n     mother of three children, one of whom was delivered very \n     early and was very ill but is doing very well now, I am \n     abhorred that Dr. Satcher's confirmation may take place.\n\n  Here you have a clinical assistant professor, a mother, a medical \ndoctor, who has had experience--one of her own three children born very \nill and very early, but doing very well now--who understands the \ntangibility of a child that is not born at full and the tangibility of \nits survival. She is, frankly, shocked that a person might be endowed \nwith the mantle of respect to lead America in health decisions who \nfavors allowing the destruction of such children rather than trying to \nprotect them. ``I am abhorred,'' she says, ``that [the confirmation] \nmay take place.''\n  One more letter. Finally, W.A. Krotoski, a retired medical director \nof the U.S. Public Health Service, living in Louisiana, asserted:\n\n       The position of Surgeon General of the United States is too \n     important to place in the hands of people who are willing to \n     deny their oaths and medical facts. Should Dr. Satcher be \n     selected, he will have enormous influence over the dedicated \n     group of health care professionals who constitute the U.S. \n     Public Health Service. Please don't allow this influence to \n     be that of denied integrity regarding human life.\n\n  It is not a matter of minor consequence. The opportunity of the \nSenate in confirmation hearings is a sobering opportunity, and it is \nnot a matter of pleasure to come to the floor to say that we can and \nought do better and that we need someone who is a physician above being \na politician, someone who will lead us to better health rather than \nreinforce the politics of an administration. I think that is something \nwe are owed and something for which we ought to aspire.\n  So I read through these letters from Dr. Stringfellow, Dr. Jackson, \nDr. Boyette, Dr. Lane, Dr. James, and Dr. Krotoski. These are letters \nwhich speak about the mainstream medical community's understanding, and \nthey call us to our highest and best. They diagnose something. The best \ndiagnosis is the diagnosis that is in advance; it doesn't wait until \nyou get the disease. It says, if you persist in a kind of behavior, you \nwill find yourself in a substandard position.\n  This is what we have here. We invite someone to be the health leader \nfor the United States of America whose commitment, when push comes to \nshove, is to politics over health, or at least who is willing to \naccommodate the political position of the President on partial-birth \nabortion, rather than someone who is willing to stand up and say what \nis true in the hearts and minds of mainstream and what is true in terms \nof the medical community. I think that kind of diagnosis by these \nphysicians is very helpful. We should heed the warning of these \ndoctors. In a sense it is a health warning.\n\n  Mr. President, what message would we send by embracing a Surgeon \nGeneral nominee who would support such barbarism? What does it say \nabout who we are? What does it say about the moral condition of our \nNation, when the Surgeon General, in the face of the American Medical \nAssociation and in the face of expert medical testimony, would seek to \nput a political position in place, or would reinforce that political \nposition? He may say, well, I am not going to be there to talk \naggressively on this issue. I am not going to be there to make a big \nthing over abortion.\n  I can assure you that when the debate comes to the floor of the \nSenate, the Surgeon General's position will be recited. To have it \nsuggested that there would be an opportunity for a person to be Surgeon \nGeneral and not lead on an issue this important, whose position would \nbe inconsequential on a position this important, would simply be to \ndeny what the responsibility of the job is. The job is to lead. The job \nis to lead toward better health. And if a person is willing to put \npolitics above better health in situations like this and say we are not \ngoing to emphasize it, I do not believe a person really is saying they \nunderstand what the nature of the job is.\n  There has been and there will be more talk of what Tuesday's vote \nsignifies. The New York Times suggested that this is a fight about \nabortion. They put it this way:\n\n       Conservatives want to block this highly respected nominee \n     because of his mildly stated views on abortion.\n\n  Well, frankly, this is about partial-birth abortion. This is about \nwhether we are going to cloak an individual with the title, prestige, \nimpact and influence of the Surgeon General of the United States of \nAmerica who is willing to support partial-birth abortion against the \nwill of the American people and against the wisdom of America's medical \ncommunity.\n  Now, there are other issues involved here. It is not exclusively \nabout abortion, but it is about abortion. The New York Times is right. \nIt suggests that it is about abortion, and, Mr. President, this is \nabout abortion. It is about partial-birth abortion, a procedure so \ncruel, a procedure so inhumane, a procedure the barbarism of which is \nso significant that rational support is hard to generate. I do not \nbelieve that reasonable and rational support can be accorded this \nprocedure. The procedure itself defies that kind of support. This \nnomination is about whether a man who championed this horrific act is \nfit to serve as the Nation's family doctor. I am a little bit troubled \nby the phrase in the New York Times editorial, ``mildly stated.'' It \nhas been stated on the Senate floor, I believe by the senior Senator \nfrom New York, that this procedure is ``infanticide.''\n  I wonder if the New York Times believes that if someone just mildly \nstates their support for infanticide that makes infanticide \nappropriate? I wonder if we had a mild statement in support of \ngenocide, whether that would make genocide acceptable? You know, mild \nstatements sometimes cover over the most serious of circumstances. I \nremember a Presidential nominee who resolved that abortion should be \nsafe, rare and legal--a pretty mild statement. But it is the same \nPresident who has consistently vetoed bans on the barbaric procedure \nknown as partial-birth abortion. If my time as Governor and Senator \nhave taught me anything it is this, that government and its officials \nteach. Teaching that partial-birth abortion is acceptable is wrong.\n  There is a struggle in the country. There is an idea that our young \npeople do not have the right view of themselves. They do not have the \nkind of esteem which we would like young people to have. Somehow, our \nchildren do not have the kind of self-image, according to a number of \nindividuals, that we would want them to have. Maybe we contribute to \nthe absence of the right kind of esteem and self-image in children when \nwe indicate to them that they can be survivable, and they can be \nsubstantially born, but it's still OK and appropriate if someone wants \nto destroy them at that stage of their existence.\n  If we want to teach children self-esteem, maybe we should begin to \nesteem\n\n[[Page S478]]\n\nchildren a little more ourselves. In the absence of the right value for \nchildren to place on their own lives, maybe we should seek to place a \ngreater value on the lives of children ourselves. I think America \ndeserves better than a Surgeon General who would show a callous \ndisregard for innocent human life, even if it is a mild statement of \napproving partial-birth abortion. A man who would sanction and support \npartial-birth abortion cannot provide the moral leadership that the \noffice of Surgeon General so desperately needs.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for this opportunity to open this debate. \nI believe more than anything else, America needs a Surgeon General who \nwill tell the American people the truth; whose efforts in the Surgeon \nGeneral's office will not be to protect the political agenda of any \nindividual but will be to help the health agenda of the American \npeople. When we are offered individuals who are willing to go in the \nface of the American Medical Association and the medical community to \nsupport partial-birth abortion and support the President rather than \nthe health concerns of the country, I think are shown a clear symptom \nof a problem which we would rather do without. The best way to avoid \nthat problem is to insist on better for the United States of America.\n  I note the presence of the senior Senator from New Hampshire on the \nfloor. He introduced the legislation to ban partial-birth abortion. He \nis an individual who has been a great fighter for the rights of the \nunborn. He tackled the issue of partial-birth abortion in a setting \nthat was very difficult and thereby demonstrated his outstanding \ncourage. I am pleased to yield to the senior Senator from New \nHampshire, such time as he may consume in regard to this nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, let me say to my colleague \nfrom Missouri how much I appreciate his leadership, being out here hour \nafter hour, many times alone, in opposition to this nomination. It is \nthe right thing to do. I don't think it is a secret that probably we \nare going to lose this fight. But in the effort the Senator has \ndistinguished himself in accenting what I think are the issues that \nneed to be accented in this debate.\n  The Senator pointed out a number of important other questions that \nhave arisen, but I want to focus on one particular issue because, as \nthe Senator said, I have written the legislation to ban partial-birth \nabortions here in the country.\n  Regretfully, I must say, but for 3 votes in the U.S. Senate we would \nhave a ban on partial-birth abortions--or, better put, perhaps if the \nPresident had not vetoed it, since we have 64 votes already in the \nSenate but we need 67, it would have come to pass.\n\n  As I sat here for the last 15 or 20 minutes listening to my \ncolleague, I couldn't help but think how frustrating it must have been, \neven for Lincoln in the time of the Civil War, basically having the \ncourage to take on the issue of slavery. Ironically, it led to the \ndestruction of one political party. The Whig Party went down and the \nRepublican Party was formed in opposition to slavery. In those days, \npeople refused to stand up on principle and lost a political party. I \ndo not know if there is a lesson to be learned here, but it is \ncertainly something to which we ought to give serious consideration.\n  I know how the Senator feels because for many hours I stood here on \nthe floor, in 1995, and took abuse from the national media. I still do \ntake abuse from the national media, and many in the media in my own \nState, for pointing out what this procedure is and how horrible it is \nand how wrong it is. But we all know that there are many out there who \nfight hard to keep us from telling the truth on this issue. I want to \nget into that in a little more detail later, about just exactly what \nhappened. But let me say on behalf of many, thank you for your \nleadership and stepping into the breech.\n  As you know, there are many people who did not want us to make an \nissue of this; who wanted this nomination to slip by quietly so people \nwouldn't be ``embarrassed'' by having to vote on the Satcher \nnomination. But let me point out that the Surgeon General is America's \nfamily doctor. That is what he or she is supposed to be. When you go to \nsee your family doctor you look for competence, certainly. You might \nwant to take a look on the wall to see what his qualifications are, see \nwhere he studied. You certainly want to look for expertise. You want to \nlook for somebody who works hard, who does a good job.\n  You also want someone with moral authority. I know Dr. Satcher has a \nvery distinguished record. But I ask whether or not, on an issue as \nimportant as this issue is, whether being passive is sufficient. Is it \nsufficient to say that you are not going to make an issue of partial-\nbirth abortion if you are the Surgeon General, to say that you are not \ngoing to crusade for it, that you are just going to be passively for \nit? That is not good enough. That is not good enough.\n  You want somebody who is grounded in common sense, who knows and \nunderstands the difference between right and wrong. Every day in the \npress today--we don't have to get into it. The American people know \nfull well what I am talking about. But every day we are hearing \nsuggestions that Americans no longer care. They do not care about right \nor wrong. They do not care about lying. They do not care about \nuntruthfulness. They do not care about cheating. They do not care about \nsetting a good example. We have to turn the television off now when our \nkids are in the room when we are talking about issues involving some of \nthe leaders in our country. That is a pretty tragic commentary.\n  Similarly, the family doctor, the Nation's family doctor, ought to be \nabout saving lives, not taking lives. We are talking about taking lives \nhere. Make no mistake about it.\n  I was in a debate with a colleague on the floor of the Senate here a \nfew years ago, in which this particular Senator said he had studied \nthis issue very carefully and he realized that, until the third month, \nthe fetus wasn't a person. I asked him if he could tell me what it was, \nthen, for the first 3 months? There was not an answer. What is it for \nthe first 3 months? We all know what it is. It's a life. It is a young \nchild. And of course, in the context of partial-birth abortion, we are \nnot talking about the first three months. What we are talking about in \npartial-birth abortion, as Senator Moynihan has said on the floor of \nthis Senate, is infanticide of a later-term baby. It is executing a \nlittle child. That is what it is.\n  We are hearing today that families of America should not care whether \ntheir family doctor--the doctor for America--knows the difference \nbetween right and wrong, that we should not care whether our family \ndoctor believes that killing a little child as her body rests in your \nhands is wrong or right. You should not care about that. It does not \nmatter, as long as he believes in the President, as long as he supports \nthe President and doesn't say anything about it. It will be all right.\n\n  Would we have ended slavery if we had taken that approach? Would we \nhave ended generations and generations of racial prejudice and \ndiscrimination? We still have not ended these, but would we have made \nthe inroads that we have made? I don't think so. I don't believe it and \nI don't believe that deep down in their souls the American people \nbelieve it either.\n  That is why I am here today.\n  I am not here today to cast any aspersions or make any commentary on \nDr. Satcher's general character. He has had a very distinguished \ncareer. But he is wrong. He is wrong on this issue. And as long as I \nhave a vote I intend to exercise that vote against this nomination. I \nknow it is not going to be a vote that we are going to win--and that is \nunfortunate.\n  Now I should probably know better than to expect this President to \npick someone for Surgeon General who is going to be against abortion or \neven against partial-birth abortion. This President is for abortion. He \nis for partial-birth abortion. He has vetoed the legislation we sent \nhim two or three times now. We do not have quite the number of votes to \noverride him. We are only 3 short, though.\n  When you hear people tell you that votes don't matter, or your vote \ndoesn't matter, or one vote doesn't matter--I would ask you to reflect \nfor a moment on this. This bill has been brought through the process \ntwo or three times, through the House, through the Senate, up to the \nPresident's desk and vetoed. We are but\n\n[[Page S479]]\n\nthree votes away from stopping the execution of little children as they \ncome from the womb. That is what we are talking about. That is what \npartial-birth abortion is. Three votes. If three people in the U.S. \nSenate changed their mind we could change that.\n  If we had a family doctor who would be willing to use the bully \npulpit to talk about this issue, we might be able to influence those \nthree votes. You never know. But we are not going to influence them \nwith a Surgeon General who says, ``It's OK. It is all right. There is \nnothing wrong with it.'' And that is why we are here.\n  I am going to oppose this nomination, along with Senator Ashcroft and \nothers, because it is morally wrong to kill little children as they \nexit their mothers' wombs.\n\n  I would say, deep down in your heart--no matter where you are, who \nyou are, how you feel about abortion in general--you probably agree \nwith me. You can get into all these other debates about who is \nresponsible, who has the right to do this, who has the right to choose \nand all that. But deep down in your heart, do you think that is right? \nDo you think it is right that the chief medical person, the family \ndoctor of America, won't speak out against it? Do you think it is right \nthat the President of the United States refuses to appoint someone who \nwill speak out against it to this post? Do you think the President is \nright?\n  Maybe some of these folks ought to witness some partial-birth \nabortions, like nurse Brenda Pratt Shafer did. Until shortly before I \ncame to the floor in 1995 and discussed this issue, I didn't know what \npartial-birth abortion was. One of the people I discussed it with was \nnurse Brenda Pratt Shafer who considered herself ``pro-choice'' until \nshe accepted a temporary assignment at a clinic where partial-birth \nabortions are performed.\n  Of course, we've heard all kinds of things from the other side of \nthis debate. They said we only do a few of them a year, maybe a few \ndozen. They said it is only done in the case of extreme deformities. I \nsaid it wasn't so and I was attacked on the floor of the Senate and \nattacked in the press. I still am being attacked in the press.\n  Come to find out, it is several thousand a year. This news came from \nprominent people in the abortion industry, a few people like Ron \nFitzsimmons, the head of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers \nwho came out and told the truth. He said, ``I lied through my teeth.'' \nNow we know, and in spite of the fact that we know, we still are faced \nwith a nominee for Surgeon General who won't oppose this brutal \nprocedure.\n  With all the problems we face in America today, all the terrible \nthings, what is wrong with our country when we can't get enough people \nin the Senate to override the President's veto of a bill to stop the \nkilling of children, as their bodies are literally in the hands of the \nabortionist? What is wrong with this country? What are we coming to?\n  We shouldn't even have to be on the floor of the U.S. Senate talking \nabout this. We shouldn't have to be here. The Constitution protects \nlife, but we are not abiding by the Constitution.\n  When I introduced the partial-birth abortion ban in the Senate in \nJune of 1995--we prevailed with 54 votes ultimately. I believe that is \ncorrect, 54 votes. I think we started off with maybe 40, but then I \nbegan to describe the procedure, and I remember Senators coming down \nhere saying how horrible it was that in front of the American people I \nwould talk about this. Well, why not? Why shouldn't we talk about it?\n  Do you know what a partial-birth abortion is? Let me tell you what it \nis. We are talking about a child anywhere from the fifth month to the \nninth month.\n  In the first step, guided by ultrasound, the abortionist grabs the \nbaby's leg with the forceps. This is the first step.\n  The baby's leg, in the second step, is pulled into the birth canal.\n  Then in the third step, the abortionist, by taking hold of that \nlittle child's feet, pulls the child entirely through the birth canal \nwith the exception of the head, restraining it from being completely \nborn.\n  The abortionist then uses scissors which he puts into the baby's \nskull. He then opens the scissors to enlarge the hole, and, the final \nstep, the scissors are removed and a suction catheter is inserted. The \nchild's brains are sucked out, causing the skull to collapse, and the \ndead baby is then removed.\n  That is what partial-birth abortion is. Let's understand what it is. \nThat is a process that our Nation's family doctor will not oppose, that \nour President, the President of the United States will not oppose.\n  There are two very famous ships in American history. One of them was \nthe Titanic that sailed from Great Britain in the early 1900s. The \nother was the Mayflower that sailed in the 1600s from England.\n  On the Mayflower, there was a group of people who knew where they \nwere going and who knew what they wanted to do when they got there. \nThey had a turbulent voyage. People died during the voyage. They hit \nstorms. It was a long, long ride, but they got here. They landed on the \nbeaches and began to found a nation. They knew what they wanted to do, \nand they did it.\n  The Titanic sailed from England three centuries later. They were \nhappily and merrily enjoying themselves, drinking and dining. But the \ncrew failed to navigate the obstacles and the Titanic hit an iceberg \nand sank. Figuratively speaking, the Roman Empire hit an iceberg and \nsank into history.\n  I say to you today, with the greatest respect for the differences of \nopinion on this issue, that there are huge moral icebergs out there \nfacing the U.S.S. America today, the ship of state. There are a lot of \nthem. Abortion is one of them, and partial-birth abortion itself is a \nbig one. If we can't speak up for the babies who are innocent victims \nof an abortionist's scissors, then we are going to run smack into that \niceberg and we are going to sink.\n  Sometimes, when we take the Senate floor to speak, we wonder how \nimportant our words are. Sometimes they are not important at all; \nsometimes they are very important. But at some point, you have to look \nback and you have to say to yourself, ``Did I sit by and not do what \nwas right or say what was right?'' or ``Did I speak up for what I \nbelieved in?''\n  I don't want to serve in the U.S. Senate if I can't do that. I am \nperfectly happy to have history judge me. Not by contemporaries in the \nmedia. I could care less what they say or how often they say it. It is \nirrelevant. History will be my judge, and history will be the judge of \nthis debate. History will be the judge of the debate on abortion, and \nhistory will be on the side of those who stood up for life. I am \nconvinced of that. I know that. So I don't worry about it.\n  I used to get upset, but today I am very calm about it. Inside I am \nnot calm, because it is a sad, sad commentary on America. That iceberg \nlooms out there, and it is big. With three more votes in the U.S. \nSenate, we could melt that iceberg and take it out of the way of the \nAmerican ship of state.\n  We could get those three votes if we had a Surgeon General and a \nPresident who had the courage to hold a two minute press conference to \nsay: ``This is wrong, this is wrong. You know, I've thought about this. \nI'm for abortion but this is infanticide'' We could succeed if the \nPresident came to the same conclusion that Senator Pat Moynihan did and \nsaid, ``This is wrong. I am going to stop it. You send me that bill \nagain and I won't veto it. And I'll send you a Surgeon General who will \nspeak out against this and let's try to stop this brutal procedure that \ntakes innocent life in such a brutal way.''\n  I can't get a hard-and-fast number for how many partial-birth \nabortions are performed. Nobody will really talk about it but it is \nestimated to be several thousand. You have to ask yourself, what those \nseveral thousand human beings would have done with their lives. Just as \nwe must ask the same question about each of the more than one million \nhuman beings destroyed by abortion every year in this country. We will \nnever know. Is there a President of the United States in that group? Is \nthere a doctor who will find a cure for cancer or a preacher who will \nsave some souls? We will never know. They never had a chance. This \nNation, but for three votes, stands by and lets it happen, to several \nthousand of these children even as they leave the birth canal.\n\n[[Page S480]]\n\n  And this Senate tomorrow will vote to make Surgeon General a man who \nwon't speak out against it.\n  When this debate began in 1995, some worked hard to hide the truth. \nBut Ron Fitzsimmons had the courage to speak out and admit, ``I lied \nthrough my teeth.'' They denied there was such a thing as a partial-\nbirth abortion. ``It's a phrase that was coined by the pro-life \nlobby,'' they said, ``There's no such thing.'' And when they had to \nadmit that there was such a procedure, they lied about what happens to \na baby who is a victim of the procedure.\n\n  But the web of lies spun by those determined to defend the \nindefensible has finally unraveled, and the American people now know \nthe truth.\n  And how do our two great political parties face up to this truth? In \none political party, there is not even an issue. That party doesn't \nmake any comment on life. Abortion is fine in that political party. In \nmy political party, we take a position in favor of life. But--and this \nis the part that sends me in orbit--we say ``be pro-life but don't talk \nabout it. It offends too many people. Just say, `I'm pro-life, what's \nyour next question? Is there a question on Iraq or maybe a question on \neducation? Could we talk about something else?' '' I have been hearing \nit for 13 years in politics. All the consultants say, ``Don't talk \nabout abortion.''\n  Well, I did in my last election. They tried to make me pay the price \nfor it. I barely won, but I won, and you know what: If I had lost, I \nwould have lost because I believed in something, and I would have gone \non with my life.\n  I often wonder what would Lincoln have said about this, or what would \nJefferson have said? It is really sad; it is really sad.\n  In 1995, the abortion industry said that all of these procedures are \nperformed in situations where the mother's well-being is imperiled. But \nthen the American Medical Association endorsed a ban on partial-birth \nabortions. And both Houses of Congress passed such a ban. And now only \nBill Clinton and his veto pen prevent us from stopping this procedure.\n  So as we consider Dr. Satcher's fitness to fill an office that \nprovides a bully pulpit on matters of health, I believe that it is \nappropriate to inquire about his views on the subject. This has been \nquoted before here on the floor, but let me repeat it. Here is what Dr. \nSatcher said about partial-birth abortion:\n\n       I support the President's position. The President opposes \n     late-term abortions except where necessary to protect the \n     life and health of the mother.\n\n  The partial-birth abortion ban bills passed by Congress protect the \nlife of the mother. But the President's insistence on a ``health'' \nexception is really a demand for language so broad that courts will \ninterpret it to mean partial-birth abortion-on-demand. For that reason, \nwe must ask: Does politics or science guide Dr. Satcher's abortion \nviews? The Physicians' Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth, a nationwide \ncoalition of hundreds of doctors formed to refute misinformation about \npartial-birth abortion, has asked why Dr. Satcher is so far out of the \nmainstream on partial-birth abortion. Physicians' Ad Hoc Coalition for \nTruth--citing the opinions of doctors holding a variety of views on the \nbroader issue of abortion, including the American Medical Association--\nhave concluded there is no medical reason for using this barbaric \npartial-birth abortion procedure. They express concern that Dr. Satcher \n``may be relying on politics rather than medicine in reaching his \nconclusions about abortion.''\n  The ``life-and-health'' position is a political position. Worse, is \npolitics that will cost the lives of innocent unborn children.\n  It is amazing really to look at the intensity of the attacks on those \nof us who stand up here and speak out on this issue. They are venomous, \nthey are vicious, but it's worth it.\n  Someday I will look back. If any of my grandchildren ask me where I \nwas when this issue was being debated, I can tell them in good \nconscience where I was. I am proud to be here today on the Senate floor \ndefending unborn children in the context of this nomination. I am proud \nto be here. I wish I did not have to be here because we should not have \nto stand here on the floor of the Senate to do this because it is a \nright that these children have under the Constitution, one outrageous \nSupreme Court decision notwithstanding.\n  Mr. President, I will oppose President Clinton's choice of Dr. \nSatcher for the position of Surgeon General. I will make that vote \nproudly. It is the least we can do when, as a result of the President's \nposition--the position upheld by the nominee under consideration \ntoday--thousands of innocent lives will be brutally extinguished.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand that we are under a time \ncontrol. Am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So I will yield myself such time as I might use on \nbehalf of those who are supporting Dr. Satcher.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I, first of all, again want to commend \nthe Senate leadership for moving to consideration of the nomination of \nDr. Satcher. It is long past time for the Senate to vote on his \nnomination to be Surgeon General. It is long past time for the country \nto have a Surgeon General and have an Assistant Secretary for Health. \nAnd it is important that we make a judgment, which we will do tomorrow. \nI believe there will be strong bipartisan support, as there should be, \nfor this really extraordinary, outstanding nominee.\n  I listened with interest and read a good part of the debate. Mr. \nPresident, the discussion thus far is a very brief sketch of Dr. \nSatcher's extraordinary achievements. He rose from poverty, obtained \nhis doctorate and medical degree. He has been published in many of the \nscientific publications. He has been recognized with honorary degrees \nand various awards over the course of his lifetime.\n  He has been endorsed by an overwhelming number of groups and \norganizations. When you look through the list virtually every medical \nassociation--the American Medical Association, the Academy of \nPediatrics, the Public Health Physicians--and the list goes on and on; \nvirtually all of the nursing associations; the hospitals; the principal \npharmaceutical companies; the major academic centers; the Association \nof American Medical Colleges; virtually all the children's groups, such \nas the Children's Defense Fund, the Children's Health Fund; virtually \nall of the allied health groups, the Cancer Society, the Lung \nAssociation, the Public Health Association, the Association for \nMaternal and Child Health Programs, the National Mental Health \nAssociation; all of the disability groups, the March of Dimes, National \nMultiple Sclerosis--again the list goes on--women's groups, such as the \nWomen's Legal Defense Fund, the Breast Cancer Coalition, the National \nBlack Women's Health Project, the National Asian Women's Health \nOrganization; virtually all the senior groups, the National Council of \nSenior Citizens; and very strong support from the various religious \ngroups; virtually all of the civil rights groups, law enforcement \nsocieties, the other groups; family, violence prevention, and a number \nof extraordinary individuals.\n  I do not agree with all of these organizations on all of their \nvarious matters, but the breadth of the type of support that we have \nhere, virtual uniformity, the men and women who have judged him on the \nbasis of his professional life and also about his commitment and \ncaring, it is virtually uniform. And these are the men and women, the \norganizations, who over a lifetime have been associated with this \nreally extraordinary individual.\n  It is interesting. Are all these groups and individuals that support \nDr. Satcher out of step with those that have spelled out their \nreservations about him? I daresay, this is about as mainstream a group \nof organizations as we would find in our country. Basically, it is a \ngroup of organizations that understand the extraordinary life and \nachievements and accomplishments of a very, very exceptional \nindividual.\n  Mr. President, Dr. Satcher's life story is the story of America at \nits best. He eminently deserves the Senate's overwhelming support and \nconfirmation.\n\n[[Page S481]]\n\n  Dr. Satcher learned his work ethic early. As a young boy in rural \nAlabama, he often rose before dawn to work on his family's farm before \nheading off to his segregated school. In addition to helping on the \nfarm, he worked after school and on weekends in the foundry where his \nfather worked for some 55 years.\n  His extraordinary ability was evident early. He did so well in high \nschool that he sometimes substituted for the school's chemistry teacher \nand other teachers when they were ill.\n  Dr. Satcher rose above the poverty and racism of his youth to become \na national public health leader. His early commitment to his family, \nhis education, and his community reflect the best American values. \nToday, he is a respected family doctor. He is a respected researcher \nand educator and public health leader. He is a role model for everyone, \nespecially those from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n  Before becoming the director of the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, Dr. Satcher was President of Meharry Medical College in \nNashville, the Nation's largest private historically black institution \nfor educating physicians, other health care professionals, and medical \nresearchers.\n  This is a nominee whose whole life has been committed to making \nhealth better for fellow citizens, as an educator, practicing \nphysician, and as a teacher. How fortunate we are to have this nominee.\n  Earlier in his career, before he served as president of Meharry, he \nserved as professor and chairman of the Department of Community \nMedicine and Family Practice at Morehouse School of Medicine in \nAtlanta. He served on the faculty of UCLA School of Medicine and the \nKing/Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles, one of the top medical \nteaching schools in the country.\n  For 5 years, Dr. Satcher ably led the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention in Atlanta, the Federal agency responsible for protecting \nthe Nation's health and preventing disease, injury and premature death.\n  Dr. Satcher has many accomplishments as director of the CDC. In 1992, \nunder his leadership, CDC developed and implemented the extraordinarily \nsuccessful childhood immunization initiative. Before the initiative \nthat was developed, only a little more than half of the Nation's \nchildren--55 percent--were immunized. Today, it is 78 percent. As a \nresult, vaccine-preventable childhood diseases are now at record lows. \nHe has borne an important responsibility. There are others that should \nshare in those achievements, but Dr. Satcher was there and fighting and \nin a key position to make a very, very important difference--and he \nhas, and he will.\n  Dr. Satcher has also led the CDC efforts to deal more effectively \nwith infectious diseases and food-borne illnesses. We rely heavily on \nCDC to provide the rapid response needed to combat outbreaks of disease \nand protect public safety. Under Dr. Satcher, CDC has implemented a \nstrategy against new and re-emerging infectious disease, like \ntuberculosis, using better surveillance and detection. In response to \nrecent food-poisoning incidents, Dr. Satcher has been instrumental in \ndeveloping a new early warning system to deal with such illnesses.\n  Dr. Satcher has received numerous honors and prizes, including the \nWatch Grassroots Award for Community Service in 1979, the Human \nRelations Award of the National Conference of Christians and Jews in \n1985, Founders' Award of Distinction of the Sickle Cell Disease \nResearch Foundation in 1992 and the Martin Luther King Jr. Drum Major \nfor Justice Award in 1994. He was elected to the Institute of Medicine \nof the National Academy of Sciences for his leadership skills in 1986; \nrecognized again by the National Academy of Sciences as being one of \nthe outstanding leaders in health policy and for all of his leadership \nskills brought into the Academy of Sciences. We are fortunate to have \nthis extraordinary human being as a nominee. In 1996, he received the \nprestigious Dr. Nathan B. Davis Award given to Presidential appointees \nfor outstanding public service to advance the public health.\n\n  More recently, he received the James D. Bruce Memorial Award for \ndistinguished contributions in preventive medicine from the American \nCollege of physicians. And the list goes on: the John Stearns Award for \nLifetime Achievement in Medicine from the New York Academy of Medicine, \nand the Surgeon General's Medallion for significant and noteworthy \ncontributions to the health of the Nation.\n  Dr. Satcher's broad range of skills and experience and his strong \ncommitment to improving public health make him well qualified to be the \ncountry's principal official on health care and policy issue--America's \ndoctors.\n  Today, the public is constantly bombarded with reports about new \ndiseases from other parts of the world--from the Ebola virus to dengue \nfever to Hong Kong flu to mad cow disease. Yet there is no Surgeon \nGeneral in office to educate the public about these threats and to \ndispel the widespread concern and fear about them. The public also \ncontinues to be confused about rapid changes in the health care system, \nespecially on issues such as access and quality and cost and managed \ncare. We need a Surgeon General who can address these challenges.\n  For more than three decades, the Surgeon General has been effective \nin educating the public about the dangers of smoking. Now we know there \nare those that don't like that message and take it out on the \nmessenger, and we understand that.\n  At his hearing in the Senate Labor Committee, Dr. Satcher said with \ntypical eloquence that he would like to ``take the best science in the \nworld and place it firmly within the grasp of all Americans.'' That \nchallenge is a big part of the job of the Surgeon General--to translate \nscientific research into plain talk that the public can use to improve \ntheir health.\n  Dr. Satcher's nomination has received broad bipartisan support and is \nendorsed by a large numbers of organizations, including medical \nsocieties and all of the various groups I mentioned earlier. Clearly, \nhe has the credentials, the commitment and integrity to serve \nbrilliantly as Surgeon General and as the Assistant Secretary for \nhealth.\n  Mr. President, some of the critics have raised questions about some \nof the particular issues, and I will respond to some of those. Some \ncritics of Dr. Satcher have argued that he and CDC want to fund needle \nexchange programs that will increase the use of illegal drugs in the \nname of AIDS prevention. It is preposterous to suggest that Dr. Satcher \nwould do anything to advocate the use of illegal drugs. Use of illegal \ndrugs is wrong and is a major public health problem and a major law \nenforcement problem. The needle exchange is a strategy for preventing \nthe spread of infectious diseases by providing clean needles in \nexchange for old ones. One to two million Americans inject illegal \ndrugs. Sharing of needles is a leading cause of AIDS transmission. \nApproximately a third of all AIDS cases are linked to drug use. For \nwomen, 66 percent of all AIDS cases are caused by drug use or sex with \npartners who inject drugs. More than half of the children with AIDS \ncontracted the disease from mothers who are drug users or their sexual \npartners.\n  A report to Congress from Secretary Shalala in February of 1997 \nconcluded that needle exchange can be an effective part of a strategy \nto prevent HIV and other blood-borne diseases. The GAO, National \nAcademy of Science, National Commission on AIDS, and the Congressional \nOffice of Technology Assessment have all concluded that needle exchange \nis an effective strategy. Despite the scientific and public support for \nsuch programs, a congressional ban on Federal funding of the program is \nin effect unless the Secretary of HHS determines that certain \nconditions are met. These include a finding that the program is \neffective in reducing AIDS transmission, and it has not encouraged \nillegal drug use.\n\n  Dr. Satcher is an eminent scientist. He has recommended to Congress \nwe allow scientific studies to answer the key questions involved with \nthis issue. Dr. Satcher supports Federal funding for research and \nevaluation of State and local needle exchange programs to assess the \neffort. That is the extent of his position, to find out what the best \nin terms of science is going to provide, whether it does make a \ndifference. That sounds to me to be a very reasonable and responsible \nposition to have on that question.\n\n[[Page S482]]\n\n  Some critics have alleged Dr. Satcher, as head of CDC, has been \npromoting a pro-gun-control agenda. In reality, Dr. Satcher, through \nCDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, is simply \ncarrying out a congressional mandate to collect data relating to all \ntypes of injuries that occur outside the workplace, including those \ncaused by motor vehicle accidents, fires, and firearms.\n  President Bush established the National Center for Injury Prevention \nand Control in the hope that just as the Federal highway fatality \nreporting system helps to reduce unintended death from automobile \naccidents, better information about other injuries would lead to better \neducation and prevention programs. Recent public service campaigns have \nfocused on such injury prevention strategies, especially children's \nsafety, bicycle safety, seatbelt use, watercraft safety.\n  Preventing violence is a public health issue and a criminal justice \nissue. Thirty-eight thousand Americans were killed with firearms in \n1994; 17,800 were homicides, 18,700 were suicides, and 1,300 were \ncaused by unintentional discharge of a firearm. Approximately 100,000 \ncitizens are treated in hospital emergency rooms each year for nonfatal \nfirearm injuries.\n  The budget of the Center for Injury Prevention and Control amounts to \n$49 million a year or 2 percent of the overall CDC budget of $2.5 \nbillion. Of the $49 million, only $7.5 million is spent on research \nconcerning youth violence, and less than 11 percent of that deals with \nfirearm-related violence.\n  Even that is enough, listening to the speeches in opposition to Dr. \nSatcher--a center set up by a Republican President, that has these \nbroad responsibilities, and people are flyspecking that there will be \nless than $1 million and, therefore, somehow he is going to violate \nsecond amendment rights.\n  Injuries resulting from violence are preventable. CDC's purpose is to \nsave lives. Firearm injuries have a huge impact on public health. We \ncannot ignore the issue. Instead of criticizing Dr. Satcher's efforts \nas a public health leader to address this serious problem, we should \ncondemn the attempts by the National Rifle Association to shut down \nthis important aspect of research into the causes and the prevention of \ninjury.\n  Now, critics have also charged that Dr. Satcher, as CDC director, \nconducted HIV studies on newborns and allowed them to be sent home \nwithout informing parents of the HIV status of their children. This \nsurvey was part of the Nation's effort to obtain more information on \nthe spread of HIV in various populations. The survey was implemented \nthrough State and local health departments with support from CDC.\n  In fact, the survey, which was initiated under President Bush, was \nimplemented in 45 States, including the State of Missouri, when Senator \nAshcroft was Governor of that State. He signed the papers. And as I \nunderstand it, the effort was made to continue at the time when they \nwere going to halt this study.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Briefly.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Does the Senator purport to know when those papers were \nsigned and what the condition of AIDS research was at the time?\n\n  I think the Senator indicated that the Governor of Missouri had \nsigned papers, I take it, personally signed papers in this respect; is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is my understanding, that these papers were approved \neither by the Governors of the States or their Administrators and that \nyou signed for your state.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Does the Senator have a copy of that?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will make it available later on this afternoon.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Do you know what date it was in which that study was \ncommenced?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand, the way it was represented to me, when \nyou were Governor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The Senator from Missouri had the privilege of being \nGovernor for a period of time that spanned 8 years, and during that \ntime there were substantial changes made in terms of the known \ntreatments for AIDS. Since that time there have been substantial \nchanges made, not the least of which is the O76 regimen for AZT \ntreatment of newborns and expectant mothers.\n  Do you know whether or not at the time of this alleged signature by \nthe then Governor of Missouri that treatment was known and had been \nproven and had been developed?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I don't believe just from personal knowledge that it \nwas, but I will provide the papers during the course of the debate with \nregard to this particular program which the Senator is familiar with \nbecause he has criticized it quite extensively. But it has been \nrepresented to me by the Department that this program was put in place \nwhile you were Governor. If you tell me it was not, I am willing to \naccept that, but I have been informed it was.\n  I was not aware that you had been critical of it prior to the time \nthat we had Dr. Satcher's nomination--or were critical of it at the \ntime it was in place in Missouri, but all I am saying is you or your \nAdministration signed the paper for these studies which you have been \ncritical of and I want them in the Record. I think you obviously will \nmake whatever comment you want in interpreting it.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I ask the Senator if developments in the technology \nwhich make treatment available at some time subsequent to the \ncommencement of the study and subsequent to my time as Governor might \nchange whether or not you should continue with the study, which would \nremain a blind study when treatment becomes available.\n  My question is: Is it possible that a study that is based on \nepidemiological and statistical value would have that value and be \nappropriate until such time as maintenance of a blind study would be in \na position to deprive individuals of care which had recently been \ndeveloped.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Senator, you will be able to explain it when we put it \ninto the Record.\n  This study was stopped by Dr. Satcher for some of the reasons that \nyou are just mentioning at the present time.\n  The point I was making here is that I listened to your very eloquent \nstatement and criticism of this kind of a study last week, and then in \nthe preparation for this debate found out, to my surprise, when it was \ninitially proposed that your Administration signed on for it for the \nState of Missouri.\n  Now, I am sure there are other changes, perhaps, that were brought \nabout while you were Governor. That is fine. Whatever explanation you \nhave on it--and maybe you were critical of it at the time that you \nreceived it.\n  My information from the DHHS is that your Administration signed it \nand that you never expressed any criticism of it at the time that you \nwere Governor, and that Dr. Satcher eventually halted it.\n  I may be wrong in that series of time line, but that, at least, is my \nunderstanding.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I guess I will have an opportunity to respond, but my \npoint is that it may be appropriate to do blind studies when there is \nno known therapy, but when a therapy is discovered, like it was in \n1994, a year after I left the Governor's office, then it would be \nincumbent upon one seeking to protect the health of the children to \nidentify the children and provide the information to those children. So \nI look forward to the opportunity and I look forward to seeing the \ndocuments that you would present purporting to bear my signature \napproving those studies. I would be interested to see those documents. \nI ask that you please provide them.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fine. I will make every effort to provide them this \nafternoon. Are you questioning whether you did OK it for the State of \nMissouri, or not, just so I have an understanding?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I would be very interested in seeing my signature on \nthe document. More importantly, the point is this: There are times when \nit's appropriate to have a study and not provide notice. But when it \nbecomes clear that there are therapies available and to persist in the \nstudies without providing notice, that changes the whole dynamic. I \nthink this is an essential and critical fact that hasn't appeared in \nyour analysis and maybe hasn't appeared adequately in mine. So I will \nbe pleased to discuss it, because the 1994\n\n[[Page S483]]\n\ndiscovery of the AZT regimen, which cut by two-thirds the incidence of \nHIV virus cases that otherwise would occur, changes the dynamics.\n  That brought the issue to the attention of the Congress, and the \nCongress forced the cessation of the studies on the part of Dr. \nSatcher. He lobbied against ceasing the studies even in light of that.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, I certainly agree with the Senator that at the \ntime when you have this kind of progress made for alternative remedies, \nthere has to be full notification. The point that I also mention is \nthat Dr. Satcher halted the studies.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. If the Senator will yield, are you aware of the fact \nthat after the new therapy was available and the Senate and the House \nbegan to debate this issue, even in the face of the new therapy and in \nthe face of the informed consent laws, Dr. Satcher came to the Congress \nto lobby Members of the Congress against stopping the studies?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am familiar that he came with others on that. I think \nit is an open question whether he was lobbying for the continuation or \nnot.\n  Mr. President, this survey went on, as I mentioned, in 45 States. It \nbegan at a time when little was known about the impact of HIV on women \nand their children. Studies were carried on to check for the presence \nof antibodies to HIV in newborns. The presence of such antibodies could \nindicate that a mother has the HIV virus and the child has been exposed \nto the virus. Approximately 25 percent of the children exposed to HIV \nby mothers developed HIV infection, too.\n  They were carried out by using blood samples left over from other \nprocedures, which otherwise would have been discarded. The samples \ncould not be identified as coming from specific individuals because the \nidentifying information had been removed to protect confidentiality.\n  At the time, because AIDS was so poorly understood, CDC decided to \nsurvey newborns as a group to learn more about the level of AIDS in \nparticular communities at the time. Science offered no treatment for \nthe newborns. The goal was to obtain information as quickly as possible \nabout the prevalence of HIV in each population so that the resources \ncould be targeted quickly and effectively. The survey adhered to the \nethical principles, was approved by the Office of Protection From \nResearch and Risk at NIH, the Institute of Medicine. The Academy of \nSciences also agreed with using this well-established approach. No \ninfants known to be HIV positive were sent home without parental \nnotification. The information in the surveys was used by communities \nfor education screening and treatment.\n  In 1995, the survey ended when a combination of treatment options for \ninfants with HIV and better ways to monitor HIV trends in women of \nchildbearing age became available in September of 1997. Dr. Satcher \nrecommended that the study be formally terminated, and HHS agreed.\n  Some in the scientific community have questioned the surveys. Dr. \nSatcher's opponents cite the opposition of Dr. Arthur Ammann, the \nProfessor of Pediatrics of the University of California Medical Center \nin San Francisco. These clinical trials are support for their \nopposition. They ignore the fact that Dr. Ammann has endorsed Dr. \nSatcher.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter to Senator Lott from Dr. Ammann \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         Department of Pediatrics,\n\n\n                                     University of California,\n\n                                 San Rafael, CA, February 4, 1998.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: It is my understanding that my \n     objections to the HIV seroprevalence study once conducted by \n     the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are \n     being used as an argument against the confirmation of Dr. \n     David Satcher. This is taking my position totally out of its \n     context and is not an argument I would support.\n       I believe that the study was initiated long before Dr. \n     Satcher's arrival at the CDC. When I initially raised my \n     objections to the study, I felt that Dr. Satcher and Dr. \n     Phillip Lee (then assistant secretary for health) gave me a \n     full and fair hearing, and I was very satisfied with the \n     meeting we had.\n       I know David Satcher, and I believe he has the interests of \n     all people, including children with HIV, close to his heart. \n     I support his nomination fully, and I would urge that you and \n     your colleagues vote to confirm him.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Arthur Ammann, M.D.,\n                                                Adjunct Professor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Dr. Wolfe raised some questions about ethical issues \nabout the studies in Africa, and then we find Members of the Senate \nusing his kind of statements and representations and saying, isn't this \nhorrible, shouldn't we oppose it? And Dr. Wolfe is supporting Dr. \nSatcher. Then we have these studies and hear Dr. Ammann quoted here \nabout how Dr. Ammann himself was very much involved in interacting with \nDr. Satcher. He indicated his full and complete support for the nominee \ndespite his concerns about these surveys. He stated, ``I support the \nnominee.''\n  We have heard it said considerable times over the past few days that \nthese issues were never raised in the committee hearings. Dr. Satcher \nhas the credentials, integrity, and commitment to be Surgeon General \nand Assistant Secretary for Health, and he really is outstanding.\n  I mentioned the other day, Mr. President, we have the extraordinary \nletter of support from Dr. Sullivan, who was the Secretary of HEW, a \nRepublican under the previous administration, who is familiar with \nthese various kinds of issues that are being raised and considered here \non the floor of the Senate. He goes into analyzing just about all of \nthem. I urge my colleagues who are having any questions about it, take \nthe time, and I will include it in the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Dr. Sullivan's letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  Morehouse School\n\n\n                                                  of Medicine,\n\n                                    Atlanta, GA, October 29, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Trent: I enthusiastically support the nomination of \n     David Satcher, M.D., for the positions of Surgeon General and \n     Assistant Secretary for Health of the Department of Health \n     and Human Services.\n       In light of the recent debate about issues regarding his \n     nomination, I wish to communicate with you my experience \n     with, and opinion of, David Satcher. I have known David for \n     over twenty-five years, and I can state unequivocally that he \n     is a physician and scientist of integrity, conviction, and \n     commitment. As Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for \n     Health, I know that David has no intention of using these \n     positions to promote issues related to abortion or any other \n     political agenda. He has worked throughout his career to \n     focus on health issues that unite Americans--not divide them.\n       I first met David Satcher in the early 1970's when he \n     served as the Director of the King-Draw Sickle Cell Center in \n     Los Angeles, California and I was the Director of the Boston \n     University Sickle Cell Center. I also had the opportunity to \n     work with David during my first tenure as President and Dean \n     of the Morehouse School of Medicine in the late 1970's, \n     before I served as Secretary of the Department of Health and \n     Human Services, from March 1989 to January 1993. While at \n     Morehouse School of Medicine, David worked on my faculty as \n     the Chairman of Community Medicine and Family Practice. He \n     brought a wealth of experience in patient care, health \n     policy, education and research to this critical post.\n       Dr. Satcher has devoted his entire career to mainstream \n     efforts to improve the health of the American people. He has \n     a long history of promoting messages of abstinence and \n     responsible behavior to our youth. As a physician, manager, \n     and public health leader, David is a man of tremendous \n     commitment and dedication to the health of our citizens.\n       I strongly support Dr. David Satcher. I am hopeful that the \n     Senate will act swiftly to confirm him as Surgeon General and \n     Assistant Secretary for Health.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Louis W. Sullivan, M.D.,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Dr. Sullivan goes through the studies and regimens and \ndeals with those in a very responsible way--I would say we could call \nit an unbiased way. He has been the head of the whole department, HHS, \nunder a Republican administration. He has known this man for a \nlifetime, and he has heard all of the charges we have heard last week. \nHe discusses them and provides strong support for Dr. Satcher. It is a \nvery, very powerful letter. I won't take the time of the Senate now to \ngo through the letter. It is a\n\n[[Page S484]]\n\nvery important letter, which I hope our colleagues will consider.\n  Now, Mr. President, there are other issues. I would like to briefly \naddress the AZT trials. Some of our colleagues have questioned Dr. \nSatcher's support for clinical trials of the drug AZT in foreign \ncountries as part of the international public health effort to stop the \nepidemic of mother-to-infant transmission of the AIDS virus.\n  Every day, more than 1,000 babies in developing countries are born \ninfected with HIV. Clinical trials in the United States in 1994 showed \nthat it is possible to reduce mother-to-infant transmission of HIV by \nadministering AZT during pregnancy, labor and delivery. It was obvious, \nhowever, that such treatment would not be feasible in developing \ncountries. It is too expensive and requires ongoing therapy, including \nintravenous administration of AZT, which is not possible in remote \nareas. It also prohibits breastfeeding, which the various populations \nthat were the most at risk were following. Thus, the standard treatment \nin the United States termed the ``076 Regimen,'' was not a feasible \noption for the developing countries.\n  Dr. Satcher could have washed his hands of the whole matter, but he \ndidn't. He felt he could help. A group of international experts \nconvened by the World Health Organization in June 1994 recommended \nresearch to develop a simpler, less costly treatment. Responding to the \nurgent need, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the \nNational Institutes of Health, the World Health Organization, and other \ninternational experts worked closely with scientists from developing \ncountries to find treatment that is feasible for use in these countries \nand that can reduce the devastating toll of HIV on their children.\n  In cooperation with experts and leaders from countries where the \nstudies were to be conducted and with careful input from ethical \ncommittees, it was recommended that placebo-controlled trials offer the \nbest option for a rapid and scientifically valid assessment of \nalternative treatments to prevent mother-to-infant transmission of HIV.\n  The decision to go forward with the trials was carefully made by the \ncountries themselves and by the international medical research \ncommunity. They did so because it was the only approach that could be \nexpected to produce a sufficiently clear response, in a reasonable time \nperiod, to the questions that had to be answered about safety and \neffectiveness of an alternative treatment in the developing world.\n  The point is made that they might have followed a different \nexperimental design or a different regimen and could have gotten the \noutcomes, perhaps not quite as accurate, but fairly accurate, but it \nwould have taken a good deal longer to receive the outcomes if they had \nnot used a placebo.\n  Dr. Satcher has acted entirely ethically and responsibly on this \nissue. The World Health Organization and the developing countries had \nurgently requested help from CDC and NIH in designing and conducting \nthese trials.\n  Before patients were enrolled in the clinical trials, they were \nspecifically informed of their AIDS status. They were specifically \ncounseled about the risks and benefits of participation, including the \nfact that they might be in a study group that received a placebo \ninstead of an experimental AZT antivirus drug. I think that is an \nenormously important responsibility, that full information is available \nand that those who are participating in these various regimens have a \nfull understanding of the risks. There is no indication that they did \nnot. The best we have heard from those opposed to Dr. Satcher is \nanecdotal kinds of information. But we never heard that prior to the \ntime that we had this opposition on the floor of the Senate to his \nnomination.\n\n  As a practical matter, the only AZT treatment available to any women \nin these developing countries is the treatment provided to participants \nin the study.\n  Ethics Committees in both the United States and developing countries \nconducted continuous, rigorous ethical reviews of the trials. The \ncommittees are made up of medical scientists, ethicists, social \nscientists, members of the clergy, and people with HIV. The role of \nthese committees guaranteed that the trials conform to strict ethical \nguidelines for biomedical research, including the Declaration of \nHelsinki and the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical \nResearch involving human subjects.\n  Even those within the scientific community who have raised the \nconcerns about these trials, such as Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of \nPublic Citizen's Health Research Group, have expressed their support \nfor Dr. Satcher's nomination. Dr. Wolfe has said that he thinks Dr. \nSatcher will ``make an excellent Surgeon General.''\n  Dr. George Annas and Dr. Michael Grodin of Boston University's School \nof Public Health have stated, ``While it is true that we have expressed \nconcern regarding the U.S.-sponsored trials in Africa, it is also true \nwe strongly support Dr. Satcher's nomination as Surgeon General.''\n  These judgments that are made on these ethical issues are complex, \nand it is very difficult to get virtual uniformity on some of them, \nparticularly when they are at the cutting edge of various kinds of \nresearch. We understand that is part of the debate on these issues. But \nto those who have expressed a differing opinion regarding the various \nstudies, even though every effort was made to go through the various \nregimens to make sure they adhere to ethical standards--and I believe, \nhaving gone through this in great detail myself that it certainly meets \nall of those standards--but the ones that have expressed some \nreservation by and large are enthusiastic about Dr. Satcher. It isn't \nthat they reached a different conclusion with regard to this but they \nalso respected the process Dr. Satcher followed.\n\n  Again, this was not an issue during the confirmation hearings, not \nthat we should be restricted from talking about it. But it is something \nthat we welcome the opportunity to try to respond to.\n  Some colleagues have also questioned Dr. Satcher's views with regard \nto abortion. Again, this was an issue during Dr. Satcher's confirmation \nhearing. But some Senators appear eager to use the controversial and \nunconstitutional Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act to attach his \ncredibility.\n  Dr. Satcher believes--as do most Americans--that abortions should be \nsafe, legal and rare. His position reflects 25 years of medical \nexperience and is entirely consistent with Supreme Court decisions.\n  In fact, Dr. Satcher supports a ban on most late-term abortions. He \nbelieves that ``if there are risks for severe health consequences for \nthe mother, then the decision [to have an abortion] should not be made \nby the government, but by the woman in conjunction with her family and \nphysician.'' Dr. Satcher's position on this issue is shared by the \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American \nMedical Women's Association, the American Nurses Association, and the \nAmerican Public Health Association.\n  Some of our Republican colleagues have raised this issue in an \nattempt to defeat a supremely qualified nominee. They point out that \nDr. Satcher's position on this issue is at odds with the position of \nthe American Medical Association--but what our Republican colleagues \ndon't point out is that the AMA has unequivocally endorsed Dr. \nSatcher's nomination.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter of endorsement from the AMA \nmay be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 American Medical Association,\n\n                                  Chicago, IL, September 15, 1997.\n     The Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: The American Medical Association \n     (AMA) enthusiastically supports your nomination of David \n     Satcher, MD, for the position of Surgeon General and \n     Assistant Secretary for Health of the U.S. Public Health \n     Service. As Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for \n     Health, Dr. Satcher will serve as a national advocate for \n     public health and a trusted advisor to you and Secretary \n     Shalala on critical health policy issues.\n       Dr. Satcher has the expertise and talent to do an excellent \n     job in this dual position. He will bring to the office a \n     wealth of experience in both the private and public sector. \n     Dr. Satcher's distinguished career has been broad in scope \n     and deep in experience, including work in patient care, \n     health care policy, education and research. He is a \n     physician, manager and outstanding public health leader.\n\n[[Page S485]]\n\n       Under Dr. Satcher's leadership at the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention (CDC), childhood immunization rates \n     have increased dramatically from 55 percent in 1992 to a \n     record 78 percent in 1996. Dr. Satcher also spearheaded CDC's \n     efforts to significantly improve the nation's ability to \n     detect and respond to emerging infectious diseases and \n     foodborne illnesses. While at CDC, Dr. Satcher has emphasized \n     the importance of prevention. Under his direction, CDC \n     released the first Surgeon General's Report on Physical \n     Activity and Health. Dr. Satcher appreciates the importance \n     of effectively communicating to the public on health-related \n     issues.\n       Through our work with Dr. Satcher over the years, the AMA \n     has learned first hand that he is a man of tremendous \n     integrity and commitment to public health. We are proud to \n     highlight that in 1996 the AMA awarded Dr. Satcher our most \n     prestigious honor, the Dr. Nathan B. Davis Award for his \n     outstanding service to advance public health.\n       The AMA strongly supports Dr. Satcher and we are hopeful \n     that the members of the Labor and Human Resources Committee \n     and the full Senate will act swiftly to confirm Dr. Satcher \n     as Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               P. John Seward, MD,\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in addition, Dr. Satcher emphatically \nstated on October 28, 1997, in a letter to Senator Frist, chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety, ``I have no intention of \nusing the positions of Assistant Secretary for Health and Surgeon \nGeneral to promote issues related to abortion.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter from Dr. Satcher to Senator \nFrist may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 October 28, 1997.\n     The Hon. William H. Frist,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety, Committee \n         on Labor and Human Resources, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: I appreciate the support you gave me in \n     the Committee on Labor and Human Resources meeting for my \n     nomination to be Assistant Secretary for Health and Surgeon \n     General. I was surprised and disappointed, however, to learn \n     of the discussion that took place during the Committee \n     meeting. The discussion about abortion is an issue that was \n     not raised during my hearing before the Committee. I would \n     like to take this opportunity to set the record straight \n     about my focus and priorities if I am confirmed for these \n     important positions.\n       Let me state unequivocally that I have no intention of \n     using the positions of Assistant Secretary for Health and \n     Surgeon General to promote issues related to abortion. I \n     share no one's political agenda and I want to use the power \n     of these positions to focus on issues that unite Amercians--\n     not divide them.\n       If I am confirmed by the Senate, I will strongly promote a \n     message of abstinence and responsibility to our youth, which \n     I believe can help to reduce the number of abortions in our \n     country. I will also work to ensure that every child has a \n     healthy start in life. I will encourage the American people \n     to adopt healthy lifestyles, including physical activity and \n     diet. And I will try to help the American people make sense \n     of a changing health care system, so they can maximize their \n     access to--and quality of--the health care they receive.\n       As a family physician, medical educator and public health \n     leader, I have devoted my entire career to mainstream, \n     consensus-building efforts to improve the health of the \n     American people. I believe it would be unfair and \n     inappropriate to have my nomination complicated at this time \n     by an issue that has little, if anything, to do with my \n     background or agenda for the future.\n       I look forward to working with you to advance the health of \n     the American people.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        David Satcher, M.D., Ph.D.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this assurance has been enough to \npersuade many of our Republican colleagues to put this issue aside and \nsupport Dr. Satcher's nomination.\n  I see others who want to address the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts.\n  Although cigarette smoking continues to be a major problem in this \ncountry today, I don't think there is anyone who doubts that the \nSurgeon General using his bully pulpit in 1966 had a profound impact on \npublic opinion and behavior in this country.\n  Mr. President, the nomination of Dr. David Satcher poses a difficult \nproblem for those of us who oppose the procedure known as partial-birth \nabortion. The vast majority of Americans agree that it is a barbaric \nprocess and procedure. As our distinguished colleague, the senior \nSenator from New York, has pointed out, it is disturbingly close to \ninfanticide.\n  As a matter of conscience, Mr. President, I cannot support a nominee \nfor the position of Surgeon General--in essence, America's chief \ndoctor--who is a defender of this procedure.\n  That, Mr. President, is why I will vote no on this nomination. While \nI suppose it would be unrealistic for any of us to hope this \nadministration would send us a pro-life nominee for Surgeon General, I \ndon't think it's too much to ask that their nominee oppose this \nparticularly brutal procedure of partial-birth abortion.\n  But we are now left, Mr. President, with the compellingly serious \nproblem of a three-year vacancy at the post of Surgeon General. The \nSurgeon General is our number one public health official--the only \ndoctor who can command the national bully pulpit to alert America to \npublic health threats. This is a very important position. As our \ndistinguished colleague, Dr. Frist, has said, and I quote:\n\n       A Surgeon General brings national and international \n     recognition to public health problems. Their expertise and \n     credibility as well as a national forum can bring life-saving \n     attention to issues Americans may not otherwise hear.\n\n  Mr. President, I could not agree more. Whoever occupies the position \nof Surgeon General can command America's attention. For example, we all \nknow that in 1966, the Surgeon General used that bully pulpit to warn \nAmericans about the health dangers of cigarette smoking.\n  Although cigarette smoking continues to be a major problem in this \ncountry today, I don't think there is anyone who doubts that the \nSurgeon General using his bully pulpit in 1966 had a profound impact on \npublic opinion and behavior in this country.\n  And there are other serious public health problems confronting \nAmerica--challenges that cry out for a strong voice--for a physician \nwho will use the bully pulpit of the office of Surgeon General to be a \nteacher, and to be a leader.\n  Mr. President, I would like to note in this context that this \nnominee, Dr. Satcher, has promised that if he is confirmed, he will \nnot--he will not--use the bully pulpit of his office to promote \npartial-birth abortion.\n  He has been very clear about that.\n  We need a Surgeon General. There may well be important challenges out \nthere that we don't yet know about. Who knows what public health \nthreats might emerge in the next 6 months, or 12 months, or 2 years?\n  Mr. President, we need somebody on the job. That is why, while I \ncannot support this nominee, I cannot in good conscience vote to delay \nthe filling of this position.\n  Consequently, I will vote in favor of cloture on this nomination. But \nit's time to move forward with this matter, it is time to have a vote \non this nominee.\n  If Dr. Satcher is then in fact confirmed, we should extend all \npossible cooperation to him, as he undertakes what is a very important \ntask for the American people. Senator Frist says Dr. Satcher is, and I \nquote, ``an accomplished researcher with a long and truly distinguished \nrecord in promoting public health'' and ``will reclaim the integrity \nhistorically associated with the position of Surgeon General.''\n  Mr. President, if the nominee is successful, I wish him well in the \ndifficult and very important task facing him and facing the country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the President, and I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts for yielding to me time to speak.\n  Mr. President, I am here today to convey my enthusiastic support for \nthe nomination of Dr. David Satcher for the positions of U.S. Surgeon \nGeneral and Assistant Secretary of Health.\n  The job of Surgeon General is to serve as a defender of public health \nand\n\n[[Page S486]]\n\nsafety and bring important health issues to the forefront of public \nawareness. I regret the long vacancy that has existed in the position \nof U.S. Surgeon General and I implore the Senate to support the \nnomination of Dr. David Satcher and fill this long vacated seat as \nexpeditiously as possible.\n  Dr. Satcher's background reflects a strong emphasis on preventive \nmedicine and an intense care for our nation's youth and underserved \ncommunities. His expertise covers a wide range of medical fields, and I \nbelieve Dr. Satcher will certainly be a strong voice for public health \nand medical education.\n  For the past four years, Dr. Satcher has directed the world renowned \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency located in my \nhome state of Georgia, which has 11 major branches and worldwide \nresponsibility. While at the CDC Dr. Satcher has championed stepped-up \nimmunization drives, spearheading initiatives that have increased \nchildhood immunization rates from 55% in 1992 to 78% in 1996 while \nsimultaneously reducing vaccine-preventable disease to the lowest rates \nin U.S. history. In addition, Dr. Satcher has boosted programs to \nscreen for cancer, upgraded the nation's capability to respond to \nemerging infectious diseases and laid the groundwork for a new Early \nWarning System to detect and prevent food-borne illnesses.\n  Throughout his career Dr. Satcher has worked in patient care, health \ncare policy development and planning, education, research, health \nprofessions education, and family medicine. He is a physician, scholar \nand a public health leader of national stature and has received broad \nsupport from the medical community. In 1986, Dr. Satcher was elected to \nthe Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences in \nrecognition of his leadership skills. In 1996, he received the \nprestigious Dr. Nathan B. Davis Award from the American Medical \nAssociation for outstanding service to advance the public health. Dr. \nSatcher has also received the American College of Physicians' James D. \nBruce Memorial Award for distinguished contributions in preventive \nmedicine, the New York Academy of Medicine's John Stearns Award for \nLifetime Achievement in Medicine, and the National Conference of \nChristians and Jews' Human Relations Award. These are awards given by \nDr. Satcher's colleagues, experts in the fields of medicine and health, \nwho have decided among themselves to praise Dr. Satcher and acknowledge \nhis outstanding service and significant contributions to the health \nfield.\n  As Americans we look toward the Supreme Court justices as a strong \nnational voice for the cause of justice. We look toward our priests, \nrabbis and ministers for spiritual guidance. The people of this great \nnation deserve a strong and respected voice on the issue of health, an \nissue that affects every single American without exception.\n  I believe that Dr. David Satcher's strong background in public health \nmatters, his dedication and unquestionable commitment to the practice \nof medicine, and his strong and sensible opinions on health issues make \nhim the ideal choice for the positions of Surgeon General and Assistant \nSecretary of Health. Dr. Satcher will be a strong and forceful voice of \nthe highest quality whom every American can look to with respect and \nadmiration.\n  I ask of my colleagues, what attributes could we possibly look for in \na Surgeon General that Dr. Satcher does not possess? He has dedicated \nhimself to bettering the human condition and has worked tirelessly to \nimprove the lives of people throughout this country and the world. \nThrough his work, Dr. Satcher has touched millions of people, and has \nmade their lives better. We would be doing every American a great \ndisservice by denying the nation Dr. Satcher's service as Surgeon \nGeneral. To quote an editorial from the Atlanta Constitution, Dr. \nSatcher ``is the right man at the right time for these two positions, \nand the Senate, which must confirm him, should recognize that.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Who yields time?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank you for trading places with me so \nthat I could come down and make remarks regarding the nomination.\n  First of all, I want to commend the Senator for conducting what I \nthink is an informative and factual and civil debate on this very \nimportant nomination.\n  We have over the past several years had some very controversial \nSurgeon General discussions and debates on this floor. The previous \nSurgeon General, Joycelyn Elders, was controversial, to say the least, \nand resigned after one of her more controversial actions. Then, \nsubsequent to that, one of the nominees for that position failed to \nachieve majority support in the U.S. Senate and withdrew his name. So \nthat is the position that has been open for some time.\n  Earlier, Mr. President, a speaker on the floor said that those who \noppose this nomination never mentioned the experience and the \nqualifications and the life experiences of Dr. Satcher--his help for \nchildren, women, and the poor and disadvantaged. That is not true, at \nleast in my experience, having been in the Chair for the last hour and \na half. I think each speaker I have heard has acknowledged Dr. \nSatcher's fairly remarkable life experience in terms of providing help \nto people; in terms of dedicating his life to advancing the cause of \nmedicine. He is an engaging person. He is a fine person with a history \nof achievements at the institutions for which he has worked.\n  My personal meetings with him in my office have been cordial and \ninformative, and his presentation before the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee on which I sit was also one of cordiality and civility. But, \nMr. President, those are not just the qualifications for someone to \noccupy the position of Surgeon General. Cordiality and life experiences \nin the ability to be, as someone said and I have said on previous \noccasions, the Nation's doctor are important qualifications but there \nare other criteria by which I believe it is important Members make the \ndetermination. I cannot speak for other Members. They can and will \nspeak for themselves. However, I can state to the Senate and to the \npeople I represent why I intend to cast my vote tomorrow in opposition \nto the nomination of Dr. Satcher. It is based on the committee hearings \nwe have had. It is based on the answers to questions that I personally \nproposed to Dr. Satcher. My opposition is based on his answers to some \nof the questions I have raised during meetings which I have conducted \nin my office. Other Members have spoken on issues that have been of \nconcern to me--his involvement and his role in the AIDS trials in \nAfrica, his support for needle exchange programs, his inability to \nstate clearly the relative importance of abstinence by children and \navoiding drug use by teens.\n  I will leave further details of those issues to others. The Senator \nfrom Missouri has already touched on some of those, as have others. \nEach of those matters could be potentially disqualifying. The \naccumulation of those matters could be disqualifying. But for me \nultimately my opposition to the nominee is based on his support for a \npractice that I consider indefensible, partial-birth abortion, a \npractice which we now know is brutal killing of a living child who has \nbeen partially delivered from the mother.\n  Some have claimed that the nominee has not in fact stated that he \nopposes legislation to ban this practice, and he made that statement to \nme. But I need to read from the following exchange of the nominee with \nmy office as was printed in the hearing record and available on the \ncommittee's web site.\n\n       Mr. COATS. Please indicate, Dr. Satcher, whether you \n     support the President's recent veto of legislation regulating \n     partial-birth abortion.\n\n  Dr. Satcher's brief but critical reply:\n\n       I support the President's position.\n\n  Mr. President, I cannot support someone who supports that position. \nSome have claimed that they expect the nominee won't do anything to \nfurther advance the President's position on this question. But it is \nprecisely on a matter so crucial to defining who we are as a nation and \nwho we are as a people that I expect, and the qualifying criteria for \nme, is that our Nation's doctor show some independence and integrity on \nthis question. I can understand why a nominee feels compelled to \n``support the President's position.'' But this is a matter of such \nfundamental importance, of such defining importance that I believe each \nhas to speak\n\n[[Page S487]]\n\ntheir own moral conscience on the matter and come to their own \nconclusion regardless of the political consequences or any other \nimplications.\n  Whether or not you will be an advocate or not an advocate for a \nposition is not the criteria. The question is, what is your position on \nthis, the most critical of all and the most defining of all issues, the \nissue of life itself. By supporting a procedure that I personally \nconsider infanticide, this nominee has in fact joined forces with those \nwho would create questions about whether or not that is the case, who \nsupports without qualification a radical procedure that is not \njustifiable in any case except to save the life of the mother, and we \nhave heard testimony from witness after witness, medical provider after \nmedical provider, expert after expert, that it has never been the case \nthat it is necessary to utilize the procedure of partial-birth abortion \nto save the life of the mother.\n  It is a grotesque practice. It has been described in this Chamber. It \nis not justifiable for any medical reasons, and yet that is the reason \nwhy it is defined here.\n  Mr. President, we need a Nation's doctor who unequivocally stands \nfor, speaks for, advocates life itself, the sacredness of life itself \nand who will not hedge that qualification with an answer that simply \nsays, I support the position of the President. Whether that person \nprivately supports that position or not is irrelevant. That person is a \npublic figure. The Surgeon General is the doctor to whom the Nation \nlooks for advice and counsel on medical matters. He speaks, he \nadvocates for those issues, and that someone says on this issue, I \nsimply support the President's position, is unacceptable to this \nSenator because the President's position is unacceptable to this \nSenator.\n  So for that reason, Mr. President, I oppose this nomination and \nintend to do so when we vote tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have listened with great care to the \narguments that have been made today and in the past, on past days, in \nopposition to the nomination of Dr. David Satcher.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will withhold for a moment, I \nwould like to find out who yields time to the Senator?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am sorry. Will the Senator from Massachusetts yield some \ntime to me?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could I ask how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 1 hour and \n58 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I yield such time as the Senator requires, and then \ncould I ask consent that the Senator from South Dakota be recognized \nafter the Senator from Utah, for whatever time he requires?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Reserving the right to object, the proponents have been \non the floor for quite some time. Does the Senator know how much time \nwill be consumed for the two?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think the Senator from South Dakota indicated 6 or 7 \nminutes; 5 minutes?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as I said, I have listened with care to the \narguments made today in opposition to the nomination of Dr. David \nSatcher for the position of Surgeon General of the United States Public \nHealth Service and Assistant Secretary for Health, and I feel compelled \nto rise again in support of this nominee.\n  Let me make perfectly clear that I do not agree with all of Dr. \nSatcher's positions. I do not agree with all of the positions, indeed \nwith many of the positions, of the Administration he will represent.\n  But, on balance, my overriding consideration, after having spoken \nextensively with Dr. Satcher, is my conviction that he has exemplary \nqualifications and experiences that will enable him to hold this \nimportant office with great distinction.\n  I know that others, like my friend from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, \nand Senator Coats and others earnestly believe that Dr. Satcher should \nnot be confirmed as Surgeon General. I respect their point of view, \nespecially Senator Ashcroft's and Senator Coats' point of view. I \nbelieve they have raised some necessary questions for the nominee to \nanswer.\n  The debate over this nomination has focused on important issues of \npublic policy such as partial birth abortion and the appropriate role \nof the United States conduct of clinical trials in the Third World.\n  These are indeed serious issues worthy of debate by this chamber. It \nis important for this body to know what the Surgeon General thinks \nabout key issues pertaining to the health of the American public and \nthe health of our international neighbors.\n  This year Congress has the opportunity to pass historic public health \nlegislation that can protect our nation's teenagers by materially \nreducing the next generation of smokers.\n  If we accomplish this--and I think we should because each day 3,000 \nyoung people begin to smoke and ultimately 1,000 will die early from \nsmoking related diseases--a portion of this success must be attributed \nto the involvement past Surgeons Generals.\n  In 1964, it was Surgeon General Luther Terry who first reported to \nAmericans that smoking is a major cause of disease. Frankly, it was \nthis Surgeon's General report that did as much as anything that set the \ncourse that places us on the verge of this historic legislation.\n  Since 1964, all succeeding Surgeons General have played an active \nrole in warning the public of the risks of tobacco use.\n  In the 1980s, it was Surgeon General C. Everett Koop who did so much \nto put this issue back on the front burner of public opinion.\n  I don't think that there is any question about the fact that one of \nthe most important legacies of the Office of Surgeon General over the \nlast 35 years is the great contribution that these officials have \nplayed in significantly cutting down the number of Americans who use \ntobacco products to about 25 percent of the population.\n  But 25 percent is still too high because it results in an estimated \n400,000 premature deaths annually and runs up billions in extra health \ncare costs.\n  In my view, we must have a Surgeon General who is able to communicate \neffectively with the American people about the risks of tobacco use.\n  On the Today Show last Friday morning, former Surgeon General Koop--a \nstrong supporter of Dr. Satcher--pointed out that in the years since \nthe Office of Surgeon General has been vacant, certain types of youth \ntobacco use have gone up about 4 percent.\n  It just seems to me that it is critical at this time to have in \noffice a Surgeon General who can lead the Government's anti-tobacco use \nefforts.\n  From his past efforts in this battle against smoking while at CDC--\nand from my personal conversations with him--I am convinced that Dr. \nDavid Satcher can be a major public figure in the country's battle \nagainst tobacco use.\n  No one is saying that a policy of prohibition for tobacco would be \nworkable. This makes it all the more important that public opinion \nleaders, like the Surgeon General, be able to communicate the risks of \ntobacco use in a fashion that convinces the public about the benefits \nof stopping to use these deadly products.\n  I think Dr. Satcher can play the role of public spokesman in an \neffective fashion because, when the American people get to know him, he \nwill have earned their respect and will listen to his advice of matters \nof public health.\n  While tobacco alone is critically important, there are many other \npublic health issues that cry out for the national focus and leadership \nthat a strong Surgeon General can provide.\n  In many respects, we are at a critical juncture in the battle against \nHIV transmission and other sexually transmitted diseases. Fortunately, \nthe latest triple combination therapies have shown--at least in the \nshort run--great promise in combating the progression of the AIDS \nvirus.\n  But, unfortunately, this may lead some people to conclude falsely \nthat HIV has been cured or is at least not dangerous, or not very \ndangerous.\n  This may lead some young people to engage in sexual behaviors and \ndrug abuse behaviors that not only are morally troublesome, but can be \npotentially lethal.\n\n[[Page S488]]\n\n  In this regard, there are some recent indications that certain types \nof sexually transmitted disease are once again on the rise.\n  We need a strong Surgeon General to help teach our citizens, and \nparticularly our young citizens, that abstinence from promiscuous \nsexual behavior and illicit drugs is good for your health.\n  I am pleased that Dr. Satcher has a strong track record in getting \nthis message out--and as a long time health educator he knows how to \nget this message out in a way that young people will listen to. And \ngiven his long record of involvement as a health leader with special \nties to those in the minority community--from his work at Morehouse \nCollege and Meharry Medical School and the King-Drew Medical Center--\nDr. Satcher promises to be able to use his leadership position as \nSurgeon General to direct greater attention on health problems that \ndisproportionately affect minority communities.\n  I have no doubt in my mind that Dr. Satcher will be able to serve \neffectively as Surgeon General for all the people in this country.\n  Under his leadership at CDC, the agency put greater emphasis on \nprevention. I think that there is much truth in the old adage, ``An \nounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.'' Frankly, as a \nconservative, I think Government debates pounds and pounds of cures, \nhaving completely lost sight of the benefits of a little old-fashioned, \nnon-governmental ounce of prevention.\n  In the past I have been involved in a number of confirmations of \nSurgeons General.\n  During the Bush Administration, I enthusiastically supported the \nnomination and confirmation of Surgeon General Antonia Novello.\n  Dr. Novello came from a research background at the National Institute \nof Child Health and Development and did a very good job for this \ncountry. Dr. Novello spent much of her efforts on pediatrics problems \nsuch as pediatric AIDS programs.\n  Before that, I was involved in the then very controversial nomination \nof Dr. C. Everett Koop by President Reagan.\n  At the time of his nomination, many had concerns that Dr. Koop, a \npediatric surgeon by training who held strong pro-life views on \nabortion, would turn the Surgeon General's role into a polarizing \nposition because of the politics of abortion.\n  Dr. Koop and I went to his opponents and explained that the great \nchallenge and responsibility of the Surgeon General's office is not to \nstress issues that divide Americans but to act to unite the public by \neducating our citizens about the medical and scientific facts of health \nissues.  I might mention that was a big battle. It took 8 months to get \nDr. Koop approved because of pro-choice Senators. But, finally, he was \napproved and those Senators became some of his strongest supporters \nthrough the years.\n\n  I agree with Dr. Koop's oft-repeated statement that the job title is \nSurgeon General of the Public Health Service, not chaplain of the \nPublic Health Service.\n  I think that history will judge that I was correct in my assessment \nthat Dr. Koop was the right man for the job. I know that many who voted \nagainst him now agree that Dr. Koop was an outstanding Surgeon General.\n  It is somewhat ironic that one of the issues raised in the Koop \nconfirmation has also been raised in the Satcher confirmation.\n  That matter is abortion, in particular the nominee's view of partial \nbirth abortion.\n  Let me be abundantly clear: I am firmly and resolutely opposed to \npartial birth abortion. I disagree with the views of both the President \nand Dr. Satcher on this issue. I think that they are in the minority on \nthis issue.\n  Nevertheless, I don't think that Dr. Satcher's views on this issue \nshould disqualify him for this  position, so long as he does not make \nit a matter of public policy and does not advocate for it. And he has \nindicated to me that he will not advocate for it, that he will not \nbring abortion into the debate if he is confirmed as Surgeon General.\n\n  While others who have held this post have endeavored to use it as a \nbully pulpit for a controversial social policy agenda, I am assured by \nDr. Satcher that he fully understands the extreme sensitivity of these \nissues, particularly abortion. In my discussions with him, he has \nassured me that he will not use the Surgeon General's Office as a pro-\nabortion platform, and I believe him. And, with that assurance, I am \nwilling to support him here today.\n  As Dr. Satcher has written to the Congress:\n\n       Let me state unequivocally that I have no intention of \n     using the positions of Assistant Secretary for Health and \n     Surgeon General to promote issues related to abortion. I \n     share no one's political agenda and I want to use the power \n     of these positions to focus on issues that unite Americans--\n     not divide them.\n       If I am confirmed by the Senate, I will strongly promote a \n     message of abstinence and responsibility to our youth, which \n     I believe can help to reduce the number of abortions in our \n     country.\n  Let me tell you, I can't tell you how much that means to me, that we \nhave a Democrat-appointed Surgeon General who is willing to preach \nabstinence throughout this country to our youth. And to preach--I \nshould say teach, would be a better word--good health practices.\n  I have to say some of our Republican Surgeons General haven't done \nthis as well as I think Dr. Satcher will be inclined to do it. So that \nis one reason alone to vote for Dr. Satcher. And it is about time.\n  It seems to me that Dr. Satcher and Dr. Koop, while having almost \ncompletely opposing views on abortion, share the view that the Surgeon \nGeneral's post is not the place to press the public debate on this \ncontentious issue.\n  Given his public assurances--which have been butressed by my private \nconversations with the nominee--I am satisfied that Dr. Satcher can \neffectively help set the public health agenda of this country and can \ndo it in a way that perhaps no other person at this time can. I think \nit is time to get this position filled and I think he will do a great \njob in it, and I intend to see that he does.\n  I also recognize that a lot of this debate has focused on the \nquestion of certain AZT trials co-sponsored by CDC and NIH in Thailand \nand the Ivory Coast.\n  I think that this debate has been healthy and has been helpful in \nfacilitating a better understanding of the proper role of United States \npublic health agencies in conducting research in the Third World.\n  First off, let me just make the point that I believe that any \ncomparisons with the infamous Tuskegee experiments is way wide of the \nmark. Those natural history studies held no promise of treatment and, \nin fact, after a treatment was found, this treatment was denied to the \nparticipants of the study.\n  Unlike Tuskegee, these AZT trials have a strong informed consent \ncomponent.\n  These trials were undertaken in close cooperation with the World \nHealth Organization and the national and local public health officials \nof the country where the trials took place. As a proponent of the \nsuccessful FDA export bill in 1995, the Hatch-Gregg amendment, I \nbelieve that it is imperative in forming public health policy that the \nUnited States must recognize and respect the differences in health and \nwealth characteristics of our foreign neighbors.\n  What is the standard of care in the United States may simply not be \nappropriate, proper, or possible in another country.\n  In fact, as former Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Louis \nSullivan has written to me to rebut criticisms raised against Dr. \nSatcher. Dr. Sullivan pointed out with respect to these AZT trials:\n\n       Part of the problem is that the cost of the drugs involved \n     is beyond the resources of developing nations. In Malawi, for \n     example, the regimen for one woman and her child is more than \n     600 times the annual per capita allocation for health care.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                  Morehouse School of Medicine\n\n                                                 February 6, 1998.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I understand that questions have been \n     raised about the ethics and leadership of Dr. Satcher because \n     of his support of AZT trials to reduce perinatal HIV \n     transmission in developing countries.\n\n[[Page S489]]\n\n     Questions have also been raised about his role in the HIV-\n     blinded Surveys of Childbearing Women which started in 1988 \n     and was suspended in 1995. As a biomedical scientist, former \n     Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services \n     (DHHS) under President Bush, and one who has known and worked \n     with Dr. Satcher for twenty-five years, I write to \n     respectfully take exception to this assessment of the studies \n     and especially of Dr. Satcher. I share the view of the World \n     Health Organization (WHO), UNAIDS, the National Institutes of \n     Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention (CDC) that these studies were ethical, appropriate \n     and critical for the health of babies in developing \n     countries. I also agreed which public health leaders at every \n     level of government that the HIV-blinded survey which was \n     started five years before Dr. Satcher entered government were \n     ethical, appropriate and critical during the early phase of \n     the AIDS epidemic. More importantly, I agree with those who, \n     while questioning the AZI trials in Africa, strongly attest \n     to the ethics and leadership of Dr. Satcher and strongly \n     support his nomination for Surgeon General.\n       In 1994 scientists in the United States found a regimen \n     using the drug AZT that dramatically reduces the transmission \n     of the HIV virus from mothers to newborns. As a result of \n     this breakdown, perinatal AIDS transmission in the United \n     States has dropped by almost half since 1992. Naturally, such \n     an advance raises hopes of making dramatic reductions not \n     only in the developed world, but in developing nations, where \n     100 babies were born each day infected with HIV.\n       Unfortunately, it is generally agreed that the regimen that \n     has worked so well in the United States is not suitable for \n     these developing nations. Part of the problem is that the \n     cost of the drugs involved is beyond the resources of \n     developing nations. In Malawi, for example, the regimen for \n     one women and her child is more is more than 600 times the \n     annual per capita allocation for health care.\n       Just as important, developing nations lack the medical \n     infrastructure or facilities required to administer the \n     regimen, which requires (1) that women undergo HIV testing \n     and counseling early in their pregnancy, (2) that they comply \n     with a lengthy therapeutic oral regimen, and (3) that the \n     anti-HIV drugs be administered intravenously at the time of \n     birth. In addition, mothers must refrain from breast feeding; \n     the newborns must receive six weeks of oral drugs; and both \n     mothers and newborns must be closely monitored for adverse \n     effects of drugs.\n       Given the general recognition that this therapy could not \n     be widely carried out in developing nations, the WHO in 1994 \n     convened top scientists and health professionals from, around \n     the world to explore a shorter, less costly, and less \n     complicated drug regimen that could be used in developing \n     countries. The meeting concluded that the best way to \n     determine efficacy and safety would be to conduct research \n     studies that compare a shorter drug regimen with a placebo--\n     that is, no medicine at all.\n       After the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) published \n     its editorial criticizing the AZT trials in developing \n     countries, two of the three AIDS experts on this editorial \n     board resigned in protest because they disagreed. Many other \n     outstanding biomedical scientists and ethicists have since \n     taken issue with the NEJM editorial.\n       As one who feels strongly about what happened in Tuskegee, \n     let me say that it is utterly inappropriate to compare these \n     trials with Tuskegee where established treatment was withheld \n     so that the course of the disease could be observed while \n     these men died. The AZT trials being carried out in \n     developing countries are for the purpose of developing \n     treatment that is appropriate, effective and safe to prevent \n     the spread of HIV from mother to child. Unlike Tuskegee, \n     these programs have a very strong informed consent component.\n       Likewise, I do not believe that criticism of the blinded-\n     surveys of childbearing women is appropriate. These surveys, \n     which started in 1988, five years before Dr. Satcher came to \n     government, were supported by public health leaders at every \n     level. They were considered to be the best way to monitor the \n     evolving epidemic during that very difficult period when we \n     knew so little of the nature of the problem and virtually no \n     treatment was available. These surveys use discarded blood \n     from which all identifying information had been removed, to \n     measure the extent of the HIV problem in various communities \n     and groups. The information was invaluable to state and local \n     communities in planning education and screening programs. \n     Using these surveys we were able to document that the \n     percentage of women infected with HIV grew from 7% in 1985, \n     to almost 20% in 1995. At no time was any baby, known to be \n     positive for HIV, sent home without the parents being \n     informed.\n       Again, I acknowledge the right to criticize Dr. Satcher, \n     the nominee for Surgeon General. But, I believe that Dr. \n     Satcher's long and distinguished career speaks for itself \n     relative to his commitment to ethical behavior, service to \n     the disadvantaged, to excellence in health care and research \n     and to human dignity.\n       Should you wish, I would be happy to review any of the \n     areas where there is any remaining confusion or questions.\n       With best wishes and regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Louis W. Sullivan, M.D.,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me be clear: This economic circumstance is a sad fact \nof life in many developing nations but it is a fact of life \nnevertheless.\n  A key question is how best to bring new treatments and new hope to \nthese underprivileged peoples around the world.\n  As Dr. Sullivan goes on to explain what happened in the construction \nof these trials you can see that the U.S. standard of care--the so-\ncalled long course AZT treatment could not serve as the proper \nbaseline:\n\n       Given the general recognition that this therapy could not \n     be widely carried out in developing nations, the WHO in 1994 \n     convened top scientists and health professionals from around \n     the world to explore a shorter, less costly, and less \n     complicated drug regimen that could be used in developing \n     countries. This meeting concluded that the best way to \n     determine efficacy and safety could be to conduct research \n     studies that compare a shorter drug regimen with a placebo--\n     that is, no medicine at all.\n\n  Let me just go on to tell you what Dr. Sullivan--the Bush \nAdministration's HHS Secretary who is currently President of the \nMorehouse School of Medicine--thinks about the comparison of this study \nto the Tuskegee study:\n\n       As one who feels strongly about what happened in Tuskegee, \n     let me say that it is utterly inappropriate to compare these \n     trials with Tuskegee where established treatment was withheld \n     so that the course of the disease could be observed while \n     these men died. The AZT trials being carried out in \n     developing countries are for the purpose of developing \n     treatment that is appropriate, effective and safe to prevent \n     the spread of HIV from mother to child.\n\n  Dr. Sullivan is joined in his opinion by many health experts such as \nthe American Medical Association and the American Academy of \nPediatrics, that support Dr. Satcher.\n  Let me just conclude that I respect the views of those who have \nraised issues about this nominee. I certainly respect their right to \nraise these issues, but when I weigh all the evidence, I come to the \nconclusion that Dr. Satcher's nomination should be strongly supported.\n  Frankly, I find his life inspiring. He comes from humble roots. He is \nan American success story. He is a good man. And I judge that he will \nbe a fair man. I am confident that if we confirm him, David Satcher \nwill do his best to advance and protect the health of the American \npublic.\n  I do not agree with all his views but I do believe that this good \nAmerican merits our votes.\n  Let me mention a few of Dr. Satcher's accomplishments both before and \nduring his tenure at CDC:\n  Dr. Satcher has led an international effort to reduce transmission of \nHIV from mother to child;\n  He has worked to close the health gap between the ``haves'' and the \n``have-nots.'' He was the Chair of Community and Family Medicine at \nMorehouse College. He served as the President of Meharry Medical \nCollege which has as a primary mission caring for the underserved.\n  In fact, Dr. Satcher has led an innovative public/private effort to \nconsolidate the Meharry teaching hospital with the county facility in \norder to reduce cost and improve care;\n  During his tenure at CDC, the childhood immunization rate has risen \nfrom 55 percent to 78 percent. Over 90 percent of children are now \nimmunized against measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, pertussis and \nhemophilus. With particular respect to measles, between 1989 and 1991, \nover 27,000 kids suffered each year. In 1995 there were less than 500 \ncases, and last year there were no deaths.\n  In years prior to approval of a vaccine for hemophilus B influenza, \nabout 1,000 children died a year. Dr. Satcher has worked to promote use \nof this new vaccine, and last year, only nine families suffered a \ndeath;\n  During Dr. Satcher's tenure, the number of states with breast cancer \nscreening programs has risen from 18 to 50;\n  Another accomplishment of Dr. Satcher's is Food Net, a new \nsurveillance system which detects foodborne illnesses. It worked in \n1996 when there was a salmonella outbreak from apple juice and again \nwith the tainted raspberries from Guatemala;\n  Dr. Satcher has developed and nurtured a program to provide public \nhealth information on the leading\n\n[[Page S490]]\n\ncause of death for African-Americans between 15 and 24. These \nstatistics, along with a teenage suicide rate that has tripled since \n1950, are a problem our Nation's physicians and leading public health \nauthorities have stated they cannot ignore any longer;\n  Dr. Satcher has also developed a much-needed comprehensive approach \nto detecting and combating infections emerging in both the U.S. and \naround the world. The possibility that world travel could quickly \nresult in an epidemic underscores the need for a rapid detection \nsystem.\n  All of these are tremendous accomplishments in a relatively short \nperiod of time by a man who had just one small agency under his \ncontrol.\n  I do not agree with all of Dr. Satcher's views. But I didn't agree \nwith all of Dr. Koop's views or all of Dr. Novello's views either, but \nprobably more with them than I do with Dr. Satcher. But I believe this \ngood American merits our votes.\n  President Clinton did win the election. He should have the right to \nhave a Surgeon General of his choice, so long as that person is within \nthe mainstream and so long as that person will not advocate a radical \nagenda that divides America. This man has indicated that he will \nencourage an agenda that will bring America together, an agenda that \nwill help our youth to abstain from promiscuous sexual activity. He has \nindicated he will be sensitive in so many other areas that will bring \nAmerica together. I think Dr. Satcher is a man who, at this time, could \ndo this better than anyone else I know. That is why I support his \nnomination. I hope that our colleagues will also support him in our \nvote tomorrow. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I rise to fully join in the strong \nbipartisan support for the nomination of Dr. David Satcher, as \nexpressed on the Senate floor today, for the dual position of U.S. \nSurgeon General and Assistant Secretary of Health.\n  This Nation is fortunate that a man of Dr. Satcher's dedication, \nvision and deep commitment to public service has agreed, in fact, to \ntake on this critically important role, a critical role, I might add, \nthat has been unfilled--unfilled--since 1994. It is time to fill this \ncritical position. We have gone more than 3 years without a Surgeon \nGeneral to push Americans toward better health and healthier \nlifestyles.\n  Dr. Satcher has served the American people as a family practice \nphysician, as an educator and as an established leader in the public \nhealth arena. During his tenure as the Director of the Centers for \nDisease Control, Dr. Satcher worked to strengthen the critical \nprevention link in our Nation's public health structure. He tackled the \nproblem of lagging childhood immunization rates, increasing the number \nof kids immunized by nearly 25 percent. Rates increased from 55 percent \nin 1992 to 78 percent in 1996. This is an exceptional accomplishment.\n  Under Dr. Satcher's leadership, we reduced by one-fourth the number \nof children at risk for immunization-preventable diseases, some of them \npermanently disabling, or even fatal.\n  Dr. Satcher also spearheaded a highly successful program to provide \nbreast and cervical cancer screening to women throughout America. State \nparticipation in the CDC breast and cervical cancer screening program \nincreased from 18 to 50 percent.\n  He helped launch an early warning system to detect and prevent \nfoodborne illnesses, such as E. coli. This system was instrumental in \ntracking and containing salmonella, E. coli and cyclospora, in imported \nraspberries, outbreaks.\n  Dr. Satcher has wide-ranging support. He is clearly of the political, \nof the medical mainstream in our Nation. He is endorsed by 133 \norganizations, including the American Medical Association and many \nphysicians groups, the American Hospital Association and most hospital \norganizations, the American Nurses Association and many others, \nincluding prominent pharmaceutical companies.\n  Dr. Satcher has indicated very clearly to this Senate that he sees \nhis role as providing a focus on issues that unite Americans and not \ndivide them; that he wants to strongly promote a message of abstinence \nand responsibility to our youth.\n  In a recent letter Dr. Satcher wrote:\n\n       If I'm confirmed by the Senate, I will work to ensure that \n     every child has a healthy start in life. I will encourage the \n     American people to adopt healthy lifestyles, including \n     physical activity and diet, and I will try to help the \n     American people make sense of a changing health care \n     system so that they can maximize their access to and the \n     quality of the health care they receive.\n\n  I believe, Madam President, that Dr. Satcher's goals are squarely on \ntarget. Our Nation will be well served by a public health leader who \ncould help us foster healthy lifestyles, a consumer advocate who \nrecognizes that strengthening our health care system means empowering \nindividuals to make informed decisions of their own about the care that \nthey receive. I am confident that Dr. Satcher, a man of experience, \nproven integrity and great insight will help us make these goals a \nreality. I am confident that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nwill join me in confirming this important nomination. I yield back my \ntime.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume in my opposition to this nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, may I ask how much time remains on \neach side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has 1 hour and 42 \nminutes; the Senator from Massachusetts has 1\\1/2\\ hours remaining.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The Senator from Missouri thanks the Chair.\n  Madam President, I rise to oppose this nomination because this \nnominee has an approach to America's drug crisis which is an approach \nof tolerance--in many respects--rather than an approach of eradication. \nThat is clear by the fact that this nominee has shown a clear \nwillingness to encourage needle exchange programs and to groups of \nindividuals that want to sponsor needle exchange programs and to \nembrace a concept waiving State laws in America that are against drug \nparaphernalia that accommodates the problem of drug abuse.\n  This afternoon, I would like to take some time to review evidence \nthat shows where we are in this debate in our culture. We can then \njuxtapose that with the views of the current nominees.\n  To begin the discussion, we must understand that the Surgeon General \nof the United States has a very important responsibility, not only to \nthe people of America--advising you and me and families across America \non our health concerns--but also in advising the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services and advising the President of the United States in \nterms of health policy the Nation should be following.\n  In that role, the Surgeon General--``America's Doctor''--should not \nonly value life, but also should value the quality of life in this \ngreat land.\n  Drugs in America impact not only the quality of life of those \naddicted to the illegal narcotics, but also the children in our schools \nand the citizens of our cities. If you look carefully, it is pretty \nclear that of the number of people in our prisons--the majority of them \nhave been involved with some substance abuse in the commission of their \ncrimes.\n  The Nation's drug policy should be one of zero tolerance. It should \nnot be a policy of accommodation. Drugs are turning our once vibrant \ncities into centers of despair and hopelessness. We need a Surgeon \nGeneral who rejects and fights the drug culture--who has no tolerance \nfor the drug culture. A Surgeon General who says that America can be \ncalled to a higher standard rather than accommodated in a culture of \nconsuming drugs.\n  Many special interest groups are calling on Congress and the \nadministration to turn our drug policy into a policy of accommodation \nand tolerance. Let me just sort of try to help you understand what kind \nof an approach that would be.\n  Rather than treating drug addiction as the problem-- understanding \nthat it is a criminal act and that it should not\n\n[[Page S491]]\n\nbe tolerated, many groups have increasingly called for a ``harm \nreduction'' policy. Harm reduction advocates policies to literally \nreduce the harm of injecting illegal drugs. These policies include \nproviding clean needles to drug addicts and for some--legalization of \ndrugs.\n  This was the case with the former Surgeon General of the United \nStates, Joycelyn Elders, who actually said that we ought to just \nlegalize drugs, we should make them available on a broad basis so that \nmore people could have easy access to them. I think that is the wrong \napproach. I think accommodating drug users, I think providing a greater \naccessibility to drugs, providing safe accessibility to drugs sends all \nthe wrong messages.\n  The ``harm reduction'' school of thought is the idea that if we \nprovide people with either free drugs or clean needles, so that there \nwill be less risk involved in using drugs, that we will have done the \nright thing.\n  The Harm Reduction Coalition's Home Page provides that HRC ``supports \nindividuals and communities in creating strategies and obtaining \nresources to encourage safer drug use. . . Rather than perpetuating the \n`all or nothing' approach to drug intervention, harm reduction--and \nhere is the key phrase--``accepts drug use as a way of life.''\n  Once you come to the conclusion that you want to accept for this \ncountry drug use as a way of life, you really have embraced something \nthat is--very troublesome as far as I am concerned. I think America \nwants to reject drug use as a way of life. We do not want to \naccommodate ourselves with the concept of more and more young people \nand more and more citizens of our culture who are involved in drug use. \nI think what we really want to be able to do is say we want fewer \npeople to be involved in drug use, and that as a way of life it is \nsomething we want to reject rather than embrace.\n  I see that my colleague from the State of New Mexico is here and has \ncome to the floor. And I intend to speak for quite some time on this \nissue. I would be happy to ask for unanimous consent that he be able to \nmake some remarks, and then that the Record would reflect that his \nremarks would be somewhere outside the confines of mine. I think he \nwould probably prefer that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, if we could have unanimous consent \nthat I could deliver my remarks at 4:30, in which event the Senator \nwould be finished. It is 3:20.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes. I would be finished by 4:30.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from New \nMexico be allowed to speak at 4:30, and that his time be taken--I \nunderstand he is supporting the nomination--that his time be taken from \nthe time on the supporting side for the nomination.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I note the presence of Senator Bingaman, my colleague \nfrom New Mexico. He wanted to speak for 2 or 3 minutes on the same \nsubject. I am not sure if 4:30 will accommodate that. I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senators Domenici and Bingaman have 15 minutes together at \n4:30, and that for part of that 15 minutes we be permitted to speak on \na resolution regarding the 400th anniversary of the commemoration of \nthe first permanent Spanish settlement in New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Reserving the right to object, let me say, to the \nextent the time is expended in favor of the nomination, that I ask \nunanimous consent that it be taken from the time allotted to the side \nfavoring the nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, has time for every Republican in favor \nof the nominee been taken out that way? If that is the case, I want to \nbe treated that way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you very much, I say to Senator Ashcroft.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you very much.\n  As I said, there was a stream of thought in this country that says, \nwe ought to begin accepting drug use as a way of life. It is known as \nthe ``harm reduction'' school of thought. It is a philosophy that tries \nto limit some of the harm and to provide as much support as is \nnecessary to drug users in the culture.\n  Now, this is the philosophy behind the needle exchange programs which \nhave gained the favor of the nominee, Dr. Satcher. By giving addicts \nclean needles, the argument goes, you reduce their chance of becoming \ninfected with HIV, therefore, you improve their quality of life.\n  I, along with a majority of Americans, believe that such policies are \nnothing more than a subsidy for drug use--providing equipment for drug \nusers to administer illegal drugs to themselves, and hoping somehow \nthat in this safer environment for them and somehow that they have \nfewer infections.\n  I indicate that that is not the view of most Americans. And I do not \nthink it is the view of many sensible individuals, including Gen. Barry \nMcCaffrey, who is the director of the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy. We frequently refer to General McCaffrey as the ``Drug Czar.'' \nThese are the words of General McCaffrey:\n\n       The problem is not dirty needles, the problem is heroin \n     addiction. . . The focus should be on bringing help to this \n     suffering population--not give them more effective means to \n     continue their addiction. One does not want to facilitate \n     this dreadful scourge on mankind.\n\n  Well, I couldn't agree more with General McCaffrey. We do not want to \nfacilitate the dreadful scourge of drugs on mankind. We do not want to \naccept drug use as a way of life. Furthermore, it is crucial that we \nunderstand whatever we do in Government--we teach--we send signals to \nyoung people.\n  What are young people to think when they encounter a junkie who wants \nto convince them to use IV drugs, and young people say, ``Oh, I don't \nknow. I've been told that's wrong. And I've been told that's \ndangerous.'' But the junkie says, ``Oh, don't worry about that. The \nGovernment gives us needles. And we can do this without risk or harm. \nYou don't think the Government would provide us with the tools if this \nwas something that's really wrong, do you?''\n  I think it would be hard, as a young person who was otherwise \ntempted, to understand that the government would not be endorsing drug \nuse. What does this do to our children? What kind of message does it \nsend to America in terms of that to which we aspire? Does it carry us \nto our highest and best or does it accommodate us at our lowest and \nleast?\n  Is this harm reduction a means, by saying that we will tolerate this, \nthat we are willing to embrace it, and not only embrace it but to \nsubsidize it? And in so doing, are we willing to corrupt the next \ngeneration because we are trying to provide a clean needle? Besides--\nthere are real questions about whether clean needles reduce drug use or \nnot.\n  Obviously, the Congress has rejected this policy of facilitating, in \nthe words of General McCaffrey, the ``dreadful scourge on mankind.''\n  In 1988, the U.S. Congress began banning the use of Federal funds for \nneedle exchange programs. The representatives of the people of the \nUnited States of America said, ``My taxpayers, the people who send me \nhere, don't want to spend their money buying needles for drug \naddicts.''\n\n  I keep thinking to myself, I will bet you they don't want to buy \nbulletproof vests for bank robbers either. You could improve the health \ncondition of bank robbers, if you wanted to, and make it safer for \nthem. Under those circumstances, they would less likely die in the \ncommission of a robbery if you would strap a bulletproof vest on them. \nBut I don't think we want to do that because we don't want to \nparticipate, with Federal money or State money or any money, in the \ncommission of a crime. It is something we are against doing.\n  I do not think we want to participate in the commission of the drug \ncrimes which spawn the robberies, spawn the assaults in our cities by \nsaying, ``We're going to make this easier for you.\n\n[[Page S492]]\n\n We're going to make it less risky for you. We're going to make it \ncleaner for you. We're going to make it more convenient for you. So any \ntime you need a needle, we can give you one. You won't have to find one \nor you won't have to try and get one some other way illegally. We'll \njust make it available to you. That way, you won't ever have to quit \ntaking drugs.''\n  In 1988, Congress began banning the use of Federal funds for needle \nexchange programs.\n  Last year, in 1997, Congress included language in the Labor, Health \nand Human Services Appropriations bill that would allow the ban to be \nlifted if the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines that \nneedle exchange programs reduce HIV among intravenous drug users and \ndoes not encourage drug use. Well, I think it would be a very difficult \nfinding to be able to make.\n  Since it is the function of the Surgeon General to advise the \nSecretary of HHS on such policies, Dr. Satcher's position on the needle \nexchange program is crucial in the debate.\n  Here you have it. The law now says that we will not spend tax dollars \nin this respect unless the Secretary of Health determines that needle \nexchange programs reduce HIV among intravenous drug users and they do \nnot encourage drug use. So all he would have to do is say, well, I kind \nof think they probably will reduce--or accept a study that might say \nthat they do, or accept a study that says they don't encourage drug \nuse. And having done that, he is in the position to have the law of the \nUnited States go from not supporting needle exchange to supporting \nneedle exchange programs.\n  Dr. Satcher's needle exchange position has been very difficult to \ndetermine. It has been difficult to determine in substantial measure \nbecause they have not been forthcoming. There has been a set of \nresponses made by the Centers for Disease Control which are incomplete. \nAnd the more complete they are, the more troublesome they become.\n  A 1992 study conducted by the University of California moved the harm \nreduction debate into the mainstream of public debate. Also, this is \nthe most often cited study showing that needle exchange programs reduce \nHIV in intravenous drug users.\n  In 1993, CDC was asked to ``review'' the California study and give \nits ``opinions and recommendations for Federal action in response to \nneedle exchange'' programs.\n  In the review, the CDC embraced the study findings that needle \nexchange programs reduce HIV infection among IV drug users and show no \nevidence of encouraging drug use.\n  The CDC, led by Dr. Satcher, made its recommendations not only on \nFederal action but also made recommendations on policy changes to State \nand local governments.\n\n       The ban on Federal funding of needle exchange programs \n     should be removed to allow States and communities the option \n     of including needle exchange programs in comprehensive \n     programs [programs that share Federal funding].\n\n  In the review, the CDC found the recommendation that State and local \ngovernments repeal their drug paraphernalia laws as they ``apply to \nsyringes,'' to be ``reasonable and appropriate.''\n  So here you have the Centers for Disease Control, under the \nleadership of Dr. Satcher, saying that we ought to urge States to \nrepeal their drug paraphernalia laws concerning syringes that it is a \nreasonable and appropriate recommendation. He is sending word up the \nchain to the Secretary of Health and Human Services that that is what \nought to be done.\n  He is also saying the ban on Federal funding of needle exchange \nprograms should be lifted to allow States and communities the option of \nincluding needle exchange programs in comprehensive programs.\n  The review also found the California study recommendation that \n``substantial Federal funds should be committed both to providing \nneedle exchange services and to expanding research into these \nprograms.'' And they found that recommendations was ``reasonable and \nappropriate.''\n  So here is what you have. You have the CDC recognizing and evaluating \nthe California study. And then you have the CDC saying, under Dr. \nSatcher's direction and leadership, that the recommendations are both \nreasonable and appropriate.\n  And what are those recommendations?\n  They are to spend substantial Federal funds to provide needle \nexchange services and to expanding research into such needle exchange \nprograms, and they are to recommend that state and local governments \nrepeal their drug paraphernalia laws as they relate to syringes, and \nthey are to say that the ban on Federal funding of needle exchange \nprograms should be lifted.\n  Here you have a real conflict. You have the people of the United \nStates against providing needles for drug addicts. You have Dr. Satcher \nrunning the CDC, evaluating studies and saying that it is reasonable \nand appropriate to start spending Federal tax dollars. Then he \nconcludes, based on the studies, that there is no increase in HIV \ntransmission or drug use as a result of needle exchange programs.\n  Now, I have to say that this so-called review by CDC has been very \ncontroversial. In fact, it was made public only during the past 2 years \nafter a needle exchange advocacy group obtained and disseminated a \ncopy. Prior to that time CDC even denied Freedom of Information Act \nrequests to obtain copies of the review.\n  Here is what you have. You have the CDC on record in favor of needle \nexchange programs under the direction of Dr. Satcher. You have a \nrefusal of the agency to provide copies of their review of the report. \nI can understand Dr. Satcher's trying to distance himself from this \nreview. When I asked for a copy of the CDC's review of this report, it \nwas not forthcoming. And when it was forthcoming, it came to me with a \ncritical piece of the operation missing. What was missing from the \nreport was the letter of Dr. Satcher--the cover letter--where he is \n``pleased to submit the attached review.''\n  Now, I have some real reservations about the fact that the CDC would \nsend out the report and not include the cover letter from this nominee. \nI can understand why this nominee would not want the cover letter to \naccompany the review because he has sought to lead Members of the \nSenate and committees of the Senate that he has not endorsed, not \nparticipated in programs that would promote needle exchange or clean \nneedles for drug addicts. But I think it is beneath the dignity of the \nCDC and beneath the integrity of the Senate of the United States to \nsend out the review without having the letter of endorsement on the \nreview that is signed on behalf of David Satcher.\n  In my opinion, for us to make good judgments about individuals who \nare before the Senate, we have to expect agencies to comply completely \nwith our requests. To provide documents that we ask be provided--\nselectively--in ways which favor prior statements of a nominee, and to \nwithhold items which might not be as favorable to the nominee and to \nprovide items that might be more favorable to the nominee reflects \npoorly on the compliance of the agency. It could reflect on the \nintegrity of the nominee if the nominee himself or herself is in \ncontrol of the agency.\n  It might be possible to argue that, well, maybe the cover letter does \nnot really apply to the recommendations and maybe the signature on the \ncover letter, which purports to be a signature for Dr. Satcher, is not \none that ought to be considered, but I hope that agencies in providing \ninformation to the Senate would allow the Senate to make judgments like \nthat.\n  The Centers for Disease Control has withheld relevant and material \ninformation I believe in an effort to mislead this body on Dr. \nSatcher's position on Federal funding for needle exchange programs.\n  A statement was made on the Senate floor that suggested I was trying \nto mislead my colleagues by saying that Dr. Satcher supports needle \nexchange programs. A Senator stated that ``Dr. Satcher has never \nadvocated taxpayer funded needle exchange programs for drug abusers. \nDr. Satcher has recommended to Congress that we allow scientific \nstudies to answer the key questions involved with this issue. Dr. \nSatcher believes we should never do anything to advocate the use of \nillegal drugs; the intravenous use of illegal drugs is wrong. He has \nsaid that he opposes the use of any illegal drugs.''\n  The key point here is after I indicated Dr. Satcher had promoted and\n\n[[Page S493]]\n\nsought to promote illegal drug use, statements were made in the Chamber \nthat he has never advocated taxpayer funded needle exchange programs \nfor drug users.\n  Well, I think you can tell from the report I just quoted, which was \nsent to us finally, begrudgingly--minus the cover letter from Dr. \nSatcher--that directly contradicts ``Dr. Satcher has never advocated \ntaxpayer funded needle exchange programs.'' No question about it.\n  Let's look at the record. In addition to this, although it is \ndifficult to find since the CDC consistently has withheld and delayed \ngetting requested information to my office, Dr. Satcher has not been \nforthright in addressing his view on public funding for needle exchange \nprograms. He has embraced the lawyer speak, Clinton speak that we have \nall heard too much of in the last 6 years. When asked the question \nabout his position on the Federal funding of needle exchange programs, \nhe talks about quality science or the administration's position. He \ndoes not simply answer the question.\n  When my office requested information from the CDC on the ``number of \nneedle exchange programs, education or research conferences sponsored \nwith Centers for Disease Control funds,'' I was told that the CDC did \nnot fund such conferences. The cover letter, transmitted with part of \nthe information that we had requested, stated that the ``CDC has \nparticipated in several conferences and other activities designed to \nreduce the spread of HIV/AIDS'' but said categorically there were no \nCDC funded conferences in this respect.\n  Understanding again the lawyer speak, the CDC only funds conferences \n``designed to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS,'' therefore, we had to ask \nfor information on all conferences funded by the CDC that were designed \nto reduce the spread of HIV and AIDS. We asked for this information 5 \ndays ago and still have not received it.\n  Even though the CDC stated that it did not fund such conferences. \nEven though we have a great deal of information, including conference \nbrochures, indicating that the CDC does fund such conferences. They \nfound one ``Award of Notice'' relevant to my request, it was a needle \nexchange conference that the CDC decided not to fund. This was a Harm \nReduction Action Coalition conference that was supposed to be funded by \nthe CDC but the funding was terminated because the CDC could not \napprove the final agenda. The CDC is forthright in giving me \ninformation about a needle exchange conference finding--it is relevant \nto the request when they terminated funding but not when the funding \nfor the conference actually went through.\n  Let me go over it. We asked them if they had ever funded a conference \nthat regarded needle exchange and whether they would fund such a \nconference and they sent us documentation that said here is a \nconference which we're going to fund--which happens to be the needle \nexchange advocacy group we already have talked about today--but the \nfunding was terminated because we could not agree on the final agenda. \nThey understood that they wanted to support Dr. Satcher's \nrepresentations to Senators and to the members of the committee of the \nSenate that he does not support needle exchange programs.\n  So we will look at the record. First, he submitted the review I just \nmentioned recommending the end to the Federal ban. Under Dr. Satcher's \nleadership the CDC has cosponsored conferences designed to advance the \nneedle exchange agenda.\n  I have mentioned the cover letter that I was sent by the Department \nof Health and Human Services Legislative Affairs Office, but now I \nquote:\n\n       The CDC does not provide funds to support needle exchange \n     programs, nor has the CDC directly funded any educational \n     research conference on needle exchange, although CDC has, of \n     course, participated in several conferences and other \n     activities designed to reduce the spread of AIDS.\n\n  What you have here is I have asked them if they ever \nsupport conferences on needle exchange. They say no. They say we can \nshow you a document of a conference we denied because it had needle \nexchange in it. And then outside of their own response with documents \nwe get this logo from a conference sponsored by CDC ``Getting the \nPoint.'' I do not think it takes a rocket scientist to know that this \nis a needle. ``A conference about clean needle programs sponsored by \nthe Chicago Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention.''\n\n  Now, it may be a coincidence that the Centers for Disease Control \nprovided me information about a conference which they were going to \nfund but then terminated the funding, but when I have asked for \ninformation from them about conferences which they did sponsor and they \nomit those carefully--but I doubt it.\n  It may be a coincidence that they omitted the cover letter which \nprovided Dr. Satcher's direct connection to the assessment of the \nCenters for Disease Control for Federal funding for clean needles and \nfor the conclusions of the California study--which--incidentally are \nnot based on good science--but I doubt it.\n  It seems like it is all too convenient that this agency--in pursuit \nof this nomination--selectively has provided to the Senate those things \nwhich reinforce the stated position, the public position of the nominee \nand has then deleted from the record those things which do not comport \nwith the position of the nominee.\n  It not only happened as it related to the cover letter on the \nevaluation of the California study; it happened when we wanted to know \nwhether we really find ourselves sponsoring clean needle conferences \nand agendas around the country. And conveniently enough the cover \nletter was deleted and conveniently enough the conference that was \nfunded was deleted, but the conference which was not funded was \nincluded in the evidence.\n  I quote from a letter from the Illinois Drug Education Alliance--who \nattended this Chicago--``Getting the Point'' Conference which was \naddressed to Dr. Satcher.\n\n       Dear Director Satcher. As President of the Illinois Drug \n     Education Alliance, I take strong exception to how the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are promoting \n     clean needle programs in the State of Illinois. My \n     understanding is that no Federal money is to be spent on \n     clean needle programs, so I do not understand how the CDC can \n     justify promoting clean needle programs.\n       In Chicago, on June 30, 1997, the Chicago Department of \n     Public Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     cosponsored a conference ``Getting The Point'' on clean \n     needle programs. I was one of three IDEA (Illinois Drug \n     Education Alliance) board Members who attended the \n     conference, and I can personally testify that it was totally \n     weighted toward clean needle programs. There were no (in \n     italics ``N-O'') speakers presenting the opposite view.\n\n  Judy Kreamer, the President of the Illinois Drug Education Alliance, \npersists to write:\n\n       We were further alarmed to learn that the CDC is providing \n     technical assistance and financial support for another \n     conference ``HIV Prevention Among Injection Drug Users.'' \n     This Illinois Department of Public Health conference also \n     presents a clearly biased perspective. After a number of \n     telephone calls and cooperation of IDPH, we were able to \n     include a panel, featuring a nationally known expert, to \n     present the opposing view.\n\n  Critical point. The kind of representations made by Dr. Satcher to \nMembers of the Senate have been that he opposes Federal funding, does \nnot advocate Federal funding for clean needle programs.\n  That was made so convincingly to a number of Members of this body \nthat when I rose to say early in the debate that he advocated clean-\nneedle programs or needle exchange programs, there were those who rose \nto vociferously contradict it and assure us that that was not the case. \nI think this evidence speaks for itself.\n  One, he has endorsed the report saying it's reasonable and \nappropriate to have substantial Federal funding for clean-needle \nprograms. No. 2, he has endorsed a report saying it's reasonable and \nappropriate to urge that the State laws be changed so that drug \nparaphernalia laws provide an exception for needles and syringes. \nSecondly, there is clear evidence, when all the evidence is in--or at \nleast when enough evidence is finally provided--that not only did the \nDepartment fail to provide us with notice of the clean-needle programs, \nthere was a selective provision of material requested by the Senate, \nand that is very, very distressing. The reasoning for not providing the \nletter was that it was just a transmittal letter, although they did \nsend us, of\n\n[[Page S494]]\n\ncourse, a substantial amount of information. I would like to submit the \nconference agenda and letter for the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSelected Readings Regarding HIV/AIDS and Access to Sterile Syringes and \n                                Needles\n\n\n                               disclaimer\n\n     (The following printed materials are provided as background \n     for the ``Getting the Point'' conference.

Madam President, the CDC claims it does not sponsor \nneedle exchange conferences. Two times during the confirmation process, \nDr. Satcher was given the opportunity to make his position on Federal \nfunding for needle exchange programs known. Both times, in response to \nwritten questions, he wrote:\n\n       I believe that, as a nation, we must remain open to the \n     input of quality science. Secretary Shalala's 1997 report to \n     Congress concluded that needle exchange programs ``can be an \n     effective component of a comprehensive strategy to prevent \n     HIV and other blood-borne infectious diseases in communities \n     that choose to include them.'' At the same time, the \n     administration's position on Federal funding of needle \n     exchange programs is that we do not have adequate science to \n     conclude that such programs do not encourage drug use in \n     communities. Thus, we have not asked that the ban on Federal \n     funding for these programs be lifted.\n\n  Dr. Satcher was asked and given the opportunity to state clearly, in \nwriting, what his position was, and it is pretty clear that this answer \nis consistent with the way they responded to my request for documents. \nAsked about his commitment to a clean-needle program, he said that he \nbelieved we must remain open to the input of quality science, and then \nhe cited the administration's position. Well, quality science without \nvalues can be dangerous.\n  The Surgeon General of the United States should reject such policies \nas an acceptance of defeat and an embrace of hopelessness. We should \nnot decide we are going to accept drugs as a way of life in the United \nStates. We should not spend resources providing clean needles to drug \naddicts or for conferences that promote the distribution of clean \nneedles.\n  In theory, there are those who really think clean needles would help. \nIn practice it doesn't work that way. Let me just give you some \ninformation about needle exchange programs.\n  First, needles are not always exchanged. Therefore, they do not keep \ndirty needles out of our communities. The New York Times' reporter went \ninto a needle exchange center and received 20 syringes without \nexchanging any needles. His companion received 40 syringes. They serve \nthem up by the dozen. According to the Associated Press, in \nWillimantic, CT, ``More than 350 discarded hypodermic needles were \ncollected from the city's streets, lots and alleys'' in a single week.\n  Now, there's a great environment for children in America--to have \nused hypodermic needles from drug addicts discarded under the guise of \na ``clean-needle program,'' protecting the drug addicts, but exposing \nthe children of America. It is obvious that we are teaching the wrong \nthings to children when we teach them that we will provide them with \nclean needles so that they can involve themselves in drugs, but in one \nweek in a small town in Connecticut, there were 350 discarded syringes. \nYou know, of all the clean-needle studies I have heard about, they \ndon't talk about the discarded syringes. Frankly, I suppose it is \nsupposed to be laid at the feet of the Congress because we said it \nwould cut down on HIV infections in drug users and would not increase \ndrug use. Well, it doesn't ask about what happens to the children of \nthe country. I think maybe we ought to think a little more carefully \nabout what happens to the children.\n  Here is an article from USA Today, September 17, 1997:\n\n       Ms. Fiske says the exchange gets back one-third to one-half \n     of the needles it gives out. That's not ideal, she says, but \n     ``one-for-one exchange does not fit the reality of how \n     injection drug users live. Some of them are homeless. What \n     are they going to do--put the dirty needles in their pockets \n     for a week?\n\n  So the clean-needle advocates say, if we have 50 percent of the \nneedles tossed on the road or available as sort of medical waste, \ncontaminated with perhaps the deadly virus of HIV, that is a sacrifice \nwe are willing to make in order to be able to accept drug use as a way \nof life. I don't think that is leadership or where we want to lead this \ncountry. That is not the kind of health to which we want the Surgeon \nGeneral of the United States to summon us. We don't want to be summoned \nto an environment of drug use and dirty needles laying around.\n\n  It goes on:\n\n       It is 1:30 p.m., time for the exchange to close. Within \n     minutes, the tables and leftover supplies are wedged back \n     inside Acker's car. But she isn't done yet. Now she drives \n     about a mile back to the neighborhood near the old exchange \n     site and pulls up in front of a row house.\n       Out comes Kellie Jones, a sometime drug user who has spent \n     a rough 45 years on the streets. Acker gives her a garbage \n     bag full of 900 boxed, sterile syringes. By 10 that night, \n     Jones says, the bag will be empty and the clean needles will \n     be in neighborhood shooting galleries.\n       She distributes the needles, she says, because ``AIDS is \n     such a horrible death,'' one she has seen. ``The public \n     should know that this isn't about condoning drug use. This is \n     about stopping the madness.''\n\n  I think if you are going to give out 900 needles in one night, 450 \nwill come back and the rest will be found somewhere in the culture, it \nis about the madness. I think it injures the quality of life in our \ncommunities.\n  From the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, a letter to the editor:\n\n       . . . Aside from my personal aversion to the destruction \n     needle exchange undeniably perpetuates in the life of the \n     addicts, there are several other key issues that . . . are of \n     concern to myself and my neighbors.\n\n[[Page S496]]\n\n       Our community has worked hard to battle the drug problem \n     that plagues our neighborhoods at many levels. But the needle \n     exchange program gives dealers and users one more reason to \n     stay here. In addition, drug users from outside our community \n     now find reasons to frequent our neighborhood.\n       Drug addiction is not a victimless crime. Not only does it \n     kill the addict, but also, in the process, the addict preys \n     on those around him. Prostitution, burglary, and now violence \n     are an increasing problem in our community. So while the \n     needle exchange people try to help addicts, they do so at the \n     expense of our neighborhood.\n\n  You wonder about taxpayers who establish neighborhoods, who own \nhomes, pay their taxes, what they think of a Government that provides \nneedles so that addicts will come to their neighborhoods and they help \naddicts at the expense of the neighborhood.\n\n       The needle exchange people, who do not live in our \n     community, have been allowed to operate openly for more than \n     two years here, while the police and neighbors looked the \n     other way. We have seen no noticeable changes of a positive \n     nature. The drug problem only gets worse.\n       Sadly, AIDS is a fact of drug addiction. But the truth is, \n     nothing but recovery and abstinence can truly save the \n     addict. Most addicts do not die from AIDS, but from a host of \n     other tragic consequences directly related to a life of \n     addiction . . .\n\n  This citizen from Pittsburgh, PA, I think tells us something about \nneedle exchange programs.\n  Here is a letter from the editor of the New York Times:\n\n       Ever since the Lower East Side Harm Reduction Center--\n\n  Remember the harm reduction group, the kind of group that sponsors \nthese kinds of programs that have been subsidized by American tax \ndollars through the CDC.\n\n       Ever since the Lower East Side Harm Reduction Center, a \n     needle exchange program, began operating in a storefront in a \n     residential population of working poor, our community has \n     witnessed drug abuse not seen since Operation Pressure Point \n     cleared the area of drugs in the 1980's. Needle exchange is a \n     link in a chain called ``one-stop shopping.'' You can receive \n     your Government-sponsored clean needles (there is no limit to \n     the number), rob and steal to get money for drugs (or sell \n     your clean needles), buy cocaine in store fronts, or heroin \n     on any corner, then leave behind a pool of blood, dirty \n     syringes, glycine bags, alcohol swabs, and bottle caps--\n     the debris of a depraved individual. The needle exchange \n     program has legitimized drug use on the lower east side.\n\n       ``The needle exchange program has legitimized drug use.'' \n     That is the key. That is the problem. We don't want to make \n     drug use legitimate.\n\n       And by a tacit approval has invited a population of \n     predators into our community. Statistics on the spread of \n     AIDS cannot be the only criterion for measuring the success \n     of the program.\n\n  One of the inevitable consequences of needle exchange programs is \nthat the police look the other way. I mean, after all, if you are going \nto give them the needle with which they are to use the illegal drug, \nyou are not really in the position to go and ask them to stop using the \nillegal drug.\n\n       So we compromise the integrity of the law enforcement \n     community. We make them duplicitous individuals who say one \n     thing but have to do another. We make the police house, a \n     station house, a house divided.\n\n  From South Tucson, the Arizona Daily Star News:\n\n       When the unmarked police car pulled behind the Wagon Wheel \n     Bar yesterday afternoon, a young woman in a black hat was \n     squatting by the back wall with both hands on one ankle. \n     ``She is shooting,'' said Gerald Brewer, South Tucson Police \n     Chief. Brewer was checking areas frequented by intravenous \n     drug users when he happened upon the woman who stood and \n     walked over toward South 6th Avenue when the police car \n     stopped. ``Police, stop,'' Brewer yelled, as he stepped from \n     the car and walked after the woman. But she didn't stop, even \n     as Brewer pulled a gun from his ankle holster and shouted at \n     her several more times. She disappeared around the corner of \n     the bar and Brewer didn't follow. She had shot the dope up \n     and already she was rubbing her ankles. So there is no \n     substance on her. ``She has discarded the syringe,'' Brewer \n     said, explaining why he didn't chase her. After turning a \n     trick, prostitutes go to drug houses near South 6th Avenue to \n     buy heroin. Then they fire up in a vacant lot, or an alley, \n     before heading back to 6th Avenue to repeat the cycle.\n\n  The point here that is being made is since it is no longer illegal, \nsince the government gave you the needle, once the drug is injected \ninto you, and you are no longer carrying the substance-- at least \noutside your body and in your bloodstream --you are no longer subject \nto arrest, you end up demoralizing the police, and you end up making it \nimpossible for individuals to enforce the law.\n  This article is from the Vancouver Sun about Glasgow, Scotland which \nis called ``The drug injecting capital of the world.'' That is a title \nwe don't want to wrest from their control. They have a massive needle \nexchange program there that makes it possible for individuals to be \ndrug injectors very conveniently, theoretically, safely.\n  The article from the Vancouver Sun says:\n\n       Michelle is 20. She is soaked through, wearing all the \n     clothes she owns. A thin, pretty, guarded girl in a sodden, \n     flimsy top and light trousers. She has been on drugs for 5 \n     years, and sleeps in an abandoned warehouse with her \n     boyfriend, Michael, 26. Both had spent the equivalent of $800 \n     Canadian on two days of heroin. Michelle isn't sure if she \n     has 17 or 25 convictions for shoplifting. Michael has spent \n     all but six months of the past 10 years in prison for two \n     serious assaults. ``I was out of it, stoned, both times'', \n     and has been on drugs for longer. Before Michael, Michelle \n     lived with another junkie who repeatedly beat her up. She \n     lost the baby she was carrying. ``I'd rather be dead than to \n     live like this,'' she says. The unemotional delivery \n     convinces you she means it. And, as she walks away in the \n     rain, you realize that she is almost certainly moving toward \n     it.\n\n  Yes. ``The drug injection capital of the world,'' fueled by a clean \nneedle program.\n\n  As teen drug use continues to rise, as the use of heroin, cocaine, \nand marijuana continues to rise, the Federal Government should not be \nsending the message that drug use should be accepted. The Federal \nGovernment should not embrace drug use as a way of life. The Federal \nGovernment should not subsidize illegal drug use through clean needle \nprograms. And the Centers for Disease Control should not advocate \nspending taxpayer dollars to provide clean needles which will find \ntheir way into the alleys and playgrounds and streets of American \ncities discarded by irresponsible IV drug users. And people who run the \nprograms now that are privately funded or otherwise locally funded say \nthat the 50 percent return is all you can expect.\n  Teen drug use is up 105 percent from 1992 to 1995. The Office of the \nNational Drug Control Policy, led by America's Drug Czar, General Barry \nMcCaffrey, strongly opposes the needle exchange program.\n  On August 20, the Office of National Drug Control Policy issued a \nstatement: ``Federal treatment funds should not be diverted to short-\nterm harm reduction efforts like needle exchange programs.''\n  We are told by those who keep statistics on drugs that more teenagers \nand young adults tried heroin for the first time in 1996 than ever \nbefore. Imagine what would be the case if it had the endorsement of the \nFederal Government.\n  Speaking in front of a Harvard research conference, General McCaffrey \ncalled spending money on the needle exchange program a ``copout.'' He \nsaid, ``The problem isn't dirty needles. It is the injection of illegal \ndrugs.''\n  His statement, I believe, is the policy that is appropriate.\n  Here is a story from the Buffalo News, August 24, 1997 ``Accepting \nDefeat.''\n\n       The needle exchange is one of the few places where addicts \n     aren't treated like losers, although that is how many view \n     themselves. ``There is no more shame in me,'' said a 36-year \n     old woman from the Buffalo who has been shooting up for 15 \n     years. The woman, who asked not to be identified, has lived \n     in heroin shooting galleries, and worked as a prostitute to \n     support her addiction that costs more than $100 a day. She \n     wears her terrible life on a racked, puffy face. To prevent \n     three of her children from being placed in foster care, she \n     sent them away years ago to live with a sister in North \n     Carolina. But she can't stop thinking of them. She has \n     attached to her blouse a section of an old rosary that \n     belonged to her daughter's godmother. Next to it is a piece \n     of jewelry she found, a gold heart surrounded by the words \n     ``Perfect Mom.'' ``I pray a lot despite the life I lead,'' \n     she said. ``I know it sounds farfetched. It helps me think \n     that maybe there is a chance I can have my children back.''\n\n  The Buffalo News talked about the two sites which together have \ndistributed 713,000 hypodermics in less than 4 years. They have also \ntaken in about 600,000 needles, not in the exchange program \nnecessarily, many of which would have littered the city neighborhoods \nin the exchange program.\n  Needle exchange programs are not always as effective as their \nadvocats suggest to the public. Connecticut has six needle exchange \nprograms, and repealed its syringe prescription law in\n\n[[Page S497]]\n\n1992. It has intravenous drug use related AIDS at 61 percent. This is \nalmost double the national average.\n  New York has 10 needle exchange programs, but has intravenous drug \nuse related AIDS at 49 percent. It is also a lot higher than the \nnational average of 33 percent.\n  Italy and Spain have a 70-percent HIV rate among IV drug users, and \nhave never had a restriction on the sale of needles. So they are freely \navailable there. It is pretty clear, at least, I think from looking at \nthe data, that there is no conclusive evidence that making needles \navailable and providing them freely reduces the HIV infection rate. \nEmbracing the harm reduction--defeatist--philosophy to any degree will \nlead to further tolerance of drug addiction.\n\n  The so-called ``syringe experiment'' I think we have all heard about. \nFirst, they started a needle exchange program. Then they opened the \nneedle park so that they could give addicts a place to shoot up. \nObviously, it is a park in which they just allow drug use. Then, in \norder to cut down on crime, they began giving 1,000 addicts doses of \nheroin. And that will increase to 5,000 this year. This is an effort, a \ngrowing momentum, to legalize all drugs.\n  It is a question of whether or not we as a culture want to say that \nwe accept drug use as a way of life, or whether we want to say we want \nto correct this problem in America.\n  I believe that we ought to stay with General McCaffrey; that the \nproblem is not dirty needles. ``The problem is heroin addiction. The \nfocus should be on bringing help to this suffering population--not to \ngive them more effective means to continue their addiction. One doesn't \nwant to facilitate this dreadful scourge on mankind.''\n  How does this relate to the nomination of Dr. David Satcher? \nUnfortunately it relates directly. Dr. Satcher has been less than \ncandid with the U.S. Senate, and has been less than candid with Members \nof this Senate in providing his record on the needle exchange programs. \nThe Centers for Disease Control, under his direction and authority, \nselectively has provided to the Senate materials which would indicate \nthat he does not have a program supporting needle exchange when a more \nthorough review of the Record indicates that he has personally endorsed \nprograms that would promote needle exchange opportunities.\n  It is troublesome to me why this nominee would provide information on \na selective basis.\n  It is, second, troublesome to me that he would support a clean \nneedles program.\n  And, third, I would say that the single most important thing that \nmust exist between the Nation and its family doctor is the idea of \ntrust. I believe that the elements of that required trust are lacking \nin the way that the CDC has provided information, and its selective \nprovision of information and its withholding of information that is \nimportant.\n  The needle exchange program is just one of the reasons that I believe \nthis nomination should not go forward. The needle exchange program \nflies in the face of the values of the American people whom I believe \nreally endorse General Barry McCaffrey--understanding that the \naddiction is the problem, and for us to support that addiction with a \nclean needle program would make no sense.\n  For these and the reasons relating to the AIDS studies, for the \nreasons related to the deployment of the resources of the Centers for \nDisease Control to limit the availability of or access of citizens to \ntheir second amendment rights, I believe we should reject this \ncandidate.\n  I was, I think, safely in the population of the Senate believing that \nthere were no problems with an individual whose record is so replete \nwith qualification and qualification at one time. It is true that Dr. \nSatcher is a remarkable person, and he has done great things. I thought \nthat one of the Senators failed to mention that the Denver Broncos had \nwon the Super Bowl for the first time under Dr. Satcher's direction of \nthe CDC. But that is about the only good thing that hasn't flowed.\n  But the truth of the matter is that there are other important \nconsiderations. David Keene came to my office late last year and began \nto alert me to the need for us to look more carefully at this \ncandidacy, and to see the critical points of attention between the \nvalues of America and the willingness of this candidate to support \nthings like the needle exchange, and to support things like research on \nother continents that could not be done here to support concepts like \npartial-birth abortion. While all of these things are related to \nscience and can be undertaken by individuals of great intellect and may \nonly be undertaken by individuals of great intellect and training, they \nare at odds with the values of America. There should be an \nunderstanding that Americans do not want to sponsor the criminal \nactivity of intravenous drug use, that Americans do not want to treat \npeople on the other side of the world as medical experiment subjects \ninstead of as human beings. They don't want to give them sugar pills if \ngiving sugar pills would be illegal in the United States. They don't \nwant to pretend that we have been ethical by saying that we got the \nconsent of all the people involved in the medical studies when those \nconsents were not only seriously challenged--but had to be \nstrengthened--on the advise of ethics boards because the consents were \nnot appropriately obtained.\n\n  This conflict of values is at the heart of this nomination. I believe \nthe conflict is so substantial that we would be well served to ask the \nPresident to send us an individual whose commitment to the public \nhealth reflected the values of the American people.\n  I take this opportunity to thank Mr. Keene who came to see me and who \nbrought to my attention the need for this particular kind of \ninvestigation, which I believe demonstrates that this nomination should \nnot be confirmed by the Senate.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, the Senator from Missouri asserted that \nthe CDC funded an Illinois needle exchange conference ``Getting the \nPoint.'' The H.H.S. informs us that the CDC did not cosponsor that \nconference.\n  The Center's for Disease Control do not fund ``needle exchange \nconferences.'' CDC does make a number of small grants to local \norganizations to support HIV-AIDS prevention conferences, and awarded \napproximately $600,000 to 65 projects last year. The conferences can \ninclude such topics as community planning; HIV testing; counseling; \nreferral and partnership notification; health education and risk \nreduction; public information programs; and training and quality \ninsurance programs. The content of the conferences is determined \nlocally, according to the needs of the community. However, CDC reserves \nthe right to review the conference agenda.\n  The only documents CDC located that were determined to be at all \nresponsive to Senator Ashcroft's request on needle exchanges were \ndocuments related to an HIV conference in Denver, Colorado. After \nreviewing the agenda, which focused on the transmission of HIV through \ndrug use and included sessions on needle exchange, CDC found it \ninappropriate for funding. CDC withdrew its award of $4,719 to the \nconference in October 1997.\n  In March of 1996, CDC was incorrectly listed as a cosponsor of a \nconference held in Atlanta which included sessions on needle exchange. \nCDC did not fund the conference, which was held at the Rollins School \nof Public Health at Emory University, and Dr. Satcher did not \nparticipate in it. A CDC scientist participated in the conference to \ndiscuss the HIV epidemic among intravenous drug abusers. The scientist \nwas unaware that Dr. Satcher had declined to participate in or sponsor \nthe conference. Following the conference, one of the participating \norganizations released information listing CDC as a cosponsor. When the \nerror was discovered the organization withdrew the materials.\n  Dr. Satcher is opposed to illegal drug use, and would never do \nanything to encourage the use of illegal drugs. He agrees with the \nAdministration's position. While the studies summarized in Secretary \nShalala's February, 1997 report showed that needle exchange programs \ncan be an effective HIV prevention strategy, the Administration has not \nyet found a similar degree of evidence on the question of whether such \nprograms encourage drug use. Therefore, both tests--as mandated by \nCongress--have not been met.\n  Senator Ashcroft has charged that HHS inappropriately withheld a copy\n\n[[Page S498]]\n\nof an intra-departmental transmittal memo when it supplied Senator \nAshcroft with information concerning CDC's staff review of a University \nof California Needle Exchange study.\n  The truth is that Senator Ashcroft received everything he requested \nfrom HHS less than 24 hours after his request was first sent to HHS by \nMajority Leader Lott's staff. Senator Ashcroft's request included ``The \nCDC's 1993 and 1994 written reviews of the California Study'', which he \nreceived with all the other materials.\n  The transmittal memo in question, which was prepared subsequent to \nthe CDC staff review as a cover note to a non-CDC official, was \nsupplied to Senator Ashcroft several hours later when HHS realized that \nhis staff was interested in additional material beyond his original \nrequest.\n  The charge that this transmittal memo was inappropriately withheld is \nuntrue. The memo is an innocuous six sentence cover note to the Deputy \nAssistant Secretary for Health that summarizes the subject of the CDC \nneedle exchange staff review and indicates that it was reviewed for \nscientific comment by staff of other HHS health agencies.\n  If anything, the memo indicates how little Dr. Satcher and other top \nHHS public health officials were involved in the CDC staff review of \nthe needle exchange study. In the memo, Dr. Satcher states that \n``Directors of these [public health] agencies have not been asked for \nfinal concurrence on the review.''\n  It is also important to remember that the CDC review of the \nUniversity of California needle exchange study was a scientific \nevaluation prepared by CDC career staff. Most of the work was completed \nbefore Dr. Satcher joined CDC on November 15, 1993. And as Dr. \nSatcher's cover note indicates, it was not intended to represent the \nviews of the leaders of the HHS public health agencies.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the transmittal letter \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                          Department of Health and\n\n\n                                               Human Services,\n\n                                                December 10, 1993.\n     Note to Jo Ivey Boufford\n     Subject: Review of University of California Report on Needle \n       Exchange and Recommendations on Needle Exchange\n\n       On October 15 you requested that the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention (CDC) review the University of \n     California research report on needle exchange and provide \n     opinions and recommendations for Federal action in response \n     to needle exchange.\n       The UC report and recommendations were reviewed by CDC \n     staff. CDC also requested and received comments on the UC \n     report and recommendations for needle exchange from the \n     National Institutes of Health, the Substance Abuse Mental \n     Health Services Administration, the Health Services and \n     Resources Administration, and the Food and Drug \n     Administration. The comments attached to the review were \n     provided by the Principal AIDS Coordinators of the four \n     agencies. Directors of these agencies have not been asked for \n     final concurrence on the review.\n       I am pleased to submit the attached review (Tab A).\n                                                     ------ ------\n                                              (For David Satcher.)\n       Attachment\n       Tab A--Review of University of California Report on Needle \n     Exchange and Recommendations on Needle Exchange\n       Tab B--NIDA/NIH Comments on the University of California \n     Report on Needle Exchange and Recommendations on Needle \n     Exchange\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The subject of that transmittal was a University of \nCalifornia needle exchange study, commissioned in 1992 by the Bush \nAdministration. The goal was to provide a scientific evaluation of \nlocal needle exchange programs.\n  Senator Ashcroft has requested and received a review of the \nUniversity of California study prepared by CDC scientific staff. The \nCDC review was conducted by career CDC scientists and the bulk of the \nreview was done before Dr. David Satcher joined CDC.\n  The CDC staff analysis was not intended to reflect scientific \nconsensus within the Department of Health and Human Services, which \nmust include the National Institutes of Health, the Substance Abuse and \nMental Health Services Administration, the Health Resources and \nServices Administration and the Food and Drug Administration.\n  While scientific review of needle exchange issues continues, HHS has \nnot yet concluded that the conditions set forth by Congress on federal \nfunding of needle exchange programs have been met.\n  Dr. Satcher has never advocated taxpayer funded needle exchange \nprograms for drug abusers. He also believes strongly that we should \nnever do anything to advocate the use of illegal drugs. The intravenous \nuse of illegal drugs is wrong. It is a major public health problem as \nwell as a law enforcement concern.\n  Dr. Satcher does believe that to realize our goals of effective HIV \nprevention, it is vital that we identify and evaluate sound public \nhealth strategies to address the epidemic of HIV and substance abuse.\n  Dr. Satcher, like Secretary Shalala, has recommended to Congress that \nwe allow scientific studies to answer the key questions involved with \nthis issue.\n  Dr. Satcher supports the Administration's position as summarized in \nSecretary Shalala's February 1997 report to Congress that concluded \nthat needle exchange programs ``can be an effective component of a \ncomprehensive strategy to prevent HIV and other blood borne infectious \ndiseases in communities that choose to include them.'' But, the \nDepartment has not yet concluded that the conditions set forth by \nCongress on federal funding of needle exchange program have been met. \nSpecifically, it has not yet been concluded that needle exchange \nprograms do not encourage drug use, one of the key standards set by \nCongress. The Department continues to look at the science on this \nissue.\n  The federal government continues to fund the research and evaluation \nof state and locally funded needle exchange programs in order to \nincrease scientific knowledge concerning their impact, if any, on drug \nuse. But at present, this is, and should be, a local decision. Under \ncurrent law and policy, local communities remain free to use non-\nfederal funds to support such programs if they choose.\n  Madam President, earlier today, the Senator from Missouri and I had a \ncolloquy about surveys of child-bearing women for HIV.\n  The surveys began in 1988 and the State of Missouri requested to \nparticipate in them from the beginning, including while Senator \nAshcroft was Governor, the director of the division of administration \nsigned on behalf of Missouri.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two applications on behalf of the State \nof Missouri be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the applications were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                   APPLICATION FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE\n\n       1.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, last week I put into the Record a \nstatement expressing my support for the nomination of Dr. David Satcher \nfor U.S. Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health. As I \nindicated then, I believe in his qualifications and achievements, and \nthink he would serve well as the Nation's top physician. Dr. Satcher \nhas excelled in many aspects of the health care system. He has been a \nprovider, a scientist, a teacher, an administrator, in both the private \nand the public sector.\n  I must say I was impressed that the American College of Physicians, \nwhich is a very prestigious organization, awarded Dr. Satcher its James \nD. Bruce Memorial Award for distinguished contributions in preventive \nmedicine. Dr. Satcher has dedicated his career to improving public \nhealth.\n  The United States has been without a Surgeon General for a little \nover 3 years. This is unfortunate, I believe. Just last week, Dr. C. \nEverett Koop, former Surgeon General of the United States, spoke at a \npress conference which I had the privilege of attending. In that press \nconference Dr. Koop spoke forcefully about the grave health risks posed \nby tobacco use, lack of exercise, and poor diet. He did not pull any \npunches. He gave a stern lecture to all those who were present and \nhopefully beyond that, about the dangers in America to American young \npeople and to all our citizens from the so-called couch potato \nlifestyle.\n  I have reviewed the statements that Dr. Satcher has made before the \nSenate Labor Committee and he is clearly anxious to follow in the \nfootsteps of Dr. Koop and his successor, Antonia Novello. At his \nconfirmation hearing Dr. Satcher stressed the importance of disease \nprevention and health promotion. This is what he said: ``Whether we are \ntalking about smoking or poor diets, I want to send the message of good \nhealth to the American people.''\n\n[[Page S500]]\n\nSo I was delighted to learn that one of his top priorities would be to \nput the health of our children and our grandchildren in the national \nspotlight. All of these matters fall directly within the job \ndescription of a U.S. Surgeon General.\n  I might say, it seems to me what we are concerned with, Madam \nPresident, is not just extending the life expectancy of Americans. It \nis beyond that. We want to have Americans in good health as they \nproceed in their elder years, and throughout all their lives. In other \nwords, it's what they call the quality of their lives that we are \nconcerned with. It is not just living longer, it's that they be healthy \nand be able to construct a healthy life and a happy one, where they \nfeel good about themselves.\n  In the period we have gone without a Surgeon General, we have been \nconfronted with a host of tough public health issues. I believe the \nneed for a Surgeon General has never been greater. We have these \nproblems in my home State of a very substantial percentage, something \nlike 27 percent, of our seniors in high school smoke. This is on the \nincrease, not just in my State but throughout the Nation. We have seen \nwidespread substance abuse, and continued struggle with AIDS, and a \nstartling rate of obesity amongst our youngsters. They just don't get \nout there and exercise.\n  As we consider the potential consequences of human cloning research, \nI for one would benefit from the perspective that a Surgeon General \nwould bring to this issue\n  Several of my colleagues have expressed misgivings about this \nnomination. Some have raised concerns about Dr. Satcher's views on \nlate-term abortions. Others have questioned his role in a series of AZT \ntrials that have been conducted in Africa.\n  I just heard the distinguished Senator from Missouri talk about \nconcerns about the free needle exchange, or needle exchange program. As \nSenator Jeffords, the chairman of the Labor Committee, and Senator \nFrist, the chairman of the Public Health and Safety Subcommittee, \nstated during the debate on the nomination last week, these are not new \ncharges. I am not familiar with the needle exchange that was just being \ndiscussed here before, but apparently the AZT trials and the late-term \nabortion matters were thoroughly discussed in the committee and \nsubcommittee. Each of these issues was raised by the committee during \nDr. Satcher's confirmation and it is my understanding he responded \nsatisfactorily--satisfactorily to the committee. They reported out the \nnomination. Indeed, his answers on those and other matters have been \navailable for all Senators and the American people to view.\n\n  So I want to say I am pleased that we have the nomination for a new \nSurgeon General before us. I applaud the majority leader for \nrecognizing the importance of this post and moving the Senate forward \non this matter.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for cloture and in favor \nof Dr. Satcher's nomination.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I am slightly late but is it fair to \nassume that I have 15 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator is \nrecognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If Senator Bingaman arrives I will yield time to him. \nIf he does not, I will speak on my own for the 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I rise today to support Dr. David \nSatcher to be Surgeon General of the United States and Assistant \nSecretary for Health at the Department of Health and Human Services. \nLet me first say I base this on many things, but I would like to tell \nthe Senate right up front that we have a wonderful doctor who is a \nUnited States Senator, Dr. Bill Frist from the State of Tennessee. \nWhile I am not saying that he knows everything about medicine, he knows \na lot more than I do. We have talked at length about this nominee and \nhe not only knows him, but he knows of him in ways that I probably \nwould not discern from just reading the same things that my friend \nSenator Frist has read. Because he reads into some of these past \nperformances and past professorships and various things that Dr. \nSatcher has done--he reads much more into them than I can because he \nknows what they are all about.\n  Suffice it to say that no Senator should rely on another Senator as \nthe only source of why he votes one way or another, but I would like to \nsay right up front that I started with at least a presumption on my \npart that I would find out a little more and read what I could on my \nown in addition to receiving some excellent advice.\n  On my own, beyond that, I have looked at his career and, frankly, I \nthink the President has picked a very, very distinguished American \ndoctor. He has been a rather reputable scholar, a rather renowned \nteacher, and obviously a very good physician. In addition to that, he \nhas obviously done considerable research and already in his career has \nbeen the head of one of America's premier institutions that pertain to \npreventive medicine and well-being, the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention.\n  I have recently been fortunate, in turning the channels as I do with \nthe flipper on cable TV, to see a rather exciting report on how great \nthe Centers for Disease Control are. And then I have been reading about \nsome new breakthroughs they are constantly making, and some of the work \nthey do, to catch viruses and learn about them before they strike. I \nthink it is a pretty good qualification to say that this nominee headed \nthat organization during a period of time that it gained in renown and \nprestige, and clearly I think that is another significant plus for this \nnominee.\n  From my own standpoint, some may know that I, over the last few \nyears, have added a significant concern regarding a certain illness to \nthe arena that I worry about. That has to do with diabetes, in this \ncase because in my home State the Navajo Indian people and a couple of \nother tribes of Indian people are suffering from diabetes at rates and \nratios well beyond any other group of American citizens; not just a \nlittle bit more, but way, way more to the point of being significantly \nin trouble. And I actually believe that if we don't do something about \nthe problem, there are a couple of great groups of Indian people that \nmay not be around in 50 to 100 years. That worries me very much.\n\n  I am very grateful that this good doctor and others helped work on \nthe diabetes issue with Secretary Shalala and others, and our good \nfriend Newt Gingrich from the House, and in the last reconciliation \nbill, the Balanced Budget Act, we put in $150 million over the next 5 \nyears for enhanced research in diabetes in America and, believe it or \nnot, we put in $150 million, $30 million a year, for special attention \nto this disease among the Indian people.\n  I happened to talk to Dr. Satcher at length about that. While I \nassume most doctors can talk about diabetes in a very understandable \nway, steeped in facts, there is no question that he knew precisely what \nwe were talking about. For that I give him another accolade.\n  So, I intend, when it is right, to vote in favor of this nominee.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to speak on a \nsubject that is not on the floor of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I believe I have some time left. How much time do I \nhave left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes remaining and may \nproceed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/09/senate-section/article/S474-3", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S500-S502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ONATE CUARTOCENTENARIO--S. RES. 148\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, in November of last year, Senator \nBingaman and I introduced a resolution regarding the 400th anniversary \ncommemoration of the first permanent Spanish settlement in New Mexico.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Mississippi (Mr. Lott);\n\n[[Page S501]]\n\nthe Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Daschle); the Senator from Georgia \n(Mr. Coverdell); the Senator from Nebraska (Mr.  Hagel); the Senator \nfrom Texas (Mrs. Hutchison); the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Murkowski); \nthe Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Thompson); the Senator from New \nHampshire (Mr. Smith); the Senator from Utah (Mr. Bennett); the Senator \nfrom Maine (Ms. Collins); the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Nickles); the \nSenator from Montana (Mr. Burns); the Senator from Kansas (Mr. \nRoberts); the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Craig); the Senator from Arkansas \n(Mr. Hutchinson); the Senator from New York (Mr. D'Amato); the Senator \nfrom Washington (Mr. Gorton); the Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch); the \nSenator from Mississippi (Mr. Cochran); the Senator from Colorado (Mr. \nAllard); the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Bond); the Senator from Ohio \n(Mr. DeWine); the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Lugar); the Senator from \nOklahoma (Mr. Inhofe); the Senator from Michigan (Mr. Abraham); the \nSenator from North Carolina (Mr. Faircloth); the Senator from Indiana \n(Mr. Coats); the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Helms); the Senator \nfrom Iowa (Mr. Grassley); the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. Gregg); \nthe Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Frist); the Senator from Alabama (Mr. \nSessions); the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye); the Senator from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Feinstein); the Senator from New York (Mr. Moynihan); \nthe Senator from Illinois (Mrs. Moseley-Braun); the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry); the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Kohl); the \nSenator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller); the Senator from Arkansas \n(Mr. Bumpers); the Senator from Maryland (Ms. Mikulski); the Senator \nfrom Florida (Mr. Graham); the Senator from Nebraska (Mr. Kerrey); the \nSenator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd); the Senator from South Carolina \n(Mr. Thurmond); the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Robb); the Senator from \nNevada (Mr. Bryan); the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid); the Senator \nfrom Louisiana (Ms. Landrieu); the Senator from Washington (Mr. Wyden); \nthe Senator from Missouri (Mr. Ashcroft); the Senator from New Jersey \n(Mr. Lautenberg); the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Jeffords); the Senator \nfrom New Jersey (Mr. Torricelli); the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Stevens) \nbe added as cosponsors to S. Res. 148, designating 1998) as the Onate \nCuartocentenario, the 400th anniversary commemoration of the first \npermanent Spanish settlement in New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. As we know, we have some procedural rules requiring 51 \nSenators to support a resolution, before it can be considered by the \nfull Senate. I thank Senators from both sides of the aisle. We now have \n57 Senators on this resolution and this number assures Senate passage. \nOur resolution declares 1998 as the ``Onate Cuartocentenario'', the \n400th Anniversary of the Onate settlement at San Juan Pueblo, New \nMexico, and asks the President to issue a proclamation of similar \nintent. Besides the historical event, this resolution acknowledges the \ncultural, economic, and political contributions that these Hispanic \nsettlers of 400 years ago started in northern New Mexico. So I thank \nthe majority leader, Senator Lott, Senator Daschle the minority leader, \nand the long list of cosponsors for helping us with this.\n  I guess right off the bat, it gives me a great deal of pride to \nremind Americans, especially here in the east where this Capitol lies, \nthat the first Spanish settlement in New Mexico occurred in 1598, when \nDon Juan de Onate settled at San Juan Pueblo in the Valley of Espanola \nin northern New Mexico. I might say, if one just remembers the dates, \nthis event precedes Plymouth Rock, which landing there occurred in \n1620. The Spanish settlers arrived in northern New Mexico 22 years \nbefore Plymouth Rock. And they were also settlers who came from Europe. \nThey just happened to come from the Spanish part of Europe rather than \nthat part where our rather famous and much talked about pilgrims came \nfrom.\n  So this year we commemorate the brave and adventurous Hispanic \nfamilies who first set roots in this beautiful land of New Mexico. By \ncommemorating these early events we are also honoring the important \ncultural, political, and economic contributions that those families and \ntheir descendants have made to enrich our State, and actually our \nNation.\n  This expedition was part of a very large effort to expand the Spanish \nempire, convert more people to Christianity, and find great wealth in \nthe new world. There was great excitement at the beginning of the 16th \ncentury about these prospects. Spaniards like Hernan Cortes and \nFrancisco Pizzaro, cousins from Medellin and Ciudad Trujillo, left \nSpain in the early 1600s to seek their fortune and spread the glory of \nSpain. When the Mayan gold was taken back to Spain from the Yucatan \nPeninsula of Mexico in 1517, it fueled the fires of enthusiasm for \nfinding the legendary Seven Cities of Gold in the New World.\n  Spanish explorers like Ponce de Leon, Francisco Coronado, and Don \nJuan de Onate explored modern-day America, believe it or not, from \nFlorida to California.\n  Some 400 Spanish settlers led by Onate from Santa Barbara, Mexico, \nthrough El Paso, Texas, to San Juan Pueblo, named by Onate for John the \nBaptist. The soldiers, priests, laymen, families, servants and their 83 \nwagons and 7,000 animals formed a 2- to 4-mile long caravan as they \njourneyed up the Rio Grande.\n  I spoke about this the other night at a very large gathering in our \nState for the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. Sitting at a table with our \narchbishop, one of my staff people said, as Senator Domenici explained \nthis 83 wagon and 7,000 animals forming a 4-mile long caravan, the \narchbishop was heard to say, ``The first traffic jam in northern New \nMexico.'' I don't know if it was that or not. There probably were no \nintersecting roads in those days.\n  When they arrived at San Juan Pueblo on July 11, 1598, they \nestablished the first Spanish capital in the New World. They built the \nSan Gabriel chapel and convento. Today, a beautiful replica of the San \nGabriel chapel stands in the Espanola Plaza.\n  It is well known that the Spanish people founded the oldest cities in \nAmerica. First, St. Augustine, Florida was founded in 1565, followed by \nSanta Fe, New Mexico, the second oldest city in what is now the United \nStates. In 1610, Santa Fe was named the capital of New Mexico making it \nthe oldest capital city in America today.\n  Before Santa Fe became the capital of the New Mexico territory, the \nSan Gabriel mission served as the first Spanish Capital of New Mexico, \nbeginning in 1598. San Gabriel is at San Juan Pueblo where the Rio \nChama meets the Rio Grande. Its Indian name was Yunge Oweenge. The \ndesignation and renaming of this site by its first Governor, Don Juan \nde Onate, as San Gabriel del Yunge Oweenge marks the first permanent \nSpanish settlement in the west.\n  1998 marks the 400th Anniversary of the founding of San Gabriel del \nYunge Oweenge in the Espanola Valley of present-day New Mexico.\n  This resolution highlights the importance of the Spanish explorations \nin America and pays tribute to the growing population of Hispanics who \nare anticipated to be twenty percent of our national population by the \nyear 2030, with a projected population of 60 million Hispanics. Two-\nthirds of the 26 million Hispanics in America--who make up eleven \npercent of our population today--are of Mexican origin, and 70 percent \nof Hispanics live in 4 states: California, Texas, New York, and \nFlorida.\n  New Mexico has the highest percentage of Hispanics at 39 percent or \nabout 660,000 residents out of a total 1995 state population of 1.7 \nmillion. Albuquerque, New Mexico, will be the site of a new Hispanic \nCultural Center to celebrate and preserve Hispanic culture including \nliterature, performing arts, visual arts, music, culinary arts, and \nlanguage arts.\n  New Mexico will be the center of many exciting events throughout the \nyear to commemorate this important historic milestone. New Mexicans are \nlooking forward to fiestas, balls, parades, and other stimulating \nevents to mark this historic occasion.\n  The Archbishop of Santa Fe will be opening a Jubilee year in January. \nAmong other events, he will hold an encuentro at Santo Domingo Pueblo \nto mark the meeting of the missionaries with the Pueblo Peoples.\n\n[[Page S502]]\n\n  The City of Espanola will have a fiesta in July to commemorate the \nactual arrival of the Spanish into the area. Santa Fe, Las Vegas, Taos, \nSocorro, Aztec, Albuquerque, and other New Mexico towns and cities will \nbe holding such special events as fiestas, historic reenactments, a \nState Fair Pageant, a historic Spanish costume ball, and parades. \nSeminars and lectures will abound.\n  State Fair pageant plans include a reenactment of De Vargas' reentry \ninto New Mexico, a review of the Pueblo Revolt and its ramifications, \nlife under the American flag during the middle to late 1800's, and a \npatriotic tribute to all Hispanics who have fought for the United \nStates. This reentry spectacular will be performed twice before large \nNew Mexico State Fair audiences. It will also be televised.\n  This resolution also asks the President to issue a proclamation \ndeclaring 1998 is a year to commemorate the arrival of Hispanics and \ncelebrate their growth in importance in our nation's culture and \neconomy.\n  This Senate resolution calls upon the people of the United States to \nsupport, promote, and participate in the many Onate Cuartocentenario \nactivities being planned to commemorate the historic event of the first \nSpanish settlement in the Southwest Region of the United States.\n  Mr President, I ask my colleagues to support Senate Resolution 148, \ndesignating 1998 as the ``Onate Cuartocentenario'' to commemorate the \n400th anniversary of the first Spanish settlement in New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I rise to speak about Senate \nResolution 148, designating 1998 as the ``Onate Cuatro-centenario,'' \nthe anniversary commemoration of the first Spanish settlement in New \nMexico. First, I thank my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici \nwith whom I have the great pleasure of marking this anniversary. And I \nthank my Senate colleagues for co-sponsoring the resolution. The bi-\npartisan support for this resolution I believe is indicative of the \nbroad understanding and appreciation for the cultural contributions \nthat Hispanics have made in our American society.\n  This resolution commemorates one of the most meaningful and \nsignificant dates of both New Mexico and American history. July 1, 1598 \nstands out in history because it was on that day, almost 180 years \nbefore the Declaration of Independence was signed in Philadelphia, that \na small group of Spanish pioneers ventured north from Mexico, up the \nRio Grande Valley and settled in what is now North-Central New Mexico. \nThe settlers, led by Don Juan de Onate, established a small mission at \nthe confluence of the Rio Chama and the Rio Grande and next to an \nIndian Pueblo the inhabitants called ``Ohke.'' The Spanish settlers \nnamed their mission San Gabriel de los Espanoles.\n  From San Gabriel, Spanish families moved outward and, in 1610 \nestablished the mission of ``La Villa Real de Santa Fe'', now well-\nknown as ``Santa Fe.'' Other settlements were soon established \nthroughout the Rio Grande Valley, Arizona, California, Colorado, and \nTexas following the long-established settlements in Florida.\n  As much as this resolution commemorates the early Spanish settlements \non this continent, it is meant to do much more. This resolution \ncelebrates the Hispanic people themselves and the many contributions \nthey have made to the history of this continent and this country over \nthe last 400 years.\n  Indeed, many Hispanics have earned a place in American history. \nDuring the American Revolution, Bernardo de Galvez, a Spanish \naristrocrat and governor of the Spanish province of Louisiana, was \ninstrumental in helping defeat the British navy and army near the Gulf \nof Mexico.\n  During the Civil War, David Glasgow Farragut, also of Spanish \ndescent, commanded a Union naval expedition against the city of New \nOrleans. Because of his leadership at the battle for Fort Jackson, \nPresident Lincoln promoted Farragut to Rear Admiral.\n  Hispanics have made significant contributions also in the area of \nScience. Luis Alvarez, for example, won the Nobel Prize for Physics. \nAlvarez taught at University of California-Berkeley and was later \ninstrumental in the development of radar at the Massachusetts Institute \nof Technology. In 1944, he went to work on the development of the \natomic bomb in Los Alamos, New Mexico.\n  Of course, I cannot speak of distinguished Hispanics without speaking \nof New Mexico's own Dennis Chavez, whom many of my Senate colleagues no \ndoubt remember well. Dennis Chavez was one of eight children and \nthrough hard work and determination became one of New Mexico's \ndistinguished Congressmen in 1934. Not long after that, he became \nUnited States Senator, and while in the Senate worked tirelessly for \nfair employment and civil rights legislation.\n  Madam President, I easily can point to all aspects of our American \nsociety, from literature to sports, and identify many Hispanic \nindividuals who have made significant contributions. It is a tremendous \nhistory--indeed, more than 400 years of history. Through this \nresolution, I wish to help New Mexico and our Nation celebrate that \nhistory. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I suggest the absence of a quorum, with the time to be \ncharged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nable to speak for 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?

Madam President, there were two articles today, one \narticle in the New York Times, a front page story: ``Pessimism Retains \nGrip on Region Shaped by War on Poverty,'' Booneville, KY, eastern \nKentucky, Appalachia. At the same time, there was also an editorial in \nthe Minnesota Star Tribune. I ask unanimous consent that both the New \nYork Times piece and this editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  (From the Minneapolis Star Tribune)\n\n                  States Must Ask the Right Questions\n\n       From Maine to California, governors are celebrating a \n     plunge in the nation's welfare rolls. Some 2 million families \n     have gone off benefits since 1994, and caseloads have fallen \n     to their lowest level in 27 years. But few officials are \n     asking what seems an obvious question: What became of these \n     families after they left public assistance?\n       That's exactly the question posed by seven Midwestern \n     welfare administrators who have banded together in \n     implementing the landmark 1996 federal welfare-reform law. \n     The seven, including Ann Sessoms of Minnesota's Department of \n     Human Services, recently traveled to Washington, D.C., to \n     unveil a new framework for measuring the success of state \n     welfare experiments. They're asking the right questions, and \n     they deserve support from the Clinton administration and \n     their colleagues.\n       Once upon a time, the fate of families leaving welfare \n     might have been an afterthought. The system was self-\n     regulating, in that clients who fell on hard times after \n     leaving public assistance could simply re-apply. Cash \n     assistance to families, known as AFDC, was an \n     ``entitlement''--if you fell below certain poverty \n     thresholds, you were entitled to benefits.\n       But since Congress passed the Personal Responsibility and \n     Work Opportunity Act of 1996, better known as welfare reform, \n     that self-regulating feature has vanished. States can kick \n     families off assistance for many reasons--failing to find \n     work, breaking administrative rules, or simply exhausting \n     their benefits ``clock,'' a time limit as short as 18 months \n     in some states.\n       The federal law requires states to submit lots of data on \n     the number of clients who receive benefits and who find jobs, \n     but it is almost silent on the issue of family well-being \n     after clients leave welfare. As federal bureaucrats draft new \n     reporting requirements, there's a danger that Washington and \n     the governors will define ``success'' as merely cutting \n     caseloads.\n       Sessoms and her colleagues have a more robust definition. \n     They'd like to know if clients are earning enough money to \n     rise out of poverty, if they're finding safe day care, \n     whether their children are seeing a doctor and attending \n     school, whether marriages are\n\n[[Page S503]]\n\n     holding together or breaking apart. Minnesota's Department of \n     Human Services has decided to track many of these questions \n     for its own clients. But the nation needs comparable \n     measurements, so that governors have the right incentives and \n     so Washington can compare results of the 50 state welfare \n     experiments.\n       This is an ambitious, even intrusive, list of questions. \n     But then, these were the very questions that prompted welfare \n     reform in the first place. It's worth remembering that \n     Congress didn't tackle welfare reform because caseloads were \n     rising--they were already falling by 1996. It wasn't because \n     assistance costs were climbing--cash welfare to families has \n     been stable at less than 2 percent of the federal budget \n     since Richard Nixon was in office. It was because welfare was \n     seen as a failed program that fostered other social \n     pathologies: idleness, drug use, broken marriages and \n     neglected children. Having blamed welfare for these problems, \n     it seems only fair to find out whether welfare reform is \n     solving them.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 9, 1998]\n\n               Pessimism Retains Grip on Appalachian Poor\n\n                         (By Michael Janofsky)\n\n       There is an area of Booneville that some residents call Ho \n     Chi Minh City for its third world appearance. It is not \n     large, just a few winding gravel roads. But many of the \n     houses look like shanties, heated with wood or coal. Children \n     walk around with dirty bare feet. Many people lack telephones \n     and cars.\n       In many respects, this little corner of Appalachia looks \n     much as it did 30 years ago, when President Lyndon B. Johnson \n     declared a war on poverty, taking special aim at the rural \n     decay in places like Owsley County, here in eastern Kentucky, \n     and other distressed areas in the 399 counties of 13 states \n     that make up Appalachia.\n       Federal and state agencies have plowed billions of dollars \n     into Appalachia through economic development programs, \n     highway construction and job-creation initiatives to help \n     residents overcome the economic and psychological isolation \n     caused by poverty and the rugged terrain.\n       But a tour of Booneville offers ample evidence that money \n     and countless programs have had only marginal effects on \n     breaking a cycle of poverty and despair that continues \n     throughout many parts of Appalachia. And conditions could \n     grow worse before they improve.\n       With state welfare regulations forcing recipients to find \n     work and with the Federal Government reviewing the \n     eligibility of children who receive disability benefits, many \n     Owsley County residents could lose vital monthly checks that \n     they have relied on for years. More than half of the people \n     in the county who receive those benefits are children.\n       Viewing those prospects, some residents sound much like \n     people who have criticized entitlement programs for \n     stagnating inner cities.\n       ``The war on poverty was the worst thing that ever happened \n     to Appalachia,'' said Denise Hoffman, 46, who runs a small \n     farm here with her husband, Neil. ``It gave people a way to \n     get by without having to do any work.''\n       By many measures, Appalachia remains mired in poverty. In \n     about one-quarter of the highland region's counties, \n     according to data from the 1990 census, 25 percent or more of \n     residents live below the poverty level as defined by the \n     Federal Government. That rate is nearly double the national \n     average.\n       Owsley County, with a population of 5,400, is one of the \n     most distressed areas. To many residents, the booming \n     national economy is something they hear about only on \n     television.\n       More than 46 percent live in poverty, as defined by the \n     Government. The median household income of $8,595 is one of \n     the lowest in Appalachia. Almost half of the adults are \n     unemployed. About two-thirds of the people in the county \n     receive Federal assistance, 30 percent of county families do \n     not have telephones, and 20 percent do not have cars.\n       More than half the adult population is illiterate.\n       But perhaps most critical of all, with the coal industry \n     long gone as a major employer and job creation minimal and \n     sporadic, feelings of hopelessness have become so deeply \n     entrenched that many residents have long forsaken any \n     expectation of bettering themselves.\n       Even a generous new program to encourage savings is \n     struggling to win participants. Through a foundation grant to \n     finance a $6-to-$1 match, residents can deposit up to $15 a \n     month for two years, a total of $360, and receive back \n     $2,520. The program began in May to encourage low-income \n     people to set aside money for home improvements, a new \n     business or school.\n       Eight people are participating.\n       ``The overriding theory of the program works against the \n     mentality that is deeply set within people who live in \n     poverty,'' said the program administrator, Jennifer Hart. \n     ``They don't think they have a future. If they did, they \n     would think about it and delay instant gratification. But \n     they have no reason to. And they can't. They can only think \n     about how they are going to feed the children this week and \n     pay the rent this month.''\n       Even many of the 70 seniors at Owsley County High School \n     this year sense the inevitability of spending their lives in \n     poverty, unchanged from their parents' situations.\n       The Hoffmans' 17-year-old daughter, Megan, a top student \n     and an athlete who has been accepted to four state colleges, \n     thinks of her classmates with chagrin.\n       ``Many of them think things are never going to get any \n     better,'' she said. ``It's pretty sad. Kids feel, `I don't \n     think I can make a difference.' They don't seem to want to \n     change or care.''\n       When the senior class voted on the message to print on \n     their T-shirts this year, an annual custom, they chose: ``I \n     came, I slept. I graduated.'' Megan said fewer than 25 \n     percent plan to attend college.\n       As elsewhere in Appalachia, the feelings of hopelessness \n     prevail despite energetic efforts by Government and private \n     groups like the Mountain Association for Community Economic \n     Development, a 21-year-old organization in Berea that helps \n     community groups in 49 counties around the state.\n       In Owsley it provides a ray of hope through self-help \n     programs like job-training classes, courses on starting a \n     business and agencies that make low-interest loans. It also \n     aids in recruiting companies into the area, a mighty \n     challenge in Booneville, with its remote location and lack of \n     services. The town has two restaurants, three groceries and \n     one dentist. And while it has three doctors the nearest \n     hospital is an hour away.\n       To attack the worse of rural poverty, the association \n     created ``action teams'' six years ago for the most \n     distressed counties, Owsley and Letcher. In each, officials \n     work closely with local leaders to convince residents that \n     they can lead more productive lives.\n       The efforts take many forms. In Booneville, the team helped \n     bring Image Entry, a data-entry company that created 58 jobs, \n     onto a site that local leaders hope will become an industrial \n     park. Team members helped start associations for goat \n     breeders and vegetable growers, to increase their profits. \n     The team also helped set up a secondhand shop that employs \n     welfare recipients so that they can fulfill new state \n     regulations that require them to find a job in two years or \n     lose benefits. Next to the shop is a credit union that offers \n     low-interest loans and a generous matched-savings program.\n       The state welfare agency has set up a pilot program for \n     recipients that teaches ``job readiness skills,'' including \n     how to write a resume and how to fill out a job application.\n       Yet every initiative pits the action team and Government \n     agencies against an intractable pessimism built on decades of \n     depressed conditions that are visible everywhere: piles of \n     garbage heaped into creeks and ravings because people cannot \n     afford the $12 monthly fee for trash removal; landscapes of \n     rusting cars, some from the 1950's, and the crumbling shell \n     of the Seale theater, which last showed a movie, ``Silver \n     Bullet,'' in 1985.\n       But many residents say the prevailing attitude in the \n     county, particularly among those receiving state and Federal \n     entitlement benefits, is that no amount of help and \n     instruction is going to make a difference. According to the \n     most recent state statistics, 14.3 percent of Owsley \n     residents receive welfare benefits, 20 percent receive \n     benefits through the Federal assistance program for disabled \n     people known as Supplemental Security Income and almost half \n     receive food stamps.\n       Mr. Hoffman, 47, a member of the action team, grew almost \n     angry, talking about the conditions in much of Appalachia. \n     ``Poverty is not about money,'' he said. ``It's in the mind. \n     It's a way of life. Once you're in that cycle you think you \n     can't break out of it. I don't know why people think that \n     way, but they become a prisoner of it. It took us three \n     generations to get into this mess, and it's going to take us \n     three generations to get out of it.''\n       Members of the team say many parents urge their children to \n     try to go to special education classes at school as a way to \n     prove that they are eligible for disability benefits.\n       ``That shows how creative people are when there are no \n     jobs,'' said Jeanne Gage, the director of the sustainable \n     communities initiative for the Mountain Association. ``You \n     learn how to work the system.''\n       But as the system is changing, that could have a \n     devastating effect on Owsley County without more jobs.\n       Pam Barrett, 32, a divorced mother of a 17-year-old \n     daughter and two sons, 11 and 10, is beginning to feel the \n     pinch. Living with her 38-year-old former husband, who \n     receives $438 a month in disability benefits for bad nerves \n     and a spine injury, she began working 20 hours a week at the \n     secondhand shop two months ago. She plans to use some of the \n     money for her daughter, Jennifer, who expects to receive an \n     athletic scholarship and start college in the fall.\n       ``She has the chance I passed up to have three young'uns,'' \n     Ms. Barrett said. ``I quit school in the eighth grade to get \n     married. I was 15. He was 21. I've regretted it ever since. \n     And young'uns having babies is going on right today. But I \n     tell you what, you learn from your mistakes.''\n       Farmers like the Hoffmans, who rely on tobacco as their \n     leading cash crop, are enduring another anxiety, waiting to \n     see how the litigation between cigarette companies and \n     Federal and state governments might affect small growers.\n       Action team members and government officials working to \n     turn around the fortunes of Owsley County all say their \n     efforts are paying off, even against an enormous tide of \n     negativism that now touches some of those who are succeeding.\n       Megan Hoffman said, ``I have really enjoyed growing up \n     here.'' But asked whether\n\n[[Page S504]]\n\n     she planned to return after college, she said: ``No. There is \n     nothing here. There is nothing to come back to.''\n       The president of the Mountain Association, Don Harker, said \n     that attitude would be difficult to change any time soon.\n       ``We have an immense amount of work to do to bring up the \n     prosperity levels of Appalachia,'' Mr. Harker said. ``To give \n     people hope, we have to change the whole dynamic. To give \n     people a reason to believe things can be different than they \n     are, we have to change their expectations.\n       ``I know we can do it,'' he said. ``But I don't think it \n     will be done in my lifetime.''\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I just want to read one part of the \neditorial today in the Star Tribune:\n\n       But since Congress passed the Personal Responsibility and \n     Work Opportunity Act, better known as welfare reform, that \n     self-regulated feature has vanished. States can kick families \n     off assistance for many reasons--failing to find work, \n     breaking administrative rules, or simply exhausting their \n     benefits ``clock,'' a time as short as 18 months in some \n     states.\n\n  The context for this piece was that seven Midwestern welfare \nadministrators have banded together, and they want us to ask questions \nabout what is happening with the welfare bill in the country.\n  I just want to say to colleagues that we would be making a mistake if \nwe assumed that 2 million fewer families on welfare meant also that we \nhad 2 million fewer families that were poor in America. What the New \nYork Times front page article points to--and I had a chance to visit \nLetcher County, KY, this summer--what this editorial speaks to, I \nthink, is a really important question.\n  I am going to have an amendment that I am going to offer on the first \nbill that is appropriate which essentially says this: We cannot \nautomatically equate reduction in caseload with reduction in poverty, \nand what we need to know as responsible policymakers is what is \nhappening with these families.\n  When I say ``these families,'' I am really talking about, in the \nmain, women and children. I know that in my travels around the \ncountry--and I do no damage to the truth, I don't think I exaggerate at \nall--I met too many families where, as it turns out, 3- and 4-year-olds \nwere home alone. The single parent is working now, but the child care \nhas not been worked out. Or it is a very ad hoc child care arrangement, \nhardly what any of us would like for our own children, not really good \ndevelopmental child care.\n  In addition, too many first and second graders, I said before on the \nfloor of the Senate, are now going home alone because their single \nparent, the mother, is working, but there is nobody there to take care \nof them when they are home. First and second graders are going home \nsometimes in some very dangerous neighborhoods.\n  It is also true, Madam President, that wherever I travel, when I am \ntold in any given State we have reduced the welfare rolls by X number \nof families, the question I have is, where are they? What kind of jobs \ndo these mothers now have? Do they pay a living wage? Where are the \nchildren? Is it decent child care? And the interesting thing is that \nhardly anywhere in the country do we have the data. I can't get answers \nto those questions.\n  So, the amendment that I am going to have on the floor of the Senate \nsoon will essentially call on States to provide to Health and Human \nServices data, let's say, every 6 months as to how many families are \nactually reaching economic self-sufficiency.\n  I am not trying to bias the conclusion one way or the other, but \nsince, depending on the State 3 years from now or 2 years from now or a \nyear and a half from now or 4 years from now, there is a drop-dead date \ncertain where all these children--women and children--will be removed \nfrom any assistance, we ought to know what is happening. That is all I \nam saying to colleagues, let's have the data, let's make sure we know \nwhat is happening to those families. That will be an amendment I will \nbring to the floor soon.\n  The second amendment I want to mention today is, I think, very much \nwithin the same context and, I think, important. Around the country, as \nI travel, I cannot believe how many women who are in a community \ncollege, who are on the path to economic self-sufficiency in school, \nare now being told that they have to go to work. It may be a $5.50-an-\nhour job, but they are essentially told they can no longer be in \nschool.\n  Madam President, I would argue that this is very shortsighted. This \nis very shortsighted. As a matter of fact, if these women can complete \ntheir 2 years in the community college or even get a 4-year degree, \nthey and their families will be much better off.\n\n  So the second amendment I am going to offer will essentially call for \na student exemption. It will say, let's let these welfare mothers \npursue and complete their education. They and their families will be \nmuch better off. I hope that the community colleges and the \nuniversities will speak up for these families, because they know what \nis happening. This is, I think, a profound mistake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/09/senate-section/article/S502-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S504-S505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SIERRA BLANCA\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I want to move on and talk about a \nrelated topic, in fact, very related, and this is a discussion that is \nurgent and long overdue. It has to do with the bill, S. 270, that would \nresult in the dumping of low-level radioactive waste in a small, poor, \nmajority Latino community in rural west Texas. I want to stop that from \nhappening, not only in Sierra Blanca, but in poor minority communities \nall over this country.\n  The best way to get this conversation going, which is a conversation \nabout environmental justice, is to make sure that the story of Sierra \nBlanca gets told, and it is an incredible story.\n  Last week, several of the people who have been telling that story for \nseveral years were here in Washington. Father Ralph Solis, who is the \nparish priest for Sierra Blanca, led a delegation of Texans who told us \nof the anger and the anguish of the people of Sierra Blanca. It is not \njust the people of Sierra Blanca who are organizing. Citizens from all \nover Texas, from cities and towns through which radioactive waste will \nbe passing on its way to Sierra Blanca, are all demanding that their \nvoices be heard. The newspaper columnist Molly Ivins has written that, \n``This is community action and local organizing at its very best.'' I \ncouldn't agree more.\n  Let me tell you something about Sierra Blanca. It is a small town in \none of the poorest areas of Texas. The average income of the people who \nlive there is less than $8,000 a year, and 39 percent of them live \nbelow the poverty line. Over 66 percent of the residents are Mexican \nAmerican, and many speak only Spanish. It is a town that already has \none of the largest sewage sludge projects in the world. Every week, 250 \ntons of partially treated sludge are brought to Sierra Blanca.\n  So why has Sierra Blanca been targeted with both a sewage sludge \nproject and a radioactive dump? I am firmly convinced the issue here is \none of environmental justice. The tragedy of Sierra Blanca is part of \nthe larger and very disturbing pattern across the country. In far too \nmany instances, poor people of color simply don't have the political \nclout to keep the pollution out of their communities. Studies by the \nUnited Church of Christ's Commission for Racial Justice, for example, \nfound that race was the single best predictor of the location of \ncommercial hazardous waste facilities, and Texas was second only to \nCalifornia in the number of such facilities located in communities with \nabove-average percentage of minorities. I don't think that is a \ncoincidence.\n  Let me be clear about one thing, Mr. President. Sierra Blanca is not \nbeing singled out because its residents are unusually fond of waste. In \nApril 1992, the Texas Waste Authority commissioned a telephone poll of \nsurrounding communities, areas where the poorest residents don't even \nhave telephones, and they found that 64 percent of the people oppose \nthe dump. But you don't need a poll to tell you that. Just show up at \nany town meeting or any licensing hearing. Local residents are often \nangry and emotional about their community being turned into a \nradioactive dump. And they have every right to be.\n\n  Let us be clear about one other thing as well. Science does not \nexplain the selection of Sierra Blanca, either. In the early 1980s, the \nTexas Waste Authority screened the entire State to find the most \nscientifically appropriate site. Their engineering consultants, Dames & \nMoore, concluded that the Sierra Blanca site was unsuitable for a \nnuclear dump because of its complex\n\n[[Page S505]]\n\ngeology. But, lo and behold, that was the site that was chosen.\n  You will hear again and again from colleagues on the other side that \nthis siting decision is a purely local matter. It is not. The most \nobvious reason is that it is up to the Congress to ratify this Compact \nbetween Texas, Maine, and Vermont. Without the Compact, it is unlikely \nthere will be a dump. Without the upfront payments from the other \nStates, where is the construction money going to come from? And by the \nTexas Waste Authority's own projections, the dump will not be \neconomically viable if Maine and Vermont do not sign up in advance. \nTexas does not generate enough waste.\n  There are other reasons why this debate rises above the purely local \nlevel. If the Texas Compact passes the Senate, it is entirely possible \nthat Sierra Blanca will become the low-level radioactive waste dump for \nthe entire country. Backers of the Compact say that that is not their \nplan. They say no other States besides Maine and Vermont will ship \nwaste to Texas. If that is the case, then I propose a solution. And I \nam hoping there will be support for this.\n  Let the Senate agree to an amendment I want to offer, which is just \nlike the Doggett amendment that passed the House, limiting the Compact \nto Maine and Vermont. Now, it seems to me, if the argument is being \nmade that the only waste that is going to come to Texas is from Maine \nand Vermont, then let us just pass that amendment. And let us be clear \nabout it. Then the debate is over.\n  But we cannot shirk our responsibilities by pretending that this is \nnothing more than a State or local affair. The Sierra Blanca dump is \nunlikely to be built if the Senate rejects this Compact. But if the \nSenate approves this Compact, Sierra Blanca may become the Nation's \npremier dump site for low-level radioactive waste. It is that simple.\n  The Senate vote will largely determine whether or not a grave \ninjustice is inflicted on a community that deserves no such thing. It \nwould be easy for all of us to turn our backs and just ignore this \nissue. But there is no way for the Senate to wash its hands of this \nbusiness. For good or ill, we bear moral responsibility for what \nhappens to the people of Sierra Blanca. This is a wrong that richly \ndeserves to be righted. And we have the power to do just that.\n  Mr. President, again, let me just make it clear that this is an issue \nof environmental justice. It is a David versus Goliath fight. There are \nlots of big guns in here that are pushing for this waste dump site. But \nwe have one thing on our side. My colleagues have said, ``Rest assured, \nthis will only be waste from Maine and Vermont that will go to Texas.'' \nI say, if that is the case, please support the Doggett amendment. It \nhas already passed the House of Representatives. Then we can go \nforward.\n  I will have one other amendment which just says that if we approve \nthe Compact, but it turns out that it can be proven that this has a \ndiscriminatory effect on a community of color or low-income people, \nthen they have the right to go to court. If those amendments pass, then \nthis Compact will pass the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I do believe that the people of Sierra Blanca and \nhundreds of minority communities just like them from around the country \nhave not been given their due. But we can make the system work. I am \nfirmly convinced of that. Sometimes justice needs a second chance. \nSometimes it needs a little push. And over the next few weeks, I think \nwe are going to give justice a second chance on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate.\n\n  I am hoping that these amendments will be accepted. I believe that \nwould be the right thing to do. I think there should be strong \nbipartisan support for that. If that does not happen, then I am \nprepared to use all of the hours on the floor of the U.S. Senate that I \nhave at my disposal as a Senator--and I will use those many hours--to \ntalk about environmental justice in this country.\n  Over and over and over again, we essentially take this waste and we \ndump it, right on the heads of low-income people. Over and over and \nover again, we look to the communities of color, we look to poor \ncommunities, we look to the communities that are not the heavy hitters, \nthat are not well connected, and this is where we put it.\n  This happens all across the country. I can bring to the floor of the \nSenate study after study after study that show that. I can marshal the \nevidence. I am hoping that we will agree that this Compact will be \nsomething we can pass, if we make it clear that the waste can only come \nfrom Maine and Vermont. If not, I think for the first time on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate we will have a really--maybe not the first time--but \nwe will certainly have a very thorough and important debate, I think, \nabout environmental justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/09/senate-section/article/S504-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO FRANK STRUKEL\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Maybe along with Senator Metzenbaum.\n  It was Saturday night, and I promised myself I would do this. I want \nto make this a part of the official Record of the U.S. Senate. Saturday \nnight, on the Iron Range in Eveleth, MN, there was at a gathering to \nhonor a man named Frank Strukel who has been one great labor organizer. \nHe is struggling with ALS, which is commonly called Lou Gehrig's \ndisease. His friends from all over the State of Minnesota came to honor \nhim. He should be honored.\n  I see my colleagues--Senator Ashcroft, who happens to be a good \nfriend, even though we do not always agree on issues. But one thing we \ndo agree on is we respect people who work hard on things that they \nbelieve in. We respect people who live by the words they speak. Frank \nStrukel was that way. Frank Strukel is that way.\n  I am hoping and praying he will somehow figure out a way to defeat \nthis disease. He said that night he is going to be with us for a long \ntime. I hope and pray that is the case. I promised him that I would say \non the floor of the Senate that Frank Strukel has been one heck of a \nhell-raising labor organizer. And he has been just that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Who yields time?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today in my capacity \nas chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee to call my colleagues' \nattention to some recent developments in the naturalization area, some \nof which are extremely serious.\n  As many of you may have read in today's Washington Post or the Los \nAngeles Times, Coopers & Lybrand today unveiled its recommendations to \nthe Justice Department for reengineering the naturalization process. \nAfter a year-long review, Coopers & Lybrand has developed what it is \ncalling a ``blueprint for a new naturalization process,'' which would \ninvolve a complete overhaul of that process. Given what we have seen in \nthe past in this area--particularly in the area of criminal background \nchecks--a reworking of the entire process is certainly needed and \nCongress should be involved in any redesign. Coopers & Lybrand has \nprepared us with what is essentially a solid outline for a streamlined, \nmore automated and more centralized naturalization system. Of course, \nmany details remain to be worked out, but I am\n\n[[Page S506]]\n\ngenuinely pleased with many aspects of the Coopers & Lybrand \nrecommendations for redesigning the process. I hope the administration \nwill take those recommendations seriously. For far too long, the \nnaturalization process has been characterized by intolerable backlogs, \nvery poor customer service, and, of course, unfortunate examples of \noutright fraud and mismanagement.\n\n  Unfortunately, just today we also learned the results of a separate \nreview of the current naturalization process. That review was conducted \nby the Department of Justice and by KPMG Peat Marwick. In a review of \nroughly 5,500 naturalization files selected at random over a 1-year \nperiod, it was determined that 90.8 percent of the files contained at \nleast one significant processing error, and a total of 87.7 percent of \nthe files had insufficient documentation in the file to support a \nproper naturalization decision.\n  The bottom line is that we can be confident that naturalization was \nproper in only 8.6 percent of the 1,049,867 cases naturalized between \nAugust 1995 and September 1996. Mr. President, clearly these statistics \nare alarming and appalling. I don't doubt that most of the cases \ninvolved were, in fact, properly naturalized. But because of the system \nthat is currently in place, we not only have enormous backlogs in the \nnaturalization process but we cannot determine on a case-by-case basis \nwhether naturalization decisions have been made correctly.\n  In my judgment, any redesign of the naturalization process must \nensure a 100 percent level of compliance. So, in the coming weeks, I \nplan to hold hearings at which the Senate Immigration Subcommittee can \nexplore the Coopers & Lybrand proposal--which at this point is simply a \nblueprint--in more detail and so that we can get to the bottom of the \ncomplete breakdown of the process I have described here today.\n  In particular, we need to examine some open issues in the redesign \nproposal, such as who would conduct the tests that are given with \nrespect to English proficiency and civics and what those tests should \ncontain. Given the recent indictments in California for fraud in \ncitizenship testing, in which 20 defendants have been indicted for \nnationwide fraud in this area, we must take a close look at the extent \nof the fraud in the testing process and we must reform the system to \neradicate any future wrongdoing in connection with citizenship testing.\n  As a proponent of legal immigration and the value of naturalization, \nI do not come at this in any way trying to undercut the naturalization \nsystem. Yet recent information suggests such a complete breakdown that \nthe process has to be redesigned to eradicate the fraud and the \nmismanagement that has characterized this system.\n  What we need to do is strike the right balance, Mr. President, so \nthat the people who deserve and have the right to be naturalized and \nbecome citizens have the opportunity to do so in a timely manner, and \nso that everyone, both the people who are waiting in those lines who \nultimately will become naturalized and those who are already citizens, \nwill have confidence that the people who are becoming citizens have met \nthe standards and the criteria which the Congress has established for \ndoing so. That means, Mr. President, close scrutiny of the current \nsystem, close scrutiny of the proposed recommendations by Coopers & \nLybrand, and action, I believe, ultimately by the INS and Congress to \nmove us in the right direction.\n  I am very disturbed by the report we received today, but I hope that \nwill form the basis for all of us to work together to find the right \nsolutions.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/09/senate-section/article/S505-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nEXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/09/senate-section/article/S506-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S506-S507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\nNOMINATION OF DAVID SATCHER, OF TENNESSEE, TO BE AN ASSISTANT SECRETARY \n  OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH \n       SERVICE, AND SURGEON GENERAL OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the nomination.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am proud today to speak in support of \nthe confirmation of Dr. David Satcher to be our Nation's Surgeon \nGeneral and Assistant Secretary of Health.\n  I want to speak about Dr. Satcher's qualifications for these \nimportant jobs, but first I want to quickly comment on the \ncircumstances that have led to the delay of our consideration of his \nnomination. I think the course of events that have taken place is very \nunfortunate. I think whenever we let certain political views interfere \nwith the public health, we are doing the American people a great \ndisservice. It has been 3 years since we have had a Surgeon General. \nThat has not been good for this country. It has created a vacuum of \nleadership on public health issues. I hope that once everyone has had a \nchance to voice his or her opinion on his nomination we can quickly \nmove ahead and fill the longstanding vacancy.\n  Mr. President, as chairman and as now ranking Democrat on the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, I have \nhad the pleasure of working very closely with Dr. David Satcher since \nhe has been the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nin Atlanta. Over the past 4 years, he has directed the CDCP with \nintegrity, compassion, and a commonsense approach. Because of his \nleadership, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has \nsuccessfully addressed some of the most pressing public health \nchallenges facing our Nation by promoting health and preventing \ndisease, injury, and premature death.\n  Mr. President, let there be no mistake, the position of Surgeon \nGeneral is an important one. Americans look to our Nation's top medical \nofficial for leadership and guidance on a number of critical health \ncare issues. For example, one of our most honored Surgeons General, Dr. \nC. Everett Koop, used the office's bully pulpit to further public \nawareness of the dangers of smoking, and he was a courageous advocate \nfor public health measures to address the growing AIDS crisis. Now \nthose are big shoes to fill, but I can think of no one more qualified \nor capable than Dr. David Satcher.\n  In 1992, I worked with former CDC Director William Roper to change \nthe name of the CDC from the Centers for Disease Control to the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention. We added the word ``prevention'' to \nthe name. Now, Dr. Roper has moved on, but under Dr. Satcher's \ndirection the CDCP has truly lived up to its new name.\n  Since he took the helm, Dr. Satcher has spearheaded a child \nimmunization initiative, upgraded the Nation's ability to detect and \nrespond to emerging infectious diseases, and he has expanded the \nparticipation in the agency's breast and cervical cancer screening \nprogram.\n  Dr. Satcher has taken the lead in creating an early warning system to \ndetect and prevent food-borne illnesses and did the bulk of the work on \nthe first-ever Surgeon General's Report on Physical Activity and \nHealth, which outlined ways in which all types of Americans can be more \nphysically active. These initiatives have been very successful, and \nthey have made the CDCP renowned worldwide for its leadership on \nprevention efforts.\n  As many of you may know--and I will probably repeat a lot what has \nbeen said here, but I think it is worth repeating--Dr. Satcher has a \ndistinguished background. President of Meharry Medical College from \n1982 until he was named Director of the CDCP in 1993. At Meharry, he \ngained national recognition as an able administrator, and his \nleadership has been accorded wide recognition.\n  In 1986, he was elected to the Institute of Medicine of the National \nAcademy of Sciences for his leadership skills.\n  In 1996, Dr. Satcher received the prestigious Dr. Nathan B. Davis \nAward for outstanding public service to advance the public health. He \nhas also received Ebony Magazine's American Black Achievement Award in \nBusiness and the Professions in 1994, and the Breslow Award for \nExcellence in Public Health in 1995.\n\n  Most recently, Dr. Satcher has received the James D. Bruce Memorial \nAward for distinguished contributions in preventative medicine from the \nAmerican College of Physicians. He has received the John Stearns Award \nfor Lifetime Achievement in Medicine\n\n[[Page S507]]\n\nfrom the New York Academy of Medicine, and the Surgeon General's \nMedallion for significant and noteworthy contributions to the health of \nthe Nation.\n  These awards all testify to the fact that Dr. Satcher is a talented, \ncompassionate doctor, researcher and administrator who, throughout his \ncareer, has committed himself to caring for those less fortunate and to \nfocusing on preventative health care. Dr. Satcher's lifelong commitment \nto improving the health of the American people began not long after he \nsurvived a near fatal brush with whooping cough as a child. Because of \nthis experience, he understands how important it is to have a Surgeon \nGeneral who communicates clearly with the people about health-related \nissues and policies that can literally save their lives. He has strong \nand practical positions on ways to improve the public health, and as \nSurgeon General and Assistant Secretary of Health, he will provide a \npositive and articulate voice on some of our Nation's most important \nhealth issues.\n  The Atlanta Journal and Constitution stated in an editorial endorsing \nDr. Satcher:\n\n       He is the right man at the right time for these positions.\n\n  I can think of no truer statement, Mr. President. So I look forward \nto concluding this debate, hopefully, on a positive note. I look \nforward to seeing Dr. Satcher confirmed as our Nation's Assistant \nSecretary of Health and Surgeon General. America needs a Surgeon \nGeneral. We need that leadership, and Dr. Satcher is the best person \nfor that job.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/09/senate-section/article/S506-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S507-S509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HUMAN CLONING PROHIBITION ACT\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I, as in morning business, want to digress \nhere just a moment, if I might, to talk a little bit about another \nissue that is going to be coming up here tomorrow. I understand we are \ngoing to be voting on cloture on a bill that has not gone through any \ncommittee, hasn't had any hearings. It involves an area of science and \nmedicine which very few, if any, of us in this entire body are \nqualified to vote on with short notice, without proper hearings and \nproper input. Yet, it's trying to be rammed through here. I am talking \nabout the bill regarding cloning research.\n  Now, there has been a lot of, I think, undue, inflammatory kinds of \nstatements and comments made about this cloning research. It seems odd \nto me that on something that has so much potential to alleviate human \nsuffering and which is also, I will be frank to admit, fraught with \nperils of ethics and bioethics--it seems odd to me that a bill of that \nnature would be rushed so soon to the floor of the Senate. It seems to \nme that this is the kind of bill that ought to go through a lengthy and \ninvolved hearing process, to bring in the best minds, ethicists, \nphysicians, doctors, researchers, those involved in gene therapy, those \nwho have been involved in cloning research in the past, to hear their \nviews on this. And then out of this, perhaps we can develop a more \nreasoned, logical, bipartisan approach on the issue of cloning \nresearch.\n  So I have to ask, what is this so-called rush? Why bring it out on \nthe floor like this without the proper kind of hearings, because there \nis a hidden political agenda? Is this to inflame fears among people? \nWell, I hope not. To take away that apprehension, I think the best \nthing would be to refer this to committee and have hearings on it. I \nserve on the Labor, Health and Human Services Committee, and I would \nassume that committee would be the proper one to have the hearings, at \nleast some of them, plus those on the House side. So I want to speak \nabout it in that context.\n  Mr. President, each year, too many of our loved ones suffer terribly. \nThey are taken away from us by diseases like cancer, heart disease and \nAlzheimer's. For many years, I have worked hard to expand research into \nfinding cures and preventative measures and improve treatments for the \nmany conditions that rob us of our health. Over the last several years, \nthere have been major breakthroughs in medical research. We need to \nmake sure that our world-class scientists continue to build on this \nprogress, but that we also say to young people who are in college \ntoday, maybe even in high school, who are thinking of pursuing research \ncareers, that we welcome their inquisitiveness, we welcome their \nexperimentation, we want there to be no bounds put on their inquiries \nby a rush to judgment by the Congress of the United States, which is \nill-equipped to make such a judgment. I think our actions here send a \nvery chilling message to young people, who want to go into biomedical \nresearch, that somehow there is going to be the heavy hand of ``Big \nBrother'' Government overlooking their research, telling them you can \ndo this but not that, or you can go no further than that, or you can \nask this question, but you can't ask that question. I think this bill \nthat we have, again, pushed before us in this rush, can have that kind \nof chilling effect.\n  Now, another area of research that has been ongoing for a long time--\nthis is nothing new--has recently captured public attention. That is \nthe research into cloning, cloning cells. Now, there is a man in \nChicago--I don't know him and I never have met him--and his name is \nRichard Seed. Well, he caused quite a sensation a few weeks ago by \nsaying he intends to clone infertile people within the next 2 years. \nWell, when I first heard this, I said, who is this guy? I never heard \nof him and I have been involved in research, medical research for a \nlong time. Well, I found out that, quite frankly, he is a very \nirresponsible individual. He doesn't have the expertise himself. He \ndoesn't have the laboratory, the money, or the wherewithal. I think \nmost researchers and policymakers that I know who know of this person \nsay that he is both out of the mainstream and that his plans for \ncloning are, at the very least, premature.\n  Now, again, from all that I have read--and now I have seen him on \ntelevision--I think that Mr. Seed is more interested in getting his \nname in the paper than actually carrying out any legitimate scientific \nresearch. This is the unfortunate part of it. Why should the \nirresponsible actions of an individual like Mr. Seed lead to \nirresponsible actions on our part, because that is exactly what we are \ndoing? Is Mr. Seed irresponsible? I believe so, absolutely. As I said, \nhe doesn't have the expertise, the lab, or the wherewithal to even \ncarry out this research. So he is making very irrational, \nirresponsible, inflammatory statements. But then why should we respond \nirresponsibly? I think we should respond responsibly and very carefully \nto an area of scientific research that can hold so much promise to \nalleviate pain and suffering and premature death all around the world.\n  Let's not act irresponsibly because one person in America has spoken \nirresponsibly. S. 1601, the bill we will be having a cloture vote on \ntomorrow, bans the use of cloning technology called somatic cell \nnuclear transfer. To create an unfertilized egg cell, even if this egg \ncell is for research, is totally unrelated to the cloning of a human \nbeing. For example, if the cell is grown under special laboratory \nconditions, it does not become a child, or a baby, but instead becomes \nspecific tissue such as a muscle, nerve, or skin.\n\n  Just think of the potential of this kind of technology. I have looked \ninto this a lot over the last several years. Science makes genetically \nidentical tissues and organs for the treatment of a vast array of \ndiseases.\n  I gave a sort of off-the-cuff set of comments last summer when this \nissue came up with Dolly, the sheep that was cloned in Scotland. Dr. \nWilmut was at our committee. I talked about the need to continue \nresearch into cloning of cells. I said it was going to happen in my \nlifetime. I certainly stand here and hope that it does.\n  Shortly after that, I was at a restaurant in a small town in Iowa. A \nperson came up to me, a friend of mine. I went over to their booth to \nsee them. There was a woman there whom I had never met, a rather young \nwoman with her husband. I was introduced to them. Just right out of the \nclear blue she said, ``Thank you for what you said about cloning and \ntaking the position you did on cloning.'' I don't even think it was in \nthe newspaper. It was on television, I think. CNN may have carried that \ntype of thing. But I was curious as to why this young woman, who, if I \nam not mistaken, lives on a farm, I believe--I can't quite remember \nthat detail. I asked her, ``Why are you so interested in this?'' She \nsaid because she\n\n[[Page S508]]\n\nhas a rare kidney disorder. She is hoping because of rejection \npossibilities that there might come a time when we could actually grow \nthe kind of tissue that would develop into a kidney to replace her \nkidney so that there wouldn't be that possibility of rejection. She got \nit. She understood it.\n  That is what we are talking about. Those are the kinds of \npossibilities that I believe will happen in my lifetime if we do not \nact irresponsibly and irrationally.\n  This bill, S. 1601, would make it a crime to conduct some research \nseeking to generate stem cells to treat a wide variety of and a wide \nrange of deadly and disabling diseases.\n  S. 1601 could ban blood cell therapies for diseases such as leukemia \nand sickle cell anemia, nerve cell therapies for Alzheimer's disease, \nParkinson's disease, Lou Gehrig's disease, and multiple sclerosis. It \ncould ban nerve cell therapy for spinal cord injuries, a very promising \narea of research for cloning. It could ban pancreas cells to treat \ndiabetes, skin cell transplants for severe burns, liver cell \ntransplants for liver damage, muscle cell therapies for muscular \ndystrophy and heart disease. This bill before us could ban research on \ncartilage cells for reconstruction of joints damaged by arthritis or \ninjuries. It could ban cells for use of genetic therapy to treat 5,000 \ndifferent genetic diseases, including cystic fibrosis, Tay-Sachs \ndisease, schizophrenia, depression, and other diseases. S. 1601 could \npermanently ban all of this type of research.\n  In addition, under this bill, scientists could be thrown in jail for \n10 years if they conduct this research--research which may not have any \nsingle thing to do with cloning a human being.\n  Last year, during this hearing on human cloning research, someone \nasked, ``Are there appropriate limits to human knowledge?'' Quite \nfrankly, I responded--and I respond again--to say that I do not think \nthere are any appropriate limits to human knowledge, none whatsoever. I \nthink it is the very essence of our humanity and human nature. As long \nas science is done ethically and openly and with the informed consent \nof all parties, I do not think Congress should attempt to place limits \non the pursuit of knowledge.\n  To those who suggest that cloning research is an attempt to play God, \nI invite you to take your ranks alongside Pope Paul V who, in 1616, \npersecuted the great astronomer Galileo for heresy--for saying that the \nEarth indeed revolved around the Sun and not otherwise.\n  But we don't have to go back that far. Not too long ago in our \nNation's history, Americans viewed artificial insemination as abhorrent \nand its use was banned as being morally repugnant--even for animals; \neven for animals. There was an attempt to ban artificial insemination. \nOf course, now that is about all we use on the farm these days. Heart \ntransplants were scorned and X-rays were considered witchcraft. But \ntoday we don't think twice about test tube babies, in vitro \nfertilization, or organ transplants.\n  Throughout the 1950s, whenever we pushed the bounds of human \nknowledge, there has always been a constant refrain of saying, ``Stop--\nyou are playing God.'' But if a couple did not have a baby and decides \nto seek artificial insemination, is that playing God? If a patient is \ndying of kidney disease and a doctor decided to transplant healthy \nkidneys, is that playing God? If a patient is dying of heart disease \nand receives a heart transplant, are we playing God?\n  Others say that human cloning research is demeaning to human nature. \nI am sorry; I don't think so. I think that any attempt to limit the \npursuit of human knowledge is demeaning to human nature. I think it is \nthe very essence of our humanity to ask how and why and if and what. I \nthink it is demeaning to human nature to raise unfounded fears among \nthe people of America. I think that is demeaning to human nature.\n  As I said, I think the finest part and the very essence of our human \nnature and our humanity is to ask why, how, and what if. It is our very \nhumanity that compels us to probe the universe from the subatomic to \nthe cosmos, and, yes, from blastocysts to the full human anatomy. Our \nhumanity compels us to do that.\n  However, I must admit that I think it is rightly proper for us as \npolicymakers to ask how human cloning research is going to affect our \nNation. It is right and proper for us to examine the use of public \nfunds for scientific research.\n  But I urge my colleagues to proceed with caution on this legislation. \nWhat we are talking about here is not the cloning of a human being. \nWhat we are talking about is the cloning of cells, and without further \nresearch and appropriate regulations, many people will die and become \nill and spend very, very miserable lives when that could otherwise be \nalleviated through this cloning research.\n  So I have to ask: Why the rush to pass hastily drafted legislation on \nthis very complex technical subject? We need to take the time to \nconsider what could be the unintended consequences. The U.S. Congress \nand the Senate should tread very softly before sending scientists to \njail for what could be promising research to cure diseases and \ndisabilities.\n  Mr. President, there was an article in Time Magazine dated February \n9, 1998, called ``The Case for Cloning.'' I ask unanimous consent that \nthis article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From Time magazine, February 9, 1998]\n\nThe Case for Cloning--The Benefits of This Bold Technique Outweigh the \n              Risks, and the Danger is Not What You Think\n\n                          By J. Madeleine Nash\n\n       An elderly man develops macular degeneration, a disease \n     that destroys vision. To bolster his failing eyesight, he \n     receives a transplant of health retinal tissue--cloned from \n     his own cells and cultivated in a lab dish.\n       A baby girl is born free of the gene that causes Tay-Sachs \n     disease, even though both her parents are carriers. The \n     reason? In the embryonic cell from which she was cloned, the \n     flawed gene was replaced with normal DNA.\n       These futuristic scenarios are not now part of the debate \n     over human cloning, but they should be. Spurred by the fear \n     that maverick physicist Richard Seed, or someone like him, \n     will open a cloning clinic, lawmakers are rushing to enact \n     broad restrictions against human cloning. To date, 19 \n     European nations have signed an anticloning treaty. The \n     Clinton Administration backs a proposal that would impose a \n     five-year moratorium. House majority leader Dick Armey has \n     thrown his weight behind a bill that would ban human cloning \n     permanently, and at least 18 states are contemplating \n     legislative action of their own. ``This is the right thing to \n     do, at the right time, for the sake of human dignity,'' said \n     Armey last week. ``How can you put a statute of limitations \n     on right and wrong?''\n       But hasty legislation could easily be too restrictive. Last \n     year, for instance, Florida considered a law that would have \n     barred the cloning of human DNA, a routine procedure in \n     biomedical research. California passed badly worded \n     legislation that temporarily bans not just human cloning but \n     also a procedure that shows promise as a new treatment for \n     infertility.\n       Most lawmakers are focused on a nightmarish vision in which \n     billionaires and celebrities flood the world with genetic \n     copies of themselves. But scientists say it's unlikely that \n     anyone is going to be churning out limited editions Michael \n     Jordan or Madeleine Albright. ``Oh, it can be done,'' says \n     Dr. Mark Sauer, chief of reproductive endocrinology at \n     Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. \n     ``It's just that the best people, who could do it, aren't \n     going to be doing it.''\n       Cloning individual human cells, however, is another matter. \n     Biologists are already talking about harnessing for medical \n     purposes the technique that produced the sheep called Dolly. \n     They might, for example, obtain healthy cells from a patient \n     with leukemia or a burn victim and then transfer the nucleus \n     of each cell into an unfertilized egg from which the nucleus \n     has been removed. Coddled in culture dishes, these embryonic \n     clones--each genetically identical to the patient from, which \n     the nuclei cme--would begin to divide.\n       The cells would not have to grow unto a fetus, however. The \n     addition of powerful growth factors could ensure that the \n     clones develop only into specialized cells and tissue. For \n     the leukemia patient, for example, the cloned cells could \n     provide an infusion of fresh bone morrow, and for the burn \n     victim, grafts of brand-new skin. Unlike cells from an \n     unrelated donor, these cloned cells would incur no danger of \n     rejection, patients would be spared the need to take powerful \n     drugs to suppress the immune system. ``Given its potential \n     benefit,'' says Dr. Robert Winston, a fertility expert at \n     London's Hammersmith Hospital, ``I would argue that it would \n     be unethical not to continue this line of research.''\n       There are dangers, but not the ones everyone's talking \n     about, according to Princeton\n\n[[Page S509]]\n\n     University molecular biologist Lee Silver, author of Remaking \n     Eden (Avon Books). Silver believes that cloning is the \n     technology that will finally make it possible to apply \n     genetic engineering to humans. First, parents will want to \n     banish inherited diseases like Tay-Sachs. Then they will try \n     to eliminate predispositions to alcoholism and obesity. In \n     the end, says Silver, they will attempt to augument normal \n     traits like intelligence and athletic prowess.\n       Cloning could be vital to that process. At present, \n     introducing genes into chromosomes is very much a hit-or-miss \n     proposition. Scientists might achieve the result they intend \n     once in 20 times, making the procedure far too risky to \n     perform on a human embryo. through cloning, however, \n     scientists could make 20 copies of the embryo they wished to \n     modify, greatly boosting their chance of success.\n       Perhpas now would be a good time to ask ourselves which we \n     fear more: that cloning will produce multiple copies of \n     crazed despots, as in the film The Boys from Brazil, or that \n     it will lead to the society portrayed in Gattaca, the recent \n     science-fiction thriller in which genetic enhancement of a \n     privileged few creates a rigid caste structure. By acting \n     sensibly, we might avoid both traps.\n\n\n                           WHO COULD BENEFIT?\n\n       Cloning might help patients with Parkinson's and other \n     brain diseases by providing them with neural tissue that is \n     genetically identical to their own.\n       Burn victims could receive soft, new skin, which would be \n     grown in a laboratory and wrapped around injured areas like a \n     bandage.\n       Patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia could gain \n     reliable source of healthy bone marrow, which might \n     eventually result in a cure.\n       Combined with gene therapy, cloning may make it possible \n     for scientists to eliminate the transmission of Tay-Sachs and \n     other inherited diseases.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, for example, I want to read a couple of \nthings from the article. It says:\n\n       House Majority Leader Dick Armey has thrown his weight \n     behind a bill that would ban human cloning permanently. \n     ``This is the right thing to do, at the right time, for the \n     sake of human dignity,'' said Armey. ``How can you put a \n     statute of limitations on right and wrong?''\n\n  Right and wrong? It is wrong to conduct cloning research that might \nenable us to grow a liver out of a person's own DNA? To grow skin out \nof a person's own DNA? Perhaps even to grow heart tissue, or even a \nfull heart, out of a person's own DNA, so there would be no rejection \npossibilities? It is wrong to do research in cloning of cells that \nmight permit my nephew, Kelly, who, at the age of 19, got injured in \nthe military, his spinal cord was broken and he has been a quadriplegic \nsince and still holds out the hope that research someday is going to \nenable him to walk again? And, yes, cloning research might be able to \nrebuild those kinds of cells from his own DNA that will get those nerve \nendings going again so that my nephew can walk again. That research is \nwrong? I ask who appointed the House majority leader as the arbiter of \nwhat is right and wrong in biomedical research?\n  Well, as the drafter of this article went on:\n\n       . . . hasty legislation could easily be too restrictive. \n     Last year, for instance, Florida considered a law that would \n     have barred the cloning of human DNA, a routine procedure in \n     biomedical research.\n\n  You might say that's not what we are doing here. But we could be \nsending the wrong signals to State legislatures, again, to try the same \nthing:\n\n       Cloning individual human cells [the writer goes on], \n     however, is another matter. Biologists are already talking \n     about harnessing for medical purposes the technique that \n     produced a sheep called Dolly. They might, for example, \n     obtain healthy cells from a patient with leukemia or a burn \n     victim and then transfer the nucleus of each cell into an \n     unfertilized egg from which the nucleus has been removed. \n     Coddled in culture dishes, these embryonic clones--each \n     genetically identical to the patient from which the nuclei \n     came--would begin to divide.\n       The cells would not have to grow into a fetus, however. The \n     addition of powerful growth factors can ensure that the \n     clones develop only into specialized cells and tissue. For \n     the leukemia patient, for example, the cloned cells could \n     provide an infusion of fresh bone marrow, and for the burn \n     victim, grafts of brand-new skin. Unlike cells from an \n     unrelated donor, these cloned cells would incur no danger of \n     rejection, patients would be spared the need to take powerful \n     drugs to suppress the immune system.\n\n  And this, I think, says it all:\n\n       Given its potential benefit,'' says Dr. Robert Winston, a \n     fertility expert at London's Hammersmith Hospital, ``I would \n     argue that it would be unethical not to continue this line of \n     research.\n\n  Mr. President, I hope that tomorrow, when we vote on this, that the \nSenate will choose to be on the side of the Galileos, those who want to \nexpand human knowledge, those who will not be constricted by outmoded \nand outdated ideas, who understand it's the very nature of our humanity \nto ask how and why and what if. No, not to be on the side of those who \nwanted to keep the Sun moving around the Earth, but to be on the side \nof progress and advancement, enlightenment and unlimited human \npotential.\n  S. 1601 needs to be amended drastically. Frankly, it needs to be sent \nto committee. There is no rush. Dr. Seed--is that his name? Yes, Dr. \nSeed from Chicago is not going to clone any human being. No reputable \nscientist or doctor that I have spoken to, and I have spoken to quite a \nfew of them, believes he is anywhere near that for years and years and \nyears. But he is making a name for himself. He is on all the talk \nshows, that's for sure. He has become notorious, a public figure, and I \nguess a lot of people like to do that.\n  But just because he's irresponsible doesn't mean we ought to be \nirresponsible. Let's take a careful look at this. Let's have our \nhearings. Let's bring in the experts. Let's bring in the bioethicists, \nthe people from all the different communities, to see what parameters, \nif any, should be drawn on this. The parameters of S. 1601 are too \nconstrictive.\n  To send scientists to jail for up to 10 years for doing the kind of \nresearch that can enable my nephew to walk again is not the kind of \nlegislation that we ought to be passing here.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call will roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/09/senate-section/article/S507-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S509-S511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF DAVID SATCHER, OF TENNESSEE, TO BE AN ASSISTANT SECRETARY \n  OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH \n       SERVICE, AND SURGEON GENERAL OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the nomination.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly about the \nnomination of Dr. William Satcher to become the United States Surgeon \nGeneral and Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  I have been closely following the Senate debate regarding Dr. \nSatcher's nomination and his qualifications to serve as the next \nSurgeon General and Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services. \nIn particular, I found his views regarding partial birth abortion and \nhis role in clinical AZT trials to treat patients infected with HIV in \nAfrica and Southeast Asia disturbing.\n  While Dr. Satcher initially expressed his opposition to partial birth \nabortions, he also stated that he shares President Clinton's view that \na ban on this procedure should include an exception for cases in which \nthe procedure might be needed to protect the health of a pregnant \nwoman. This raises serious concerns for me, since I am adamantly \nopposed to partial birth abortions except to save the life of a woman. \nThis is a procedure which is inhumane and offensive to anyone who \nvalues human life. No matter what a person believes regarding the \nlegalization of abortion, we should all be appalled and outraged by the \npractice of partial birth abortions.\n  Since these concerns were raised, however, Dr. Satcher has provided \nwritten assurances regarding his intentions if nominated. Dr. Satcher \nwrote, ``I have no intention of using the positions of Assistant \nSecretary for Health and Surgeon General to promote issues related to \nabortion. I share no one's political agenda and I want to use the power \nof these positions to focus on issues that unite Americans--not divide \nthem.'' Dr. Satcher also wrote that he would promote a message of \nabstinence from premarital sex and behavioral responsibility to our \nyouth. This is a commendable objective that should be promoted among \nour nation's youth.\n\n[[Page S510]]\n\n  The other major concern raised for me was Dr. Satcher's role in \nclinical trials of AZT conducted in Africa and Southeast Asia. In 1994, \nthe World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that studies be \nconducted to test the safety and efficacy of short-term AZT therapy in \ndeveloping countries in reducing the transmission of HIV from pregnant \nwomen to their babies. This study was needed because 1,000 babies are \nborn every day infected with HIV in developing nations. This study was \nintended to determine an effective and affordable treatment for women \nin the nations that can not afford the expensive AZT and are unable to \nreceive intravenous treatments. The developing nations, in conjunction \nwith the WHO, determined that placebo controlled trials offered the \nbest method for determining an alternative to the expensive and \nculturally incompatible AZT drug treatment.\n  After reviewing the available materials on these studies and \nconferring with Senator Frist, who is a practicing medical physician \nand has extensive knowledge and experience with the complex issue of \nbiomedical ethics, I am confidant that these AZT trials were conducted \nin a scientifically sound and ethical manner. It is my understanding \nthat the appropriate protocols for these clinical trials were developed \nand extensively reviewed for scientific and ethical integrity by \nInstitutional Review Boards in the United States and by equivalent \ncommittees in the counties conducting the clinical trials. According to \nthese medical standards, it is clear that the CDC's decision, under the \nguidance of Dr. Satcher, regarding the AZT trials researching methods \nfor providing functional, affordable and effective care to people \nworldwide was based on sound ethics and science.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the individual who fills the position \nof Surgeon General must be a person who unites our nation and promotes \nhealthy living. This individual must place the health and well-being of \nour nation's citizens far above any political agenda. They must provide \nleadership in disease prevention and health promotion throughout our \ncountry by developing innovative and worthwhile public health \ninitiatives. In short, our nation's Surgeon General must be capable of \nserving as a national symbol of commitment to protecting and improving \nthe public's health.\n  After carefully reviewing all the facts surrounding Dr. Satcher's \nprofessional career and consulting with members of the medical \ncommunity, including our colleague, Senator Frist, I am confident that \nDr. Satcher is well-qualified to serve this nation in these important \npublic health positions. It is my belief that the concerns raised about \nDr. Satcher have been adequately and openly addressed. I believe that \nhe has continually demonstrated his commitment to public health \nthroughout his life and is ready and willing to continue these efforts \nas Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary of Health and Human \nServices. Therefore, I am confident that when Dr. Satcher is confirmed \nas the next U.S. Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, he will serve the health needs of our nation and I will \nsupport his efforts.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \nconfirmation of the nominee for Surgeon General of the United States, \nDavid Satcher, and I allocate myself such time as I may consume in \nopposition.\n  Mr. President, we have had extended debate on this nomination. It is \nconceded by individuals from every quarter that the nominee is a person \nof great talent, of substantial intellectual capacity, and who has made \na substantial contribution to the medical community. The reservations \nwhich I have expressed in no way are designed to derogate the record of \nachievement that this medical doctor has assembled. But there are a \nseries of concerns which I have raised, some of which are so serious \nthat I believe they would cause us to refrain from voting to confirm \nthis nominee to lead us as America's family doctor.\n  I would like to just mention four of them, as I conclude my remarks \ntoday. As is contained in the unanimous consent order, there will be \nanother hour of debate on this issue tomorrow prior to the vote on \ncloture, and in the event cloture is invoked, there will be a vote on \nfinal passage immediately thereafter.\n  These four points, though, I would like to raise, and I believe each \nof these would be adequate or sufficient as a basis for denying \nconfirmation here. But certainly the cumulative impact of these \nparticular concerns should weigh heavily on the minds of Senators as we \nmove toward the votes related to the confirmation of this nominee. And \nin my case they clearly indicate that we should not vote in favor of \nthis confirmation.\n  The first is this. This is a nominee who favors partial-birth \nabortion. Partial-birth abortion is a procedure that has been \ndemonstrated to be a cruel, inhumane, unnecessary procedure. The \nAmerican Medical Association opposes it. Three-quarters of the American \npeople oppose it, especially those who understand what it is. And for \nthis nominee to side with the political agenda of the President rather \nthan the health agenda of the United States of America indicates, I \nthink all too clearly, that the agenda will be politics rather than \nhealth. We ought to have a Surgeon General who has a health agenda and \ndoes not repair to the politics of the President or anyone else.\n  Next, during the time when this nominee presided over the Centers for \nDisease Control, he and the Centers for Disease Control sponsored \nstudies in Africa regarding the transmission of AIDS from HIV infected \nmothers to their children.\n  Rather than implement an ethical strategy for that research that was \nconsistent with the ethics in the United States, they conducted the \ntests by giving half of the individuals in the study sugar pills or \nplacebos, when there was a known, effective treatment. This was such a \nbreach of the ethics of the medical profession in testing that the New \nEngland Journal of Medicine, the No. 1 medical journal in the United \nStates of America, very seriously and aggressively cited this ethical \nlapse and said that these studies were unethical and should be \ndiscontinued on that basis.\n  The truth of the matter is, the studies go forward. There are a lot \nof reasons that have been put forth in this debate about why they have \ngone forward. Some have talked about informed consent. It is clear the \nlevel of informed consent there would never pass muster here.\n  What is clear to me is this nominee views lives differently in Africa \nthan he could be allowed to view them in the United States. This \nnominee views lives differently before they are born, in the partial-\nbirth abortion arena, than I think the American people do.\n  Next, there were CDC studies on HIV-infected newborns in this \ncountry. No identification was made of the newborns. The studies were \nconducted after the blood samples were de-identified. This may have \nbeen an appropriate strategy before we knew that we could help a \nnewborn that tested positive for HIV. But once we developed a potential \ntherapy, to persist with the studies in the absence of identification \nof the infected newborn and notification to the parent so that remedial \naction could be taken, it seems to me a tremendous moral lapse, and it \nwas characterized by one of the most notable AIDS researchers in the \nworld as a breach of the ethics not only of the United States, but \ninternational ethics.\n  When the Congress got upset about this and sought to ask Dr. Satcher \nand the CDC to cease these tests where you learned about the fact that \nthere were X number of HIV-infected babies but you couldn't identify \nthem, and therefore, you weren't able to tell the parents, what did Dr. \nSatcher do? He came to the Hill to lobby Congress that we should keep \ndoing that, in spite of the fact that we had the ability, once we \nlearned about the HIV virus, to be able to curtail it with the therapy, \nwith the administration of drugs and other things. I think that \ncompounds the ethical problems that were identified in the Africa \nstudies, and it compounds the ethical problems that relate to the \ndisregard for human existence that characterizes his embrace of the \nPresident's position on partial-birth abortion.\n  The last item which was the subject of significant debate today was \nthe needle exchange program. While Dr. Satcher has indicated that he \ndoesn't support needle exchange programs, the\n\n[[Page S511]]\n\ndocuments that have only recently been released by the Centers for \nDisease Control find him in endorsement of needle exchange programs, \nand urging that there be large amounts of Federal money to support \nneedle exchange programs.\n  I don't believe that we need a family doctor for America who says we \nought to subsidize the drug culture by providing free needles, by \nsaying to the drug dealers, you can get all the needles you want, and \nwhen you want to go and tell our young people that they should get \ninvolved in your drug culture, you can have the authority of the \nGovernment with you to say it must be OK; surely, the Government \nwouldn't provide us with these free, clean, sterile needles to use in \nshooting up drugs if it weren't in your best interest.\n  I think that sends the worst message possible to young people that \nthe Government is a subsidizer of and a promoter of an environment in \nwhich drugs can be used with lowered risk.\n  My own sense is that it makes no more sense to provide clean needles \nto drug dealers than it would be to provide bulletproof vests to bank \nrobbers. We could surely make bank robbing a safer occupation by \nproviding bulletproof vests, but we wouldn't want to do it. Neither \nshould we make intravenous drug use a sort of project of the Government \nbecause we might be able to provide some safety to some user.\n\n  I won't go into the details; we have already done that. We already \nknow that people who don't care enough about themselves to use good \nneedles or clean needles in drug use won't take care of the needles \nonce they have used them. One town found over 300 needles in the course \nof 1 week after a privately funded clean-needle program was implemented \nthere. I don't think we want our playgrounds and our streets and our \ncities to be littered with once-used free needles supplied by the \nGovernment that could later infect our children.\n  All of these things that relate to a disregard for the right health \nstrategy for America are disqualifying events for this candidate: \npartial-birth abortion, the African AIDS studies, the domestic blind \nHIV tests on newborns, where we persisted in this practice even after \nwe discovered an effective therapy for these infants, and last but not \nleast, the clean-needle exchange program, which basically wants to \naccept drug culture as a way of life instead of calling America to its \nhighest and best and saying that the real problem is heroin, the real \nproblem is drug addiction, the real problem is not the absence of a \nneedle program funded by the taxpayers. The taxpayers do not want us to \ndestroy their neighborhoods by subsidizing drug dealers who will not \nonly use the clean needles, but leave them in places where they can \ninfect the children of America.\n  For those reasons, I believe it would be appropriate for us to reject \nthe nomination of Dr. David Satcher to be Surgeon General. We do need a \nSurgeon General, but we don't need one so badly that we need to welcome \none who doesn't really call us to the highest and best health that \nAmerica ought to have.\n  Mr. President, I thank you very much for the opportunity to make \nthese concluding remarks. With that, I yield back the remainder of my \ntime on today's debate, reserving, obviously, the time to be a \nparticipant in the debate tomorrow on this issue. I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/09/senate-section/article/S509-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  (During today's session of the Senate, the following morning business \nwas transacted.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/09/senate-section/article/S511-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S511-S512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF MARGARET MORROW\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we will soon debate the confirmation of \nMargaret Morrow to be a United States District Judge. Her \nqualifications are exemplary; her commitment to public service is \nimpressive; and her supporters are many.\n  Despite the high regard of a broad and bipartisan group of attorneys \nand judges, Ms. Morrow has had to wait over 19 months for a vote of the \nfull Senate. But this long delay is finally coming to an end. I am very \npleased Senator Lott has promised that, before the February recess, \nthis fine nominee will get her day on the Senate floor.\n  The Alliance for Justice, which represents a whole host of \norganizations interested in a strong judiciary, sent a letter to me \nyesterday outlining their many reasons for supporting the nomination of \nMargaret Morrow as well as their concern about the time it has taken \nfor the Senate to act. As a supplement to the voluminous information \nalready on the record in support of this nomination, I submit the \nAlliance for Justice's letter for my colleagues' review. Mr. President, \nI ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 February 4, 1998.\n     Senator Tom Daschle,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: We write to express our concern over \n     a series of developments that continue to unfold in the \n     Senate that are undermining the judicial confirmation \n     process. These include calls for the impeachment of judges, a \n     slowdown in the pace of confirmations, unjustified criticisms \n     of certain nominees, and efforts to leave appellate vacancies \n     unfilled. Some court observers have opined that collectively \n     these are the most serious efforts to curtail judicial \n     independence since President Roosevelt's plan to pack the \n     Supreme Court in 1937.\n       In the past year nominees who failed to meet certain \n     ultraconservative litmus tests have been labeled ``judicial \n     activists.'' While these charges are unfounded, they \n     nonetheless delay confirmations and leave judicial seats \n     unfilled. We note that of the 14 individuals whose \n     nominations have been pending the longest, 12 are women or \n     minorities. This disturbing pattern is in striking contrast \n     to those 14 judges who were confirmed in 1997 in the shortest \n     period of time, 11 of whom are white men. For example, \n     Margaret Morrow, a judicial nominee to the United States \n     District Court for the Central District of California, was \n     nominated more than a year and a half ago. Not only is she an \n     outstanding candidate, but her credentials have earned her \n     enthusiastic and bipartisan endorsements from leaders of the \n     bar, judges, politicians, and civic groups.\n       An honors graduate from Harvard Law School, a civil \n     litigator for more than 20 years, winner of numerous legal \n     awards, and the first female president of the California Bar \n     Association, Morrow has the breadth of background and \n     experience to make her an excellent judge, and in the words \n     of one of her sponsors, she would be ``an exceptionally \n     distinguished addition to the federal bench.'' Morrow has \n     also shown, through her numerous pro bono activities, a \n     demonstrated commitment to equal justice. As president of the \n     Los Angeles County Bar Association, she created the Pro Bono \n     Council, the first of its kind in California. During her year \n     as bar president, the Council coordinated the provision of \n     150,000 hours of previously untapped representation to \n     indigent clients throughout the country. Not surprisingly, \n     the American Bar Association's judicial evaluation committee \n     gave her its highest rating.\n       Republicans and Democrats alike speak highly of her \n     accomplishments and qualifications. Robert Bonner, a Reagan-\n     appointed U.S. Attorney and U.S. District Judge for the \n     Central District of California and head of the Drug \n     Enforcement Administration during the Bush Administration, \n     has said Morrow is a ``brilliant person with a first-rate \n     legal mind who was nominated upon merit, not political \n     affiliation.'' Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block wrote \n     that, ``Margaret Morrow is an extremely hard working \n     individual of impeccable character and integrity. . . . I \n     have no doubt that she would be a distinguished addition to \n     the Court.'' Other supporters include local bar leaders; \n     officials from both parties, including Los Angeles Mayor \n     Richard Riordan; California judges appointed by the \n     state's last three governors; and three Republican-\n     appointed Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals judges, Pamela \n     Rymer, Cynthia Holcomb Hall, and Stephen Trott.\n       Despite her outstanding record, Morrow has become the \n     target of a coordinated effort by ultraconservative groups \n     that seek to politicize the judiciary. They have subjected \n     her to a campaign of misrepresentations, distortions and \n     attacks on her record, branding her a ``judicial activist.'' \n     According to her opponents, she deserves to be targeted \n     because ``she is a member of California Women Lawyers,'' an \n     absurd charge given that this bipartisan organization is \n     among the most highly respected in the state. Another \n     ``strike'' against her is her concern, expressed in a \n     sentence from a 1988 article, about special interest \n     domination of the ballot initiative process in California. \n     Her opponents view the statement as disdainful of voter \n     initiatives such as California's term limits law; however, \n     they overlook the fact that the article outlines a series of \n     recommended reforms to preserve the process.\n\n[[Page S512]]\n\n     It is a stretch to construe suggested reforms as evidence of \n     ``judicial activism,'' but to search for this members of the \n     Judiciary Committee unprecedentedly asked her to disclose her \n     personal positions on all 160 past ballot propositions in \n     California.\n       Morrow's confirmation has been delayed by the Senate beyond \n     any reasonable bounds. Originally selected over nineteen \n     months ago in May 1996, her nomination was unanimously \n     approved by the Judiciary Committee that year, only to \n     languish on the Senate floor. Morrow was again nominated at \n     the beginning of 1997, subjected to an unusual second \n     hearing, and recommended again by the Judiciary Committee, \n     after which several Senators placed secret holds on her \n     nomination, preventing a final vote on her confirmation. \n     These holds, which prevented a final vote on her confirmation \n     during the 1st Session of the 105th Congress, were recently \n     lifted.\n       As Senator Orrin Hatch repeatedly said: ``playing politics \n     with judges is unfair, and I'm sick of it.'' We agree with \n     his sentiment. Given Margaret Morrow's impressive \n     qualifications, we urge you to bring the nomination to the \n     Senate floor, ensure that it receives prompt, full and fair \n     consideration, and that a final vote on her nomination is \n     scheduled as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n         Alliance for Justice: Nan Aron, President; American \n           Jewish Congress: Phil Baum, Executive Director; \n           Americans for Democratic Action: Amy Isaacs, National \n           Director; Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law: Robert \n           Bernstein, Executive Law; Brennan Center for Justice: \n           E.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize former Navy \nand Marine Corps members who received the Distinguished Flying Cross in \naccordance with section 573 of the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 1998, which waived time limitations for award of this \ndecoration for specified persons. These awards were recommended by the \nSecretary of the Navy based upon requests from Members of Congress. \nThese procedures were established by section 526 of the National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 to resolve a dilemma \nunder which deserving individuals were denied the recognition they \ndeserved solely due to the passage of time. I am proud to have \nestablished a procedure that enables these distinguished veterans to \nreceive the honors they earned.

Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate will cast one of the \nmost important votes of this Congress, and perhaps of this decade. That \nvote will determine whether one of the most promising avenues of \nresearch against a host of dread diseases will continue, or whether the \nCongress will act to ban it--and condemn millions of Americans to \nunnecessary death and disability in the process.\n  The vote that will occur is on a cloture motion to take up S. 1601. \nThe authors of S. 1601 say that it is a bill to ban the production of \nhuman beings by cloning--an attempt to stop Dr. Seed and other \nunscrupulous scientists in their tracks.\n  But that claim cannot pass the truth in advertising test. S. 1601 \nisn't a bill to ban a brave new world of mass production of cloned \nhuman beings. It is not legislation to stop wealthy individuals from \nreproducing themselves at will in an unscrupulous and unethical attempt \nto achieve a kind of immortality. Instead, this legislation bans the \nactual technology used in human cloning research--the technology that \ncould be used to create cures for cancer, diabetes, spinal cord \ninjuries, arthritis-damaged joints, birth defects, and a host of \nterrible neurological diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's \ndisease, Lou Gehrig's Disease, and multiple sclerosis.\n  Every scientist in America understands the threat this legislation \nposes to critical medical research. Every American should understand \nit, too. A vote against cloture is a vote for medical research. It is a \nvote for millions of Americans suffering from dread diseases for whom \nthe technology of cloning offers hope of new and miraculous cures. But \nit is certainly not a vote in favor of cloning human beings. Congress \ncan and should act to ban cloning of human beings during this session. \nBut it should not act in haste, and it should not pass legislation that \ngoes far beyond what the American people want or what the scientific \nand medical community understands is necessary and appropriate.\n  Senator Feinstein and I understand the importance of a ban on \ncreating human beings by cloning. This is an ethical judgment I believe \nour society is ready to make. We have introduced legislation of our own \nthat will accomplish this goal. We hope that it can be reviewed through \nthe normal committee process of hearings and mark-up. I have no doubt \nthat responsible legislation to ban the production of human beings by \ncloning can come through committee and mark-up and be passed into law \nduring this session of Congress. But S. 1601 is not that responsible \nban on cloning. It is an attempt to capitalize on public concern to \nrush through a sweeping and inappropriate ban on critical medical \nresearch.\n  I have just received the Administration's statement of position on S. \n1601. The President has taken the lead in directing a prompt response \nto the ethical and moral dilemmas created by human cloning. He called \nfor a ban on creation of a human being by cloning in the State of the \nUnion message. If S. 1601 were simply a ban on creation of a human \nbeing by cloning, it would receive his wholehearted support. But that \nis not what S. 1601 does, and that is why the Administration says in \nits letter, ``On June 9, 1997, the President transmitted to Congress \nlegislation making it illegal for anyone to create a human being \nthrough cloning. The President believes that using somatic cell nuclear \ntransfer cloning techniques to create a human being is untested, \nunsafe, and morally unacceptable. The Administration, however, believes \nS. 1601, as introduced, is too far-reaching because it would prohibit \nimportant biomedical research aimed at preventing and treating serious \nand life-threatening diseases. Therefore, the Administration does not \nsupport passage of the bill in its current form.''\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of the Administration \nstatement of position be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                 Washington, DC, February 9, 1998.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n    (This statement has been coordinated by OMB with the concerned \n                               agencies)\n\n\n                 s. 1601--human cloning prohibition act\n\n       On June 9, 1997, the President transmitted to Congress \n     legislation making it illegal for anyone to create a human \n     being through cloning. The President believes that using \n     somatic cell nuclear transfer cloning techniques to create a \n     human being is untested, unsafe, and morally unacceptable. \n     The Administration, however, believes S. 1601, as introduced, \n     is too far-reaching because it would prohibit important \n     biomedical research aimed at preventing and treating serious \n     and life-threatening diseases. Therefore, the Administration \n     would not support passage of the bill in its current form. \n     The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress \n     to address these concerns. Specifically, the Administration \n     supports amendments to S. 1601 that would:\n       Include a five-year sunset on the prohibition on human \n     somatic cell nuclear transfer technology. The sunset \n     provision would ensure a continuing examination of the risks \n     and benefits of this, while being free from the concern that \n     someone will use it prematurely.\n       Permit somatic cell nuclear transfer using human cells for \n     the purpose of developing stem cell (unspecialized cells \n     capable of giving rise to specific cells and tissue) \n     technology to prevent and treat serious and life-threatening \n     diseases and other medical conditions, including the \n     treatment of cancer, diabetes, genetic diseases, and spinal \n     cord injuries and for basic research that could lead to such \n     treatments.\n       Strike the bill's criminal penalties and instead make any \n     property, real or personal, derived from or used to commit \n     violations of the Act subject to forfeiture to the United \n     States.\n       Strike the bill's provisions establishing a new Commission \n     to Promote a National Dialogue on Bioethics. The new \n     Commission would needlessly duplicate the mission of the \n     President's National Bioethics Advisory Commission.\n       The President's proposal, which in many ways is reflected \n     in S. 1602 sponsored by Senators Feinstein and Kennedy, would \n     prohibit any attempt to create a human being using somatic \n     cell nuclear transfer, provide for further review of the \n     ethical and scientific issues associated with the use of \n     somatic cell nuclear transfer, and protect important \n     biomedical research.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as the scientific and medical community \nlearns more about this legislation, almost universal opposition is \ndeveloping. The American Association of Medical Colleges has circulated \na letter to other scientific and medical organizations asking that this \nlegislation not go forward.\n  The letter states,\n\n       The current opportunities in biomedical research are \n     unparalleled in our nation's history. To ensure that these \n     continue, the scientific and organized medicine communities \n     urge you to oppose legislation that would prohibit the use of \n     somatic cell nuclear transfer due to the grave implications \n     it may have for future advances in biomedical research in \n     human healing.\n\n  They go on to compare S. 1601's attempts to ban not just cloning of \nhuman beings but use of the technique itself to the ill-considered \nattempts to ban recombinant DNA techniques in the '70's.\n  They state,\n\n       Like the recombinant DNA debate, the scientific techniques \n     involved in cloning research hold great promise for our \n     ability to treat and manage myriad diseases and disorders--\n     from cancer and heart disease, to Parkinson's and \n     Alzheimer's, to infertility and HIV/AIDS.\n\n  As of this morning, the letter had been signed by 71 distinguished \norganizations, from the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and \nImmunology, to the Association of American Cancer Institutes to the \nParkinson's Action Network--and the list continues to grow.\n  A letter from Dr. Gerald R. Fink, the Director of the Whitehead \nInstitute of the American Cancer Society--one of the pre-eminent cancer \nresearch institutes in the country--explains very clearly what is at \nstake. Dr. Fink says, ``I am very concerned about efforts to bring the \nBond bill to an immediate vote. While I agree that there should be a \nnational ban on human cloning, it is essential that any such law \nprotects areas of critical research that can benefit human health. The \nBond bill's generic ban on the use of `human somatic cell transfer \ntechnology,' would in fact be quite damaging to medical research \nprogress in the United States.\n  ``The Bond bill would seriously limit our ability to develop new \ncell-based strategies to fight cancer, diabetes, and\n\n[[Page S514]]\n\nAlzheimer's disease. It would also prevent vital research on the repair \nof spinal cord injuries and severe burns.\n  ``I urge you to convey to your colleagues that the Bond bill would \ncause us to lose ground in the battle against deadly and disabling \nhuman diseases.''\n  Is this really what the Senate or the American people want, Mr. \nPresident? To lose ground in the battle against deadly and disabling \nhuman diseases? I don't believe so.\n  More than 120 scientific and medical organizations have expressed \nopposition to the Lott-Bond bill or concerns about prohibition on \nlegitimate cloning research as the result of ill-conceived or over-\nbroad legislation.\n  So you have this immense array of scientific and medical societies \nand patient groups opposing S. 1601 and urging us to use caution and \nnot to rush ahead without adequate consideration. Our friends who are \nsupporting this bill say that it won't impede necessary research. If \nthis true, where is their support from people who know.\n  I ask them to cite even a handful of mainstream scientific or medical \norganizations supporting rushing their legislation through without \ncommittee hearings, adequate definitions, or even a semblance of \ncareful consideration. They can't do it. They can't do it, because the \nscientific and medical and patients' communities know that what they \nare doing is wrong.\n  As objectionable as the substance of this bill is the procedure by \nwhich it is being considered. To grant cloture to this bill tomorrow \nwould be a travesty of the Senate's role as a deliberative body.\n  This is one of the most important scientific and ethical issues of \nthe 21st century.\n  It was introduced on Tuesday of last week.\n  It was put on the calendar on Wednesday.\n  The Majority Leader tried to bring it to the floor on Thursday and \nfiled an immediate cloture petition when he was unsuccessful.\n  The Senate was not in session Friday--and few of our colleagues are \npresent today.\n  This legislation has not received one day of committee hearings.\n  It has not received one minute of committee discussion and markup.\n  The telephones in my office are ringing off the hook from scientists \nand physicians and patients from all over the country who are deeply \nconcerned about the impact of this legislation. But they have had no \nopportunity to have their voices heard.\n  Mr. President, this is an important issue. It warrants Senate \nconsideration. But it does not warrant consideration under this \naccelerated and indefensible procedure.\n  The authors of this legislation know that it cannot stand up to \npublic scrutiny. That is the reason for their extraordinary attempt to \nrush this legislation through.\n  The Lott-Bond bill does not just ban cloning of human beings, it bans \nvital medical research related to cloning--research which has the \npotential to find new cures for cancer, diabetes, birth defects and \ngenetic diseases of all kinds, blindness, Parkinson's disease, \nAlzheimer's disease, paralysis due to spinal cord injury, arthritis, \nliver disease, life-threatening burns, and many other illnesses and \ninjuries.\n  Here is what the bill says--Page 2, line 13, paragraph 301 is \nentitled, ``Prohibition on cloning.'' It is the heart of the bill. It \nstates, ``It shall be unlawful for any person or entity, public or \nprivate, in or affecting interstate commerce, to use human somatic cell \nnuclear transfer technology.'' That is the end of the statement.\n  It does not just ban the technology for use in human cloning. It bans \nit for any purpose at all.\n  That means scientists can't use the technology to try to grow cells \nto aid men and women dying of leukemia. They can't use it to grow new \neye tissue to help those going blind from certain types of cell \ndegeneration. They can't use it to grow new pancreas cells to cure \ndiabetes. They can't use it to regenerate brain tissue to help those \nwith Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease. They can't use it to \nregrow spinal cord tissue to cure those who have been paralyzed in \naccidents or by war wounds.\n  Congress should ban the production of human beings by cloning. But we \nshould not slam on the brakes and stop scientific research that has so \nmuch potential to bring help and hope to millions of citizens. As J. \nBenjamin Younger, Executive Director of the American Society for \nReproductive Medicine, has said:\n\n       We must work together to ensure that in our effort to make \n     human cloning illegal, we do not sentence millions of people \n     to needless suffering because research and progress into \n     their illness cannot proceed.\n\n  Let us work together. Let us stop this know-nothing and unnecessarily \ndestructive bill. Let us vote against cloture tomorrow and send this \nbill to Committee where it can receive the careful consideration it \ndeserves. Together, we can develop legislation that will ban the \ncloning of human beings, without banning needed medical research that \ncan bring the blessings of good health to so many millions of our \nfellow citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/09/senate-section/article/S513-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S514-S515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BOSTON'S SUCCESS FIGHTING JUVENILE CRIME\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I recently received an impressive letter \nfrom Boston Police Commissioner Paul Evans on Boston's current \nsuccessful experience in reducing crime in the city, especially \njuvenile crime. Firearms homicides have plummeted, and the overall \ncrime rate has dropped significantly.\n  As Commissioner Evans states, ``The keys to our effort in Boston have \nbeen prevention, intervention and enforcement.'' The city's \ncomprehensive approach includes not only law enforcement agencies, but \nthe entire criminal justice system and community and social service \nagencies as well. As more and more cities become aware of this \nsuccessful, anti-crime strategy, Boston is becoming a model for the \nnation on this vital issue.\n  His letter goes on to say, ``Our strategy relies on focused \nintervention, with smarter, tougher enforcement targeted at the very \nsmall group of hard-core offenders. We work closely with state and \nfederal agencies to disrupt the flow of illegal firearms by mounting \ncoordinated investigations and prosecutions of gun traffickers.''\n  As Commissioner Evans emphasizes, the progress in Boston was made \n``without measures such as housing juvenile detainees and convicts in \nadult jails and prisons. The focus of policy and dollars should be \nintervention and prevention at the front end, and not incarceration in \nadult facilities at the back end.''\n  As the Senate prepares to take up legislation to combat juvenile \ncrime, I urge my colleagues to heed the words of Commissioner Evans, \nand I ask unanimous consent that his letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     Boston Police Department,\n\n                                                 January 30, 1998.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: As the Senate prepares to debate the \n     juvenile crime bill, I agree with your suggestion that it \n     would be helpful to look again at the collaborative work in \n     Boston, and the progress we have made over the past 18-24 \n     months. I offer the following.\n       The keys to our effort in Boston have been prevention, \n     intervention and enforcement conducted with broad \n     collaboration across law enforcement, criminal justice, \n     community and social service agencies. Our strategy relies on \n     focused intervention, with smarter, tougher enforcement \n     targeted at the very small group of hard-core offenders. We \n     work closely with state and federal agencies to disrupt the \n     flow of illegal firearms by mounting coordinated \n     investigations and prosecutions of gun traffickers.\n       Firearm homicides among people aged 24 years and younger \n     are down over 70 percent since we instituted the innovative \n     ``Cease-Fire'' program in 1995. We have lost one juvenile to \n     a firearm homicide since July, 1995. Overall homicides are at \n     their lowest level in 30 years, with a 30 percent decrease in \n     1997 as compared with 1996.\n       It also noteworthy that we have made these strides without \n     measures such as housing juvenile detainees and convicts in \n     adult jails and prisons. The focus of policy and dollars \n     should be intervention and prevention at the front end, and \n     not incarceration in adult facilities at the back end.\n       As the Senate takes up the complex question of effective \n     juvenile crime control policy, I would strongly recommend \n     federal spending that requires collaboration, that requires \n     communities to support a balance of prevention along with \n     enforcement, and the directs these funds in the most crime-\n     impacted neighborhoods. We cannot be credible\n\n[[Page S515]]\n\n     in the community about enforcement if we are not credible on \n     prevention. The juvenile block grant offers an excellent \n     opportunity for the Senate to invest seriously in prevention.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                    Paul F. Evans,\n     Police Commissioner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/09/senate-section/article/S514-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

The agency supports an impressive range of projects \nencompassing the worlds of history, literature, philosophy, and \nculture. Through these projects, Americans of all walks of life are \nable to explore and share in the uniqueness of our Nation's democratic \nexperience.\n  The activities of the NEH touch tens of millions of our citizens--\nfrom the youngest students to the most veteran professors, to men and \nwomen who simply strive for a greater appreciation of our Nation's \npast, present, and future. The NEH has supported projects as diverse as \nthe widely viewed documentary, The West, and research as specialized as \nthat conducted on the Dakota Tribe. Small historical societies have \nreceived support, as have some of the Nation's largest cultural \ninstitutions.\n  Throughout our history, the humanities have provided Americans with \nthe knowledge, insights, and perspectives needed to move ourselves and \nour civilization forward. Today, the NEH remains vitally important to \npromoting our Nation's culture. Not only does its work continue to add \nimmeasurably to our civic life, it strengthens the democratic spirit so \nessential to our country and our world on the eve of a new century.\n                                                  William J.

A bill for the relief of Jesus M. Collado-Munoz; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                       private relief legislation\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. On September 28, 1996, the Senate passed the Omnibus \nConsolidated Appropriations Act, a 749-page bill with 24 separate \ntitles. Included in that unwieldy legislation was the Illegal \nImmigration and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, a far-reaching \nmeasure designed to curtail illegal immigration and prevent criminals \nfrom entering our country. This legislation, hurried to passage in the \nfinal days of a legislative session, has proven to be overly punitive \nin a number of cases, including that of Jesus Collado.\n  On April 7, Jesus Collado, a 43-year-old legal resident of the United \nStates, returned to this country after vacationing in the Dominican \nRepublic, his homeland. Upon arrival at John F. Kennedy airport in New \nYork, Mr. Collado was detained by INS officers who kept him handcuffed \nand made him sit on the floor of a room in the airport for nearly 24 \nhours. INS officials had determined Mr. Collado excludable because the \nIllegal Immigration and Immigrant Responsibility Act made the \nmisdemeanor on his criminal record a deportable offense. Twenty-three \nyears ago, when Mr. Collado was 19-years old, he was convicted of a \nclass A misdemeanor, having sexual relations with a minor, his 15-year-\nold girlfriend. I should note here that their relationship was a \nconsensual one. Mr. Collado was sentenced to a year's probation, which \nhe served. He has not been in trouble with the law since.\n  Whatever I or my colleagues think about his teenage indiscretion, the \nfact remains that he is not a serious criminal who should be excluded \nfrom entering the United States. Yet, as I mentioned, on April 7 last, \nMr. Collado was arrested upon arrival in New York and was held without \nbail for 201 days at the INS Detention Facility at the York County \nPrison in York, Pennsylvania.\n  The Illegal Immigration and Immigrant Responsibility Act was meant to \nkeep serious criminals out of the United States. It was not meant to \nexclude those who have resided here legally for a quarter century \nbecause of a misdemeanor committed as a teenager. Might I add that \nLamar Smith, the chairman of the House Immigration Subcommittee seems \nto agree with me. In Anthony Lewis' December 22, 1997 column in the New \nYork Times, Mr. Smith remarked that Jesus Collado's case ``obviously \ntugs at your heart. Clearly this is an instance where humanitarian \nconsiderations should be taken into account. I believe in redemption \nand I believe it should be granted generously.''\n  Ultimately, the Immigration and Naturalization Service must be given \ndiscretion in the implementation of this Act. But Mr. Collado and his \nfamily need relief now. Today I am introducing private relief \nlegislation for Mr. Collado to establish that his misdemeanor is not \ngrounds for inadmissibility, deportation or denial of citizenship. \nRepresentative Nydia Velazquez, who has worked tirelessly on Mr. \nCollado's behalf, has introduced a similar measure in the House of \nRepresentatives. I urge the Senate to act on this matter swiftly so \nthat the Collado family may get on with their lives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nAnthony Lewis' column be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was order to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1617\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. WAIVER OF CONSIDERATION OF CRIMINAL OFFENSE FOR \n                   IMMIGRATION PURPOSES FOR JESUS M. COLLADO-\n                   MUNOZ.\n\n       Notwithstanding sections 212(a) and 237(a) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act, Jesus M. Collado-Munoz shall \n     not be considered, by reason of the criminal offense to which \n     he pleaded guilty on October 24, 1974, to be inadmissible to, \n     or deportable from, the United States. The offense shall not \n     be used to find that Jesus M. Collado-Munoz lacks good moral \n     character for any purpose under that Act, including \n     eligibility for naturalization.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 22, 1997]\n\n                           A Generous Country\n\n                           (By Anthony Lewis)\n\n       Washington.--The immigration law passed by Congress in 1996 \n     has had harsh effects on some individuals: visitors barred at \n     our borders, aliens marked for deportation after living here \n     legally for many years. I discussed the issues with the \n     principal House sponsor of the law, Representative Lamar S. \n     Smith, Republican of Texas.\n       ``America should continue to be the most generous country \n     in the world toward immigrants,'' Mr. Smith said, ``I thing \n     they have much to contribute to this country.''\n       The 1996 act, he said, was designed to deal with people who \n     do not deserve to be here, such as those who enter illegally. \n     But it was not intended to deny anyone fair treatment.\n       ``There is not excuse for anybody being treated unjustly,'' \n     he said ``Justice is one of the things that makes this \n     country great, and rightly attracts people here, along with \n     economic opportunity and freedom.''\n       What about instances, I asked, where the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service has admitted that its officers \n     mistreated individuals at the border? The Commissioner of \n     Immigration, Doris Messner, has said that about several cases \n     described in this column in recent months.\n       ``It's not the fault of the law,'' Mr. Smith replied. \n     ``It's the fault of the I.N.S.\n       ``When you have hundreds of millions of entries every year, \n     and you have human nature involved, there are inevitably \n     going to be some lapses. That doesn't excuse them, I hope it \n     won't be interpreted as rationalizing any kind of \n     insensitivity. It is simply a comment on what is a fact of \n     life.''\n       One provision of the 1996 act, called ``expedited \n     removal,'' allows I.N.S. agents to keep out anyone they think \n     is trying to enter the country improperly, even if the person \n     has a U.S. visa, and bar him for five years. I asked whether \n     that, didn't encourage hasty, sometimes unfair decisions.\n       Mr. Smith said he had been to two border checkpoints in the \n     last several months and found the border patrol agents \n     ``enthusiastic'' about the provision. ``I think on the whole \n     it's reducing the abuses,'' he said, ``the gaming of the \n     system.''\n       The new law's process for dealing with applicants for \n     political asylum is also working well, he said. It requires \n     someone who claims to be fleeing persecution first to \n     persuade an asylum officer at the border that he or she has a \n     ``credible fear,'' then to have an asylum hearing before an \n     immigration judge.\n       ``The asylum officers are getting some good training,'' Mr. \n     Smith said. ``Almost 90 percent of people asking for asylum \n     are being found to have a credible fear. When you have that \n     high a level of initial acceptance of their claims, clearly \n     the officers are giving people the benefit of the doubt.''\n       Since it was human nature for the I.N.S. to make some \n     mistakes, I asked, why had the new statute in many areas \n     stripped away the right to judicial review of the agency's \n     decisions?\n       ``Judicial review,'' he said, ``encouraged many of the \n     people who are in this country illegally'' by allowing them \n     to contest their deportation endlessly. He said there were \n     about five million, with the number growing by 300,000 a \n     year.\n       The 1996 law also made legal immigrants deportable because \n     of minor crimes committed years ago, and removed their right \n     to\n\n[[Page S517]]\n\n     seek a waiver of deportation. A notable case is that of Jesus \n     Collado, a Brooklyn man who faces deportation because he \n     slept with a 15-year-old girlfriend 23 years ago and was put \n     on probation for contributing to the delinquency of a minor. \n     He has lived a blameless life since and has an American wife \n     and three children.\n       ``In the vast majority of cases I think the crimes do \n     justify deportation,'' Mr. Smith commented. ``However, \n     perhaps around the far edges the I.N.S. should have some \n     discretion in these cases.\n       ``First I'd like to be reassured that the Administration is \n     serious about deporting hardened criminals. It has a program \n     to deport those currently in prison when they finish their \n     sentences, but it is deporting less than 50 percent.''\n       The Collado case, he said, ``obviously tugs at your heart. \n     Clearly this is an instance where humanitarian considerations \n     should be taken into account. I believe in redemption, and I \n     believe it should be granted generously.\n       ``The question is how you do that without creating a giant \n     loophole through which thousands of others can escape \n     deportation.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Hollings, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Frist, \n        Mr. Reed, and Mr. Bryan):\n  S. 1618. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to improve \nthe protection of consumers against ``slamming'' by telecommunications \ncarriers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n                 the consumer anti-slamming act of 1998\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Consumer Anti-\nSlamming Act of 1998. This legislation is aimed at putting an end to an \nabusive and unscrupulous practice that affects thousands and thousands \nof consumers every year. Joining me as a co-sponsor of this legislation \nare Senator Fritz Hollings, the Ranking Member of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, and Senator Frist and Senator Snowe, also Members of the \nCommittee. I am most grateful for their support in this important \neffort.\n  ``Slamming'' is the unauthorized changing of a consumer's long-\ndistance carrier. A consumer who is slammed often receives lower-\nquality service or is charged higher rates. Sometimes consumers are not \neven aware that they have been slammed until they get their bills. When \nthey realize what has happened, they have to go through the aggravation \nof getting their service switched back to their original carrier and \nhaving their bills adjusted. And they often find it difficult to secure \ncompensation for any additional damages they may have incurred.\n  Mr. President, last year alone over 20,000 consumers filed slamming \ncomplaints with the FCC. This is by far the largest category of \ncomplaints the FCC received. When you stop to consider that only a \nsmall fraction of all consumers who are slammed actually file \ncomplaints about it with the Commission, the real dimensions of the \nproblem become apparent. And those dimensions are growing: last year's \n20,000 complaints represented a 25 percent increase in the number of \ncomplaints filed in 1996, despite the fact that the FCC adopted new \nrules to discourage slamming.\n  The reality we face is that unless Congress supplements by law what \nthe FCC can do by regulation, this already bad problem will only get \nworse. This legislation will attack slamming in two ways: it will \nestablish stringent anti-slamming safeguards to deter slamming from \nhappening in the first place, and it will enlarge the remedies \navailable to punish slammers and make consumers whole if it does. The \nbill does this by prescribing definitive procedures for telephone \ncompanies to follow, providing alternative ways for consumers to obtain \nredress for having been slammed, and giving federal and nonfederal \nauthorities the power to impose tough sanctions, including high fines \nand compensatory and punitive damages.\n  The bill takes a straightforward approach. It prohibits a telephone \ncompany from changing a consumer's telephone service unless the company \nobtains a verbal, written, or electronic verification from the \nsubscriber showing that the subscriber has consented to the change. The \ncompany making the change will be required to retain this verification. \nIf a consumer charges a company with slamming, the company has 120 days \nin which to satisfy the consumer's complaint. If it does not do so, the \ncompany must promptly advise the consumer of that fact, and give the \nconsumer a copy of the verification and information about how to pursue \nthe complaint with the FCC and about all other available remedies. If a \ncompany ignores a consumer's slamming complaint, it will be subject to \nthe penalty for slamming.\n\n  The bill then provides for simple, streamlined complaint resolution \nprocedures at the FCC, requiring the Commission to issue a decision on \nthe carrier's liability within 150 days. It broadens the Commission's \nenforcement powers by authorizing it to award both compensatory and \npunitive damages, and requires that damages be awarded within 90 days \nof the liability determination. It directs the FCC not to levy a fine \nof less than $40,000 against first-time offenders and $150,000 for \nrepeat offenders absent mitigating circumstances, and it empowers the \nFCC to prosecute slammers who refuse to pay their fines. The bill also \nenables consumers to go after slammers in court instead of at the FCC \nthrough a state class-action suit. These alternatives--consumer action \nat the FCC and state action in court, backed up by stiff monetary \npenalties--will provide both a sword against past slamming and a shield \nagainst future slamming.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the bill assures that the FCC will detect and \ndeter other problems that might result in slamming. It requires the \nCommission to report to Congress on telephone companies' telemarketing \npractices, to recommend whether it would be in the public interest to \nlevy penalties directly on telemarketers or on other entities not \ncurrently subject to the bill's provisions, and to promptly adopt rules \nproscribing any deliberately deceptive or misleading telemarketing \npractices disclosed by the report.\n  The bottom line here, Mr. President, is that slamming has to stop, \nonce and for all, and this bill means to stop it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1618\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Federal Communications Commission to \nstudy systems for filtering or blocking matter on the Internet, to \nrequire the installation of such a system on computers in schools and \nlibraries with Internet access, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                   the internet school filtering act\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The Internet \nSchool Filtering Act, which is designed to protect children from \nexposure to sexually explicit and other harmful material when they \naccess the Internet in school and in the library. I am pleased to be \njoined by Senators Hollings, Coats, and Murray as cosponsors of this \nlegislation, and I thank them for their assistance in this important \neffort.\n  This legislation comes to grips with a regrettable but unavoidable \nproblem. Today, pornography is widely available on the Internet. \nAccording to Wired\n\n[[Page S519]]\n\nmagazine, today there are approximately 28,000 adult Web sites \npromoting hard and soft-core pornography. Together, these sites \nregister many millions of ``hits'' by websurfers per day.\n  Mr. President, there is no question that some of the websurfers who \nare accessing these sites are children. Some, unfortunately, are \nactively searching for these sites. But many others literally and \nunintentionally stumble across them. Anyone who uses seemingly \ninnocuous terms while searching the World Wide Web for educational or \nharmless recreational purposes can inadvertently run into adult sites. \nFor example, when the word ``teen'' is typed into a search engine, a \nsite titled ``Teenagesex.com'' is the first search result to appear.\n  Mr. President, parents have a responsibility to monitor their \nchildren's Internet use. This is their proper role, and no amount of \ngovernmental assistance or industry self-regulation could ever be as \neffective in protecting children as parental supervision.\n  Parental supervision, however, is not possible when children use the \nInternet while they are away from home, in schools and libraries. The \nbillions of dollars per year the Federal government will be giving \nschools and libraries to enable them to bring advanced Internet \nlearning technology to the classroom will bring in the Internet's \nexplicit online content as well. These billions of dollars will \nultimately be paid for by the American people. So it is only right that \nif schools and libraries accept these federally-provided subsidies for \nInternet access, they have an absolute responsibility to their \ncommunities to assure that children are protected from online content \nthat can harm them.\n  And this harm can be prevented. The prevention lies, not in censoring \nwhat goes onto the Internet, but rather in filtering what comes out of \nit onto the computers our children use outside the home.\n  Mr. President, Internet filtering systems work, and they need not be \nblunt instruments that unduly constrain the availability of \nlegitimately instructional material. Today they are adaptable, capable \nof being fine-tuned to accommodate changes in websites as well as the \nevolving needs of individual schools and even individual lesson-plans. \nBest of all, their use will channel explicit material away from \nchildren while they are not under parental supervision, while not in \nany way inhibiting the rights of adults who may wish to post indecent \nmaterial on the Web or have access to it outside school environs.\n  Mr. President, it boils down to this: The same Internet that can \nbenefit our children is also capable of inflicting terrible damage on \nthem. For this reason, school and library administrators who accept \nuniveral service support to provide students with its intended benefits \nmust also safeguard them against its unintended harm. I commend the \nefforts of those who have recognized this responsibility by providing \nfiltering systems in the many educational facilities that already have \nInternet capability. This legislation assures that this responsibility \nis extended to all other institutions as they implement advanced \ntechnologies funded by federally-mandated universal service funds.\n  Mr. President, this bill takes a sensible approach. It requires \nschools receiving universal service discounts to use a filtering system \non their computers so that objectionable online materials will not be \naccessible to students. Libraries are required to use a filtering \nsystem on one or more of their computers so that at least one computer \nwill be appropriate for minors' use. Filtering technology is itself \neligible to be subsidized by the E-rate discount. Once a school or \nlibrary certifies that it will use a filtering system, they will be \neligible to receive universal service fund subsidies for Internet \naccess. If schools and libraries do not so certify, they will not be \neligible to receive universal service fund-subsidized discounts.\n  Some have argued that the use of filtering technology in public \nschools and libraries would amount to censorship under the First \nAmendment. The Supreme Court has found, however, that obscenity is not \nprotected by the First Amendment. And insofar as other sexually-\nexplicit material is concerned, the bill will not affect an adult's \nability to access this information on the Internet outside the school \nenvironment, and it will in no way impose any filtering requirement on \nInternet use in the home. Perhaps most important, the bill prohibits \nthe federal government from prescribing any particular filtering \nsystem, or from imposing a different filtering system than the one \nselected by the certifying educational authority. It thus places the \nprerogative for determining which filtering system best reflects the \ncommunity's standards precisely where it should be: on the community \nitself.\n  Mr. President, more and more people are using the Internet each day. \nCurrently, there may be as many as 50 million Americans online, and \nthat number is expected to at least double by the millennium. As \nInternet use in our schools and libraries continues to grow, children's \npotential exposure to harmful online content will only increase. This \nbill simply assures that universal service subsidies will be used to \ndefend them from the very dangers that these same subsidies are \notherwise going to increase. This is a rational response to what could \notherwise be a terrible and unintended problem.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nappear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1619\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Thomas, and Mr. Lugar) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 174\n\n       Whereas, the United States maintains a close bilateral \n     partnership with Thailand and has a profound interest in \n     furthering that relationship;\n       Whereas, the friendship between our two countries goes back \n     farther than that with any other Asian nation dating back to \n     the Treaty of Amity and Commerce and Navigation of 1833;\n       Whereas, the bilateral trade relationship is robust and \n     promises to grow even more so in time;\n       Whereas, the U.S. security relationship with Thailand is \n     one of our most critical, and it is in both countries' \n     interest to maintain and strengthen that relationship;\n       Whereas, the new government in Thailand has committed \n     itself to making significant structural reforms to its \n     economy in line with the conditions placed upon it by the \n     International Monetary Fund, including improving financial \n     and economic transparency and cutting its budget;\n       Whereas, the conditions imposed on Thailand by the IMF were \n     developed in August of 1997 when the economic environment in \n     Asia was vastly different from that existing today;\n       Whereas, an example of those changed circumstances is the \n     fact that both Korea and Indonesia provided second line of \n     defense contingency loans to Thailand in August, 1997, \n     amounting to US$500 million each;\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that:\n       (1) The United States should be prepared to take \n     appropriate steps to help ensure that Thailand's economic \n     recovery efforts will continue uninterrupted and to enhance \n     the close political, economic and security relations between \n     Thailand and the United States; and\n       (2) Thailand deserves praise and commendation from the \n     United States for the measures it has implemented to resolve \n     its financial problems.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself, Mr. \nBaucus, Mr. Thomas, and Mr. Lugar, to submit a Resolution to state the \nsense of the Senate that Thailand remains one of America's most \nimportant partners and closest friends, and that Bangkok has been \nmaking important strides in executing its responsibilities under its \narrangements with the International Monetary Fund.\n  Mr. President, America's friendship with Thailand is our longest-\nstanding in Asia. Our first Envoy to Thailand negotiated a Treaty of \nAmity and Commerce with that country in 1833.\n  Thailand was the first country afflicted with the so-called Asian \ncontagion, and the first to receive IMF assistance. However, at the \ntime the IMF put the package together for Thailand in August, 1977, \nAsia's regional economy looked far different than it does today. Let me \ngive one compelling example of how things have changed: Last year, both \nKorea and Indonesia were economically secure enough to pledge so-called \n``second line of defense'' contingency loans to Thailand.\n  The point is, Mr. President, many of the assumptions that the IMF \nused in formulating the conditions for Thailand's package are no longer \napplicable.\n  Despite the changes, however, the new Government of Thailand has been \nmaking important progress in fulfilling its IMF obligations. Already \nThailand has taken steps to improve financial and economic transparency \nand cut its budget.\n  I recently visited Thailand and was very impressed by the new \nleadership in Bangkok, by the steps they have taken thus far and by \ntheir resolve in fulfilling their IMF obligations.\n  Mr. President, I believe I am safe in saying that all of us in this \nchamber--and Americans all across this land--are great admirers of \nThailand and Thai culture. I remain optimistic about Thailand's future. \nGiven the Thai people's energy and initiative, the country's remarkable \nhistory, and its record of economic success, I hope and expect to see \nThailand's return to prosperity in the not-too-distant future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/09/senate-section/article/S521-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 175--TO DESIGNATE ``NATIONAL CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS \n                          AND EMPLOYEES WEEK''\n\n  Mr. ROBB submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep sympathy \nto the families of those killed in Italy by a low flying plane. Like \nall Americans, I was shocked, saddened, and angered that an American \nplane caused this tragedy.\n  We do not have all the details at this time and are having to rely on \nmedia reports, but I want to be very clear. This tragedy never should \nhave happened. This was a disgraceful act, military training should not \nbe done in civilian areas.\n  I wish that I could say that this was an isolated incident. \nUnfortunately, I cannot. Accidents during training missions occur with \ndisturbing frequency.\n  Last September, the Secretary of Defense was forced to suspend all \ntraining flights after a rash of six crashes within one week.\n  Also in September, a F-117 crashed in Maryland, injuring 4 civilians \nand burning a portion of a home.\n  In 1996, a U-2 spy plane crashed in the parking lot of the Mercury-\nRegister newspaper, killing one and injury two others.\n  In October, a military jet crashed in Pennsylvania. The pilot managed \nto eject safely, but the plane exploded near a busy interstate highway.\n  It may be impossible to make training missions 100% safe for the \npilots, but we have an obligation to make sure they are safe for \ncivilians.\n  In the tragedy in Aviano, Italy, the pilot was flying an approved \nflight path though not at an approved altitude. This flight path led \nthe plane, at a very low altitude, directly over a functioning ski \nlift. While I have trouble believing news reports that pilots entertain \nthemselves by flying under the ski lift cables, that plane never should \nhave been in the proximity of the ski lift. The potential for tragedy \nwas simply too great. Unfortunately, it took the deaths of 20 people to \nprove it.\n  Clearly, responsibility for this tragedy lies not only with the \npilot, but also with the commanders who authorized these dangerous \nflights. There is a certain degree of risk involved in all training \nmissions. That risk should not fall upon innocent civilians. How many \nmore incidents such as the one in Aviano have to occur before it \nbecomes clear that the potential for tragedy in these missions is too \ngreat?\n  I would like to see the following actions taken:\n  1. A change in the guidelines over where planes can fly training \nmissions.\n  2. An immediate report to the American people of the facts of the \naccident at Aviano. It has been almost a week and we still have no \ninformation from the military.\n  3. If the investigation shows that the pilot was at fault, the pilot \nshould be subject to Italian law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/09/senate-section/article/S522-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S522-S523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ``BEWILDERING BUDGET-SPEAK'' ON SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, millions of Americans, myself \nincluded, listened intently to what President Clinton had to say about \nSocial Security in his State of the Union address. What we heard--or \nwhat we thought we heard--was a plan by the President to reserve any \nbudget surplus that might emerge in the next few years to shore up \nSocial Security for future generations.\n  It was a plan that drew widespread praise from the public. But now it \nturns out that what we heard is not, according to White House \nspokesmen, what the President really meant. The Washington Post put it \nthis way in a February 4 report: ``the ringing simplicity of Clinton's \ncall to `save Social Security first' gave way to a fog of bewildering \nbudget-speak from the administration's top economic advisers.''\n  Here is what OMB spokesman Larry Haas had to say: ``People who think \nit [President Clinton's proposal] shores up Social Security were not \nlistening closely.'' Testifying before the Senate Budget Committee, \nTreasury Secretary Robert Rubin admitted that the Clinton budget does \nnot include any mechanism that would transfer surpluses to the Social \nSecurity trust fund.\n  Mr. President, why the intricate game of words? Is Social Security \nfirst or not? Let us take a look.\n  Next year--the year covered by President Clinton's proposed budget--\nSocial Security itself will run an estimated surplus of about $93 \nbillion. Remember, the system is currently generating surpluses that \nare intended to build up until about the year 2016, when we will have \nto begin using them to pay retirement benefits to 75 million baby \nboomers.\n  But the Clinton budget does not set aside this $93 billion Social \nSecurity surplus. The Clinton budget spends every penny of it on \ngeneral operating expenses of the federal government.\n  The practice of using the Social Security nest egg to mask overall \ngovernment deficits dates back to President Lyndon Johnson. Colleagues \nfrom both sides of the aisle have condemned it for years. It is only \nbecause President Clinton employs this sleight of hand--counting the \nSocial Security surplus in the unified federal budget--that he is able \nto show an overall surplus of $9 billion for next year. If Social \nSecurity's $93 billion surplus and the surpluses held in other federal \ntrust funds were removed from the calculations, the Clinton budget \nwould actually show a deficit of $95.7 billion.\n  Even the relatively small surplus that is created by commingling all \nof the funds--that is, after mixing Social Security with the rest of \nthe federal budget--is shrunken considerably from what it would have \nbeen if the President reserved the entire amount for Social Security, \nas he said he would. That is because he devotes the bulk of the \nresulting surplus to a host of new spending initiatives.\n  Here are just some of the new programs that President Clinton is \nproposing:\n  a new clean water initiative for about $37 million;\n  two new farm programs for $14 million;\n  $170 million for new mandatory empowerment zones and enterprise \ncommunities;\n  a new program called the Community Empowerment Fund, which will cost \nabout $400 million;\n  a new $10 million Indian land consolidation pilot program;\n  $47 million on a new community adjustment program to help areas \nadversely affected by trade agreements;\n  at least eight new education programs totaling over $1.8 billion;\n  a new Medicare buy-in program costing $1.5 billion over five years;\n  $4.5 billion for five new child-care related programs;\n  a new smoking cessation program for $87 million; and\n  two new law-enforcement initiatives for $200 million.\n  The cost of these new programs is estimated to be about $120 billion \nto $130 billion over the next five years, and that does not even count \nthe myriad increases he proposes for other existing federal programs. \nIn other words, some $120 billion to $130 billion of anticipated \nunified budget surpluses are not reserved for Social Security at all, \nbut are used to create brand new programs.\n  Granted, many of these proposals are appealing, and some address real \nneeds in our communities. Granted, some of the spending for these new \nprograms is designed to come from the proposed tobacco settlement. But \nif President Clinton is sincere in his desire to reserve 100 percent of \nthe surplus for Social Security, how is it that there is so much money \nfor so many new programs? Why is the tobacco money not used to boost \nthe size of the surplus that could be devoted to Social Security?\n  Given the programs I just mentioned a few moments ago, it is obvious \nthat Social Security is not really first on President Clinton's list of \nanticipated uses of any unified budget surplus. It is not second or \neven third. It does not make the top 10 list. It is number 26 on\n\n[[Page S523]]\n\nthe President's list, after all of these other new programs are \ncreated. Remember, too, that President Clinton is proposing to spend \nthe entire $93 billion surplus that the Social Security system will \nitself generate--spend it on other things.\n  So what did President Clinton really mean when he spoke of Social \nSecurity in his State of the Union? Here is what he said:\n\n       I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus--that \n     is every penny of any surplus--until we have taken all the \n     necessary measures to strengthen the Social Security system \n     for the 21st century.\n\n  His budget clearly spends the surplus, so what hidden meaning could \nthere possibly be in his apparently very carefully crafted words?\n  Treasury Secretary Rubin explained to the Budget Committee that the \nPresident was merely declaring his opposition to using surpluses, \nshould they materialize, for any purpose other than paying down the \nnational debt until Congress and the President have agreed on a long-\nterm solution that ensures the solvency of the Social Security program. \nIn other words, nothing may ever be set aside specifically for Social \nSecurity.\n  Mr. President, I am confused, as I think most Americans are, about \nPresident Clinton's intentions with respect to Social Security. John \nRother, chief lobbyist for the American Association of Retired Persons, \ntold The Washington Post that many of his members are also confused and \nmistakenly assume the surpluses will be used to pay future Social \nSecurity benefits.\n  Crafting next year's budget, let alone tackling the coming problems \nin the Social Security system and the many other important problems \nfacing this administration and the country, requires straight talk and \nstraight answers. Either Social Security is first or it is not. Either \nwe reserve any surplus for Social Security or we do not. Tell the \ntruth, and the American people will support what needs to be done.\n  Senior citizens deserve better than to be treated as a political \nfootball by this President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/09/senate-section/article/S522-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FOOD CHECK OUT DAY\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today we celebrate ``Food Check Out \nDay'' and commemorate the day when the average American will have \nearned enough income to pay for the entire year's food supply. We \ncelebrate the bounty from America's farms and ranches and how it is \nshared with American consumers through affordable food prices.\n  According to the United States Department of Agriculture, on average, \nAmerican consumers spend only 10.9 percent of their disposable income \nfor food. When applied to the calendar days, that means that the \naverage American will have earned enough income to pay for his or her \nfamily's annual food supply in just 40 days. We commemorate this fact \non February 9th, which is the 40th day of this year.\n  Compared to other expenses facing America's families, food is a \nbargain. While Americans must only work until February 9th to pay for \ntheir yearly food supply, last year they had to work until May 9th just \nto pay for their taxes. In addition, the percentage of disposable \npersonal income spent for food has declined over the last 25 years. In \n1997, Food Check Out Day would have been on February 10. In 1970, Food \nCheck-Out Day would have been 11 days later than it is today--February \n20.\n  This is made more notable by the fact that trends indicate Americans \nare buying more expensive convenience food items for preparation at \nhome, as well as more food away from home.\n  The Agriculture Department's latest statistic, compiled for 1996, \nincludes food and non-alcoholic beverages consumed at home and away \nfrom home. This includes food purchases from grocery stores and other \nretail outlets, including food purchases with food stamps and vouchers \nfor the Women, Infants and Children's program. The statistic also \nincludes away-from-home meals and snacks purchased by families and \nindividuals, as well as food furnished to employees.\n  Mr. President, many states will mark today with an event to raise \nfood donations for their local Ronald McDonald House. The Ronald \nMcDonald House provides a ``home-away-from-home'' for the families of \nseriously ill children receiving medical treatment in their local \nareas. The food donated from these Food Check Out Day programs will be \nused to help feed visiting families staying at the House.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is that food in America is \naffordable, in large part because of America's productive farmers and \nranchers. Food Check-Out Day allows us to recognize their hard work, \nthe benefits of which we all enjoy. As a fellow rancher, I personally \nwant to salute these Americans and thank them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/09/senate-section/article/S523-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             70TH BIRTHDAY OF PRESIDENT EDUARD SHEVARDNADZE\n\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I call the Senate's attention to \nan individual who has dedicated his life to liberating his people and \nrestoring his nation. Eduard Shevardnadze's career of government \nservice is marked most significantly by his personal journey from being \na member of the Soviet hierarchy to being the prominent democratic \nleader he is today. I am proud to have met him on several occasions and \ndraw the Senate's attention to this extraordinary man's accomplishments \nin celebration of his seventieth birthday which was January 25, 1998.\n  Eduard Shevardnadze's career began with a steady rise through the \nCommunist Party. As the Minister of Foreign Affairs, his ability as a \ndiplomat brought the United States and Soviet Union into a better \nunderstanding of one another. He was a significant force in ending the \nCold War peacefully and ushering in an historic era of improved world-\nwide relations. In 1991, however, Eduard Shevardnadze was at odds with \nthe dictatorial policies of the Communist Party. His strong principles \nultimately drove him to forego the trappings of the elite political \nclass and he resigned his position.\n  Upon his resignation, Eduard Shevardnadze returned to Georgia. In the \naftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, his homeland was \ndestabilized and struggling economically. Eduard Shevardnadze began \nassisting in the revitalization of Georgia, and in November, 1995, he \nwas elected president. His policies have focused on restoring \nterritorial integrity, as well as promoting economic and political \nindependence. Since his election, President Shevardnadze's notable \nachievements include adopting and implementing a new constitution, \nintroducing a new currency, cracking down on organized crime, and \nnegotiating important treaties with neighboring countries to secure \nGeorgia's future.\n  President Eduard Shevardnadze's personal journey from communist to \ndemocratic leader is a compelling example of the triumph of the human \nspirit. His high standing among Western leaders has been earned through \nhis principled democratic leadership and perseverance in the face of \nadversity. I would like to express my warm regards to President \nShevardnadze in wishing him a prosperous seventieth year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/09/senate-section/article/S523-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S523-S524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      PROHIBITING THE DESECRATION OF THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for S.J. Res. 40, a resolution to propose a Constitutional \namendment to prohibit the desecration of the flag of the United States. \nI am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this resolution.\n  The people of Idaho have told me, quite clearly, that they feel we \nmust take steps to protect the Stars and Stripes. By way of a \nresolution passed by the Idaho State Legislature approximately three \nyears ago, my constituents let it be known that Idahoans want the \nopportunity to ratify an amendment to the Constitution which would \nprohibit the desecration of the flag. The resolution stated, ``. . .the \nAmerican Flag to this day is a most honorable and worthy banner of a \nnation which is thankful for its strengths and committed to curing its \nfaults, and a nation which remains the destination of millions of \nimmigrants attracted by the universal power of the American ideal. . \n.''.\n  Perhaps nowhere is the desire to protect the American ideal exhibited \nbetter than in the men and women who serve this nation in our armed \nforces. As a member of the Armed Services committee, I have had the \nopportunity to visit with many of these outstanding Americans who serve \nour nation\n\n[[Page S524]]\n\nboth on our own soil and in foreign lands around the globe. These men \nand women stand ready, at a moments notice, to put their lives on the \nline so that U.S. citizens here and abroad may live in peace and \nsafety. They are prepared to protect, at any cost, the rights and \nfreedoms which we all hold so dear, and for which so many have \nsacrificed so much during the more than 220 years of our nation's \nhistory. As they serve, even on foreign ground, they serve under Old \nGlory, the symbol of all that we value and cherish about the United \nStates of America. The flag serves as a constant reminder of the land \nthey call home, of their family and friends, and of all the values that \nmake the United States of America the beacon of liberty and justice \nthroughout the world.\n  In trying to define what the flag of the United States means, I was \nparticularly moved by the words of Henry Ward Beecher. In his essay, \n``The Meaning of Our Flag,'' he wrote, ``Our Flag carries American \nideas, American history and American feelings. Beginning with the \nColonies, and coming down to our time, in its sacred heraldry, in its \nglorious insignia, it has gathered and stored chiefly this supreme \nidea: divine right of liberty in man. . . .That it meant, that it \nmeans, and, by the blessing of God, that it shall mean to the end of \ntime!''\n  Mr. President, by supporting S.J.Res. 40, we honor the meaning of the \nflag. By acknowledging that the flag of the United States is more than \njust a piece of cloth, more than just a physical entity devoid of \nvalue, we indicate our understanding of those things for which it \nstands. I hope my colleagues will join me, and the resolution's \nsponsors and cosponsors, in taking the first step toward protecting the \nflag and everything it represents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/09/senate-section/article/S523-3", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S524-S530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REDUCTION OF THE DEFICIT\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, during the President's State of the Union \nspeech, as well as in the submission of the budget, there have been a \nlot of accolades about a balanced budget. Many of us have worked for a \nlong, long time to see a balanced budget. It has been kind of \ninteresting, with different people taking credit for it. The President \nsaid he has done it since has been in office, that the deficit has come \ndown every year. The Republicans have said after they took control in \nthe '94 elections, that is when we really saw the deficits reduce.\n  I would like to put some facts into the Record, dealing both with the \nPresident's budget and also the source of the decline of the deficit \nsince January of 1995. In the budget deficit of 1995, submitted by \nPresident Clinton, in January of 1995, it showed that the deficit was \nestimated to be $176 billion in 1995; in 1996, it was supposed to be, \nor estimated to be $207 billion; in 1997, $224 billion; $222 billion in \n'98; $253 billion in '99; $284 billion in 2000; $297 billion in 2001; \n$322 billion in the year 2002. This is President Clinton's budget. That \nwas what he submitted to Congress in January of 1995.\n  Now, you had something happen in November of '94, which is that the \nRepublicans were elected to take control of Congress. That was the \nchange. This already takes into account the President's large tax \nincrease of 1993. So that is already computed in here. In spite of his \nlarge tax increase, deficits continued to increase, from $176 billion \nin '95 to an estimated $322 billion in the year 2002.\n  I make a point of that because I have heard several administrative \nofficials testifying, ``Yes, we brought the deficit down and did it \nbecause of that historic tax increase of 1993.'' I just beg to differ. \nThe facts were that the policies showed that the deficit was going to \ncontinue to climb significantly. What happened since 1995? That is what \nthis chart will show. We have had some tax cuts. The tax cut that was \npassed--actually, there was one passed in '95, but the President vetoed \nit. So there is no change in '95 and '96, as far as the Tax Code. \nCongress did pass, and the President signed, a tax reduction effort \nlast year. This chart will show the net effect of that. Frankly, it is \nnot very large. In between the years 1997 and 2002, it is a net tax cut \nof $75 billion. So that didn't have a lot of difference on what \nhappened in the economy.\n  Spending cuts over that same period of time, between the year 1995 \nand 2002, was $276 billion. So that didn't have a lot. The primary \ndifference was re-estimates--re-estimates. I am using CBO data, \nCongressional Budget Office data. The difference of technical and \neconomic assumptions is $1.567 trillion over those same years. And so, \nyes, the economy has done better, and the estimates were off. The \ngrowth rates have been higher, revenues have been higher. That is the \nprincipal source of deficit reduction. Again, I am not even trying to \noffer a lot of my own opinion. I am just trying to show that here is \nthe deficit projection given by CBO in January of 1995. Here is the CBO \ndeficit baseline in January of 1998, 3 years apart, but a total of a \ncouple of trillion dollars difference in their net results.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, I would like to talk about the President's budget \nthat he submitted to Congress. He made the statement that he did not \nwant one dime to be spent that would increase the national debt--not \none dime. Under the President's proposal, he has $124 billion, actually \n$124.1 billion, between the year 1998 and the year 2003, that 5-year \nperiod of time, that would increase the debt by new spending. And $70.9 \nbillion of that is discretionary spending--including mandatory, a total \nof $124 billion of new spending, spending over and above what we have \nin present law, spending over and above what is now contemplated, \nspending over and above what was agreed upon last year.\n  I might mention, as far as the discretionary spending, last year we \nentered into an agreement that said here is how much we are going to \nspend in discretionary spending every year. The President is violating \nthat agreement by his submission of the budget.\n  Now, the budget was balanced, but yet in the budget that we agreed \nupon last year, one of the reasons it is balanced is because basically \nwe froze, or came close to freezing discretionary spending. He is \ncalling for increases in discretionary spending above what was agreed \nupon last year. He calls for $124 billion in new spending. He also has \ntax cuts that really also would have an increasing impact on the \ndeficit of $24.2 billion.\n  If you add the two together, the President's proposal that he made in \nhis budget and in the State of the Union, if you took the new spending \nand the tax cuts, which are really, in my opinion, using the Tax Code \nto spend money, it would have a negative impact on the deficit of \n$148.3 billion over this period of time.\n  I am going to submit this for the record. It will show you exactly \nwhere it goes, the discretionary, mandatory--where in the mandatory \nspending, where in the tax cuts, the amount of those tax cuts the \nPresident has proposed. He has proposed this amount of new spending and \ntax cuts which have a negative impact on the deficit of $148 billion.\n  In other words, if we do not do anything, the deficit picture will be \n$148 billion better than it would be if we enacted the President's \nspending and tax proposal.\n  Now, to pay for it, he does provide for $115.8 billion of new taxes--\ntobacco tax increases, other tax increases, and user fees. If you add \nall that together, it is $115.8 billion. He has proposed spending cuts \nin the mandatory items of $34 billion, and so that's how he is paying \nfor his new spending and for his tax cuts.\n  So I just make mention of that, Mr. President. The President's \nproposal violates the budget proposal because it increases \ndiscretionary spending more than we agreed upon last year, and that's \nwhere we are getting a lot of savings. Then he says basically what he \nwants to do is to spend $124 billion more over this period of time than \nwhat we agreed upon last year. He wants to give some tax cuts of $24 \nbillion, targeted social spending through the Tax Code, and some of \nthat is for school construction, some of it is for child care tax \ncredits, for environmental purposes, and so on. But anyway, he wants to \nuse the Tax Code to spend money, and so he has $148 billion. What does \nhe do? He says, well, let's increase taxes $115.8 billion and let's \nmake some changes in some of the entitlement programs, spectrum fees \nand so on, and we will raise the money to do it. So he wants to spend \nand tax $150 billion more than we agreed to last year--$150 billion \nover 5 years. That is what it boils down to.\n  In other words, you can do nothing and you will have basically the \nsame\n\n[[Page S525]]\n\ndeficit picture under the President's budget as if you adopted it. If \nyou adopt the President's budget, you would spend a lot more and you \nwould tax a lot more, period. If you just look at the figures, here is \nthe budget level under existing law, or if we adopt the President's, we \nare going to spend about $148 billion, $150 billion more in \ndiscretionary and mandatory spending and we are going to tax that much.\n  That is really what it boils down to.
