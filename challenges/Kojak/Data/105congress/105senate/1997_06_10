Mr. President, those who are watching the activities of \nthe Congress now understand that the Congress, after some delay, passed \na disaster bill to provide disaster relief to victims, especially the \nvictims of the blizzards and the floods in South Dakota, North Dakota, \nand Minnesota, but to provide disaster relief on a much broader scale \nto those who have been victims of disaster in many States around the \ncountry.\n  The Congress did something different this time on disaster relief. In \nthis circumstance, on this disaster relief bill, which is called a \nsupplemental appropriations bill, the Congress decided to attach some \nvery controversial provisions that don't have any relationship to the \nbill, that are totally extraneous, unrelated to the disaster bill. They \nattached these provisions that weeks ago the President said he would \nnot accept.\n  The result was the disaster bill became a political vehicle asking \nflood victims and disaster victims to wait: ``Hold on over there, we're \ngoing to have a political exercise on the disaster bill.'' And, in \nfact, this weekend, following the passage of the disaster bill by the \nCongress last Thursday night, instead of sending the disaster bill to \nthe President then, this weekend it was held over in the House of\n\n[[Page S5432]]\n\nRepresentatives, and then the Republican National Committee went on \npaid radio ads in North Dakota, for example, to make a political issue \nof this so that the bill could be sent down to the President on Monday, \nso that they would hope the President would pay a political price for \nvetoing the bill.\n  I don't care about one or the other. I don't care about this side, \nthat side, your side or my side. What I care about are disaster \nvictims, and disaster bills ought not be the product of political \ngames. In any event, I ask those who would construct a political \nstrategy on the disaster bill, how on Earth could you construct a \nstrategy by which everybody loses? What kind of a political game is \nthat, a game in which you have constructed an approach so that everyone \nloses, most especially, the losers are the victims of a disaster? \nThousands of them this morning who woke up not in their own homes, \nbecause their homes are destroyed, but woke up in neighbors' homes, in \na neighboring city, relatives' homes, a shelter, a tent, a camper \ntrailer. That is where they are living. They are the first victims of a \nstrategy that plays politics with disaster relief, but there are \nothers.\n  The other losers are all the folks in the political system. There are \nno winners here, only losers, and the biggest losers are those who can \nleast afford it: victims of this disaster.\n  I intend, in just a moment, to ask unanimous consent to call up a \nbill that I introduced in the Senate yesterday. It is identical to the \nbill that Congress passed providing disaster relief, except for two \nthings. It takes out the two major controversial provisions to which \nthe President objects. I say, by doing this, let's pass a clean \ndisaster bill, pass it now, get it to the President, get it signed and \nget disaster relief to the victims who so desperately need it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say to my colleague, I can, as said \nby the President, feel your pain here, because in 1993, my \ncongressional district was inundated in a Midwestern flood.\n  There are many natural disasters which can befall America and a \nfamily. One of the most insidious is a flood. It just never goes away. \nSome disasters strike quickly, with a tornado or an earthquake or fire, \nand by the next day, people are starting to reassemble their lives and \nclean up the mess and put it behind them. A flood lingers, and as it \nlingers, I have watched family after family in my district reach a \nlevel of depression, then desperation. About the only thing that \nsustains them is not only all of the good neighbors and volunteers who \ncome to their assistance, but the belief that this Nation stands behind \nthem; that, as a family, America says, ``We will come to your aid, too. \nWe will assist you.''\n  It is interesting to me that during the course of our history, time \nand time again, without exception, we have said we are going to waive \nthe rules, we are going to drop the politics, we are just going to \nfocus on helping people. We aren't going to ask them whether they are \nrich or poor, Democrat or Republican, Independent; it doesn't make any \ndifference. They are Americans, they are neighbors, they are in need.\n  Let us get on with the business of being a nation of people who care \nabout those in need. Why then are we going through this exercise? Why \nhaven't we passed the disaster bill to help the victims of the flood in \nNorth Dakota and South Dakota and Minnesota, and other places? \nUnfortunately, it is because some of the leaders here believe that this \nis the kind of bill that puts pressure on the President. Send him a \nbill that he has to sign, like a disaster bill, and then like a \nChristmas tree, put on these ornaments, little things totally unrelated \nto disasters. ``Let's send this to him and, boy, we'll force his hand. \nNo President is going to veto a disaster bill with homeless people. We \nwill force him. We will put a provision in there that says we are going \nto violate the budget agreement, we are going to set up a new standard \nhere for funding agencies.''\n\n  What does that have to do with disaster assistance? If you were out \nof your home, if you had seen all of your Earthly belongings inundated \nwith a flood, if you and your kids were huddled in some shelter, would \nyou really want the Congress of the United States of America to get \ninvolved in this kind of political gamesmanship?\n  Even worse, there is a provision in this bill that relates to the \ntaking of the census. Boy, there's a real timely emergency; we better \nget on this one. Shoot, take a look, it is only 36 months from now that \nwe are going to have to deal with it; 36 months away we are supposed to \ntake the census. The Republican leadership said, ``Let's put a \nprovision in this bill that will force the hand of the Federal \nGovernment when it comes to taking the census.''\n  This is sad. This is really sad for so many people who have been \nvictimized by this flood to now be victimized by politics on Capitol \nHill. And it is outrageous. Senator Dorgan is correct, let us not \nviolate the standard which we have established which says when there is \na disaster and a need in America, we will rally behind the victims, our \nneighbors, our fellow Americans regardless of party label, regardless \nof agenda.\n  We are losing it in this debate because the Republican leadership \ninsists on amendments to this bill which have nothing to do--nothing to \ndo--with disaster victims.\n  I salute my colleague for his efforts. I tell you, I have been there, \nand I know what it means to go home weekend after weekend and see these \nfamilies struggling, looking at homes that have been inundated with \nfloodwater and mud, everything in their life washed away--the wedding \npictures, everything, it's gone--and then to have to tell them, ``I'm \nsorry, another week has gone by and Congress has not met its \nresponsibility.''\n  I salute my colleagues. Let us hope that just for one brief shining \nmoment that this body will rise above politics and support your effort \nto bring a clean disaster bill to the table, pass it today, pass it in \nthe House, move it on to the President and get it signed this evening. \nWe can then say to the people huddled in those shelters worried about \ntheir future and what they have been through that we have met our \nresponsibility. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me make two additional points----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 2 minutes, \n15 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me make two additional points before I propound the \nunanimous-consent request. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me read an editorial from this \nmorning's Fargo Forum, North Dakota's largest newspaper in the Red \nRiver Valley. It is, in most cases, a conservative voice. Here is what \nthey say about what is going on, how they observe what is going on in \nCongress:\n\n       The result [of all of this] is to aggravate the tragedy of \n     the flood by extending uncertainty about relief. Last week, \n     community leaders from Grand Forks and East Grand Forks, \n     Minnesota--many of them longtime, loyal Republicans--urged \n     Congress to quit fooling around with the lives of flood \n     victims. Clean up the disaster bill, they said, so the \n     president can sign it.\n       Their words were ignored. Instead, Republican congressional \n     leaders and the two governors tried to shift the blame for \n     delays on the president. In a callous display of partisan \n     arrogance, they said his veto would be the delay, not the \n     amendments.\n       It won't fly here in the Red River Valley--\n\n  The Fargo Forum says--\n\n     where people are trying to put their homes, businesses and \n     lives back together.\n       The president made it clear weeks ago: Unless the disaster \n     aid bill was clean, he would veto it. Nevertheless, \n     Republican leaders fouled up the legislation with unrelated \n     riders, knowing the president's veto was certain. So instead \n     of considering the crucial needs of valley flood victims, \n     they opted for a purely partisan agenda. The onus is on them.\n       Apologists for the GOP leadership insists adding unrelated \n     matters to popular bills is routine. Maybe so.\n       But the flood of this century in the valley is not routine. \n     A disaster of such magnitude is not routine. The pain and \n     destruction are not routine. The short construction season \n     for rebuilding is not routine. Surely, the least flood \n     victims can expect is for Congress to put aside its routine \n     nonsense when circumstances are this extraordinary.\n\n  This from the Fargo Forum, not a liberal newspaper, normally speaking \nfor conservatives.\n  Finally, this point. There are those here who say it doesn't matter \nthat we\n\n[[Page S5433]]\n\nhave messed around with this bill because there is money in the \npipeline; no one is being disadvantaged. I heard them spin that yarn \nfor weeks.\n  We kid people in our part of the country about whoppers. You know the \nwhoppers: Yes, I won this belt buckle in a rodeo riding bulls; my \npickup truck's paid for. Now I heard this other whopper: There's money \nin the pipeline. Tell that to the folks in Grand Forks.\n  There is a woman living in a tent right now in Grand Forks with her \nfamily. There was a woman in the newspaper yesterday, she and her \nfamily are out of work and have been out of their home for 5 weeks \nliving in a camper trailer, and they don't know when they are going to \nget back to their home and she doesn't know when she will have another \njob. Tell it to them, that there is money in the pipeline.\n  Better yet, get on a plane and go out there and try to live on that \nmoney in the pipeline. The money doesn't exist except in this bill, and \nthe bill must get passed and must be a clean bill so this aid goes to \ndisaster victims, and it ought to be done now. It can be done simply. I \nintroduced a bill yesterday, and I will call it up now by unanimous \nconsent, and if there is objection, it means the Congress will not \nallow a clean disaster bill to pass. If not now, when?\n  Let me call up a clean disaster bill where we take out the census \nissue and the Government shutdown issue and send this bill, as it was \nwritten by the Congress, to the President for signature.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed to Calendar No. 18, \nH.R. 581, and that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the \ntext of S. 851, the clean disaster bill, be substituted in lieu \nthereof; that the bill be read a third time and passed; and that the \nmotion to reconsider be laid on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. THOMAS. There is an objection. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, the Senators both know there are \nnegotiations going on now. This performance on the floor does not help \nat all. Our leaders are talking to your leaders. They are working \ntoward doing it. As a matter of fact, if you want to carry on this \nthing, there may be some time where you can do it this evening. The \nfact is, this is not the way to solve the issue. The leaders are \nmeeting, and I object to the request.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand under a previous order that I \nhave 30 minutes under my control at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, first, I rise on another topic, but I want to say to \nthe Senator from North Dakota that I fully empathize and sympathize \nwith him on his position. The flood about which my colleague from \nIllinois spoke a few minutes ago is the same flood that devastated Iowa \nin 1993. This Congress and the President came to the assistance of the \npeople of Iowa in a very rapid measure. To this day, the people of Iowa \ntalk about how rapidly the funds got out there, the Government was \nthere to help. And the same thing should apply to any disaster \nanywhere. And it should apply in North Dakota also.\n\n  I want to say to my colleague from North Dakota, he is right on the \nmark. This legislation ought to get through. The money ought to be sent \nout without all these other political ramifications. So I appreciate \nthe Senator from North Dakota. Again, his position is the correct one. \nWe ought to get the money through here. And we should not be loading it \ndown with political considerations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/10/senate-section/article/S5431-6", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5433-S5437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY AND THE 34TH ANNIVERSARY OF PRESIDENT \n            KENNEDY'S CALL FOR THE VIGOROUS PURSUIT OF PEACE\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I take the floor today with a couple of my \ncolleagues to note a very important anniversary.\n  Mr. President, 34 years ago today, on June 10, 1963, President John \nF. Kennedy delivered a historic address at American University here in \nWashington, DC, regarding the need for the vigorous pursuit of peace. \nHe declared that the United States has a critical interest in limiting \nthe testing of nuclear weapons. We wanted to mark that occasion today \nby talking about the need to continue that progress and to bring to \ncompletion President Kennedy's dream and goal of the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty.\n  I yield at this time to my colleague from Illinois for his unanimous-\nconsent request and for any comments he wants to make.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you Mr. President.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that privileges of the floor be granted to \nthe following members of my staff, Thomas Faletti and Robin Gaul during \nthe pendency of this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to thank my colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, \nfor reminding us of this important and historic anniversary. President \nJohn Kennedy's speech to American University in 1963, really I think \ndemonstrated a vision of the future which no one believed at the time \nwas really within our reach. We expect leaders in America to challenge \nus, to think ahead, and to think of a different world, a better world. \nCertainly President Kennedy did that at American University.\n  In the midst of the cold war, when it was starting to heat up with \nnuclear missiles being built at great expense in the Soviet Union and \nthe United States, President Kennedy challenged the United States to \nthink of the vision of a world that was a world of peace, a world where \nthe leaders in countries like the United States and Russia would be \nfocusing their resources on good and positive things rather than \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  We have tried through the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to reach a \nmilestone on the road to the total abolition of nuclear weapons. This \ntreaty prohibits all nuclear weapons test explosions or other nuclear \nexplosions anywhere in the world.\n  It is verifiable. We have a global network of monitoring facilities \nand onsite inspections to make sure that each country lives up to its \nterms.\n  President Bush, obviously a Republican leader, initiated a test \nmoratorium in October 1992. President Clinton continued it, and then \nsigned the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty last year, along with 125 \nother world leaders. It has been endorsed by the United Nations. Now it \nmust be ratified by the United States. The Senate must put its approval \non this notion that we are going to eliminate nuclear weapons testing \nas part of a global plan to bring real peace to this world. Forty-three \nother nuclear-capable countries must face that same responsibility.\n  Why should we do this at this point in our history? Are we not making \nenough progress? Do we really need this? I think the answers to these \nquestions demonstrate why we are here on the floor speaking to this \nissue. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty would curb nuclear weapons \nproliferation worldwide.\n\n  What does it mean? Not just those nations currently in possession of \nnuclear weapons, but those that dream--unfortunately dream--of being \nnuclear powers, they would be held back, too. Our monitoring devices in \nthe test ban treaty will be at least a discouragement, if not a \nprohibition against their own nuclear testing to become nuclear powers, \nto join in some nuclear arms race at a new level different from the \ncold war.\n  There is another aspect of this that is so troubling. Fully $1 out of \nevery $3 we spend each year now in the United States on what we call \nthe nuclear weapons program is money spent to clean up the mess, the \nenvironmental degradation that is left over from our nuclear program. \nIf we stopped the testing and put a halt to the construction of these \nweapons, we are going to\n\n[[Page S5434]]\n\nprotect our environment, and future generations will certainly be happy \nto hear that. It saves taxpayer money. And, it is supported by a \nmajority of Americans. In fact, over 80 percent of the American people \nthink it is time for us to do this.\n  The U.S. nuclear arsenal has consumed about a quarter to a third of \nall of our defense spending since World War II. I will not recount all \nthe dollars involved; and I am sure my colleagues will during the \ncourse of this debate. But, we have put ample resources in this \nprogram. We must be reminded over and over again of the words of \nPresident Dwight Eisenhower, no dove, our leader in World War II, who \nstood up and reminded us that every dollar spent on weaponry, every \ndollar spent in this case on nuclear weaponry, is a dollar not spent on \nthe education of a child, on nutrition for a child at risk. These are \nthings which should be constant reminders of the need to resume this \ndebate.\n  Despite the end of the cold war and the collapse of the Soviet Union, \nthe United States currently spends at least $33 billion a year on \nnuclear weapons and weapons-related activity--about 13 percent of our \ndefense budget. These costs continue even though no new warheads or \nbombs have been built since July 1990.\n  Nuclear weapons testing has stopped since September 1992. And the \nsize of the nuclear stockpile, because of negotiations, has gone down \ndramatically; yet, still $33 billion a year right up on the cash \nregister out of the taxpayers' pockets into a nuclear program. And for \nwhat? Unfortunately, a third of it, as I said, is used for \nenvironmental cleanup. And that should be done. But so much more is \nbeing used to maintain and upgrade existing weapons and retain the \ncapability to produce new ones.\n  Let us realize the vision of President Kennedy, a vision which 34 \nyears ago challenged Americans to think beyond the current cold war in \nthose days to the future, to a future free of nuclear weapons to a more \npeaceful world.\n  I am happy to join with my colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, on \nthe floor. And I thank him for reminding us of a commitment made of a \nvision expressed 34 years ago. It is time for this test ban treaty to \nbe ratified by the United States for a safer world, for ourselves and \nour children.\n  I yield back to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my colleague from Illinois for his very eloquent \nremarks and for reminding us of just how much we are spending. Even yet \ntoday, to maintain this nuclear stockpile, the United States spends \nroughly $30 billion a year. That is just about three times the amount \nthat we are spending on all medical research at the National Institutes \nof Health, to find the causes and cures of things like heart disease, \ncancer, and Alzheimer's, diabetes, Parkinson's disease. Three times \nwhat we are spending on this arsenal than all medical research. We are \ntrying to come up with money for NIH.\n  We had a sense-of-the-Senate resolution last week--98 to 0--to \nsupport a doubling of funding for NIH. That would bring it up to about \n$25 billion a year, not even up to this level. Yet we do not have the \nmoney to even get about a 4 or 5 percent increase at NIH.\n  I thank the Senator from Illinois for his eloquent comments.\n  I want to also yield to the Senator from Rhode Island for his \ncomments on this topic and thank him for being involved in this \ndiscussion on the floor of the Senate. This is an important \nanniversary. It must be noted. And we must mark it as hopefully the \nlast anniversary in this long journey to get a Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty.\n  I just say to my friend from Rhode Island and my friend from \nIllinois, that President Kennedy during that famous speech, 34 years \nago today, at American University, called for an end to nuclear \ntesting, and then proceeded to negotiate with the then-Soviet Union and \nothers for a ban on atmospheric testing. Four months later this Senate \nratified a ban on all atmospheric testing--4 months. And then here we \nhave been 34 years to get to a comprehensive test ban.\n  So if they could do that in 4 months, I would think now, certainly \nbefore the end of this year, we could bring this to a closure.\n  I yield to my friend and my colleague from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator for yielding. I commend him for his \nleadership on this important issue. And I also want to commend my \ncolleague from Illinois for his very eloquent statement on this very \nimportant topic.\n  I join my colleagues today in urging the administration to submit the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty to the Senate for its consideration and, \nhopefully, ratification. On this day in 1963, President John F. Kennedy \ndelivered his famous address to the graduates of American University. \nHe made his famous call for peace for all time. He was then searching \nfor a solution to a tense nuclear standoff. He stated in that speech:\n\n       Today the expenditure of billions of dollars every year on \n     weapons acquired for the purpose of making sure we never need \n     to use them is essential to keeping the peace. But surely the \n     acquisition of such idle stockpiles--which can only destroy \n     and never create--is not the only, much less the most \n     efficient means of assuring peace.\n\n  Mr. President, today we have an alternative means of assuring peace. \nAfter years of negotiations and false starts, 60 countries have \napproved the text of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty which would \nprohibit all nuclear weapons test explosions or other nuclear \nexplosions anywhere in the world.\n  This treaty would prevent deployment and impede the development of \nthese deadly weapons. It would not enter into force however until \nratified by all 44 states which possess nuclear power, including the \nfive countries which have harnessed this power to make nuclear weapons. \nIts comprehensiveness would reassure the 177 nonnuclear weapons states \nthat nuclear proliferation is waning, thus eliminating the need of \nthese states to develop their nuclear capability.\n  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty clearly has one purpose: To end the \narms race and prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. \nIt seeks to accomplish its goal in an objective and fair manner.\n  The membership of the executive council, the treaty's principal \ndecisionmaking body, will be distributed evenly throughout the world.\n  An international monitoring system will use scientific methods to \ndetect and identify prohibited nuclear explosions. A network of \nseismic, hydroacoustic, and radionuclide monitoring stations will \ncontinuously collect and analyze data to ensure global compliance.\n  A consultation and clarification regime will provide state parties \nwith the opportunity to address accusations of noncompliance before an \nonsite inspection is ordered. And any state party which demands a \nfrivolous or abusive inspection may be subject to punitive measures.\n  How can the United States not take the lead in this cause? If we \nratify this treaty, others will follow. Imagine a day when world peace \nis not decided by the size of nuclear stockpiles, but rather by the \nwill and wishes of the people of the world. This treaty is the next \nstep toward that reality.\n\n  Mr. President, in his book of several years ago, ``The Good War,'' \nauthor Studs Terkel presented an oral history of those touched by World \nWar II. He spoke with many individuals whose lives were shaped by the \nbomb. Indeed, he spoke with survivors of Hiroshima, who still do not \ntalk about the events of August 6, 1945, without breaking down.\n  He spoke with an American sailor who swam in the waters of the \nMarshall Islands the day after a test explosion. He died of cancer \nbefore the book was published.\n  But perhaps Terkel's most disturbing chapter is his last, when he \ninterviewed some children, aged 11 to 15, on a Chicago street corner in \n1965.\n  One child, Sam, stated, ``I hope I can die of old age, before the \nworld starts THE war.'' Ethel then chimed in, ``I wanna see if I'm \ngonna grow up first. I mean, I might not live to be grown up. Cause I \ndon't know when my time is up * * * I never know if I could die \novernight from the bomb or something.'' And finally Raymond said, \n``This might sound crazy, but I'd like to see a world without bombs. I \nmean without wars. It would be a lot bigger, the world. Maybe we could \nenjoy it more. Get a lot out of life, without worrying you would be \nblown up tomorrow.''\n\n[[Page S5435]]\n\n  Mr. President, generations growing up after World War II were haunted \nby the specter of annihilation by nuclear weapons. We now have an \nopportunity to rid these fears, the fears of our children, forever. The \nAmerican people want this treaty. Over 80 percent of the public support \nits ratification. It is incumbent upon us to consider this treaty and \nto ratify it, to put to rest once and for all the specter of nuclear \nannihilation.\n  I yield back my time to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair.\n  I thank my colleague from Rhode Island again for continuing to be \ninvolved in this discussion, for his leadership in the House and now in \nthe Senate on the total issue of arms control and especially on the \nissue of the test ban treaty.\n  Mr. President, let me continue for a little bit to talk some more \nabout the aspects of this treaty and why it is so important that we \nratify it this year.\n  Again, to recap, 34 years ago today, on June 10, 1963, President \nKennedy made a historic speech at American University here in \nWashington, DC. He talked about the need for a test ban treaty to limit \nthe number of nuclear weapons tests. Four months after that, President \nKennedy negotiated with the Soviet Union, signed and secured \nratification from the United States Senate for the limited test ban \ntreaty that banned all atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons. So, since \nOctober 1963, the two nations have had no atmospheric tests of nuclear \nweapons.\n  But President Kennedy's goal was not just atmospheric tests. His goal \nwas to ban all nuclear weapons tests. As President Kennedy said on June \n10, a comprehensive test ban treaty ``would check the spiraling arms \nrace in one of its most dangerous areas. It would place the nuclear \npowers in a position to deal more effectively with one of the greatest \nhazards * * * the further spread of nuclear arms. It would increase our \nsecurity; it would decrease the prospects of war.'' That is a quote \nfrom President Kennedy's speech at American University 34 years ago.\n  Mr. President, completion of a global nuclear test ban treaty \nnegotiations has been a central nuclear arms control objective for more \nthan 40 years. This long-awaited goal was finally won just last \nSeptember, September 24, 1996, when the United States and other \ncountries signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the CTBT as it is \ncalled, a treaty consistently supported by more than 80 percent of the \nAmerican public.\n  Now, we in the Senate must ensure that the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty is ratified here in the Senate and by 43 other nuclear-capable \ncountries so that it formally enters into force.\n  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is a major milestone in the effort \nto prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. It would establish a \npermanent ban on all nuclear explosions in all environments for any \npurpose. It's zero-yield prohibition on nuclear tests would help to \nhalt the development and deployment of new nuclear weapons. The treaty \nwould also establish a far-reaching verification program that includes \na global network of sophisticated seismic, hydro-acoustic, radionuclide \nmonitoring stations, as well as on-site inspection of test sites to \ndeter and detect violations.\n  I might just add here, Mr. President, one of the important reasons \nfor getting this treaty ratified as soon as possible is that under this \nregime, newly emerging nations that may be wanting to develop a nuclear \nweapon will find it thousands of times more difficult to do so. I will \nnot put myself in a position of saying it will be absolutely \nimpossible, nothing is 100 percent perfect, but many of these smaller \nnations that may want to have a nuclear weapon are going to need a \nsmall nuclear weapon. They will need some of the latest technology in \norder to have it delivered in a vehicle that they have in their \npossession or that they might soon acquire. To do that would require \ntesting. If they cannot do the testing, then they cannot acquire the \nlatest technology in nuclear weapon design and construction.\n  Mr. President, in 1991, the Soviet Union announced a unilateral \nnuclear weapons test moratorium. In 1992, the House and Senate passed \nlegislation establishing a 9-month U.S. moratorium with restrictions on \nthe number and purpose of any further U.S. tests and a prohibition on \nU.S. tests after September 30, 1996, unless another nation conducts a \ntest.\n  In 1993, President Clinton, with advice from the armed services, the \nnuclear weapons laboratories, and the Energy Department, determined \nthat the U.S. nuclear arsenal was safe and reliable without further \ntesting. On July 3 of that year, he announced he would extend the test \nmoratorium and agree to begin multilateral test ban negotiations in \nJanuary of 1994.\n  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was negotiated over more than 2 \nyears at the 61-nation Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. A key \nturning point occurred in 1995, when our Nation's leading nuclear \nweapons scientific advisors concluded that our nuclear weapons \nstockpile is safe and reliable and that even low-yield weapons tests \nare unnecessary, even the so-called safety tests intended to guard \nagainst defects that could lead to accidental warhead detonations.\n\n  Spurred by the independent JASON scientific group's report that the \nUnited States nuclear arsenal is safe and reliable without testing, and \nspurred further by the international outcry when the French resumed \nnuclear testing after a 3-year hiatus, the United States and France \nthen adopted a zero-yield test ban position in the nuclear weapons test \nban talks.\n  So, by August 1996, the negotiations produced a final nuclear weapons \ntest ban treaty text supported by all countries except one, all \ncountries except India, and India sought to include in the treaty a \ntimetable for eliminating all nuclear weapons and, again, India would \nfind its own nuclear weapons development program limited by a ban on \ntesting. So, to overcome one nation's opposition, Australia proposed--\nand more than 100 other countries supported--a resolution endorsing the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty, a zero-yield test ban, which was \nsubmitted to the U.N. General Assembly and passed by the overwhelming \nmargin of 158-3 on September 10, 1996.\n  Now, for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to formally enter into \nforce, it must be ratified by 44 named signatory nations, including the \nfive declared nuclear weapons states and the three undeclared nuclear \nweapons states--India, Israel, and Pakistan. The U.S. ratification \nrequires, of course, a two-thirds vote by the U.S. Senate. However, \nuntil the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty does enter into force, all \nsignatories, including the United States, are bound by article XVIII of \nthe Vienna Convention on Treaties not to undertake any action that \nviolates the purpose or intent of the treaty. In other words, the \nsignatory nations shall not test nuclear weapons.\n  That is sort of the recent history. Now, what is the next step? Well, \nseveral key steps must now be taken. Before the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty can be considered by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and \nthe full Senate, the Clinton administration must submit the articles of \nratification and must reach agreement with the Senate leadership to \nbegin formal consideration of the treaty. The treaty must also become a \npriority for the administration and for the U.S. Senate. The Foreign \nRelations Committee of the Senate and the Senate in its whole must then \nproceed with a thorough examination of the treaty and to vote on it. In \nthe end, I believe the Senate will agree that ratification of the \ntreaty is in our country's national security interests just as \nPresident Kennedy said 34 years ago today.\n  The Senator from Illinois mentioned that conservatively we are \nspending about $30 billion a year now to maintain our nuclear \nstockpile. I wondered how much we had spent over the intervening years. \nIt turns out that from right after the end of World War II until now, \nthe United States has spent more than $300 billion --that is billion \nwith a ``b''--$300 billion, about a third of a trillion dollars, for \nnuclear weapons and nuclear weapons materials. That does not include \nthe cost of all the delivery vehicles--that is, all of the missiles, \nthe silos we build, the Minutemans and the Titans--and it does\n\n[[Page S5436]]\n\nnot include the cost of all the B-52 bombers, the B-47 bombers, the B-2 \nbombers, and the B-1 bombers. It does not include that. It does not \ninclude the cost of all the submarines, all the Polaris and later the \nTrident submarines. That probably would come to hundreds of billions \nmore. I am talking just about nuclear weapons material alone, and the \nweapons themselves--$300 billion approximately that we have spent, and \nnow about $30 billion a year. As I mentioned earlier, Mr. President, \nthat is 2\\1/2\\ times what we are spending on all medical research in \nthe National Institutes of Health. We are spending 2\\1/2\\ times every \nyear to maintain the nuclear stockpile than we are spending on all \nbiomedical research through the National Institutes of Health. That is \nnot right, and that is why it is time to conclude the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty.\n\n  President Kennedy said 34 years ago today that the negotiations for a \nban on above-ground nuclear tests were in sight, and he implored the \nNation and the international community to bring that treaty to a \nconclusion. As I said, 4 months later, the agreement was reached and \nthe atmospheric test ban treaty became a reality--in just 4 months at \nthe height of the cold war.\n  The Soviet Union no longer exists. We have relations with Russia, \nopen relations. We visit their military establishments; they visit \nours. We now have an agreement where they will be an adviser to NATO. \nWell, now it is time for us to conclude the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty. It has been around a long time. Now we are at the point where \nwe can bring it to its final conclusion.\n  President Clinton must adopt the same attitude that President Kennedy \nadopted in 1963. He must insist on a quick closure, to make it a top \npriority of his administration to get the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty \nratified by the Senate this year. It is in our best interests. It would \nhelp secure our planet from nuclear threats. It would go a long way \ntoward ensuring that newly emerging nations do not get their hands on \nthe nuclear trigger and would begin the process of getting rid of, over \na period of time, the nuclear stockpiles that we have and saving all of \nthat money that we are now spending and, hopefully, putting that money \ninto important endevors such as medical research.\n  Well, the end is in sight. We soon can have in hand a comprehensive \nban on all nuclear weapons tests.\n  Mr. President, sometimes it boggles the mind to think of how many \nnuclear tests we have had in the past. Nuclear tests worldwide, \nunderground tests, 1,517, with the United States doing 815, the old \nSoviet Union doing 496, France doing 160, Britain 24, China 22, and \nIndia 1.\n  Atmospheric testing: 528 atmospheric tests prior to 1963, with the \nUnited States doing 215, the Soviet Union doing 219, France doing 50, \nBritain, 21, and China, 23. Total, all tests: 2,046.\n  A sad, sad chapter in the history of humankind; a terrible toll that \nit has taken not only economically from America and other countries by \nwhat we have spent, but I think it has taken a terrible toll \nenvironmentally.\n  Much of the money that we spend now through the Department of Energy \nfor our nuclear weapons stockpile is spent on cleaning up the mess that \nwas made, first, through the production of nuclear materials; second, \nthrough the refining of these nuclear materials, and the processing; \nthird, through the storage; and, of course, fourth, through the \nunderground testing.\n  So we are spending today, and we will continue to spend in our \nlifetimes, billions of dollars just to clean up the mess that has been \nmade.\n  There is another mess that has been made that we are paying for \ndearly. All those atmospheric tests that I mentioned--528 of them--each \nand every one of those produced in the atmosphere large amounts of \nplutonium and other toxic materials. I have seen estimates that tons of \nplutonium were released during all of these tests into the atmosphere, \nin the food chain, and in sea life. The half-life of plutonium is tens \nof thousands of years. And, yet, we know it is one of the most \ncarcinogenic materials known to mankind. One microscopic piece of \nplutonium can cause cancer.\n  Who knows how much plutonium is embedded into the ground and into the \nsoils from the underground tests, how much of that plutonium may find \nitself to underground aquifers later on in the evolution of our planet?\n  We are paying a terrible price for this sad chapter of our history. \nWe shouldn't pay the price any longer. Now is the time to end testing \nonce and for all and close the books on it.\n  I call upon President Clinton to make this a priority of his \nadministration this year. I call upon the majority leader of the Senate \nand the minority leader of the Senate to make it a priority for the \nU.S. Senate this year that we debate and vote on the comprehensive test \nban treaty. I call upon the chairman and the vice chair of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, as soon as the President sends this down, \nto take it up, to investigate it, to debate it fully, and to vote on it \nand report it to the floor of the Senate.\n  This must be a priority. We must do it this year. Let's make this \n34th anniversary of President Kennedy's speech at American University \nthe last anniversary before we have a completion of what he called a \nban on all nuclear testing.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my friend, the \nSenator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], in marking the anniversary of President \nJohn F. Kennedy's historic speech on nuclear disarmament. It was in \nthat speech, given June 10, 1963, at American University, that \nPresident Kennedy announced the initiation of negotiations for a \ncomprehensive ban on nuclear tests. I am pleased to see that now, 34 \nyears later, a comprehensive test ban is on the verge of becoming \nreality.\n  I am a strong supporter of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty [CTBT] \nas a way to curtail nuclear proliferation. This treaty, once it is \nratified by the 44 actual or potential nuclear powers, will ban all \nnuclear explosions no matter how small. In 1993, I cosponsored \nlegislation that extended our moratorium on nuclear tests and called on \nthe United States to end all testing by the year 1996. That bill passed \nand the United States' unilateral move to stop testing has shown our \ncommitment to a worldwide ban on nuclear explosions. As we all know, \nthe CTBT won approval in the U.N. General Assembly last September and, \njust days after the U.N. vote, President Clinton signed the treaty on \nbehalf of the United States. More than 100 other nuclear and nonnuclear \nstates have also signed the CTBT.\n  Mr. President, the CTBT will act as an essential complement to the \nnuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and will help end the threat of \nnuclear war. By prohibiting nonnuclear states from developing atomic \nweapons, the Non-Proliferation Treaty has greatly enhanced global \nsecurity since it was first signed back in 1968. The CTBT, by \nprohibiting nuclear testing, will provide further assurance that no \nadditional states will develop nuclear weapons. The world will \nundoubtedly be a safer place once all nuclear explosions, even \nunderground ones, are permanently outlawed.\n  Since President Kennedy first initiated test ban negotiations, the \nUnited States has taken the leading role in ending nuclear testing. We \nmust maintain this momentum. I urge the President to submit the CTBT to \nthe Senate for its advice and consent at the earliest possible date and \nthen I would hope the Foreign Relations Committee would take it up for \nconsideration soon thereafter. The United States should continue its \nleadership by ratifying the CTBT. We should demonstrate that our \ncommitment to a nuclear test ban is as strong as ever.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to join my \ncolleagues today in marking the 34th anniversary of President Kennedy's \nhistoric call for negotiations aimed at reducing the risk of nuclear \nwar.\n  President Kennedy's June 10, 1963, address at American University \nmarked the beginning of serious international efforts to limit the \nnuclear arms race and to avert the nightmarish possibility of a nuclear \nwar. His initiative resulted a few months later in the Limited Test Ban \nTreaty, which brought about the first pause in the nuclear powers' \nefforts to construct bigger, better, and more nuclear weapons.\n  It's worth noting that President Kennedy's objectives were more \nambitious. He had hoped to enact a comprehensive nuclear test ban, but \nwas unable to win agreement for such a bold step. Now,\n\n[[Page S5437]]\n\nmore than three decades later, we have an opportunity to realize this \nobjective.\n  Following several years of negotiations in the U.N. Conference on \nDisarmament, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty [CTBT] was completed and \nopened for signature in September 1996. Since then, over 140 countries \nhave signed the document, including all five declared nuclear weapons \nstates. For the treaty to enter into force, 44 key signatories, \nincluding the United States, must ratify the agreement prior to \nSeptember 1998.\n  Mr. President, over the past few years I have had the privilege of \nparticipating on a steering committee of a project organized by the \nHenry L. Stimson Center on Eliminating Weapons of Mass Destruction. The \nobjective of the group, which included such authorities on foreign \npolicy and national security as Gen. Andrew Goodpaster and Ambassador \nPaul Nitze, was to consider concrete measures the United States could \nundertake to work toward the long-term goal of a world free of nuclear \nweapons. In our third and final report, released in March, we laid out \nseveral steps President Clinton and Congress can take now to ensure \nthat future generations are safe from the threat posed by weapons of \nmass destruction. Ratification of the CTBT was one of the three most \nurgent measures we recommended.\n  Enactment of a comprehensive test ban would do more to stem \nproliferation and reduce the nuclear threat than any other action we \ncould take at this time. The details of the CTBT are technical and \ncomplex but the effect of the treaty is pure and simple: it would ban \nall nuclear test explosions. Not only would this constrain the \ndevelopment of more complex weapons but it would also protect our \nenvironment.\n\n  The United States already has a moratorium in effect on nuclear \nweapons tests and has not conducted such a test since 1992. It's time \nto make this moratorium permanent and ensure that others follow suit.\n  The administration has indicated its intent to present the CTBT to \nthe Senate for advice and consent. However, to date it has not done so. \nI appreciate that the treaty is likely to be controversial in some \nquarters and that the Senate has only recently concluded a hotly \ncontested debate on another important arms control treaty, the Chemical \nWeapons Convention [CWC]. However, one of the problems we faced with \nthe CWC was that it was not brought before the Senate as quickly as it \ncould have been. For that and other reasons, we found ourselves in late \nApril facing a deadline affecting our participation in the treaty.\n  Let's not put ourselves in that position again. Let's begin the \ndebate on the treaty now so that our decision on ratification--which I \nfervently hope will be a positive one--can serve as a signal of \nencouragement to other countries.\n  Thirty-four years ago today, President Kennedy called on us to pause \nand consider the effects of a devastating nuclear conflict. He put us \non a path to eliminating this threat. Let's honor his memory by \nfulfilling one of his grandest objectives. Let's act on and ratify the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/10/senate-section/article/S5433-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5437-S5438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          GREAT OUTDOORS WEEK\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to chat a little bit about \nrecreation in America today and announce that Great Outdoors Week for \n1997 began on Monday of this week.\n  From America's vast forests to her mighty rivers, to her majestic \nmountains, plains, and valleys, there is the recognition that this \nNation is truly blessed with national and natural beauty beyond \ncomparison. As a consequence, it is no wonder that our Nation and our \nnational consciousness are defined in no small part by the great \noutdoors that we all enjoy.\n  Coming from my State of Alaska--which is, at least as far as I am \nconcerned, America's premier outdoor State--I have lived near and \nexperienced some of nature's greatest handiwork. I have fished, hunted, \nsailed, hiked, and camped in probably the best places on Earth.\n  So it is with great pleasure that I come before my colleagues to \nannounce Great Outdoors Week for 1997.\n  The recreation community is in Washington this week to host a number \nof activities to remind those of us inside the beltway that outdoor \nrecreation is a good thing for people, for communities, for the \neconomy, and for conservation. Great Outdoors Week will bring together \nmany people and groups who really care about America's great outdoors. \nFederal, State, and local officials, recreation enthusiasts, outdoor \nmedia, recreation associations, and the recreation industry will all \ntake part in the events scheduled for this week.\n  I met last night with the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association--\nthe manufacturers and the suppliers of recreation vehicles. There were \nsome 250 to 300 people in the Russell rotunda at a very, very \noutstanding reception to kick off Great Outdoors Week for 1997.\n  Mr. President, as on outdoorsman and chairman of the Senate committee \nwith responsibility for our Nation's public lands, I am also going to \ntake an active role in the other events scheduled for this week.\n  The work of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources touches the \nlives of Americans in many ways but few ways more visible than in our \noversight of the Nation's great outdoors. Great Outdoors Week really \ngives us an opportunity to focus on the value of recreation in our \nlives, and how we can do a better job of encouraging people of all ages \nto enjoy America's natural and national splendor.\n  The great outdoors is the main focus of our national recreation \ninitiative. The acronym is REC, and it stands for three goals: \nreinvigorate, enhance, and conserve.\n  To reinvigorate and rebuild our national parks, forests, and other \nFederal lands that provide diverse recreation opportunities.\n  To enhance the visits Americans make to our public land legacy \nthrough improved access, facilities, and services.\n  To conserve America's natural resources that provide recreation \nopportunities, particularly through wildlife habitat restoration and \nprotection. It also includes areas in our urban centers with strategies \nto protect open space, rivers, lakes, and to link parks and trails.\n  Last year, we passed the largest parks and conservation public lands \nbill that has passed this body since the 1940's. Containing 119 pieces \nof legislation, the bill increased park boundaries, designated \nhistorical trails and wild and scenic rivers, protected sensitive \nlands, and benefited virtually every State in this Nation.\n  It also protected the Presidio in San Francisco, one of the finest \nrecreation areas in our country, by establishing a new management \nsystem which takes advantage of private sector expertise, contribution, \nand finance.\n  It will also create the National Recreation Lakes Study Commission. \nThis is a nine-member panel which will examine the demand for \nrecreation at federally managed lakes and reservoirs and help develop \nplans with the private sector to maximize recreational opportunities. A \nreport is due next year, and we may write legislation to increase \nopportunities in this area.\n  Thankfully, after I wrote to the President last week, he told me that \nhe will name the remaining four members of the nine-member commission \nthis week so that they can get down to work.\n  On April 25 of this year, we held a seminar on outdoor recreation \ntrends and benefits.\n  This Wednesday we will hold an oversight hearing on the stateside \nprogram of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. We will hold \nadditional oversight hearings on other aspects of the outdoor \nrecreation capabilities. At least one of them will be a field hearing \nout West. The committee report, hopefully, will follow.\n  Putting our heads together, we can decide what the Federal Government\n\n[[Page S5438]]\n\ncan and should do to reinvigorate, to enhance, and to conserve \nAmerica's outdoors.\n  Our national parks--our Nation's crown jewels--are losing some of \ntheir luster. We need to ensure that all Americans can enjoy and be \nproud of our parks system for years to come.\n  We have at least an $8 billion backlog in unfunded projects and \nprograms.\n  Yellowstone needs about $300 million in road repairs.\n  Yosemite needs $178 million in repairs after January's floods.\n  Each year, another 1 percent of the National Parks Service roads fall \nfrom fair to poor or failing.\n  We are working to leave a legacy everyone can be proud of--a new, \nreinvigorated, world-class National Park System.\n  Mr. President, an expanded fee demonstration program, major \nconcession reform, a bonding initiative, and additional private-sector \nsponsorships are all under consideration in this Congress. Our system \nof parks includes State and local parks as well. Capital needs of State \nand local recreation systems for 1995-99 are over $27 billion, \naccording to the National Recreation and Parks Association, but we have \na problem. The stateside Land and Water Conservation Fund has been shut \ndown.\n  Over 30 years ago, in a bipartisan effort, Congress and the President \ncreated the Land and Water Conservation Fund referred to as the LWCF. \nIt is funded primarily by offshore oil and gas revenues which now \nexceed $3 billion. My committee has authorized land and water \nconservation funding to the year 2015 with an annual ceiling of $900 \nmillion.\n  The LWCF stateside program promotes a unique partnership among \nFederal, State, and local governments. It provides matching grants that \nenable State and local governments to create recreation facilities, \nparks, and playgrounds. Because they are matching grants, they double \nthe impact.\n  The stateside LWCF program has helped finance 37,500 national parks \nand recreation projects--campgrounds, trails, playgrounds, recreation \ncenters, and gyms. It has also helped in my State of Alaska. We have \nhad a number of very effective State and local parks which received a \nstateside LWCF grant. The demand continues to increase. As a matter of \nfact, in fiscal year 1995 over $600 million was requested.\n  But I want to explain very briefly, Mr. President, that the recent \nbalanced budget agreement between that the administration and the \ncongressional budget negotiators provided $700 million over 5 years for \nthe Federal side of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. That is the \nportion of the fund used for land acquisition by the Federal land \nmanagement agencies. The administration wants $315 million of that to \nbuy Headwaters Forest and the New World Mine. This is not what LWCF was \ndesigned to do. The remaining $385 million, according to the \nadministration, would be spent for Federal land purchases. That is \nhardly a State matching program. This means the stateside matching land \nand water conservation fund program would still remain unfunded.\n  So what would Americans get for their $700 million? More Federal land \nacquisitions over the next 5 years chosen by politicians in Washington, \nDC, rather than the people. State and local recreation projects, the \nones closest to the people, get nothing, and that is too bad because \nthose are matching funds and we get twice the bang for the buck. We \nneed to save the stateside Land and Water Conservation Fund program and \nI have asked appropriators to provide some money to keep the matching \ngrant program alive.\n  When Congress authorized the Land and Water Conservation Fund, it had \ntwo parts. One part dealt with Federal acquisitions. The other provided \nmatching grants for State and local governments to purchase and develop \nparks and recreation facilities. The administration is trying to \nabolish the second half, and Congress should simply not let that \nhappen. In fiscal years 1996 and 1997, Congress and the administration \nsimply zeroed out those funds.\n  Mr. President, let me show you a couple of charts, and I will \nconclude my remarks. This chart shows the Land and Water Conservation \nFund authorizations and appropriations. As one can see, the stateside \nLWCF appropriations in green have dramatically decreased. Of course, \nthe authorizations have gone way up. What we have here is a dropoff \nfrom 1983 to 1995 down to 1996 where there is zero money provided for \nstateside LWCF matching grants. That is probably the greatest single \nsignificance of what the Federal role is. It is in matching, if you \nwill, so that Federal appropriations can come on and the priorities can \nbe addressed in an appropriate manner that represent the will and \nattitudes of States and local communities.\n  There is just one other chart that I want to show, and that is the \nreceipts. Where does the money come from? It comes from a dedicated \nfund, the Outer Continental Shelf areas where revenues now exceed more \nthan $3 billion a year. There is very little from recreation fees. \nThere is some from the motor fuel tax and surplus property sales. The \nfunding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund comes from offshore \nrevenues, but the Appropriations Committee has seen fit to use those \nfunds for other expenditures.\n  So, Mr. President, during Great Outdoors Week and every other week of \nthe year, I ask that we all remember the value of outdoor recreation to \nAmericans. We are blessed with a great natural bounty. It is our duty \nto conserve it. As a consequence, I urge my colleagues to reflect on \nthe necessity of having a meaningful stateside Land and Water \nConservation Fund program which would provide matching grants \nbenefiting the States and allowing the priorities at hand to be met.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/10/senate-section/article/S5437-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5438-S5439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR THURMOND\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure I come to the \nfloor today to speak about a distinguished colleague and dear personal \nfriend, Senator Strom Thurmond. I, like so many American citizens, have \nadmired the senior Senator from South Carolina for his outstanding \nservice to the United States in this chamber, and for the life he has \nlived through military service in World War II to his years of \nteaching, coaching, and practicing law in the Palmetto State.\n  The accomplishments and achievements which have been a part of \nSenator Thurmond's life are truly outstanding. Accordingly, his reach \nacross this country, particularly the Southeast, is remarkable. One can \ngo to the Georgia/South Carolina border, traveling along Interstate 20 \nto Florence, SC, and be driving on the Strom Thurmond Highway. Or one \ncan take a stroll through the U.S. Capitol and walk into the beautiful \nStrom Thurmond room, so designated in 1991. These are just two of the \nmany facilities named for the distinguished Senator because of his \ncourage and patriotism. He has set a fine example for all Americans--\nfrom the students he taught from 1923-28 in Edgefield, McCormick, and \nRidge Spring, SC, to the pages, interns, and staffers to whom he has \nbeen so gracious, friendly, and helpful since his arrival in the Senate \nin 1954.\n  Senator Thurmond has served diligently on the Armed Services, \nJudiciary, and Veterans' Affairs Committees. He has not only been a \nchampion for his State, supporting such vital missions as those \nperformed at the Savannah River site, but also a leader on security \nissues for our Nation as a whole. There is no question that his \nknowledge, understanding, and expertise in military affairs and foreign \npolicy has strengthened our national security and helped to maintain \nthe status of the United States as the world's preeminent military and \neconomic power.\n  As a soldier, the Senator's record was no less impressive. In World \nWar II, Senator Thurmond volunteered for active service on the day we \ndeclared war and flew his glider behind enemy lines during the D-day \ninvasion with the 82d Airborne Division.\n  Following these heroics, he was awarded 18 decorations, including the \nPurple Heart, Bronze Star for Valor, and the Legion of Merit with Oak \nLeaf Cluster. His military service continued as he was promoted to \nmajor general in the U.S. Army Reserve in 1959. This is where he \ncontinued to serve in distinguished fashion for the next 36 years.\n  With the rest of his military and political career well documented \nand chronicled on the floor by my colleagues, I would just like to \nclose now\n\n[[Page S5439]]\n\nby saying thank you to Senator Thurmond, as a citizen of the United \nStates of America and as a colleague in the Senate. I am honored that I \ncan say I served with you and called you my friend. Moreover, I know \nthat many Americans will join me in commemorating the enduring record \nyou have set and legacy you will leave for future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/10/senate-section/article/S5438-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, on May 27 I sent a letter to President \nClinton.\n  In it, I expressed opposition to the possible nomination of Mr. John \nJ. Hamre to fill the No. 2 spot at the Pentagon.\n  He would be the Deputy Secretary of defense, and it's a big job.\n  I told the President why I would oppose this nomination--if it's ever \nmade, and I'll give my reasons in just a moment.\n  But 2 days after writing this letter, the Washington Post ran a story \nabout my opposition to the nomination.\n  Mr. Hamre was also interviewed.\n  He attempted to respond to my criticism.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my letter and the \nnewspaper article be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to address some of Mr. \nHamre's assertions.\n  First, Mr. Hamre's remarks imply that my criticism is somehow \npersonal.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. He is a very likeable \nperson.\n  But my personal feelings have absolutely nothing to do with my \nposition on his nomination.\n  What I have tried to do is examine all the facts and then reach a \nconclusion based on those facts.\n  These are the facts as I know them.\n  In 1992, the inspector general [IG] examined the Department of \nDefense's [DOD] progress payment procedures.\n  The IG along with legal counsel declared that these policies \n``resulted in the rendering of false accounts and violations of the \nlaw.''\n  The IG told the Department to get on the stick and fix the problem.\n  The bureaucrats balked.\n  Under pressure, they finally signed an agreement in March 1993.\n  In signing this document, they agreed to comply with the law.\n  One of the persons who signed this agreement was Mr. Alvin Tucker.\n  Well, 7 months after Mr. Tucker signed the agreement, Mr. Hamre \nbecame Comptroller and Chief Financial Officer or CFO.\n  Well, guess what?\n  Mr. Tucker became Mr. Hamre's most senior deputy. He became the \nDeputy CFO.\n  Mr. President, after becoming CFO, Mr. Hamre did nothing to meet the \nterms of the agreement and comply with the law.\n  Instead, he sided with the bureaucrats who were thumbing their noses \nat the law.\n  He gave them the green light to keep breaking the law.\n  He personally reauthorized their illegal operation.\n  Then, early this year he floated a legislative proposal.\n  His draft language would have sanctioned the procedure that the IG \nhad declared illegal and that he, Mr. Hamre, had personally authorized.\n  Mr. President, those are the facts.\n  In my opinion, Mr. Hamre was attempting to legalize a crime.\n  Mr. Hamre knew full well his progess scheme was operating outside the \nlaw.\n  Otherwise, why would he feel like he needed some legal cover?\n  Second, he accuses me of making a mountain out of a molehill.\n  He claims I am focusing on a ``small policy'' issue.\n  I take issue with the notion that this is somehow an insignificant \nissue.\n  The statute that Mr. Hamre's progress payment scheme violates is \nsection 1301 of title 31 of the United Statess Code.\n  This law embodies a sacred constitutional principle: Only Congress \nhas the power to decide how public money many be spent.\n  This is the device that Congress uses to control the purse strings.\n  So, Mr. President, this isn't Mickey Mouse stuff. I'm talking about a \nconstitutional principle.\n  When a constitutional principle is involved, it's very difficult for \nme to see the smallness of an issue.\n  Third, Mr. Hamre claims this is an acquisition issue--not a finance \nand accounting question.\n  This is an obvious attempt to deflect responsibility--away from \nhimself.\n  It's an attempt to make it someone else's problem.\n  His reasoning is flawed.\n  If Mr. Hamre thinks this is an acquisition issue, maybe he has \nabdicated his responsibilities under the law--as CFO.\n  The CFO's responsibilities are spelled out in the ``Money and \nFinance'' section of the United States Code. That's in title 31.\n  His payment scheme violates section 1301 in the same book--title 31.\n  It does it by deliberately charging payments to the wrong accounts \nand then juggling the books to cover it up.\n  Anyone who thinks this is an acquisition issue needs to consult the \nlaw books.\n  When you go to the law library and locate title 31 and open the book, \nthe subtitle staring you in the face is: ``Money and Finance.''\n  Section 1301 lies in a chapter entitled ``Appropriations.''\n  Mr. President, misappropriation, mischarging and cooking the books \ntakes Mr. Hamre deep into the realm of money and accounting.\n  If this is just an acquisition issue, I'll eat my hat.\n  Fourth, when Mr. Hamre became CFO in October 1993, he declared war on \nfinancial mismanagement.\n  To claim success today, he cites ``steep drops in contract \noverpayments.''\n  Mr. Hamre's claims are not supported by the facts.\n  The General Accounting Office [GAO] has issued a series of reports on \nDOD overpayments.\n  These reports demolish Mr. Hamre's success stories.\n  The most recent report says Mr. Hamre's progress payments scheme is \nthe biggest, single driver behind overpayments. He's to blame.\n  That's right, Mr. President, Mr. Hamre's own operations are causing \noverpayments to happen.\n  That's exactly what it says on page 12 of the GAO report entitled: \n``Fixing DOD's Payment Problems is Imperative.''\n  This report is dated April 1997 and has the designation NSIAD-97-37.\n  GAO reports also say that DOD has no capability to detect \noverpayments.\n  Virtually every overpayment ever examined by the GAO was detected by\n\n[[Page S5440]]\n\nthe person who got the check in the mail--the contractor--and not the \nGovernment.\n  In almost every case, overpayments were voluntarily refunded by the \ncontractor who got the checks.\n  Now, Mr. President, if Mr. Hamre were really serious about \neliminating overpayments, why didn't he just shut down the illegal \nprogress payments operation--like the IG asked?\n  That would have removed the primary source of overpayments.\n  If Mr. Hamre has no capability to detect overpayments, how does he \nknow whether they are going up or down?\n  How does he know they are going down, if he doesn't know how many \nthere are?\n  Perhaps, if overpayments are really going down--like he says, it must \nmean the contractors have stopped making voluntary refunds.\n  Maybe they have decided to keep the money. That would help to keep \nthe numbers down.\n  Mr. President, I will have much more to say about Mr. Hamre in the \nweeks ahead.\n  Some of my colleagues have asked me why I oppose this nomination.\n  I want to be sure they know where I am coming from.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 27, 1997.\n     President William J. Clinton,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing to inform you that I am \n     opposed to the nomination of Mr. John J. Hamre to fill the \n     number two position at the Department of Defense (DOD).\n       Secretary Cohen has recommended that Mr. Hamre be the next \n     Deputy Secretary of Defense.\n       I am opposed to this nomination because Mr. Hamre has \n     authorized and protected an illegal payment operation.\n       The procedure in question is the one DOD uses to make \n     progress payments on contracts. Under Mr. Hamre's policy, \n     payments are deliberately charged to the wrong accounts. \n     Then, after the payments are made, DOD attempts to ``adjust'' \n     the accounting ledgers to make it look like the checks were \n     charged to the right accounts when the money was, in fact, \n     spent some other way. Deliberately charging the wrong \n     accounts and then juggling the books to make them look right \n     is what I call ``cooking the books.''\n       Legal counsel has said that DOD's progress payment \n     procedures ``result in the rendering of false accounts and \n     violations of Section 1301.'' Section 1301 is a little known \n     but very important law. It embodies a sacred constitutional \n     principle: Only Congress decides how public money may be \n     spent. Section 1301is the device the Congress uses to control \n     the purse strings.\n       After the Inspector General declared that DOD progress \n     payment procedures were illegal, the department's Chief \n     Financial Officer (CFO), Mr. Hamre, had a responsibility to \n     institute some reforms. In fact, his senior deputy made a \n     formal commitment to obey the law. But instead of fixing the \n     problem, Mr. Hamre tried to legalize the crime. Earlier this \n     year, he circulated a piece of draft legislation for review \n     and comment. His legislation would have sanctioned the \n     payment procedures that the IG had declared illegal and that \n     he had personally authorized in writing after becoming CFO.\n       Mr. Hamre's draft bill tells me that he knew full well that \n     his progress payments process was operating outside the law. \n     Otherwise, why was he seeking legal cover?\n       Mr. President, when I found out about what Mr. Hamre was up \n     to, I went straight to the floor of the Senate to denounce \n     his actions. I did it on two occasions. Once on January 28th \n     (See pages S695-696 in the Record) and again on February 12th \n     (S1265-1267).\n       I think Mr. Hamre has probably done an excellent job in \n     making a case for the DOD budget before Congress. And that is \n     the John Hamre that most senators know--the one wearing the \n     budget hat. That's John Hamre, the Comptroller. But the \n     budget is just part of his job. He wears another hat. He is \n     also the department's CFO. As CFO, he is responsible for \n     financial management and accounting. This has been his \n     downfall. In the accounting field, Mr. Hamre has done a lousy \n     job. I would give him a grade of F for his performance. The \n     department's books are in a shambles. True, they were that \n     way when he became CFO, but that was four years ago, and they \n     are still that way. The department's books are in such a \n     mess--so much documentation is missing--that they can't be \n     audited as required by the CFO Act of 1990. And the situation \n     is not expected to get much better anytime soon. The IG \n     expects to keep giving DOD disclaimers of opinion ``well into \n     the next century.''\n       One reason why DOD keeps flunking the CFO audits is sloppy \n     bookkeeping. DOD refuses to do routine accounting work on a \n     daily basis as transactions occur. And one of the most \n     flagrant examples of sloppy bookkeeping is the progress \n     payment process. As legal counsel said, it results in the \n     rendering of false accounts and violations of Section 1301. \n     Payments are deliberately charged to the wrong accounts and \n     then DOD doctors the books to make them right with the law. \n     With this kind of bookkeeping operation, it's next to \n     impossible to either locate or follow the audit trail.\n       Mr. President, this is not ``mickey mouse'' accounting \n     stuff that only ``bean counters'' need to worry about. This \n     is about the breakdown of discipline and internal controls. \n     That leaves the department's accounts vulnerable to theft and \n     abuse. In recent years, several employees succeeded in \n     tapping into the DOD money pipe undetected, stealing millions \n     of dollars. They were caught as a result of outrageous \n     personal behavior and not because of effective internal \n     controls. How many others are still out there, ripping off \n     the taxpayers?\n       Under the CFO Act, Mr. Hamre is responsible for ``improving \n     internal controls and financial accounting.'' Because of his \n     personal involvement in the illegal payment process and his \n     failure to clean up the books, I do not believe that Mr. \n     Hamre deserves to be promoted to Deputy Secretary of Defense.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 29, 1997]\n\n            Official in Line for No. 2 Defense Post Rebuked\n\n                          (By Bradley Graham)\n\n       John Hamre, the Pentagon comptroller in line to become the \n     Defense Department's new second-in-command, has come under an \n     unusually sharp attack from Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) \n     triggered by a dispute over how the department accounts for \n     progress payments on contracts.\n       In a letter to President Clinton made public yesterday, \n     Grassley accused Hamre of having ``authorized and protected \n     an illegal payment operation'' and announced he would oppose \n     Hamre's expected nomination.\n       The accounting practice, Grassley said, is symptomatic of \n     the Pentagon's chronically ``sloppy bookkeeping.'' He charged \n     Hamre had ``done a lousy job'' revamping the Pentagon's \n     financial management during his four years as comptroller, \n     adding that the Pentagon's books remain a ``mess.''\n       Hamre, a former Senate staff member who enjoys widespread \n     favor on Capitol Hill, was stunned and puzzled by the \n     harshness and personal focus of Grassley's remarks. At issue, \n     he said, was just an honest disagreement over a Pentagon \n     contracting practice that dates back several decades.\n       ``The senator has taken an important but small acquisition \n     policy issue and applied it to my entire tenure,'' Hamre said \n     in a brief phone interview. ``I'm sorry he's done that, and \n     I'd welcome a chance to talk about it.''\n       Grassley repeatedly has called attention to the Pentagon's \n     antiquated accounting system, deploring its waste and \n     vulnerability to fraud. Hamre, in turn, declared improvements \n     in controls and methods a top priority when he took over as \n     the Pentagon's top financial officer in 1993. Since then, the \n     Pentagon has reported steep drops in contract overpayments \n     and unmatched disbursements, begun a shift from paper-based \n     to electronic payments and consolidated financial offices.\n       But what troubles Grassley is the Pentagon's continuing \n     practice of making periodic payments on contracts without \n     correlating them to the work done, a process that Grassley \n     says the Pentagon's inspector general declared illegal in \n     1992.\n       ``Under Mr. Hamre's policy,'' Grassley wrote, ``payments \n     are deliberately charged to the wrong accounts. Then, after \n     the payments are made, DOD attempts to `adjust' the \n     accounting ledgers to make it look like the checks were \n     charged to the right accounts when the money was, in fact, \n     spent some other way.\n       ``Deliberately charging the wrong accounts and then \n     juggling the books to make them look right is what I call \n     `cooking the books,' '' the senator added.\n       Hamre maintains there is nothing nefarious about the \n     practice. He said the system of progress payments was adopted \n     years ago to allow the contractor to avoid having to borrow \n     money, and thus keep project costs down. Whether the Pentagon \n     should move to a more precise billing process now, he said, \n     is a contracting issue, not a financial management one. Just \n     how far Grassley intends to go in thwarting Hamre's accession \n     is unclear. While Defense Secretary William S. Cohen has \n     recommended Hamre for the job of deputy secretary, Clinton \n     has not publicly affirmed the choice.\n       If the nomination goes to Capitol Hill, Grassley could \n     simply vote against it or, as he has done in previous \n     instances, exercise his senatorial prerogative to block the \n     nomination from coming to a floor vote.\n       ``I don't know what we're going to do yet,'' a Grassley \n     aide said.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

He is a very likeable \nperson.\n  But my personal feelings have absolutely nothing to do with my \nposition on his nomination.\n  What I have tried to do is examine all the facts and then reach a \nconclusion based on those facts.\n  These are the facts as I know them.\n  In 1992, the inspector general [IG] examined the Department of \nDefense's [DOD] progress payment procedures.\n  The IG along with legal counsel declared that these policies \n``resulted in the rendering of false accounts and violations of the \nlaw.''\n  The IG told the Department to get on the stick and fix the problem.\n  The bureaucrats balked.\n  Under pressure, they finally signed an agreement in March 1993.\n  In signing this document, they agreed to comply with the law.\n  One of the persons who signed this agreement was Mr. Alvin Tucker.\n  Well, 7 months after Mr. Tucker signed the agreement, Mr. Hamre \nbecame Comptroller and Chief Financial Officer or CFO.\n  Well, guess what?\n  Mr. Tucker became Mr. Hamre's most senior deputy. He became the \nDeputy CFO.\n  Mr. President, after becoming CFO, Mr. Hamre did nothing to meet the \nterms of the agreement and comply with the law.\n  Instead, he sided with the bureaucrats who were thumbing their noses \nat the law.\n  He gave them the green light to keep breaking the law.\n  He personally reauthorized their illegal operation.\n  Then, early this year he floated a legislative proposal.\n  His draft language would have sanctioned the procedure that the IG \nhad declared illegal and that he, Mr. Hamre, had personally authorized.\n  Mr. President, those are the facts.\n  In my opinion, Mr. Hamre was attempting to legalize a crime.\n  Mr. Hamre knew full well his progess scheme was operating outside the \nlaw.\n  Otherwise, why would he feel like he needed some legal cover?\n  Second, he accuses me of making a mountain out of a molehill.\n  He claims I am focusing on a ``small policy'' issue.\n  I take issue with the notion that this is somehow an insignificant \nissue.\n  The statute that Mr. Hamre's progress payment scheme violates is \nsection 1301 of title 31 of the United Statess Code.\n  This law embodies a sacred constitutional principle: Only Congress \nhas the power to decide how public money many be spent.\n  This is the device that Congress uses to control the purse strings.\n  So, Mr. President, this isn't Mickey Mouse stuff. I'm talking about a \nconstitutional principle.\n  When a constitutional principle is involved, it's very difficult for \nme to see the smallness of an issue.\n  Third, Mr. Hamre claims this is an acquisition issue--not a finance \nand accounting question.\n  This is an obvious attempt to deflect responsibility--away from \nhimself.\n  It's an attempt to make it someone else's problem.\n  His reasoning is flawed.\n  If Mr. Hamre thinks this is an acquisition issue, maybe he has \nabdicated his responsibilities under the law--as CFO.\n  The CFO's responsibilities are spelled out in the ``Money and \nFinance'' section of the United States Code. That's in title 31.\n  His payment scheme violates section 1301 in the same book--title 31.\n  It does it by deliberately charging payments to the wrong accounts \nand then juggling the books to cover it up.\n  Anyone who thinks this is an acquisition issue needs to consult the \nlaw books.\n  When you go to the law library and locate title 31 and open the book, \nthe subtitle staring you in the face is: ``Money and Finance.''\n  Section 1301 lies in a chapter entitled ``Appropriations.''\n  Mr. President, misappropriation, mischarging and cooking the books \ntakes Mr. Hamre deep into the realm of money and accounting.\n  If this is just an acquisition issue, I'll eat my hat.\n  Fourth, when Mr. Hamre became CFO in October 1993, he declared war on \nfinancial mismanagement.\n  To claim success today, he cites ``steep drops in contract \noverpayments.''\n  Mr. Hamre's claims are not supported by the facts.\n  The General Accounting Office [GAO] has issued a series of reports on \nDOD overpayments.\n  These reports demolish Mr. Hamre's success stories.\n  The most recent report says Mr. Hamre's progress payments scheme is \nthe biggest, single driver behind overpayments. He's to blame.\n  That's right, Mr. President, Mr. Hamre's own operations are causing \noverpayments to happen.\n  That's exactly what it says on page 12 of the GAO report entitled: \n``Fixing DOD's Payment Problems is Imperative.''\n  This report is dated April 1997 and has the designation NSIAD-97-37.\n  GAO reports also say that DOD has no capability to detect \noverpayments.\n  Virtually every overpayment ever examined by the GAO was detected by\n\n[[Page S5440]]\n\nthe person who got the check in the mail--the contractor--and not the \nGovernment.\n  In almost every case, overpayments were voluntarily refunded by the \ncontractor who got the checks.\n  Now, Mr. President, if Mr. Hamre were really serious about \neliminating overpayments, why didn't he just shut down the illegal \nprogress payments operation--like the IG asked?\n  That would have removed the primary source of overpayments.\n  If Mr. Hamre has no capability to detect overpayments, how does he \nknow whether they are going up or down?\n  How does he know they are going down, if he doesn't know how many \nthere are?\n  Perhaps, if overpayments are really going down--like he says, it must \nmean the contractors have stopped making voluntary refunds.\n  Maybe they have decided to keep the money. That would help to keep \nthe numbers down.\n  Mr. President, I will have much more to say about Mr. Hamre in the \nweeks ahead.\n  Some of my colleagues have asked me why I oppose this nomination.\n  I want to be sure they know where I am coming from.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 27, 1997.\n     President William J. Clinton,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing to inform you that I am \n     opposed to the nomination of Mr. John J. Hamre to fill the \n     number two position at the Department of Defense (DOD).\n       Secretary Cohen has recommended that Mr. Hamre be the next \n     Deputy Secretary of Defense.\n       I am opposed to this nomination because Mr. Hamre has \n     authorized and protected an illegal payment operation.\n       The procedure in question is the one DOD uses to make \n     progress payments on contracts. Under Mr. Hamre's policy, \n     payments are deliberately charged to the wrong accounts. \n     Then, after the payments are made, DOD attempts to ``adjust'' \n     the accounting ledgers to make it look like the checks were \n     charged to the right accounts when the money was, in fact, \n     spent some other way. Deliberately charging the wrong \n     accounts and then juggling the books to make them look right \n     is what I call ``cooking the books.''\n       Legal counsel has said that DOD's progress payment \n     procedures ``result in the rendering of false accounts and \n     violations of Section 1301.'' Section 1301 is a little known \n     but very important law. It embodies a sacred constitutional \n     principle: Only Congress decides how public money may be \n     spent. Section 1301is the device the Congress uses to control \n     the purse strings.\n       After the Inspector General declared that DOD progress \n     payment procedures were illegal, the department's Chief \n     Financial Officer (CFO), Mr. Hamre, had a responsibility to \n     institute some reforms. In fact, his senior deputy made a \n     formal commitment to obey the law. But instead of fixing the \n     problem, Mr. Hamre tried to legalize the crime. Earlier this \n     year, he circulated a piece of draft legislation for review \n     and comment. His legislation would have sanctioned the \n     payment procedures that the IG had declared illegal and that \n     he had personally authorized in writing after becoming CFO.\n       Mr. Hamre's draft bill tells me that he knew full well that \n     his progress payments process was operating outside the law. \n     Otherwise, why was he seeking legal cover?\n       Mr. President, when I found out about what Mr. Hamre was up \n     to, I went straight to the floor of the Senate to denounce \n     his actions. I did it on two occasions. Once on January 28th \n     (See pages S695-696 in the Record) and again on February 12th \n     (S1265-1267).\n       I think Mr. Hamre has probably done an excellent job in \n     making a case for the DOD budget before Congress. And that is \n     the John Hamre that most senators know--the one wearing the \n     budget hat. That's John Hamre, the Comptroller. But the \n     budget is just part of his job. He wears another hat. He is \n     also the department's CFO. As CFO, he is responsible for \n     financial management and accounting. This has been his \n     downfall. In the accounting field, Mr. Hamre has done a lousy \n     job. I would give him a grade of F for his performance. The \n     department's books are in a shambles. True, they were that \n     way when he became CFO, but that was four years ago, and they \n     are still that way. The department's books are in such a \n     mess--so much documentation is missing--that they can't be \n     audited as required by the CFO Act of 1990. And the situation \n     is not expected to get much better anytime soon. The IG \n     expects to keep giving DOD disclaimers of opinion ``well into \n     the next century.''\n       One reason why DOD keeps flunking the CFO audits is sloppy \n     bookkeeping. DOD refuses to do routine accounting work on a \n     daily basis as transactions occur. And one of the most \n     flagrant examples of sloppy bookkeeping is the progress \n     payment process. As legal counsel said, it results in the \n     rendering of false accounts and violations of Section 1301. \n     Payments are deliberately charged to the wrong accounts and \n     then DOD doctors the books to make them right with the law. \n     With this kind of bookkeeping operation, it's next to \n     impossible to either locate or follow the audit trail.\n       Mr. President, this is not ``mickey mouse'' accounting \n     stuff that only ``bean counters'' need to worry about. This \n     is about the breakdown of discipline and internal controls. \n     That leaves the department's accounts vulnerable to theft and \n     abuse. In recent years, several employees succeeded in \n     tapping into the DOD money pipe undetected, stealing millions \n     of dollars. They were caught as a result of outrageous \n     personal behavior and not because of effective internal \n     controls. How many others are still out there, ripping off \n     the taxpayers?\n       Under the CFO Act, Mr. Hamre is responsible for ``improving \n     internal controls and financial accounting.'' Because of his \n     personal involvement in the illegal payment process and his \n     failure to clean up the books, I do not believe that Mr. \n     Hamre deserves to be promoted to Deputy Secretary of Defense.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 29, 1997]\n\n            Official in Line for No. 2 Defense Post Rebuked\n\n                          (By Bradley Graham)\n\n       John Hamre, the Pentagon comptroller in line to become the \n     Defense Department's new second-in-command, has come under an \n     unusually sharp attack from Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) \n     triggered by a dispute over how the department accounts for \n     progress payments on contracts.\n       In a letter to President Clinton made public yesterday, \n     Grassley accused Hamre of having ``authorized and protected \n     an illegal payment operation'' and announced he would oppose \n     Hamre's expected nomination.\n       The accounting practice, Grassley said, is symptomatic of \n     the Pentagon's chronically ``sloppy bookkeeping.'' He charged \n     Hamre had ``done a lousy job'' revamping the Pentagon's \n     financial management during his four years as comptroller, \n     adding that the Pentagon's books remain a ``mess.''\n       Hamre, a former Senate staff member who enjoys widespread \n     favor on Capitol Hill, was stunned and puzzled by the \n     harshness and personal focus of Grassley's remarks. At issue, \n     he said, was just an honest disagreement over a Pentagon \n     contracting practice that dates back several decades.\n       ``The senator has taken an important but small acquisition \n     policy issue and applied it to my entire tenure,'' Hamre said \n     in a brief phone interview. ``I'm sorry he's done that, and \n     I'd welcome a chance to talk about it.''\n       Grassley repeatedly has called attention to the Pentagon's \n     antiquated accounting system, deploring its waste and \n     vulnerability to fraud. Hamre, in turn, declared improvements \n     in controls and methods a top priority when he took over as \n     the Pentagon's top financial officer in 1993. Since then, the \n     Pentagon has reported steep drops in contract overpayments \n     and unmatched disbursements, begun a shift from paper-based \n     to electronic payments and consolidated financial offices.\n       But what troubles Grassley is the Pentagon's continuing \n     practice of making periodic payments on contracts without \n     correlating them to the work done, a process that Grassley \n     says the Pentagon's inspector general declared illegal in \n     1992.\n       ``Under Mr. Hamre's policy,'' Grassley wrote, ``payments \n     are deliberately charged to the wrong accounts. Then, after \n     the payments are made, DOD attempts to `adjust' the \n     accounting ledgers to make it look like the checks were \n     charged to the right accounts when the money was, in fact, \n     spent some other way.\n       ``Deliberately charging the wrong accounts and then \n     juggling the books to make them look right is what I call \n     `cooking the books,' '' the senator added.\n       Hamre maintains there is nothing nefarious about the \n     practice. He said the system of progress payments was adopted \n     years ago to allow the contractor to avoid having to borrow \n     money, and thus keep project costs down. Whether the Pentagon \n     should move to a more precise billing process now, he said, \n     is a contracting issue, not a financial management one. Just \n     how far Grassley intends to go in thwarting Hamre's accession \n     is unclear. While Defense Secretary William S. Cohen has \n     recommended Hamre for the job of deputy secretary, Clinton \n     has not publicly affirmed the choice.\n       If the nomination goes to Capitol Hill, Grassley could \n     simply vote against it or, as he has done in previous \n     instances, exercise his senatorial prerogative to block the \n     nomination from coming to a floor vote.\n       ``I don't know what we're going to do yet,'' a Grassley \n     aide said.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I may speak \nfor a few minutes about some concerns about the budget that I have.

Mr. President, I rise to express some concerns that I \nhave about recent developments that are occurring in the House of \nRepresentatives related to the budget. It was just a few nights ago, a \nfew evenings ago, that we got a conference report from the House that \nwas passed by a substantial margin in the Senate that confirms that the \nwork we did in the budget negotiations was satisfactory to both the \nMembers of the other body and the Senate. We had been through it here \nonce before, the conference report, to get the budget resolution \nconfirmed. It passed 78 to 22. The vote was almost identical when we \ngot the conference report back. That was Thursday evening. I was \nstunned to read in Friday morning's newspaper that there were \nchallenges to the assumptions that were made, to the agreements that \nwere made to try to get that budget done, to try to forge a consensus \nagreement.\n  I must point out that this is not an agreement that I have heard \npeople standing up and lauding and saying, ``I love it. It is the \nperfect budget agreement. It is everything my constituents want it to \nbe.'' By no means. But there is in this budget agreement something I \nthink both parties can salute. There is an investment in the middle \nclass, there is an investment in education, there is some tax relief \nfor the middle class. Once again, if we look at the extremes, we are \nall woefully short of things that I would have liked to have if I had \nan ideal opportunity to design it myself. But I do not, and we \nrepresent a consensus. Mr. President, 50 States are represented here by \nthe two Senators from each State who are here to argue the case from \ntheir particular point of view.\n  A bipartisan budget agreement was the product of extensive \nnegotiations involving compromises by everyone involved, and many \nprovisions were the subject of protracted discussion, with each word \ncarefully considered and debated. In the end, we struck a delicate \nbalance, and the resulting agreement, if implemented, will provide, I \nbelieve, great benefits to our Nation. It will give us the first \nbalanced budget since 1969. It will provide tax relief, as I said \nearlier, to the middle class. It will protect Medicare, extend its \nsolvency, and it will do something about cleaning up the environment, \ninvestments in education, and other significant national priorities.\n  Unfortunately, since the handshake that took place here--it took \nplace in the negotiating room between the chairman and the ranking \nmembers and the representatives of the President--two House committees \nare now moving to alter the bipartisan budget agreement when the ink is \nbarely dry. It is a matter of great concern to me and it ought to be a \nmatter of great concern to everybody here who thought we had \naccomplished something significant when we passed that budget \nagreement. Although the steps have been taken in the other body, I want \nto raise my concerns here before Senate committees begin the process of \nmarking up their own reconciliation packages.\n  For instance, one important provision of the bipartisan budget \nagreement would protect immigrants, legal immigrants who have come to \nthis country, who paid their taxes, played by the rules, and who then \nsuffer from a disability--perhaps from an automobile accident or an \nillness that robs them of their ability to function as they used to--\neyesight or other physical ailments that affect their capacity to walk \nor to work. The budget agreement says these people should be protected.\n  It states on page 22 of the agreement of the budget resolution that \nCongress will:\n\n       . . . restore SSI and Medicaid eligibility for all disabled \n     legal immigrants who are or who become disabled and who \n     entered the United States prior to August 23, 1996.\n\n  That was a compromise date, I point out. Unfortunately, last week in \nthe House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, they reported \na bill that fails to do this and suggests reducing the numbers of \npeople and reducing the availability of these services, these programs \nfor these disabled people. It directly violates this portion of the \nagreement, the compromise that they are proposing. The compromise was \nalready done. The subcommittee's action is not an innocent mistake. It \nis not based on differences in interpreting the agreement. This is a \nblatant, intentional violation of the bipartisan budget accord which \nshould not be tolerated. Certainly it should not be begun unilaterally \nso soon after the agreement is done.\n  If we had things that we wanted to talk about, they ought to be \ntalked about cautiously and not entered into the news media immediately \nas something they want to change.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \ntwo letters from the Director of OMB, Frank Raines, to the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee and to Representative Shaw, the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Human Resources in the Committee on Ways and Means, \nthat outline this and other similar concerns about the implementation \nof the budget agreement.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                     Washington, DC, June 5, 1997.\n     Hon. John Kasich,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, House of Representatives, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Enclosed is a letter I sent earlier \n     today to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Ways and \n     Means Human Resources Subcommittee regarding Subcommittee \n     markup of legislation to implement the Bipartisan Budget \n     Agreement.\n       The preliminary markup documents we reviewed were \n     inconsistent with the agreement in several important \n     respects. I hope that by identifying these issues as early as \n     possible, we will be able to implement the agreement in a \n     bipartisan manner.\n           Sincerely,\n     Franklin D. Raines.\n                                  ____\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                     Washington, DC, June 5, 1997.\n     Hon. E. Clay Shaw, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Human Resources, Committee on Ways \n         and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you know, the Administration and the \n     bipartisan congressional leadership recently reached \n     agreement on a historic plan to balance the budget by 2002 \n     while investing in the future. The plan is good for America, \n     its people, and its future, and we are committed to working \n     with Congress to see it enacted.\n       With regard to welfare, the budget agreement called for \n     restoring Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid \n     benefits for immigrants who are disabled or become disabled \n     and who entered the country before August 23, 1996; extending \n     from five to seven years the exemption in last year's welfare \n     law for refugees and asylees for the purposes of SSI and \n     Medicaid; and making other important changes.\n       We have reviewed the Subcommittee's draft markup document, \n     however, and we have found a number of provisions that are \n     inconsistent with the budget agreement in these and other \n     areas. Consequently, if the Subcommittee were to proceed with \n     its legislation in this form, we would be compelled to invoke \n     the provisions of the agreement that call on the \n     Administration and the bipartisan leadership to undertake \n     remedial efforts to ensure that reconciliation legislation is \n     consistent with the agreement.\n       We appreciate the fact that the Subcommittee has a mark \n     that includes several provisions that the Administration \n     supports, such as in the areas of welfare to work and State \n     SSI administrative fees.\n       Welfare to Work.--We are pleased the budget agreement \n     includes the President's $3 billion welfare-to-work proposal \n     and that the Subcommittee included provisions that meet many \n     of the Administration's priorities. Specifically, we are \n     pleased that the mark provides funds for jobs where they are \n     needed most to help long-term recipients in high \n     unemployment-high poverty areas; directs funds to local \n     communities with large numbers of poor people; awards some \n     funds on a competitive basis, assuring the best use for \n     scarce resources; and gives communities appropriate \n     flexibility to use the funds to create successful job \n     placement and job creation programs.\n       Though your mark does not address a performance fund, we \n     appreciate your willingness to consider a mechanism to \n     provide needed incentives and rewards for placing the \n     hardest-to-serve in lasting, unsubsidized jobs that promote \n     self-sufficiency. In addition, we stand ready to continue to \n     provide assistance in refining targeting factors.\n       State SSI Administrative Fees.--The Administration is \n     pleased that the Subcommittee has included a provision, \n     consistent with the budget agreement, to increase the \n     administrative fees that the Federal Government charges \n     States for administering their State supplemental SSI \n     payments and to make the increase available, subject to \n     appropriations, for Social Security Administration (SSA) \n     administrative expenses.\n       In a number of areas, however, we have serious concerns \n     with provisions that do not\n\n[[Page S5442]]\n\n     reflect the budget agreement. The Administration has \n     separately transmitted draft legislation that reflects the \n     budget agreement's provisions on benefits to immigrants.\n       Continued SSI and Medicaid Benefits for Legal Immigrants.--\n     The Administration strongly opposes the provision that denies \n     coverage to many legal immigrants who were in the United \n     States when the welfare law was signed but who become \n     severely disabled after that date. The budget agreement \n     explicitly states, ``Restores SSI and Medicaid eligibility \n     for all disabled legal immigrants who are or become disabled \n     and who enter the U.S. prior to August 23, 1996.'' The mark \n     fails to reflect that agreement by only ``grandfathering'' \n     those now receiving SSI, therefore dropping those who would \n     become disabled in the future and would be eligible for \n     benefits under the agreement. Instead of enacting the budget \n     agreement, the Subcommittee would grandfather immigrants who \n     were on the SSI rolls on August 22, 1996, thus protecting \n     75,000 fewer immigrants than the budget agreement by the year \n     2002. By contrast, the agreement targets the most vulnerable \n     individuals by providing a safety net for all immigrants in \n     the country when the welfare law was signed who have \n     suffered--or may suffer in the future--a disabling accident \n     or illness.\n       In contrast with the budget agreement, which was designed \n     to restore benefits, the markup document would provide SSI \n     and Medicaid benefits to immigrants now on the rolls only if \n     the immigrant has no sponsor, the sponsor has died, or the \n     sponsor has income under 150 percent of the poverty level. \n     The Administration strongly opposes this provision, which \n     would cut off about 100,000 severely disabled legal \n     immigrants who would receive benefits under the budget \n     agreement. We understand that the Subcommittee may drop this \n     provision, and we hope that is true.\n       As noted above, the agreement provided for both SSI and \n     Medicaid eligibility for disabled legal immigrants. The mark, \n     however, also fails to guarantee Medicaid coverage for all \n     disabled legal immigrants who continue to receive SSI. For \n     States in which SSI eligibility does not guarantee Medicaid \n     coverage and for States that choose not to provide \n     Medicaid coverage to legal immigrants who were in the U.S. \n     prior to August 23, 1996, legal immigrants who receive SSI \n     would not be guaranteed to continue receiving Medicaid. To \n     conform to the policy in the budget agreement, the \n     Subcommittee should include a provision in its bill to \n     explicitly guarantee Medicaid coverage to disabled legal \n     immigrants who continue to receive SSI.\n       Refugee and Asylee Eligibility.--The budget agreement would \n     extend the exemption period from five to seven years for \n     refugees, asylees, and those who are not deported because \n     they would likely face persecution back home. However, the \n     Subcommittee's proposal would provide that extension for \n     refugees and not for asylees and others. Such asylees and \n     others should receive the additional two years to naturalize.\n       In addition to the provisions in the Subcommittee markup \n     related to immigration, the Administration has the following \n     concerns:\n       Unemployment Insurance Integrity.--The Subcommittee draft \n     does not include the provision of the budget agreement that \n     achieves $763 million in mandatory savings over five years \n     through an increase in discretionary spending of $89 million \n     in 1998 and $467 million over five years. These savings are a \n     key component of the budget agreement. The discretionary \n     spending that the agreement assumes, and which would be \n     subject to appropriation, would support the necessary \n     additional eligibility reviews, tax audits, and other \n     integrity activities that, the evidence demonstrates, will \n     yield the savings. We urge the Subcommittee to adopt this \n     provision to achieve the specified savings.\n       The Federal Unemployment Account.--The Administration \n     supports the proposed increase in the Federal Unemployment \n     Account ceiling, which reflects the budget agreement. The \n     mark, however, does not accomplish another aspect of the \n     agreement, because it only ``authorizes'' $100 million to the \n     States in 2000-2002 for Unemployment Insurance administrative \n     funding, rather than making the payments mandatory as the \n     agreement provides. We look forward to working with the \n     Subcommittee to address this issue.\n       The Subcommittee mark also includes a member of provisions \n     that were not specifically addressed in the budget agreement, \n     and about which the Administration has serious concerns. They \n     include the following:\n       Minimum Wage and Workfare.--The Administration strongly \n     opposes the Subcommittee's proposal on the minimum wage and \n     welfare work requirements.\n       First, the proposal goes beyond the scope of the budget \n     agreement and, thus, should not be included in the \n     reconciliation bill.\n       Second, the proposal would undermine the fundamental goals \n     of welfare reform. The Administration believes strongly that \n     everyone who can work must work, and those who work should \n     earn the minimum wage--whether they are coming off of \n     welfare or not. The proposal does not meet this test.\n       Worker Protections in Welfare to Work.--We are deeply \n     disappointed in the Subcommittee draft's lack of adequate \n     worker protection and non-displacement provisions. We \n     strongly urge the Subcommittee to adopt, at a minimum, the \n     provisions included in H.R. 1385, the House-passed job \n     training reform bill.\n       Repeal of Maintenance of Effort Requirements on State \n     Supplementation of SSI Benefits.--Historically, the \n     Administration has strongly opposed the repeal of \n     maintenance-of-effort requirement because it would let States \n     significantly cut, or even eliminate, benefits to nearly 2.4 \n     million poor elderly, disabled, and blind persons. Congress \n     instituted the maintenance-of-effort requirement in the early \n     1970s to prevent States from transferring Federal benefit \n     increases from SSI recipients to State treasuries. The \n     proposal also could cause some low-income elderly and \n     disabled individuals to lose SSI entirely and to lose \n     Medicaid coverage as well. The Administration opposed this \n     proposal in last year's welfare reform debate.\n       Other TANF Provisions.--The Administration is concerned \n     with several provisions in the mark that were not in the \n     budget agreement. For example, the agreement did not address \n     making changes in the TANF work requirements regarding \n     vocational education and educational services for teen \n     parents. The Administration opposes the provision allowing \n     States to divert TANF funds away from welfare-to-work efforts \n     to other social service activities.\n       The budget agreement reflects compromise on many important \n     and controversial issues, and challenges the leaders on both \n     sides of the aisle to achieve consensus under difficult \n     circumstances. We must do so on a bipartisan basis.\n       I look forward to working with you to implement the \n     historic budget agreement.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Franklin D. Raines,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today the House Commerce Committee, \nthe Subcommittee on Health and Environment, will consider legislation \nintroduced by the chairman of that subcommittee that also breaks the \nbipartisan budget agreement. The budget agreement calls for $1.5 \nbillion to ease the impact of increasing Medicare premiums on low-\nincome beneficiaries. This provision was included because the budget \nagreement calls for phasing in increases in Medicare premiums to \naccommodate the shift of home health care expenditures from part A to \npart B. We were worried because there is going to have to be, in order \nto provide the solvency that we found for Medicare to continue, or the \nMedicaid programs, we had proposed expanding Medicaid premium coverage \nfor Medicare recipients who had incomes of 120 to 150 percent of \npoverty. That is pretty modest going.\n  The final agreement threw out the specifics of the premium proposal. \nHowever, it did call for spending the $1.5 billion on whatever policy \nCongress chose to enact. But that was not the understanding. \nRegretfully, the House committee with jurisdiction of Medicaid will \nonly include $300 to $400 million for this provision, one we labored \nlong and hard over. It is another clear violation of the budget \nagreement, and it is very troubling.\n  I am also concerned about the tax bill that the chairman of the House \nWays and Means Committee outlined yesterday. The chairman's bill would \nonly provide $30.8 billion--not an insignificant amount--in tax \nincentives for higher education. But that was fought for very stoutly; \nthat it was to get $35 billion. And only about $22 billion of the \nproposal of this type is for the benefits that were advocated by the \nPresident, understood to be something we could agree on, falling far \nshort of, and I quote here, the ``roughly $35 billion.'' That language \nwas struggled over, ``roughly $35 billion.'' I tell you this, no one \ncan buy a house for ``roughly $35,000,'' or a car for ``roughly \n$15,000.'' How much is it? Well, that is what it ought to be. That \nlanguage was compromise language, because we knew the intent or \nbelieved the intent of both Speaker Gingrich and/or the distinguished \nleader here, Senator Lott, was their commitment to the program. \nAlthough the word ``roughly'' was there, it should be interpreted \nbroadly, and I think this, frankly, goes too far, when they start \nmaking the cuts in the House committee that are inconsistent with the \nagreement.\n  Mr. President, the bipartisan budget agreement calls on the House and \nSenate leadership to take remedial efforts to ensure that this document \nis implemented in the legislative process. Leadership action is \ncritical if the agreement is to be implemented properly. And, \ntherefore, I hope that Speaker Gingrich will intervene promptly and \nrequire that in all cases I have mentioned the relevant committees make \nthe changes necessary to be consistent with the agreement that we have.\n\n[[Page S5443]]\n\n  If the congressional leadership fails to enforce the agreement, it \nwill not be worth the paper it is written on and in the process of \nreconciliation we could be looking at very serious problems getting \nthis program into place.\n  Mr. President, I also want to take a moment to talk about the \ndisaster supplemental. I am pleased to note that yesterday the \nPresident vetoed the bill because it contains the so-called automatic \nCR. The automatic CR also violates the bipartisan budget agreement for \ntwo reasons.\n  First, it would lower the amount of discretionary spending available \nfor fiscal 1998. The budget agreement calls for $527 billion in \ndiscretionary spending for fiscal year 1998, which is $17 million over \nlast year's level. If the automatic continuing resolution is enacted, \nthe majority could refuse to pass the 13 appropriations bills, thereby \ncutting the $17 billion in discretionary spending. That would \nabsolutely violate one of the basic Democratic accomplishments in the \nbudget agreement and, again, the consensus.\n\n  The automatic CR would make deep cuts in programs that are protected \nin the budget agreement. The bipartisan negotiators agreed to provide \nlarge increases in 13 major discretionary programs. Examples of these \nprograms include elementary and secondary education, Pell grants, child \nliteracy, Head Start, national parks, job training, Clean Water Act, \nSuperfund, and the COPS Program. Some of the programs are preferred by \nDemocrats, some preferred by Republicans, but the fact is we arrived at \na consensus. Both parties wanted this done. An automatic CR would \nfreeze these programs at last year's level, and they would not get the \nincreases promised in the budget agreement, at least without further \ncongressional action.\n  So, I hope the leadership will comply with the budget agreement, put \nthe plight of disaster victims above politics, strip the automatic CR \nfrom the bill and send the President a clean version of the disaster \nrelief bill that he can sign.\n  Mr. President, I conclude and I thank you for your indulgence with \nthis simple message: A promise is a promise. A deal is a deal. The \nRepublican leadership made a promise to the Democrats in the Congress \nand to the President. What I am asking here today is that they make \nsure that promise is kept by their committee chairs, subcommittee \nchairs, and those who would violate the agreement after all of that \nlabor and what I think was a smashing success.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send a bill to the desk and ask for \nits appropriate referral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to finish by adding to \nwhat Senator Lautenberg has said, that we sent a bill to the President \nfor disaster relief for the victims of North and South Dakota and \nMinnesota. We sent him a bill that we hoped he would sign. I don't \nthink the President has explained why he would veto a bill that he says \nis necessary for these disaster victims when, in fact, all we did was \nsay we are also going to make sure that we don't shut down the \nGovernment so that the very people we are trying to help will not be \nable to get the checks that they need after September 30 if Congress \nand the President have not come to agreement.\n  It is very important that people understand that the budget agreement \nfor the 1998 budget year are allocations, they are not appropriations. \nIn fact, to actually spend the money, it takes both Congress and the \nPresident to agree. Sometimes, the Congress and the President don't \nagree before September 30, which is the end of the fiscal year. So we \nhave to start a new fiscal year. Now, if there is not an agreement and \nwe don't have a provision for continuing Government, then we can shut \ndown Government again. That is not what anyone wants to do.\n  So Congress has in the disaster relief bill and the supplemental \nappropriations to go with that bill, the process that says we are not \ngoing to shut down Government, we are going to keep spending money at \nthe same level that is being spent this year, and then when the \nagreement is made between Congress and the President, we will be able \nto go into whatever Congress and the President agree on.\n  When anyone talks about cuts in spending because we go into the 1998 \nyear under the 1997 spending, there are no cuts because there have been \nno appropriations for 1998, and we haven't come to agreement on the \nspecifics.\n  I think it is very proper to ask why the President did not sign the \nbill. I think it is proper to say to the President, ``We did send you a \nbill; you chose not to sign it. I think you owe an explanation to the \ndisaster victims of why you would stand for the authority to shut down \nGovernment when we are trying to continue the process of covering \npeople in case some of the appropriations bills are not passed at the \nend of the fiscal year.''\n  We just want to make sure that people can plan ahead, that they will \nknow that their paychecks will be there if they work for the \nGovernment, that their pensions will be there if they are veterans who \nhave earned their pensions, that there will not be a disruption of our \nGovernment. We are not cutting back from this year's expenditures. We \nwill say we will keep on going until we have an agreement, and when \nthat agreement is made, then we go forward and the President and the \nCongress together do the job that both of us were elected to do. So I \nthink it is very important the people of this country have the facts \nand know that we are trying to help with all of the Federal emergency \nmanagement funds that need to be replenished as well as the funds to \nreplenish the Bosnia accounts and the many other supplemental \nexpenditures that are in that bill.\n  Mr. President, I think it is very important that the President of the \nUnited States sign the bill and continue the operation of Government as \nusual so that the people in our country, on September 30, will not have \nto worry about a disruption in their lives if they work for the \nGovernment or if they have earned veterans' pensions or if they plan a \nfamily vacation or if they are going on a business trip and they have \nnot renewed their passports. Those are the things that are at stake \nhere.\n  We have a lot of responsibility. We can meet that responsibility by \nmaking sure that the disaster victims are covered and that we keep \nGovernment going on a rational and responsible basis.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/10/senate-section/article/S5443-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to authorize the Government of India to establish a \nmemorial to honor Mahatma Gandhi in the District of Columbia; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n            Legislation to Establish Mahatma Gandhi Memorial\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to authorize \nthe placement of a statue of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi --Mahatma \nGandhi--on Federal land across the street from the Indian embassy in \nWashington DC. The Government of India has offered a statue of Gandhi \nas a gift to the United States. In order to place it on Federal land, \nan act of Congress is required. This bill will fulfill just that \npurpose, and I thank the Senator from Florida [Mr. Mack] and the \nSenator from Maryland, [Mr. Sarbanes] for joining me in this endeavor.\n  India is currently celebrating the 50th anniversary of its \nindependence. Authorizing the placement of a statue of Mahatma Gandhi, \noften called the father of the Indian nation, would serve as a fitting \ntribute to Indian democracy which has survived--in fact, thrived--\ndespite enormous challenges, and a symbol of the growing strength of \nthe bonds between our two countries.\n  It is particularly appropriate that a statue of Mahatma Gandhi be \nselected for this purpose. The effects of his non-\n\n[[Page S5445]]\n\nviolent actions and the philosophy which guided them were not limited \nto his country, nor his time. His influence in the United States was \nmost notably felt in the civil rights movement, but has also infused \nall levels of our society.\n  If I may invade ever so slightly the privacy of the President's \nluncheon table, in May 1994, Mr. Clinton had as his guest the \ndistinguished Prime Minister of India, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, who in \nhis youth was a follower of Mahatma Gandhi. In a graceful passage, \nPrime Minister Rao related how it came to pass that Mahatma Gandhi, \ncaught up in the struggle for fair treatment to the Indian community in \nSouth Africa, and in consequence in jail, read Thoreau's essay on \n``Civil Disobedience'' which confirmed his view that an honest man is \nduty-bound to violate unjust laws. He took this view home with him, and \nin the end the British raj gave way to an independent Republic of \nIndia. Then Martin Luther King, Jr., repatriated the idea and so began \nthe great civil rights movement of this century.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., has written of the singular influence \nGandhi's message of nonviolent resistance had on him when he first \nlearned of it while studying at Crozier Theological Seminary in \nPhiladelphia. He would later describe that influence in his first book, \n``Stride Toward Freedom'':\n\n       As I read I became deeply fascinated by [Gandhi's] \n     philosophy of non-violent resistance . . . as I delved deeper \n     into the philosophy of Gandhi, my skepticism concerning the \n     power of love gradually diminished, and I came to see its \n     potency in the area of social reform . . . prior to reading \n     Gandhi, I had concluded that the love ethics of Jesus were \n     only effective in individual relationships . . . but after \n     reading Gandhi, I saw how utterly mistaken I was.\n       . . . It was in this Gandhian emphasis on love and non-\n     violence that I discovered the method for social reform that \n     I had been seeking for so many months . . . I came to feel \n     that this was the only morally and practically sound method \n     open to oppressed people in their struggle for freedom . . . \n     this principle became the guiding light of our movement. \n     Christ furnished the spirit and motivation and Gandhi \n     furnished the method.\n\n  Martin Luther King, Jr., believed that Gandhi's philosophy of \nnonviolent resistance was the guiding light of the American civil \nrights movement. As Dr. King wrote, ``Gandhi furnished the message.'' A \nstatue of Gandhi, given as a gift from the Government of India, on a \nsmall plot of Federal land along Massachusetts Avenue, in front of the \nIndian Embassy, will stand not only as a tribute to the shared values \nof the two largest democracies in the world but will also pay tribute \nto the lasting influence of Gandhian thought on the United States. An \ninfluence that is so pervasive that when the President and the Prime \nMinister of India meet at the White House for lunch, a half-century \nafter Gandhi's death, it is no surprise that he should be a topic of \nconversation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Kerrey, and Mr. \n        Conrad):\n  S. 864. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nimprove the provision of managed care under the Medicaid Program; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 The Medicaid Managed Care Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce The \nMedicaid Managed Care Act of 1997. This legislation meets two very \nimportant objectives in the Medicaid Program. First, it gives States \nthe additional flexibility they need to administer the Medicaid Program \nby allowing them to enroll Medicaid beneficiaries into managed care \nPrograms. Second, the bill sets Federal standards for managed care to \nensure that Medicaid patients receive the same quality of care as those \npatients who are enrolled in private managed care plans.\n  Under our legislation, States could require Medicaid patients to \nenroll in managed care plans without going through the lengthy and \ncumbersome process of applying to the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices for a waiver of current Medicaid regulations. In exchange for \nthis important flexibility, States will have to meet a set of minimum \nFederal standards to ensure that Medicaid patients continue to receive \nquality care.\n  For example, States would be required to offer patients a choice of \nat least two health plans. Plans would be required to meet certain \nstandards of access to care, quality, and solvency. These standards are \nespecially important given recent problems in States that have set up \nMedicaid managed care programs under the waiver process. In some \ninstances, plans have failed to contract with enough providers to serve \nthe Medicaid population. Some have been permitted to operate under \nstandards that are lower than commercial insurers are required to meet, \nand others have used fraudulent marketing practices to entice Medicaid \npatients to sign up with their plans. These actions have resulted in \npatients being denied medically necessary services, and have resulted \nin States and the Federal Government paying for care that was never \ngiven.\n  Considering these abuses, why should we allow Medicaid managed care \nat all? Because managed care, if implemented correctly, can vastly \nimprove the quality of health care provided to low-income families. In \ntoday's fee-for-service program, patients face myriad problems. Some \nare forced to get care in hospital emergency rooms because they cannot \nfind a private physician willing or able to accept Medicaid's low \npayment rates. Those who do have access to providers often must wait \nfor hours in clinics which are overcrowded and understaffed. And, \nsadly, they often do not have access to primary and preventive care \nservices which would have prevented them from becoming ill to begin \nwith.\n  Medicaid managed care, if done well, provides regular prenatal care \nto assure that children are born healthy. These plans provide coverage \nfor check-ups and immunizations to prevent serious illnesses. And they \ngive patients a medical home--a provider they know they can go to if \nthey are sick, or a number to call if they have questions.\n  Medicaid managed care also has the potential of benefiting our \noverall health care system by providing access to primary care \nproviders rather than forcing patients to make costly and unnecessary \nvisits to hospital emergency rooms. It gives providers the opportunity \nto catch and treat, or prevent, costly health problems.\n  Mr. President, we have worked very hard to ensure that this \nlegislation strikes an appropriate balance between the needs of \nMedicaid beneficiaries and the managed care companies. I want to thank \nSenators Breaux and Kerrey who helped craft this legislation and are \noriginal cosponsors. I also want to thank the many advocacy \norganizations for their input and support. And I also want to thank \nsome of the managed care organizations who worked with us. I am \nespecially pleased that some of these organizations, such as the HMO \nGroup which is an alliance of health maintenance organizations have \nendorsed this legislation. Their support is critical to the success of \nMedicaid managed care.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be included \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 864\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for improved coordination, communications, \nand enforcement related to health care fraud, waste, and abuse, to \ncreate a point of order against legislation which diverts savings \nachieved through medicare waste, fraud, and abuse enforcement \nactivities for purposes other than improving the solvency of the \nFederal hospital insurance trust fund under title XVIII of the Social \nSecurity Act, to ensure the integrity of such trust fund, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  the medicare anti-fraud act of 1997\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today, and join my colleagues, \nSenator Mack and Senator Baucus, to introduce timely legislation that \naddresses a problem that continues to plague the Medicare Program--\nfraud and abuse. The premise of this bill is quite simple: if Congress \nis to look for cuts in the Medicare Program, it should begin with \neradicating fraud--for several reasons:\n  First, we cannot fix Medicare while letting fraud erode the system. \nThe General Accounting Office estimates that the Medicare waste, fraud, \nand abuse ripoff rate is about 10 percent. With fraud pilfering the \nhealth system's resources losses to Medicare and the Federal share of \nMedicaid could be $30 billion annually. Using the most conservative of \nestimates, we could cover an additional 2 million seniors a year with \nfunds lost just to Medicare waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  Mr. President, over the next few weeks, Congress will be ironing out \nthe details of a historic budget agreement--one which will finally \nbalance the budget. And both Congress and the President deserve credit \nfor doing so. However, a balanced budget does not come without some \npain--some consequences. For instance, the Medicare Program will \nrealize cuts of approximately $115 billion over the next 5 years. We \nwill be asking our Nation's seniors to share in the sacrifice along \nwith the rest of the country.\n  Congress cannot, in good conscience, ask the Medicare Program and its \nbeneficiaries to accept cuts unless we also work hard to eradicate \nfraud and abuse. Passage of the Kennedy-Kassebaum legislation last year \nwas a step in the right direction. But the cheats and swindlers are \nclever at gaming the system. It is a sad fact that there will always be \ngreedy people looking to take advantage of our Nation's seniors. So it \nis imperative that Congress be equally vigilant by cracking down on \nfraud wherever possible. Passage of my bill will continue the process \nand send this signal to the con artists and thieves: ``Your days are \nnumbered.''\n\n  My legislation is crafted to build on State successes. For instance, \none of the most crucial provisions in my bill, modeled after an \nextremely successful Florida Medicaid antifraud program, requires \nproviders of durable medical equipment, home health, and transportation \nservices to post a $50,000 surety bond to participate in the Medicare \nProgram.\n  While a $50,000 bond is relatively inexpensive to post for scrupulous \ncontractors, at the cost of between $500 and $1,500, the requirement \nhas achieved tremendous results in my State. Since implementation of \nthe surety bond requirement, the fly-by-night providers have scattered \nlike so many roaches when the lights are turned on.\n  Durable medical equipment suppliers have dropped by 62 percent, from \n4,146 to 1,565; home health agencies have decreased by 41 percent, from \n738 to 441; providers of transportation services have disenrolled from \nthe State's Medicaid Programs in droves--from 1,759 to 742, a drop of \n58 percent. Fewer providers bilking the State's Medicaid Program is \nprojected to save over $192 million over the next 2 years in Florida.\n  Two years ago I spent a day working in the U.S. attorney's Office in \nsouth Florida. I realized then that it was easier to get a provider \nnumber under Medicare than a personal VISA; easier to get a blank check \npaid for by the Treasury than a VISA or MasterCard.\n  This bill requires individuals to provide their social security \nnumber [SSN] and employer identification number [EIN] to get a Medicare \nprovider number. This will make it more difficult for swindlers to \nenter the program. This bill has several other provisions which are \ncritical to stemming rampant fraud in the Medicare Program:\n  My bill would enable State fraud control units, often the first line \nin the\n\n[[Page S5456]]\n\nfight against health care fraud, to investigate and prosecute fraud in \nFederal health care programs.\n  It would also prevent providers from discharging Medicare debt by \ndeclaring bankruptcy. The bill would also preclude Medicare swindlers \nfrom transferring their business to a family member in order to \ncircumvent exclusion from the Medicare Program.\n  This legislation enacts a broad-based Federal statute aimed at \nsuppressing Medicare fraud. It enhances the arsenal of weapons to \ncombat fraud and prescribes stiff penalties against those convicted of \nfraud.\n  At the signing of the Medicare bill in Missouri 30 years ago, \nPresident Johnson said that Medicare had been planted with ``the seed \nof compassion and duty which have today flowered into care for the sick \nand serenity for the fearful.'' Medicare has lived up to its promise. \nBut fraud is threatening to compromise the integrity of the system. We \nhave the prescriptions to combat fraud. Now is the time to employ them \nif we want to save the integrity of Medicare.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON:\n  S. 866. A bill to amend title 29, United States Code, to provide that \ncertain voluntary disclosures of violations of Federal law made as a \nresult of a voluntary environmental audit shall not be subject to \ndiscovery or admitted into evidence during a judicial or administrative \nproceeding, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              The Environmental Protection Partnership Act\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the title of the bill I send to the \ndesk is the Environmental Protection Partnership Act of 1997. By \nintroducing this bill, I am suggesting that the Federal Government take \na cue from the States regarding environmental protection. Many State \ngovernments have passed laws that allow for voluntary audits of \nenvironmental compliance. These laws encourage a company to conduct an \naudit of its compliance with environmental laws. By conducting the \naudit, the company determines whether it is in compliance with all \nenvironmental laws. If it is not, these state laws allow the company, \nwithout penalty, to correct any violations it finds so it will come \ninto compliance.\n  What my bill does is let the Federal Government do the same thing. It \nlets the Federal Government say to companies all over America, if you \nwant to do a voluntary audit for environmental compliance, we are going \nto let you do that. We will encourage you but not force you to do it. \nAnd we are not going to come in and threaten you with the hammer of the \nEPA if you, in fact, move swiftly to come into compliance when you find \nthat you are not in compliance.\n  We think this is the most effective way to clean up the air and \nwater. Our air and water are invaluable natural resources. They are \ncleaner than they have been in 25 years, and we want to keep improving \nour efforts to guarantee their protection. This bill will ensure that, \nin the same fashion as many States have done. It does not preempt State \nlaw. If State laws are on the books, then the State laws prevail. But \nthis offers companies all over our country the ability to comply with \nFederal standards in a voluntary way, to critically assess their \ncompliance and not be penalized if they then take action to immediately \ncome into compliance.\n  So I am asking that we take up this bill very quickly in committee. I \nthink through this bill we can do a lot of good for America.\n  Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that will ensure that we \ncontinue to increase the protection of our environment in the United \nStates. My bill, the Environmental Protection Partnership Act of 1997, \nprovides incentives for companies to assess their own environmental \ncompliance. Rather than playing a waiting game for EPA to find \nenvironmental violations, companies will find--and stop--violations. \nMany more violations will be corrected, and many others will be \nprevented.\n  Under my bill, if a company voluntarily completes an environmental \naudit--a thorough review of its compliance with environmental laws--the \naudit report may not be used against the company in court. The report \ncan be used in court, however, if the company found violations and did \nnot promptly make efforts to comply. By extending this privilege, a \ncompany that looks for, finds, and remedies problems will continue this \ngood conduct, and protect the environment.\n  In addition, if a company does an audit, and promptly corrects any \nviolations, the company may choose to disclose the violation to EPA. If \nthe company does disclose the violation, the company will not be \npenalized for the violations. By ensuring companies that they will not \nbe dragged into court for being honest, the bill encourages companies \nto find and fix violations and report them to EPA.\n  This does not mean that companies that pollute go scot-free. Under \nthis bill, there is no protection for: willful and intentional \nviolators; companies that do not promptly cure violations; companies \nasserting the law fraudulently; or companies trying to evade an \nimminent or ongoing investigation. Further, the bill does not protect \ncompanies that have policies that permit ongoing patterns of violations \nof environmental laws. And where a violation results in a continuing \nadverse public health or environmental effect, a company may not use \nthe protections of this law.\n  Nor does this bill mean that EPA loses any authority to find \nviolations and punish companies for polluting. EPA retains all its \npresent authority.\n  At the same time that EPA retains full authority to enforce \nenvironmental laws, I propose to engage every company voluntarily in \nenvironmental protection by creating the incentive for those companies \nto find and cure their own violations. This frees EPA to target its \nenforcement dollars on the bad actors--the companies that intentionally \npollute our water and air.\n  Twenty-one States have already passed audit laws. These States \nunderstand that to truly protect the environment, everyone must \nparticipate. These States have made it possible for companies to want \nto be good actors and play an active role in environmental protection. \nTexas has an audit law. Hundreds of companies have carried out a \nvoluntary environmental audit, and after only 18 months, companies had \nalready reported and corrected 50 violations. Other States report \nsimilar success.\n  My bill does not mandate that States adopt these policies. It does \nnot mandate that States amend their laws. Quite the opposite. My bill \nspecifically does not preempt State law. Therefore, a State may choose \nnot to enact an audit law, but a company in that State can still \nconduct a voluntary audit with respect to Federal environmental law. \nFurther, in a State with an audit law, a company will be able to \nthoroughly review its entire State and Federal compliance, and remedy \nany violations it may find. Therefore, my bill supports--but does not \nsupplant--State efforts by encouraging companies to audit their \ncompliance with Federal environmental laws as well.\n  We have made great strides in cleaning up our environment over the \npast 30 years. To continue this trend, we need to be preventing \npollution, rather than always reacting to environmental problems after \nthey occur. Even EPA agrees that to achieve this, companies need to \nplay an active role in environmental protection. In a recent policy \nStatement, EPA pointed out that because Government resources are \nlimited, maximum compliance cannot be achieved without active efforts \nby the regulated community to police themselves. The Environmental \nProtection Partnership Act will make companies active partners with EPA \nin assuring compliance with environmental laws.\n  I am very pleased to be working with the majority leader on this \nlegislation and I hope Members on both sides of the aisle will join me \nin this effort to increase environmental protection.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Reid, Mr. Bryan \n        and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 868. A bill to amend the Social Security Act to prohibit persons \nfrom charging for services or products that the Social Security \nAdministration and Department of Health and Human Services provide \nwithout charge; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              the Social Security Consumer Protections Act\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President. Today, I am introducing, on behalf of \nmyself,\n\n[[Page S5457]]\n\nSenators Hutchinson, Reid, Bryan, and Rockefeller, the Social Security \nConsumer Protection Act. This is a simple, commonsense legislation that \nwill arm consumers with the information they need to protect themselves \nfrom a growing type of consumer scam.\n  Several years ago Congress took an important step toward stamping out \nfrauds against older Americans. We passed a law making it illegal for \ncompanies to prey upon senior citizens and others by misrepresenting an \naffiliation with Social Security or Medicare. After some delay, the \nSocial Security inspector general has begun to enforce this important \nnew consumer protection law. However, we are finding that many scam \nartists are squirming through a loophole in the law that allows them to \ncharge unwitting consumers for services that are available free of \ncharge from Social Security or Medicare.\n  A recent investigation by my staff found that unsuspecting \nconsumers--from new parents to senior citizens--are falling prey to con \nartists charging them for services that are available free of charge \nfrom the Social Security Administration. Many of the schemes involve \nuse of materials and names which mislead consumers into believing that \nthe scam artists are affiliated with the federal government.\n  Companies operating under official sounding names like Federal \nDocument Services, Federal Record Service Corp., National Records \nService, and U.S. Document Services are mailing information to \nthousands of unsuspecting Americans, including many Iowans. These \ncompanies are scaring people into remitting a fee to receive basic \nSocial Security benefits and eligibility information such as a new \nSocial Security number and card for a baby and changing names upon \nmarriage or divorce.\n  We began to look into this problem based on a number of complaints \nfrom Iowans who had received these deceptive mailings. One example was \nsent to me by Deb Conlee of Fort Dodge. She received a mailing from a \ncompany called Document Service. The official looking letter starts: \n``Read Carefully: Important Facts about your Social Security Card. The \nresponse envelope is stamped ``SSA-7701'' giving the impression that it \nis connected with the Social Security Administration. The solicitation \ngoes on to say that she is required to provide Social Security with any \nname change associated with her recent marriage and get a new Social \nSecurity card. It then urges her to send them $14.75 to do this. It \nsays, ``We urge you to do this immediately to help avoid possible \nproblems where your Social Security benefits or joint income taxes \nmight be questioned.''\n  Ms. Conlee paid $60 to this company and was furious when she learned \nthat she could have gotten the same services free of charge from Social \nSecurity.\n  Last year I asked Social Security Commissioner Shirley Chater to \ninvestigate the complaints of Iowans and those of consumers like her. \nShe responded that the services provided by Document Service ``are \ncompletely unnecessary. Not only do they fail to produce any savings of \ntime or effort for the customer, they also tend to delay issuance of \nthe new Social Security card.'' While it is now illegal for a company \nto imply any direct connection with Social Security or Medicare in \nmailings, it is not illegal to charge for the very same services that \nare available at no cost from the government.\n  So while Congress has acted to try and stop scam artists from trying \nto fool people into thinking their business is somehow affiliated with \nSocial Security, Medicare, or some other government agency, many are \nskirting around the edges of this law and are conning consumers into \npaying for services that they can get free of charge. Nowhere in any of \nthe mailings from these outfits that I have reviewed is there any \nmention that the services they offer are in fact available to consumers \nat no cost from the government.\n  The Social Security Consumer Protection Act would require that any \nsuch solicitation prominently display the following consumer alert: \n``IMPORTANT PUBLIC DISCLOSURE: The product or service described here \nand assistance to obtain the product or service is available free of \ncharge from the Social Security Administration or the Department of \nHealth and Human Services.'' Armed with this information, consumers \nwould be able to make informed decisions about where to obtain the \nservice they need or want. Companies found to be in violation of this \nsimple requirement would face fines.\n  Our legislation would not stop the provision of services by private \ncompanies. Rather, it would simply make sure that consumers are fully \ninformed, so that they can make an informed choice about where and how \nthey prefer to receive certain services.\n  These scams must be put to an end. A simple change in the law would \ngo a long way toward stopping them. The bill we are introducing today \nwould make such a change without imposing an undue burden on legitimate \nbusinesses or restricting consumer freedom of choice.\n  Mr. President, this legislation has been endorsed by the National \nCommittee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. The National \nCommittee is an effective and aggressive advocate of the rights of \nolder Americans. I am pleased to have their endorsement and ask \nunanimous consent to include a copy of their letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  I urge my colleagues to review this bill and to work with us to \nensure its prompt approval.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    National Committee to Preserve\n\n\n                                 Social Security and Medicare,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 8, 1997.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: On behalf of the 5.5 million members \n     and supporters of the National Committee to Preserve Social \n     Security and Medicare, I am pleased to offer our endorsement \n     of your legislation, the Social Security Consumer Protection \n     Act.\n       Your legislation would require that any business which \n     solicits direct payment for services which the Social \n     Security Administration provides free of charge must include \n     a clear and prominent written disclaimer. Your bill would \n     also impose new civil and criminal penalties for failure to \n     comply with its provisions. A growing number of businesses \n     have emerged across the country which, for a direct fee, \n     assist individuals who seek to change their names, social \n     security numbers, or obtain other information relative to \n     their work record. Unfortunately, some of these enterprises \n     do not adequately inform would be consumers that they are not \n     affiliated with the federal government, or that such services \n     are provided free of charge by the government. As a \n     consequence, some individuals may be led to believe that they \n     must pay the fee to obtain these services.\n       We appreciate your leadership on this important matter. \n     People should not be coerced to pay twice for services which \n     are already provided with their hard earned tax dollars.\n           Sincerely,\n                                      Martha A McSteen, President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Torricelli, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Wellstone, \n        Mr. Harkin, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mr. Levin, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Inouye, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n        Robb, Mr. Moynihan, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Reid, Mr. \n        Leahy, Mr. Bryan, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Glenn, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. \n        Reed, Mr. D'Amato, and Mr. Cleland):\n\n  S. 869. A bill to prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of \nsexual orientation; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n             The Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here today to \nintroduce the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 1997 [ENDA]. As many \nof you recall, my colleagues and I introduced similar legislation in \nthe last Congress. While we were unable to pass ENDA in the last \nCongress, I was encouraged that ENDA was only narrowly defeated, by a \nvote of 50 to 49. It is my hope that in the 105th Congress, we can \nbridge that narrow gap and pass this legislation. By extending to \nsexual orientation the same Federal employment discrimination \nprotections established for race, religion, gender, national origin, \nage, and disability, this legislation will further ensure that \nprincipals of equality and opportunity apply to all Americans.\n\n[[Page S5458]]\n\n  I believe that all Americans deserve to be judged at work based on \ntheir ability to do their jobs and not their sexual orientation. People \nwho work hard and perform well should not be kept from leading \nproductive and responsible lives because of an irrational, non-work-\nrelated prejudice. Unfortunately, many responsible and productive \nmembers of our society face discrimination in their workplaces based on \nnothing more than their sexual orientation. Because this insidious \ndiscrimination persists, there is a need for Congress to pass the \nEmployment Non-Discrimination Act.\n  Mr. President, the Senate's vote last Congress is no doubt reflective \nof the American people's support of the concept behind ENDA. In a \nrecent poll, 83 percent of the respondents support the passage of a law \nextending civil rights and preventing job discrimination against gays \nand lesbians. While ENDA will achieve this goal of equal rights for job \nopportunities, it does so by not creating any special rights for gays \nand lesbians. Specifically, this legislation prohibits preferential \ntreatment based on sexual orientation. In addition, ENDA does not \nrequire an employer to justify a neutral practice that may have a \nstatistically disparate impact based on sexual orientation, nor provide \nbenefits for the same-sex partner of an employee. Rather, it simply \nprotects a right that should belong to every American, the right to be \nfree from discrimination at work because of personal characteristics \nunrelated to successful performance on the job.\n  Since ENDA's narrow defeat last September, we have taken a fresh look \nat this important legislation in an attempt to allay some of the \nconcerns raised by ENDA's detractors in the last Congress. I am pleased \nto announce that we have made several significant improvements in the \nbill.\n  Our first change is intended to address the concern raised that \nemployees' privacy rights would be violated if the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission [EEOC] required employers to provide the \nGovernment with data on the sexual orientation of their employees. As a \nresult, the bill now prohibits the EEOC from collecting such statistics \nand from compelling employers to do so. Opponents of the previous \nlegislation were also concerned that the EEOC would require employers \nwho have violated ENDA to hire gay and lesbian employees as part of its \nenforcement scheme. To alleviate that possibility, the new legislation \nprecludes the EEOC from entering into a consent decree that includes \nquotas, or gives preferential treatment based on sexual orientation. In \naddition, we have narrowed the language of the previous bill so that \nonly actual paid employees are protected and we have attempted to \nensure that exempted religious organizations from coverage.\n\n  In today's global economy, our Nation must take full advantage of \nevery resource that is at our disposal if we want U.S. companies to \nmaintain their competitive advantage over their international \ncompetitors. The fact that a majority of Fortune 500 companies have \nincorporated many of ENDA's policies, clearly indicates the acceptance \nof these changes within the workplace. In fact, it can be stated that \nwithout these American companies, on their own, undertaking these \nactions to insure adequate working protections for all of their \nemployees they would be less competitive and may even be unable to \nmaintain their existence within this fiercely competitive international \nenvironment.\n  Mr. President, some concern has been raised by my colleagues that \npassing ENDA will create a new wave of litigation. I am proud to say \nthat my home State of Vermont is one of several States and localities \nthat have enacted a sexual orientation anti-discrimination law, and it \nis no surprise, to me, that the sky has not fallen. Since the enactment \nof Vermont's law in 1991 the Vermont Attorney General has initiated \nonly 17 investigations of alleged sexual orientation discrimination. \nSeven are pending at this time. Five have been closed with \ndeterminations that unlawful discrimination cannot be proven to have \noccurred. Four have been closed for miscellaneous administrative \nreasons, unrelated to the merits of the charge, and one resulted in a \nsettlement. In addition, I am not aware of a single complaint from \nVermont employers about the enforcement of the State law. However, I do \nknow that thousands of Vermonters no longer need to live and work in \nthe shadows. The facts bear out my belief that the effect experienced \nin Vermont on litigation has been experienced in other States and the \nDistrict of Columbia that have implemented policies similar to the one \nof my home State of Vermont.\n  As I have stated before, success at work should be directly related \nto one's ability to do the job, period. The passage of ENDA would be a \nsignificant step toward ensuring the ability of all people, be they \ngay, lesbian, or heterosexual, to be fairly judged on their work \nproduct, not on an unrelated personal characteristic. I urge all my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 869\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am delighted to join with Senators \nJeffords, Kennedy, and over 30 of our colleagues as an original \ncosponsor of this important legislation, the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act of 1997. By guaranteeing that American workers \ncannot lose their jobs simply because of their actual or perceived \nsexual orientation, this bill would extend the bedrock American values \nof fairness and equality to a group of our citizens who too often have \nbeen denied the benefit of those most basic values.\n  Our Nation's foundational document, the Declaration of Independence, \nexpressed a vision of our country as one premised upon the essential \nequality of all people and upon the recognition that our Creator \nendowed all of us with the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the \npursuit of happiness. Two hundred and twenty years ago, when that \ndocument was drafted, our laws fell far short of implementing the \ndeclaration's ideal. But since that time, we have come ever closer, \nextending by law to more and more of our citizens--to African-\nAmericans, to women, to disabled Americans, to religious minorities, \nand to others--a legally enforceable guarantee that, with respect to \ntheir ability to earn a living at least, they will be treated on their \nmerits and not on characteristics unrelated to their ability to do \ntheir jobs.\n  It is time to extend that guarantee to gay men and lesbians, who too \noften have been subject to incidents of discrimination and denied the \nmost basic of rights: the right to obtain and maintain a job. A \ncollection of nearly two dozen studies shows that as many as 46 percent \nof gay and lesbian workers have experienced significant discrimination \nin the workplace. The fear in which these workers live was clear from a \nsurvey of 1,400 gay men and lesbians in Philadelphia. Seventy-six \npercent of the men and 81 percent of the women told those conducting \nthe survey that they hide their orientation at work out of concern for \ntheir job security. This result, although unfortunate, is not \nsurprising in light of a University of Maryland study that found gay \nmen's income to be 11 to 27 percent lower than that of heterosexual \nmen, thanks to the effects of discrimination.\n  The toll this discrimination takes extends far beyond its effect on \nthose individuals who must live in fear and without full employment \nopportunities. It also takes an unacceptable toll on America's \ndefinition of itself as a land of equality and opportunity, as a place \nwhere we judge each other on our merits, and as a country that teaches \nits children that anyone can succeed here as long as they are willing \nto do their job and work hard.\n  This bill provides for equality and fairness--that and no more. It \nsays only what we already have said for women, for people of color, and \nfor others: that you are entitled to have your ability to earn a living \ndepend only on your ability to do the job and nothing else. In fact, \nthe bill would even do somewhat less than it does for women and people \nof color, because it would not give gay men and women all of the \nprotections we currently provide to other groups protected under our \ncivil rights laws.\n  Mr. President, this bill would bring our Nation one large step closer \nto realizing the vision that Thomas Jefferson so eloquently expressed \n220 years ago when he wrote that all of us have a right to life, \nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin supporting this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 870. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nfacilitate the development, approval, and use of medical devices to \nmaintain and improve the public health and quality of life of \nindividuals, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources.\n\n\n   THE MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY, PUBLIC HEALTH, AND INNOVATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the legislation that I am introducing \ntoday, the Medical Technology, Public Health and Innovation Act of \n1997, takes a significant step toward improving the effectiveness, \ntimeliness, and predictability of the FDA review process for medical \ndevices.\n  It is important that we improve the system for device approval in \norder to provide access to optimal technology to American consumers. We \nneed to do this in order to promote the public health. We must also \nmaintain protections for consumers, which are provided by the FDA's \noversight of device manufacturing, development, and marketing. This \nlegislation maintains those protections, while allowing for new \nefficiencies within the FDA.\n  Over the past 2 years, I have met with numerous representatives of \nMinnesota's medical device industry, patient advocates, clinicians, and \nofficials from the FDA, and have concluded that there are indeed steps \nthat Congress should take to make the regulatory process for medical \ndevices more efficient. Minnesotans want the FDA not only to protect \npublic health, but also to promote public health. They want to know not \nonly that new technologies will be safe, but that they will be \navailable to them in a timely manner. Many of Minnesota's medical \ndevice manufacturers, researchers, clinicians, and patients in need of \nnew and improved health care technology have become increasingly \nconcerned about the regulatory environment at the FDA. While there have \nbeen some improvements in the device review process, there is still a \nneed to increase communication between the FDA and industry; to \ndecrease review times; and to have consistency in the review process.\n  These needs are highlighted by the following example. A plant \noperated by a Minnesota-based device company was developing a new \ntreatment for aortic aneurysms, which would require less invasive \nmeasures than are currently used. The company developed a protocol for \ntesting its product, submitted the protocol to the FDA and was told by \nthe reviewer that the protocol was invalid. The reviewer suggested a \ndifferent protocol and the company followed it. Upon completion of the \nclinical trial, the company submitted the required data to the FDA. The \noriginal reviewer was on an extended leave of absence, so the data went \nto a different reviewer. The new reviewer deemed the protocol that was \nused to be invalid, and requested a new clinical trial, which basically \nfollowed the protocol that had been rejected by the first reviewer. The \ncompany was forced to do a new trial, which resulted in significant \ndelays in getting this important product to market for patient use. I \nam certain that this is but one of many examples of inconsistently \napplied processes that delay the release of life-saving technology \nto the consumer.\n\n  The technologies that the FDA regulates are changing rapidly. We \ncannot afford a regulatory system that is ill-equipped to speed these \nadvances. As a result, both Congress and the Administration are \nreexamining the paradigms that have governed the FDA. Our challenge \nwill be to define FDA's mission and scope of responsibility, as well as \nto give guidance on an appropriate balance between the risks and \nrewards of streamlining all aspects of how FDA does its job--including \nthe approval process for breakthrough products.\n  The legislation that I am introducing would begin to address these \nissues in three important ways:\n  First, it would enable the FDA to adopt nationally and \ninternationally recognized performance standards to improve the \ntransparency and effectiveness of the device review process.\n\n[[Page S5461]]\n\n Resource constraints and the time-consuming rulemaking process have \nprecluded FDA promulgation of performance standards in the past. This \nlegislation would allow the FDA, when appropriate, to simply adopt \nconsensus standards that are already being used by most of the world \nand use those standards to assist in determining the safety and \neffectiveness of class III medical devices. The FDA could require \nadditional data from a manufacturer relevant to an aspect of a device \ncovered by an adopted performance standard if necessary to protect \npatient safety. Currently, the lack of clear performance standards for \nclass III medical devices is a barrier to the improvement of the \nquality and timeliness of the premarket approval process.\n  Second, it would improve communication between the industry and the \nFDA and the predictability of the review process. I believe that these \ntwo factors are extremely important. The bill includes provisions for \nmeetings between the applicant and the FDA to ensure that applicants \nare promptly informed of any deficiencies in their application, that \nquestions that can be answered easily would be addressed right away, \nand that applicants would be well informed about the status of their \napplication. I believe that improving communication between the FDA and \nindustry would result in greater compliance with regulations and that \nthis will ultimately benefit consumers and patients.\n  Third, the legislation would help the FDA focus its resources more \nappropriately. PMA supplements or 510(k)'s that relate only to changes \nthat can be shown to not adversely affect the safety or effectiveness \nof the device would not require premarket approval or notification. \nManufacturers would instead make information and data supporting the \nchange part of the master record at the FDA. In addition the FDA would \nbe able to exempt from premarket notification requirements those class \nII devices for which such requirements are unnecessary to ensure the \npublic health without first having to go through the time consuming and \nbureaucratic process of reclassifying them to class I. The FDA would \nalso have the option of relying on postmarket controls classifying \ndevices. Enabling the FDA to focus its attention where the real risks \nare will not only streamline the approval process but also benefit \nconsumers.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Jeffords, the chairman of the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee, and my other colleagues on the \nCommittee on the concepts included in my proposal. I will work \nvigorously to ensure that they are included in FDA legislation \nconsidered by the Senate this year. I look forward to continuing to \nwork on these issues with Minnesotans. Clearly, there are actions that \nCongress can take to improve the FDA without sacrificing the assurance \nof safety that all Americans depend on.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 870\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, \n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE AND REFERENCE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Medical \n     Technology, Public Health, and Innovation Act of 1997''.\n       (b) Reference.--Whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal \n     is expressed in terms of an amendment to, or a repeal of, a \n     section or other provision, the reference shall be considered \n     to be made to a section or other provisions of the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321 et seq.)\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; MISSIONS STATEMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) While the United States appropriately puts a top \n     priority on the regulation of medical technologies to ensure \n     the safety and efficacy of medical technologies that are \n     introduced into the marketplace, the administration of such \n     regulatory effort is causing the United States to lose its \n     leadership role in producing innovative, top-quality medical \n     devices.\n       (2) One of the key components of the medical device \n     regulatory process that contributes to the United States \n     losing its leadership role in medical device development is \n     the inordinate amount of time it takes for medical \n     technologies to be reviewed by the Food and Drug \n     Administration.\n       (3) The most important result of the United States losing \n     its leadership role is that patients in the United States do \n     not have access to new medical technology in a timely manner.\n       (4) Delayed patient access to new medical technology \n     results in lost opportunities to save lives, to reduce \n     hospitalization and recovery time, and to improve the quality \n     of life of patients.\n       (5) The economic benefits of the United States medical \n     device industry, which is composed principally of smaller \n     companies, has provided through growth in jobs and global \n     trade are threatened by the slow and unpredictable regulatory \n     process at the Food and Drug Administration.\n       (6) The pace and predictability of the medical device \n     regulatory process are in part responsible for the increasing \n     tendency of United States medical device companies to shift \n     research, product development, and manufacturing offshore, at \n     the expense of American jobs, patients, and leading edge \n     clinical research.\n       (b) Mission Statement.--This legislation seeks to improve \n     the timeliness, effectiveness, and predictability of the \n     medical device approval process for the benefit of United \n     States patients and the United States economy by--\n       (1) providing for the use of nationally and internationally \n     recognized performance standards to assist the Food and Drug \n     Administration in determining the safety and effectiveness of \n     medical devices;\n       (2) facilitating communication between medical device \n     companies and the Food and Drug Administration;\n       (3) targeting the use of Food and Drug Administration \n     resources on medical devices that are likely to have serious \n     adverse health consequences; and\n       (4) requiring the Food and Drug Administration to determine \n     the least costly, most efficient approach to reasonably \n     assuring the safety and effectiveness of devices.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish the Oklahoma City National Memorial as a \nunit of the National Park System; to designate the Oklahoma City \nMemorial Trust, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n              oklahoma city national memorial act of 1997\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith Senator Inhofe to establish the Oklahoma City National Memorial \nand create the Oklahoma City Memorial Trust. The memorial will \ncommemorate the national tragedy ingrained in all of our minds that \noccurred in downtown Oklahoma City at 9:02 a.m. on April 19, 1995, in \nwhich 168 Americans lost their lives and countless thousands more lost \nfamily members and friends.\n  The Oklahoma City National Memorial, to be established as a unit of \nthe National Park Service, will serve as a monument to those whose \nlives were taken and others will bear the physical and mental scars for \nthe rest of their days. It will stand as a testament to the hope, \ngenerosity, and courage shown by Oklahomans and fellow Americans across \nthe country following the Oklahoma City bombing. This will be a place \nof remembrance, peace, spirituality, comfort, and learning.

The Memorial \nTrust, comprised of nine unpaid trustees, will administer the \noperation, maintenance, management, and interpretation of the memorial.\n  While the thousands of family members and friends of those killed in \nthe bombing will forever bear scars of having their loved ones taken \naway, the Oklahoma City National Memorial will revere the memory of \nthose lost and venerate the bonds that drew us all closer together as a \nresult.\n  I welcome all Members to cosponsor this important piece of \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT:\n  S. 873. A bill to amend the prohibition of title 18, United States \nCode, against financial transactions with state sponsors of \ninternational terrorism; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n  the prohibition on financial transactions with countries supporting \n                         terrorism act of 1997\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I would like to introduce The \nProhibition on Financial Transactions with Countries Supporting \nTerrorism Act of 1997. This legislation will further isolate state \nsponsors of international terrorism from the community of responsible \nnations. By prohibiting financial transactions between U.S. persons and \nsuch criminal regimes, this bill will also reduce the financial \nresources available to terrorist states.\n  Unfortunately, this is the second time the Senate has had to consider \nlegislation to prohibit financial transactions with state sponsors of \nterrorism. The Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, passed \nby Congress and signed into law by the President on April 24, 1996, \ncontained a similar provision--section 321--which prohibited financial \ntransactions with state sponsors of terrorism. Unfortunately, the \nmanner in which the State Department implemented section 321 \neffectively exempted at least two terrorist States, Sudan and Syria, \nfrom the ban on financial transactions with United States citizens.\n  The Clinton administration seemingly misinterpreted the clear \nlanguage of section 321 which states that:\n\n     . . . whoever, being a United States person, knowing or \n     having reasonable cause to know that a country is designated \n     . . . as a country supporting international terrorism, \n     engages in a financial transaction with the government of \n     that country, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned for \n     not more than 10 years, or both.\n\n  Somehow, our Government read such plain language to permit--not \nprohibit--almost all financial transactions with terrorist states. The \nonly transactions the lawyers down at Foggy Bottom saw fit to prohibit \nwere financial transactions which might further terrorism within the \nUnited States. The bureaucrats at the State Department evidently feel \nthat transactions which further terrorism against citizens of foreign \ncountries or Americans abroad--such as Pan Am flight 103--should not be \ntargeted by this law.\n  Mr. President, the Congress of the United States has worked \nextensively in a bipartisan manner to provide the legislative tools \nneeded to defend America and our allies against the rising threat of \ninternational terrorism, and I am sorry that the Senate must now \nrevisit this antiterrorism legislation to correct the misguided efforts \nof this administration to confront and isolate terrorist-supporting \nnations in an effective manner.\n  We no longer live in a cold war world where the threats to our \nnational security are easily identifiable. The fluid and complex \ninternational environment we face today demands the highest national \nsecurity vigilance, the kind of vigilance that appears to be lacking in \nthe Clinton administration. The administration's abysmal performance in \nenforcing United States laws against the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction by China is now mirrored by the administration's \nevisceration of Congress' antiterrorism sanctions. This administration \nfinds no inconsistency between President Clinton's claim in an August \n1996 speech at George Washington University that America ``cannot do \nbusiness with * * * terrorists who kill * * * innocent civilians,'' and \nthe State Department issuing regulations for the Anti-terrorism Act \nthat same month that permit most business transactions with terrorist \nstates to continue.\n  Mr. President, terrorism is no longer a far away phenomenon that \nAmerican only risk when traveling abroad. Terrorist violence that \nprimarily targeted U.S. citizens overseas is now finding its way to \nAmerican shores, and the most stringent U.S. antiterrorism policy will \nbe essential to protect our citizens. State sponsors of terrorism \npossess a hatred of global dimensions, and America is one of their \nprimary targets. Our policies must reflect this understanding.\n  Mr. President, in the Africa Subcommittee, I have followed closely \nthe global efforts of one particular country on the list of terrorist \nnations. Since democracy was overthrown by a radical Islamic military \ncoup in 1989, Sudan has quickly joined Iran as the worst of the world's \nstate sponsors of terrorism. Sudan's Government harbors elements of the \nmost violent terrorist organizations in the world: Jihad, the Armed \nIslamic Group, Hamas, Abu Nidal, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah, \nand the Islamic Group all run terrorist training camps in Sudan.\n  Those groups are responsible for hundreds of terrorist attacks around \nthe world that have killed thousands of innocent people. Abu Nidal \nalone has been responsible for 90 terrorist attacks in 20 countries \nwhich have killed or injured almost 900 people. Jihad is responsible \nfor the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Jihad's \nleader, Sheikh Omar abdel Rahman, is the ideological ringleader of the \nterrorists that attacked the World Trade Center and plotted to bomb the \nUnited Nations in New York. Another terrorist organization, the Islamic \nGroup, regularly targets westerners in Egypt for attack and claims \nresponsibility for the failed assassination attempt on Egyptian \nPresident Hosni Mubarak during his visit to Ethiopia in 1995. In \naddition to harboring such terrorist organizations, Sudan has also \ngiven refuge to some of the\n\n[[Page S5464]]\n\nmost notorious individual terrorists in the world, including Imad \nMoughniyeh who is believed to be responsible for the 1983 bombing of \nthe United States Marine barracks in Beirut which killed 241 American \nsoldiers.\n  Sudan is not simply a favorite training camp for terrorists, Mr. \nPresident. The Sudanese Government actively supports this terrorist \nactivity. For instance, Sudan reportedly provided the weapons and \ntravel documentation for the assassins who attacked President Mubarak \nduring his Ethiopia visit. Two Sudanese diplomats at the United Nations \nin New York conspired to help Jihad terrorists gain access to the U.N. \ncomplex in order to bomb the building.\n  The conspiracy to bomb the United Nations was just one in a series of \nterrorist plots to bomb numerous locations around New York, including \nthe Lincoln and Holland Tunnels, the George Washington Bridge, and \nvarious U.S. military installations. Five of the twelve defendants \nconvicted in this series of terrorist plots were Sudanese nationals. \nThankfully, law enforcement authorities thwarted most of these \ntragedies before they occurred, but the earlier terrorist attack \nagainst the World Trade Center was carried out by the same broader \nterrorism network in New York and killed six people. Those who bombed \nthe World Trade Center only expressed regret that the twin towers were \nnot toppled as they had planned, a catastrophe that in an instant could \nhave resulted in more American casualties than the entire Vietnam war.\n  Sudan's involvement in the conspiracy to wage an urban war of \nterrorism in New York makes it patently clear why our Government has \njustifiably designated some nations as state sponsors of terrorism and \nhas imposed upon them the most severe penalties and sanctions provided \nby United States law. I am grateful that America has been relatively \nisolated from most of the world's terrorist violence, but just as \nterrorists have targeted Americans abroad in the past, they are now \ntargeting Americans here at home. International terrorism is one of the \ngreat threats to our national security, but unfortunately yet another \nexample of a national security threat this administration is failing to \nforcefully address. By cutting off the flow of financial resources to \nthese rogue regimes, it will become more difficult for them to seed the \nglobe with their acts of violent cowardice.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today will \neffectively prohibit financial transactions with state sponsors of \nterrorism--regardless of whether the terrorist attack occurs within the \nUnited States or abroad. This prohibition is one step in the fight \nagainst international terrorism the administration is evidently \nunwilling to take.\n  An analysis of Sudan's involvement in international terrorism gives \nus an idea of the global designs of terrorist states. Business as usual \nshould not proceed with such regimes, and President Clinton should not \nhave to be coaxed into aggressively enforcing U.S. antiterrorism law to \nisolate these countries. This legislation will diminish the financial \nresources available to terrorist states for their campaign of violence \nand hatred, and I urge the Senate's prompt consideration and passage of \nthis bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FAIRCLOTH (for himself and Mr. Shelby):\n  S. 874. A bill to amend title 31, United States Code, to provide for \nan exemption to the requirement that all Federal payments be made by \nelectronic funds transfer; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                electronic benefits transfer legislation\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \ntoday that would modify the mandatory EBT legislation that was passed \nin 1996.\n  Mr. President, in 1996, the Congress amended the Federal Financial \nManagement Act of 1994--as part of the Omnibus Appropriations Act of \n1996, Public Law 104-134--to require that all Federal payments after \nJanuary 1, 1999, be made by electronic funds transfer.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would provide an exemption \nfrom that requirement for Social Security and veterans benefits, except \nthat a recipient may send written notification to the agency head \nauthorizing that such payments be made electronically. Thus, the \nlegislation makes it optional for the vast majority of Federal \nbeneficiaries, particularly retirees.\n  This would affect nearly 20 million Social Security recipients who \nstill receive their check through the mail. Also, nearly 40 percent of \nveterans benefits are still by mail.\n  Mr. President, I have found that many retirees are unaware of this \nrequirement, and do not desire to have their checks electronically \ndeposited.\n  Mr. President, these are not welfare checks. The Government should \nnot force retirees to accept this mandate.\n  In fact, AARP testified before the House Government Reform and \nOversight Committee last year, stating that ``AARP believes that direct \ndeposit of federal payments should remain optional for current payment \nrecipients.'' Further, AARP has found that Social Security recipients \nreceiving checks by mail were clustered in a handful of States, \nincluding my home State of North Carolina.\n  Mr. President, many people worked all of their lives for these \nbenefits. They have the right to receive them. Many people served their \ncountry for these benefits. The very notion that they will be told \nwhere their benefits are being sent is abhorrent. Further, it has even \nbeen suggested that benefits could be withheld if persons do not choose \na bank to receive a check.\n  Mr. President, this is wrong. I am not opposed to direct deposit, but \nI am opposed to it being forced on people. I would urge the Senate to \nact soon on this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, I rise today to give \nrecognition to four very important individuals involved in the \nadvancement of engineering and science relating to nuclear activities \nfor our country, and specifically within the State of Idaho. I would \nlike to commend Douglas C. Crawford, H. Peter Planchon, John I. Sackett \nand Bobby R. Seidel on their various efforts in this area which have \nwarranted top awards from the American Nuclear Society.\n  These four scientists, all employees of the Argonne National \nLaboratory-West, have made tremendous advances in terms of the science \ninvolving the safe generation of nuclear power. For example, Dr. \nDouglas Crawford was awarded the Young Member Engineering Achievement \nAward which recognizes a series of experiments on reactor fuels. Dr. \nCrawford has become a widely recognized expert in the handling, \nmanagement, and treatment of plutonium. He is also the manager of the \nEngineering Division's Materials Technology Section at Argonne-West.\n  Dr. H. Peter Planchon, who serves as an Associate Director of the \nEngineering Division, received the American Nuclear Society's Seaborg \nMedal which is awarded for outstanding long-term individual excellence \nin nuclear investigation and study. Dr. Planchon developed reactor \nmodeling and experiments which have led to the use of passive response \nto accidents in sodium-cooled reactors. His work and efforts were \ndemonstrated in a 1986 experiment in which Experimental Breeder \nReactor--II, at the time operating at full power, was exposed to \naccident conditions. The reactor safely shut itself down without \noperator intervention. Thanks to Dr. Planchon's efforts, subsequent \ntests have shown that simplified nuclear plants could be safely \ndesigned for the future.\n  Dr. John Sackett's contributions to fast reactor technology, \nresulting in new and better approaches to plant protection and safety, \nhave earned him great recognition and the honor of receiving the Walker \nCisler Medal. This medal is a special award which recognizes \noutstanding scientific or engineering research achievements in the \ndesign and development of the fast breeder reactor as applied to \nelectric power generation. Dr. Sackett's efforts truly are outstanding \nscientific achievements which have led to better plant operation. He \ncurrently serves as the Deputy Associate Laboratory Director for \nArgonne-West.\n  And finally, the American Nuclear Society's Public Communications\n\n[[Page S5466]]\n\nAward was given to Dr. Bobby Seidel for his exceptional service in \ncommunicating unbiased facts regarding nuclear power to the public, \nwhich, as you know, Mr. President, is not always an easy task. Dr. \nSeidel directs the student and faculty programs at Argonne-West and was \nthe propelling strength behind the planning and construction of the \nnuclear energy display for the Idaho Falls-Bonneville County Museum. \nThis is a particularly important exhibition of nuclear technology for \nthe people of the Idaho Falls area because so many times a hands-on \nlook at how this process works is a much more effective means of \neducation, rather than merely reading about such technology in a \npamphlet or newspaper.\n  The American Nuclear Society is a nonprofit, international agency \ncomprised of individuals who represent more the 1,600 corporations, \neducational organizations, and Government agencies. These people, most \nof whom are engineers, scientists, educators, and students, have \ncreated an astounding membership number of over 17,000. Each year, the \nsociety chooses the top contributors to the institutes of nuclear \nscience and engineering, and recognizes them with distinctive awards, \nspecific to their fields of work. I am proud to know that this year a \nfew of these awards were given to four outstanding Idaho citizens.\n  Again, Mr. President, I would like to commend these gentlemen on \ntheir accomplishments and contributions to the nuclear scientific and \nengineering community. These individuals are a valuable asset not only \nto Argonne-West, but to all of us who rely on nuclear power as an \ninexpensive, renewable, and reliable source of energy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/10/senate-section/article/S5465-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE BRONX RECEIVES RECOGNITION AS A TOP 10 ALL-AMERICAN CITY\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the New York City borough once \nderided as ``the worst slum in America'' has been named an All-American \nCity by the National Civic League. This achievement, announced last \nweekend by Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer, is the result of a \ndecade of hard work and careful planning. Improved economic conditions \nhave spawned a renewal of spirit; a cultural and economic renaissance \nthat gives hope for the future.\n  In his 1997 State of the Borough Report, President Ferrer writes, \n``Ten years ago, the Bronx was best known as the borough of window \ndecals and trash-strewn vacant lots. Abandoned buildings. Illegal \nMedicaid mills. With its broken windows and broken dreams, the Borough \nof the Bronx stood as the international symbol of urban failure.''\n  What a difference a decade can make. The National Civic League Award \nconfirms what the residents of the Bronx already knew; their community \nhas undergone an unprecedented transformation. This metamorphosis is \nevidenced by strong economic growth, 522 new businesses, the \npreservation of the Old Bronx Borough Courthouse, improvements in \ntransportation, 30,000 new housing units, new parks and recreational \nfacilities, and a celebration of the cultural and ethnic diversity of \nthe people of the Bronx.\n  President Ferrer, New York City officials and community leaders \ndeserve our praise and our admiration. Together, they have earned an \nhonor for the Bronx that makes all New Yorkers proud. In so doing, they \nhave provided hope to other communities throughout the world. I ask \nthat news stories from the New York Times and the Daily News be printed \nin the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 9, 1997]\n\n                 The Bronx Is Named an All-America City\n\n       The Bronx--once called ``the worst slum in America'' by \n     former President Carter--is one of America's top communities, \n     the National Civic League said, announcing its annual top 10 \n     All-America Cities.\n       Other winners were Fremont, Calif.; Hillside Neighborhood \n     (Colorado Springs), Colo.; Aberdeen, Md.; St. Joseph, Mo.; \n     Asheville, N.C.; Statesville, N.C.; Bismarck, N.D.; Aiken, \n     S.C.; and Texas City, Tex.\n       The 48-year-old competition, sponsored by the Allstate \n     Foundation, judges cities based on citizen participation, \n     collaborative approaches to problem-solving, diversity and \n     education, among other criteria.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute \nto an exceptional hometown hero, John Tallman, who is retiring as \npresident of the Bourbonnais, IL, Fire Protection District after 48 \nyears of distinguished service.\n  On June 7, 1997 colleagues, friends, and family gathered to celebrate \nJohn's retirement after a lifelong commitment to the fire department \nand the community of Bourbonnais. He certainly deserves such \nrecognition.\n  Although a farmer by profession, at age 28, John began his service \nwith the volunteer-operated fire protection district as an appointed \ntrustee and was then elected president. As testimony to his commitment \nand integrity, John has remained the only president in the fire \nprotection district's 49-year history.\n  Over the years, John guided the fire protection district through \nremarkable periods of growth and modernization. Under John Tallman's \ntenure, the Bourbonnais Fire Protection District distinguished itself \nas one of the outstanding all-volunteer fire departments in the State. \nImprovements to the fire department facilities, equipment, and service \ninstituted under John's direction enabled the department to better \nrespond to the growing number of emergencies and helped save lives and \nproperty.\n  In addition to his duties with the fire protection district, John has \nalso been a dedicated husband and father, an 18-year member of the \nBourbonnais Elementary School Board, a farmer, and a 19-year member of \nthe Kankakee County Board of School Trustees.\n  John is a role model for all Americans and I commend him for his \nselfless service and effective leadership to the citizens of \nBourbonnais and of our State. A fellow firefighter once described John \nas being one of a kind. John Tallman leaves behind big shoes to fill, \nand his leadership and vision as fire protection district president \nwill be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/10/senate-section/article/S5467-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN REMEMBRANCE OF JOHN SENGSTACKE\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, today I would like to offer \nmy most heartfelt condolences to the family, friends, and colleagues of \nJohn Sengstacke, Chicago Defender publisher and owner, a Chicago \nnative.\n  Mr. Sengstacke was a man of vision, who promoted and created \nopportunities through his words and his actions. He was a person who \nvalued commitment, always urging others to follow through. Under his \ntutelage, the Chicago Defender became one of the most widely read, \ninformative, and important, independent newspapers for countless \nChicagoans.\n  His was a courageous life, and he always took a stand against \nsegregation and discrimination, always fought to give a voice to the \nvoiceless. Most notable are his efforts as a member of Truman's \ncommittee to desegregate the military and his vigilant effort to get \nthe first African-American correspondent into the White House.\n  He was clear that his role was not only to inform but to educate, by \nboth his personal and professional actions.\n  John Sengstacke knew the power of the pen was one of the strongest \nweapons available to African-Americans. He worked tirelessly to get the \nNational Newspaper Publisher's Association established, and it became \nan organization that would help more than 200 African-American-owned \nnewspapers provide a voice for the African-American community.\n  We have truly lost one of our finest freedom fighters, but he left a \nlegacy of tenacity and resilience that will endure.\n  We have much to celebrate in remembering the life of John Sengstacke. \nI thank John for his friendship, and thank him for blessing us with his \nlegacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/10/senate-section/article/S5467-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   WEST VALLEY DEMONSTRATION PROJECT\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to note that May 28 was a \nsignificant day in West Valley, NY, and in the field of nuclear waste \ndisposal. In 1982 we authorized the West Valley demonstration project, \nin which we would learn to take liquid nuclear waste and mix it with \nglass. The process is called vitrification, and yields ten foot high \nglass logs that can be stored safely. After 14 years of preparation, \nresearch, and testing, vitrification began last July. On May 28th the \n100th glass log was produced.\n  The success of the vitrification process developed at West Valley and \nat the Savannah River in Georgia led the Department of Energy to select \nit as the preferred method of disposal for such wastes. This is an \naccomplishment that the many hundreds of people in western New York who \nworked on the project can be most proud of.\n  They have another 110 logs to go at West Valley, but it is clear that \nthe technology works. It can and will be replicated at other sites \naround the country, helping to solve one of our most vexing and serious \nwaste disposal problems. Moreover, vitrification can be used to store \nother types of hazardous waste without fear of leaking. I congratulate \nall those at Westinghouse and the many agencies involved with the West \nValley project for achieving this milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/10/senate-section/article/S5467-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5467-S5468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CBO COST ESTIMATES--S. 430 AND S. 210\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Congressional consent to the amendments to the \n     constitution of the state of New Mexico is required before \n     they can be implemented by the state government.\n       CBO estimates the enacting S. 430 would have no effect on \n     the federal budget. Because the bill would not affect direct \n     spending or receipts, pay-as-you-go procedures would not \n     apply. S. 430 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of \n     1995 and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal \n     governments. Enactment of this bill would give New Mexico \n     state officials greater flexibility in investing and \n     distributing the assets of the state's permanent funds.\n       The estimate was prepared by Marjorie A.

In addition, \n     the bill would establish the Commission on the Economic \n     Future of the Virgin Islands and the Commission on the \n     Economic Future of American Samoa to recommend policies and \n     programs to assist the Virgin Islands and American Samoa in \n     developing secure and self-sustaining economies.\n       Subject to appropriation of the necessary funds, CBO \n     estimates that implementing S. 210 would cost the federal \n     government about $6 million over the 1997-2002 period. In \n     addition, the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates \n     that this bill would decrease federal revenues by about $14 \n     million over the 2003-2007 period. Enacting this legislation \n     also could affect direct spending by reducing the amount of \n     offsetting receipts from the sale of federal property. Hence, \n     pay-as-you-go procedures would apply to the bill. CBO \n     estimates, however, that any potential loss of such receipts \n     would not be significant.\n       S. 210 contains no private-sector or intergovernmental \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of \n     1995 (UMRA) and would impose no costs on state, local, or \n     tribal governments.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of S. 210 is shown in the following table. \n     Assuming appropriation of the amounts specified in the bill \n     for the costs of the proposed commissions and amounts \n     estimated for other costs, CBO estimates that implementing S. \n     210 would cost about $6 million over the 1997-2002 period.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                      By fiscal years, in millions of dollars\n                                                                 -----------------------------------------------\n                                                                   1997    1998    1999    2000    2001    2002\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\n \nEstimated authorization level...................................       1       2       2       1       1   (\\1\\)\nEstimated outlays...............................................

Of that amount, about \n     $525,000 is for food commodities and about $55,000 is for \n     administrative expenses. In addition, the bill would require \n     that the amount of commodities provided to the Marshall \n     Islands reflect changes in its population that have occurred \n     since the enactment of the Compact of Free Association in \n     fiscal year 1986. The amount provided to the program has \n     varied since it began in fiscal year 1987. According to USDA, \n     the program received about $1.6 million in 1987. Between 1988 \n     and 1992, the program received, on average, about $465,000 a \n     year. Since fiscal year 1993, $581,000 has been appropriated \n     each year for the program. S. 210 only specifies a base year \n     from which to calculate changes in the islands' population \n     but not a base level of funding. The estimate adjusts the \n     level of funding received in fiscal year 1988--$501,000--for \n     changes in the price level and for changes in the population \n     since fiscal year 1986. (CBO estimates that the population \n     will have increased by about 60 percent between fiscal \n     years 1986 and 1998.) Under these assumptions, extending \n     the program would cost about $5 million over the 1998-2001 \n     period.\n       The bill also would establish the Commission on the \n     Economic Future of the Virgin Islands and the Commission on \n     the Economic Future of American Samoa to recommend policies \n     and programs to assist the Virgin Islands and American Samoa \n     in developing secure and self-sustaining economies. Both \n     commissions would have six members, and the bill would \n     require that each commission file its report by June 30, \n     1999. The bill would authorize an average of $300,000 a year \n     for fiscal years 1997 through 1999 for the costs of each \n     commission. Assuming the bill would not be enacted until \n     later this year, CBO estimates that outlays for the two \n     commissions would total about $1.2 million over fiscal years \n     1998 and 1999.\n       S. 210 also would require, subject to availability of \n     appropriated funds, that the Department of the Interior (DOI) \n     take a census of Micronesia within five years of the \n     decennial census of the United States population. A census of \n     Micronesia would thus be required by fiscal year 2005. The \n     bill would limit expenditures on the census to no more than \n     $300,000. In addition, the bill would repeal a requirement \n     that the Administration report annually to the Congress on \n     the impact of the Compact of Free Association on the \n     territories and the state of Hawaii. According to DOI, it has \n     prepared three such reports since 1986. CBO estimates that \n     savings from repealing this requirement would not be \n     significant.\n       Direct spending and receipts\n       By granting the government of Guam the right of first \n     refusal on any federal property declared excess on Guam, S. \n     210 could reduce the amount of offsetting receipts from the \n     sale of surplus federal property. However, according to the \n     General Services Administration (GSA) and DOI, a sale of \n     federal property has never occurred on Guam. Also, the bill \n     would require Guam to pay fair market value for any property \n     transferred for private use. Therefore, CBO estimates that \n     the provision would have no significant impact on federal \n     receipts. In most or all cases, CBO expects the federal \n     government would transfer the property anyway to the \n     government of Guam under one of its public purpose programs.\n       Under current law, the Virgin Islands is required to secure \n     its bonds with a priority first lien claim on specified \n     revenue streams, rather than being permitted to secure \n     multiple bond issues on a parity basis with a common pool of \n     revenues. JCT estimates that if the priority lien requirement \n     is repealed, the Virgin Islands would issue more tax-\n     exempt bonds beginning in fiscal year 2003 than under \n     current law. (Fiscal year 2003 is the earliest that the \n     Virgin Islands can refund outstanding revenue bonds issued \n     on a priority basis.) The increase in tax-exempt bonds, \n     which would lower federal revenues, would occur because \n     the Virgin Islands could secure a greater volume of bonds \n     with the same amount of revenues if a parity approach were \n     permitted. JCT estimates that repealing the priority lien \n     requirement for revenue bonds would decrease federal \n     revenues by $14 million over the 2003-2007 period.\n       If the Virgin Islands were also to receive the authority \n     under separate legislation to refund the outstanding revenue \n     bonds prior to their redemption date in fiscal year 2003, JCT \n     estimates that this provision would decrease revenues by an \n     additional $21 million over the 1998-2002 period and by an \n     additional $2 million over the 2003-2007 period. These \n     estimates assume that the Virgin Islands would refund the \n     priority bonds in fiscal year 1998 and thus increase the \n     volume of outstanding tax-exempt bonds. Thus, if S. 210 were \n     enacted after the enactment of separate legislation \n     authorizing the additional advance refunding by the Virgin \n     Islands, JCT estimates that federal receipts would decrease \n     by about $21 million over the 1998-2002 period and by about \n     $37 million over the 1998-2007 period.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: Section 252 of the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 sets up pay-\n     as-you-go procedures for legislation affecting direct \n     spending or receipts through 1998. While H.R. 210 could \n     affect direct spending in fiscal year 1998 by reducing the \n     amount of offsetting receipts from the sale of federal \n     property, CBO estimates that any such effect would not be \n     significant.\n       Estimated impact on State, local, and tribal governments: \n     S. 210 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in \n     UMRA and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal \n     governments.\n       Some of the amendments included in this bill would benefit \n     the affected governments--territories and freely associated \n     states of the United States. Generally, the impact of these \n     changes would be small. For example, the bill would give the \n     government of Guam greater access to excess federal property. \n     It would also give the government of the Virgin Islands \n     additional options for issuing bonds and short-term notes.\n       Estimated impact on the private sector: This bill would \n     impose no new private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: John R. Righter; \n     Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: Marjorie \n     Miller.\n       Estimate approved by: Robert A.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Labor \nCommittee now be discharged from further consideration of S. 419, a \nbill to prevent birth defects by developing and implementing new \nprevention and surveillance strategies and the Senate now proceed to \nits immediate consideration under the following limitation: One \nsubstitute amendment in order to be offered by Senator Bond, no other \namendments be in order to the bill, and there be 30 minutes equally \ndivided for debate with Senator Bond in control of 15 minutes, and the \nranking member in control of 15 minutes, and further, following the \ndisposition of the amendment, and the expiration or yielding back of \ntime, the bill be read a third\n\n[[Page S5469]]\n\ntime and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the bill as amended \nwith no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I am a \ncosponsor of that particular legislation and I appreciate having the \nchance to debate it on the Senate floor. I think there is probably \nbroad bipartisan support for it. But I have indicated to the majority \nleader on a number of occasions now our strong desire to delay the \nconsideration of any other legislation until we have the opportunity to \nconsider again the disaster bill.\n  There are people out there that have birth defects. There are people \nout there that do not have homes. There are people out there that do \nnot have their farms, their businesses. There are people out there that \ndo not have the opportunity to conduct their lives in a normal way that \nare waiting day by day for us to respond in a meaningful way to their \ncircumstances.\n  People in 35 States now have been affected by the disastrous \ncircumstances that are addressed in this piece of legislation. We ought \nnot do anything until we have had the opportunity once more to consider \nthat legislation. So on behalf of the Democratic caucus, Mr. President, \nI object to the unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The unanimous consent \nrequest of the majority leader is not agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. I regret that the Democrats will not allow the Senate to \nconsider this bipartisan legislation. I know there are a number of \nDemocrats that are cosponsors of it. I presume we are going to find a \nway to consider this. This legislation would establish a national birth \ndefects prevention research system. I point out that our bill is \ncosponsored not only by the Democratic leader, but Senator Dorgan, \nSenator Hollings, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, just to name a few, and \na number of Senators on this side of the aisle.\n  As I know the cosponsors are aware, an estimated 150,000 infants are \nborn each year with serious birth defects, resulting in 1 out of every \n5 infant deaths. The bill is designed to establish regional birth \ndefects research programs, establishes the Centers for Disease Control \nas the coordinating agency for birth defects surveillance and \nprevention, and authorizes grants to public and nonprofit organizations \nto develop new public awareness to reduce the incidence of birth \ndefects.\n\n  With regard to the supplemental bill, I presume that we are going to \ncontinue to work to try to find a resolution to this problem. I think I \nhave proven over the past year that I always believe you can find a way \nto work through disagreements. Quite often here in the Senate, when we \nseem to be in an immovable position, when everyone is intractable, \nSenator Daschle and I have found if we go to the Senators that say, \n``No deal ever,'' and ask them, ``OK, what's the solution?'' I think \nquite often they say, ``Well, we can do it this way or that way.''\n  What I have suggested to Senator Daschle and to the White House and \nto the House of Representatives and to the leadership in the Senate, \nincluding the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, is we can work \ntogether and see if we can come up with language that we can agree on \nwith regard to this very important issue and with regard to preventing \na Government shutdown at the end of the fiscal year and find a way to \nmove the bill with some of the other language that is in there. Some of \nit may have to be removed; some of it may be compromised.\n  But, you know, compromise is not something where you work it out with \nyourself, on one side of the aisle or one side of the Capital. Now we \nhave to work among ourselves, Republicans and Democrats, House and \nSenate and the administration. It involves engagement.\n  And I have asked several times along the last couple weeks, including \nlast Friday and again yesterday, and including direct conversations \nwith the President--``You know, can't we find a way to come up with \nsome language that you can live with and that we can live with and move \nthis issue beyond us and go on to other issues?''\n  I want to note also for one and all that this bill was originally \nrequested to be $4.1 billion. It is now at least $8.6 billion. And it \nis not just funds for disasters around the country, it is also funds \nfor the Department of Defense and a lot of other programs that were not \noriginally requested.\n  I will just give you some idea what we are talking about. I hope I \nhave the list here. It does include things like--and these are all good \nand fine programs, I guess--but $33 million I think it is for the \nBotanical Gardens, not exactly emergency disaster funding; $23 million \nfor a parking garage in Cleveland, OH. I do not have the list here with \nme, but there is a long list of things that have been added along the \nway.\n  Barnacles have been picked up on this ship. So one of the things I \nhave suggested is, while we continue to work to try to resolve the \namount and the language--in fact yesterday I was asked by one of the \nadministration officials--I do not want to put words in their mouth--\n``What is this objection that Attorney General Reno has to some money \nin the bill?'' I said to this person, ``Are you talking about the $2 \nmillion for a law enforcement commission?'' Would the President want to \nstart talking about vetoing a bill because of $2 million for a law \nenforcement commission? I do not think so, but I would like to hear \nwhat their argument is against it.\n\n  One of the things I have suggested, with all honesty, and I did it \nback before the Memorial Day recess, rather than trying to negotiate \nthis thing down or to solve all the language right now, we should go \nahead and do a smaller bill that will provide the real emergency \ndisaster and the urgent salary for DOD. That will still leave a lot of \nmoney and a lot of language that we will continue to work on.\n  I guess what I am saying here is that I would like to get this worked \nout. I would like for us to move on to the reconciliation bill. I would \nlike for us to move on to appropriations bills. I had hoped we could do \ntwo or three appropriations bills before the Fourth of July recess, and \nI still hope we can put them in there tomorrow. I would like for us to \ntake up some of the nominations that are pending. I would like for us \nto take up adoption legislation, legislation that passed the House with \n465 votes, to make it easier to have adoptions in America. I did not \nbring it up last week because I found that we have a number of Senators \non both sides of the aisle that have been working on that and have some \ngood ideas, including Senator Rockefeller, Senator DeWine, Senator \nCraig, and Senator Chafee. They are working on it, and I think we may \nhave a compromise adoption bill we could call up later on this week.\n  All I am saying here is let us go on and do some of these bills that \nwe should be able to do in a relatively short period of time, including \nthe birth defects research program, while we continue to see if we can \nwork things out. I am ready. I am ready. Help me. I think we can find a \nway to get this thing done.\n  But it does not work this way. It does not work that the President \nsays, ``Send me down a full plate of money, $8.6 billion --and, by the \nway, we do not want any of your language on it.'' I have gone back and \nI have looked at supplementals over the years, and there has hardly \never been a supplemental that did not have all kinds of extraneous \nlanguage, all kinds of add-ons. If necessary, as the afternoon \nprogresses, I will read the list. Many of the supplementals that went \nto President Reagan, President Carter, and President Bush had not one \nor two little pieces of language, lots of pieces. I will give you some \nidea of how on every supplemental, I believe without many exceptions, \nthe Congress has expressed its will. We have input. We deserve some \nconsideration. These are not insignificant issues.\n  I am not convinced, for instance, on census, that at some point, once \nwe fully understand how the sampling might work, that we would not want \nto do that. I think I have real legitimate questions that I do not know \nthe answers to yet. Rather than let the administration start on down \nthe trail, and we will do this by sampling, I want to know for sure how \nthat is going to be better than enumeration. I want to know who is \ngoing to do it, and how it will be done. I do not know the answers.\n\n[[Page S5470]]\n\n  All I am saying is, take a time out on this issue, on census, until \nwe have more time to work on it, and then we can resolve it this fall \nor even next year, but we should not get locked in now before we have \nhad a chance to really look into it.\n  So, I yield to my colleague, Senator Daschle, and ask my colleague to \nanswer this question: If the Senate cannot consider this bill today, \nwould he be in a position, if we cannot do it today, to grant consent \nfor the Senate's consideration during Wednesday's session of the birth \ndefects research program bill?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me \ntake the opportunity to respond to a number of points raised by the \ndistinguished majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The majority leader says that all disaster bills, all \nsupplemental bills have had extraneous legislation. I suppose that is \nprobably true. But I have also gone back and looked at all these \ndisaster bills and extraneous legislation added to supplemental bills, \nand there is one difference between all of those in the past and this \none: All of those in the past have the agreement of the President; all \nof those in the past have been negotiated with the White House.\n  So, of course, you had supplemental legislation. Of course, you had \nextraneous legislation. But each and every time when that happened, the \nWhite House said, ``Send it down. I will sign it.'' In this case, the \nPresident has said, ``Look, these issues are so controversial and so \nfar reaching and so problematic that I cannot agree.'' And the \ndifference between this experience and all the others is the majority \nsaid, ``We will do it anyway.''\n  Now, I give great credit to the Senator from Minnesota, the junior \nSenator from Minnesota, who sent all of us a letter in the last couple \nof days. The Senator from Minnesota had a very practical, pragmatic way \nwith which to address this problem. What he suggested is that we simply \ntake those controversial pieces out, have a good debate, have a \ndiscussion, see if we can find a compromise. Let's do it. Let's agree \nright now without any filibusters, without any delay. We can commit to \na time certain for legislation dealing with census, for legislation \ndealing with a continuing resolution, for anything else that may be \nextraneous and onerous to the White House. We can agree to that.\n\n  Now, I have suggested that to some of my Republican colleagues and \nthe answer I get is, ``Well, the President is going to veto those bills \nif they go in their current form and we don't want that.'' So, in a \nsense, what they are saying is, we will hold hostage our troops in \nBosnia, all of the people detrimentally affected by the natural \ndisasters, and every single other item in this legislation because we \nwant our way. That is what we are being told.\n  Mr. President, there is no way to compromise with something like \nthat.\n  Now, like the majority leader, I have tried to find ways, and I give \nhim credit for trying to come up with innovative ways with which to \naddress this problem, but I must say we are in a set of circumstances \nfor which there can be no compromise when it comes to holding hostage \nvictims of natural disasters, holding hostage people serving their \ncountry in Bosnia.\n  We cannot allow that to happen. So, let's take the suggestion made in \ngood faith by the Senator from Minnesota. Let's take those pieces out, \nlet's have a good debate on them, and maybe, in the process, we can \nfind a compromise.\n  But until that happens, Mr. President, as I said a minute ago, we are \ngoing to object to any other piece of legislation coming to the floor. \nAnd I object.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/10/senate-section/article/S5468-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5470-S5475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record at this point the list of some of the extraneous items that \nhave been added to this bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n\nHighway trust fund.................................................$694\nTitle 1 grants (poor and disadvantaged schools).....................101\nVA compensation (mandatory).........................................932\nWIC..................................................................58\nBotanical Gardens....................................................33\nLaw Enforcement Commission............................................2\nBreast cancer research...............................................15\nRetired Coast Guard pay...............................................9\nOlympics counterterrorism fund........................................3\nIndian health.........................................................3\nCalifornia vineyards..................................................9\nCustoms Service expenses.............................................16\nVA parking garage, Cleveland, OH.....................................12\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I note the figure I used on the parking garage in \nCleveland, OH, was not the accurate number. It is actually $12 million. \nIt also has other interesting things in here, including $3 million for \nthe Olympics counterterrorism fund, $3 million for Indian health care, \n$9 million for California vineyards.\n  These may all be good programs and all deserving, but I wonder how \nthey found their way into this supplemental appropriations bill.\n  Also, I was here during the 1980's and early 1990's. I remember how \nsupplementals worked. Unfortunately, I used to plead with President \nReagan not to send supplemental requests up here because I knew it \nwould become a freight train pulling all kinds of things through. I \nremember Presidents of both parties objecting to things that Congress \nadded to the supplemental appropriations bills. The one we had June 30, \n1989, I see one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine add-\nons. Some are not exactly insignificant, either, like East European \nrefugee assistance, foreign aid to Haiti, funds for the Washington \nConvention Center. The supplemental appropriations also had about nine \nadd-ons, including renewing section 8 housing contracts.\n  Remember, supplementals are always alleged to be--while they may not \nall be natural disasters--they are always alleged to be somewhat \nemergency, or otherwise they would not be coming to the floor of the \nCongress saying, ``Give us some more money.'' Most administrations and \nCongress always underfund food stamp programs, knowing full well we \nwill come back next year and add more money to it.\n  Again, some of this is pretty significant legislation and pretty \ncostly, also.\n  The same thing again in 1991 and 1994. There is always language that \nis added. There is always funding that is added to these bills beyond \nwhat was originally requested. So, to infer that this is really \nsomething new or different is not the case.\n  Now, what I maintain is different here, if I could make this point.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to respond if I could make this point.\n  When I have suggested, and others have suggested, let's work together \nto work this out, I give credit to the Democratic leader. He has always \nbeen willing to listen, and I think that some of the things we have \nsuggested he has been willing to think about and discuss with his \ncolleagues. And he, like I, we cannot always say it will be this way or \nthat way. We have a conference we deal with and you have an \nadministration that you have to deal with. I have asked the President \nand his chief of staff, ``Please respond. Come back. Let's see if we \ncannot work this out.'' Basically, what they are saying is, ``Give us \nthe money and no language. We want it our way and no other way.'' It \ndoes not work that way.\n  However, in the realization and in recognition of the need for some \nof this to be done, I am advocating while we continue to work on that, \nthat we do a smaller bill that would address some of the concerns that \nthe Senator from South Dakota has.\n  I yield to the Senator from North Dakota, if I could.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I very much appreciate that.\n  Mr. LOTT. Only for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader yields for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the Senator from Mississippi yielding for a \nquestion.\n  I ask the Senator if it is not unusual when very controversial \namendments are added to disaster bills. I have been around here for \nsome while, as well, and it is clear there have been on the other side \nof the aisle disaster bills, but not in my memory have very \ncontroversial measures been added to disaster bills that attract a \nPresidential veto and thereby delay or derail the bill.\n  It seems there are two ways out of this. I ask the Senator from \nMississippi\n\n[[Page S5471]]\n\nabout both of them. One approach to resolve this issue is an approach \nthat I offered this morning on the floor by unanimous consent, and the \nSenator from Minnesota has also, I believe, suggested something \nsimilar, and that would be to simply take the two big controversial \nitems out of this, pass the bill, get a Presidential signature and get \ndisaster aid to the victims of disasters.\n  The second approach is an approach that the Senator from Mississippi \nseemed to suggest a few moments ago, and I would like to ask a question \nabout that. As the Senator from Mississippi will recall, about 2\\1/2\\ \nweeks ago, just prior to the Congress breaking for the Memorial Day \nrecess, there was some discussion that if the larger bill cannot go, at \nleast extract the body of real disaster aid and allow that to happen \nquickly. Now, that could happen this afternoon if others around here \nbelieve----\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator would yield, I have been an advocate of \ndoing that for probably about 3 weeks, and I would entertain doing it. \nI tell you why I said it to Senator Daschle earlier today, so that we \ncan do something quickly. Even if we came to an agreement here in the \nnext 24 hours on how we would do this, it would still have to go \nthrough the committees and both floors, with amendments in order. It \nwould take time.\n\n  This approach that you are suggesting, and I am suggesting, could \ntake 24 hours if we put our heads to it, and we could go on and \ncontinue to work and think about the additional money. And the \nlanguage, keep it in mind now, I do not know how much they are worried \nabout some of these other issues, but I have the impression from the \nadministration that they have a couple of other issues that they are \nvery, very interested in. So it is not just two.\n  But I am interested in, and I would like to work that out, and, \nagain, we would have to do it over here, and we would have to get it \ndone on the other side of the Capitol and the President would have to \nbe willing to sign it.\n  I think that approach makes sense--that is all I am saying. Common \nsense around here usually works pretty darn good.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield further for an additional \nquestion, we had someone on the other side of the Capitol suggest prior \nto the weekend break, if this does not get resolved the way we--that \nbeing them--want it, we may very well cut the amount of disaster aid \nthat is available to victims of disaster. Over the weekend in North \nDakota, we had a lot of folks reacting to that with some real quaking, \nwondering, what does this mean? I hope that cooler heads will prevail \nand some common sense will prevail.\n  I assume there has not been that discussion here in the Senate. We \nhad bipartisan cooperation putting together the disaster portion of the \nbill, and for that we are very thankful. The trick now, the goal now, \nis to get that aid to people who woke up this morning and who are \nhomeless, not just dozens but thousands of them, and the Senator \nsuggests an approach I would support, and that is to take those \nportions of the bill that represent the aid that is necessary to go to \ndisasters to help get their life back in order and pass that.\n  I ask the Senator----\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could----\n  Mr. DORGAN. I just ask if we could assume, with your willingness to \ndo that rather quickly, what kind of impediments does the Senator see \nto having that get to the President for his signature in the next 24 \nhours or so?\n  Mr. LOTT. I think that could be done quickly. It would take--I don't \nthink it could get done right here and how. I'd like to talk further \nwith your leader. One of the problems with the appropriations is they \ngenerally begin on the other side. But in furtherance of what you are \nsaying, I have discussed this this morning with the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee here in the Senate and with the Speaker of the \nHouse. I presume he is consulting with his chairman and others. So I \nthink this is the process by which we might move pretty quickly.\n\n  I think there are opponents to this. There are urgent things sort of \nnow with regard to some of the disaster programs--perhaps some of the \nhousing programs, perhaps some of the agriculture. There is a need to \nget this done as soon as possible because of weather considerations and \nso forth.\n  There is a second and third component. There are some other parts of \nit, some money that will need to be available and that will be \navailable for months and even years down the line.\n  So there are really two parts of it. The part that is somewhat in the \nemergency category is different from what we usually have because you \nare talking about some new programs and some new ideas--which I think \nhave some attractiveness, by the way. I have said that publicly and to \nthe people from your States; I think it is the way to go. I think it \nwould save money if we can find a way to move people out of what you \ncall the flood way--what we call the floodplain in my neck of the \nwoods--into areas where they will not be flooded year after year. That \nwould wind up in the long run saving money.\n  So there is that part.\n  Then there is the funding for the longer term which could be \navailable maybe for your State and may be available for other States as \nwe look at these various disasters.\n  I will yield to the Senator from Missouri. But let me wrap this up. I \nam ready. I am willing. And I want to work with you to see if we can't \ndo it that way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would like to ask the majority leader a \nseries of questions that I think are necessary to clarify where we \nstand. I apologize for not being on the floor when he began.\n  I have the responsibility for the subcommittee that appropriates \nmoney for FEMA. I wonder--as has been made clear on the floor, the \nemergency money is now flowing. There is money --$2 billion in FEMA--\nthat is going for the immediate needs right now. So there is money \nwhich can be paid out right now prior to the issuance of the completion \nof plans and assessments being available.\n  Is that clear? Has that been made clear?\n  Mr. LOTT. That has not been made clear, if I could respond to the \nquestion in this discussion. But I think repeatedly it has been noted \nthat there is money in the pipeline. The distinguished Senator from \nMissouri is the chairman of the subcommittee that has jurisdiction in \nthat area. He knows what is available and what should be available to \nFEMA for housing-type programs. Clearly those funds are flowing. We do \nneed to prospectively for the future have additional funds. But the \nmoney is there.\n  I have spoken to the head of FEMA, James Lee Witt, to ask him that \nspecific question. I have asked him, ``Do you need to do something \nmore; something different? You do have the money, don't you? You do \nhave temporary housing available, don't you? If you do not, we would \nlike to help make sure that you have that temporary housing money \navailable and the temporary housing available.''\n  So I think the Senator makes a very good point.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BOND. If I could ask another question----\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could take another question, then I will go back to \nthe Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. BOND. It has been made clear to our colleagues and to the people \nviewing this that before major disaster relief can start flowing, there \nhas to be damage assessments. I guess it is the understanding of the \nmajority leader that they are at least 2 weeks away from getting the \ndamage assessments. The State has to have a plan submitted and approved \nby the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Dollars then go to the \nState from FEMA and from the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment. Is it the clear understanding that this is a long process \nwhich is not being held up during this day or tomorrow, but the money \nis needed, and we will provide it? But the time required to get the \nplans in place still has not been completed.\n  Is that the understanding?\n  Mr. LOTT. In answer to the Senator's question, that is my \nunderstanding. I have been through these disaster situations. I know \nthere is a painful period during which you must have assessments and \nyou must have plans. It is the most difficult time of all. It is \nactually worse a month after a disaster\n\n[[Page S5472]]\n\nthan it is the day after, in some respects. Or certainly after 6 months \nyou begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n  We checked this morning from the staff standpoint with regard to FEMA \nfunds available. I understand there is $1.5 billion available as of \nthis morning.\n  So there are funds available, and they are, I believe, probably \nflowing to the various States that have been affected.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BOND. I have one final question to the majority leader. I very \nmuch appreciate his efforts to bring up the Birth Defects Prevention \nAct, which would deal with a very serious problem of 150,000 babies \nbeing born each year with birth defects in this country. We would like \nto go to it.\n\n  It is my understanding that, even if there were no other measure on \nthe floor, the supplemental appropriations bill would have to come over \nfrom the House. There is no reason to filibuster or delay the Birth \nDefects Prevention Act, because taking care of this bill this afternoon \nwill in no way delay the disaster. It will deal with the disaster of \nbirth defects which we can deal with today without slowing down any \nsupplemental emergency appropriations.\n  Is that correct?\n  Mr. LOTT. In answer to the Senator's question, it is absolutely \nright.\n  I thank the Senator from Missouri for his work on this legislation. \nHe has worked for a good long while and with the help of a lot of other \nSenators.\n  He is absolutely right, also, that we have tried this afternoon, \nduring which time we can do this birth defects legislation while we see \nif we can work out some agreement or some emergency disaster bill. It \nwould have to pass the House. Also, in connection with the Senator's \nstand, we want to talk about the supplemental.\n  I am prepared to work with the Senator from South Dakota to make sure \nwe have adequate time later on this afternoon and tonight to have a \nfull discussion.\n  I thought last week having protracted discussion would have been \ncounterproductive to trying to get an agreement, to get it completed. \nIf the Senators feel strongly that they want time to do that tonight, \nmy advice is to accommodate you in that effort. Of course, we will want \nSenators from our side of the aisle to have equal time or opportunity \nto speak also.\n  I thank the Senator for his questions. I know he is prepared and \nready to go to the birth defects legislation.\n  Mr. President, I am glad to yield to the Senator from North Dakota \nfor a question only.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. President, is the majority leader aware that over the weekend on \nthis question of the money in the pipeline that the Republican \nCongressman from Minnesota said this: ``Those who argue there is money \nin the pipeline are being disingenuous, at best. There is no money for \nhousing, for livestock, sewerage systems, water supply, housing \nbuyouts. There is no money in the pipeline for those things. They can't \nreally rebuild without the funds that are tied up in the disaster \nrelief bill.''\n  I would like to ask further, is the majority leader aware of what the \nRepublican Governor of South Dakota said on this question? Janklow \nsaid, ``The delay in the legislation is blocking reconstruction of \nsewerage facilities, highways, and a state-owned rail line in South \nDakota.''\n  He went on to say, ``I am not going to award contracts on the come. \nI'm not a fool.''\n  Janklow said, ``What happens if we award a contract and we don't have \nthe money for it?''\n  Finally, I ask if the majority leader is aware that the mayor of \nGrand Forks has now written letters to the Senate and said the same \nthing and asked that the emergency provisions be stripped out--that is, \nthe disaster provisions--and be passed so that in fact the aid can \nflow.\n  Is the Senator aware of those developments over the weekend: the \nRepublican Congressman from Minnesota saying the money is not flowing \nin those specific areas; the Republican Governor of South Dakota saying \nthe same thing; and, finally, the mayor of Grand Forks asking that we \nmove the disaster provisions as expeditiously as possible because they \nare not getting the aid they desperately need?\n  Mr. LOTT. As a matter of fact, if I could respond to the question and \ncomments, the Senator is suggesting right there at the end that we try \nto move the emergency disaster portion of this as expeditiously as \npossible. I suggested a way we can do that.\n  I want to remind the Senator also that this additional funding and \nauthorization, I believe, would be available--would have been available \nyesterday--if the President had signed the bill, a bill that 67 \nSenators voted for. It would have been available yesterday just like \nthat. But the President of the United States vetoed it because of \nlanguage that he is not happy with, and, I repeat, a bill that got 67 \nSenators to vote for it, including, I think, a majority or very close \nto a majority of Democrats. I know why. And I know that there are some \nareas where the youth program is being suggested, and I hope we can \nfind a way to move that expeditiously, as has been suggested.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. LOTT. I understand we can't use these dollars until the plans are \navailable to use them. Anyway, we are still waiting on plans from FEMA \nor from the States.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes; I am glad to yield for a question only.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I could ask the Senator, with this question of the \nmoney in the FEMA pipeline, is the Senator aware that there are other \npipelines that deliver assistance that in fact don't have money in \nthem? That is, housing doesn't have money in their pipeline, \nagriculture doesn't have money in their pipeline. So the reference to \nFEMA is very limited with respect to those parts of disaster relief \nthat they address.\n  Mr. LOTT. In responding to the question, there are perhaps some \nprograms or agencies that may not have specific disaster funds. I know \nthat the Senator from South Dakota has advocated something new or \ndifferent with regard to livestock, if that is an accurate way to put \nit.\n  I know that agriculture has a good bit of money that they could use \nin a variety of ways that would be helpful. But, as I understand it, \nthis would be a new program which I am sympathetic to. But before any \nof this is done, I repeat once again, there has to be a plan.\n  I just say to my colleagues here again that as soon as we complete \nthis dialog and then we hear from others who are awaiting to speak from \nboth sides of the aisle, including the Senator from Minnesota, who \nwishes to be heard, I will be glad to talk further with the Senators \nfrom North Dakota, Minnesota, and South Dakota, or any other States. We \ncan talk about how we can do this thing expeditiously while we continue \nto work on the bigger package.\n  Also, I would like to note, if I could, that we hope to move other \nissues in the days ahead.\n  I mentioned that I believe we hope to consider the State Department \nauthorization bill next week, as well as the DOD authorization bill. We \nneed to get this resolved as soon as we can so we can get on to those \nimportant issues.\n  I understand that my Democratic colleagues have also objected to the \npermission of committees to meet during today's session. One of those \ncommittees, which is very important, is the Armed Services Committee. \nThe Armed Services Committee is marking up the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill for the next fiscal year.\n  This year, unlike a lot of past years, I had the impression that the \nDOD authorization bill and the Armed Services Committee marking up is \ngoing smoothly and that it is not going to be as controversial as it \nhas been in the past; that we may have one or two big amendments, but \nthat this is something we can do in a relatively short period of time--\nperhaps 3 days.\n  The Armed Services Committee had three subcommittee meetings planned \ntoday in an effort to prepare or report the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  I really regret that objection. Needless to say, this objection to \ncommittee meetings will only delay and hamper their ability to report \nthis bill.\n  Then, of course, during the week of the 23d, the Senate will consider \nboth\n\n[[Page S5473]]\n\nreconciliation bills, both the spending restraint and realignment-of-\nspending bill. And the tax legislation will be reported out of the \nFinance Committee.\n  So we are going to have long days and nights ahead of us. I want the \nMembers to be on notice that we must get this work done before our \nFourth of July recess. Therefore, in anticipation of that, Senators \nshould be prepared to be here at least next week throughout all of the \nweek and probably the next week, too. The objection to the birth \ndefects bill, as well as the provisions for committees to meet, will \nonly make these last few weeks even longer.\n  I understand what you are trying to accomplish here. I hope that we \ncan find a way to allow the committees to meet, and I hope to do that \nlater on this afternoon.\n  Then I would like also to talk to the Senator from South Dakota the \nDemocratic leader about exactly what we need to do in terms of debate \ntonight and how long you are thinking about. Also, I need to talk to \nall of you about how we can move something very quickly and \nexpeditiously.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield to Senator Sarbanes for the purpose \nof a question only.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator agree with me that all Members of the \nSenate have an interest in making sure that this disaster relief is \nprovided to the people who have been hit by this extraordinary national \ndisaster, and that there is a constant reference to the Senators from \nNorth Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota? Of course, they have been \nmost immediately impacted, but it seems to me that every Member of the \nSenate has an interest in responding to this.\n  Mr. LOTT. In response to that question, why, of course. We all have \nthat interest. As a matter of fact, 35 States have had some amount of \ndisasters--whether it is flooding, freezes, or whatever it may be--\nincluding my own State, in which I think for three or four counties a \nrequest was made by our Governor to have disaster assistance available, \nwhich I might note has been turned down by FEMA even though the State \nright across the river, which was also flooded, was approved.\n  But in answer to the Senator's question, the Senate, the Congress, \nhas always shown a desire to, as a matter fact, address natural \ndisasters; and also a desire to avoid manmade disasters like the \nfiascoes we have had 11 times since 1981 of Government shutdowns that \nalso cause people pain and suffering and loss of their jobs and income. \nSo, yes, I feel that sympathy. I have been through it. I have been \nthrough hurricanes, tornadoes, freezes, droughts----\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is the other question.\n  Mr. LOTT. Ice on the trees, endless amounts, and we have always been \nsympathetic to each other, and we are this time. We are this time. We \nare going to provide the disaster assistance the people in the affected \nStates need. We are going to do it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield? Can we do it today?\n  Mr. LOTT. The question is, how do we do it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Can we do it today?\n  Mr. LOTT. I hope so. I would like to do that. But we can do it one or \ntwo ways. We can do sort of the new portion, the emergency portion, or \nwe can work out an agreement on the bigger package. And I am ready to \ndo either one of those. I think we can do it once we make up our minds \nto do it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for one further question?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I recall the Senator's own State was struck with a \ndisaster.\n  Mr. LOTT. We have had them all. We have had them all.\n  Mr. SARBANES. We had a major hurricane, and I remember voting to send \ndisaster relief to the Senator's State in order to meet that situation. \nI don't recall it being caught up in these kinds of delays.\n  Mr. LOTT. Well, understand once again----\n  Mr. SARBANES. In personal disaster relief.\n  Mr. LOTT. There seems to be an abundance of selective memory around \nhere. I remember--in fact, I have been through how that disaster \nlegislation has worked. In fact, I was a staff member one time on the \nbiggest one of all where we did not have FEMA. We did not have existing \nlaw. In fact, if you go back and look at the history of what has led to \nFEMA, it was in legislation we drafted in 1969. The disaster occurred \nAugust 18, as I recall it was, something like that, and we had to rely \non the Corps of Engineers and people, volunteers to come in and help \nus. It was weeks, weeks before we got the legislation and, in fact, got \nmany of the programs to help us. In fact, we did not have a lot of the \nprograms that are now on the books.\n  I am not saying that that is good. I think we have learned from that \nexperience.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I hope so.\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad we have been through that, and now we are going \nto provide, as we always have, the assistance that is needed to the \npeople in America who cannot help themselves.\n  There is one thing that worries me about part of this bill. There is \na lot of spending in here that does not relate to these disasters. It \nhas just sort of been added as it's gone along, and I am not putting \nthat just on Democrats either. A lot of these projects, if I go down \nthe list, I can trace them back to some of my colleagues. But we are \ngoing to get this done. We can do the emergency stuff, and we can do \nthe bigger package.\n  But right now everybody is trying to find a way to prevail or to \nclaim victory or to get the PR victory, and I am not--I did not say \nyou. I said we. And when we decide, once we make up our minds we are \ngoing to get this done, short term or long term, we are going to find a \nway to do it. But the fact is, as has always been the case--and it will \nbe this time--the people who have been hurt and hit with these \ndisasters in a variety of States are going to get the help they need.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for one final question?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield for a question from the Senator \nfrom Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the majority leader. Let me see if I \nunderstand what the majority leader said, and I think I do. I expect it \nto be a friendly question.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would not expect it to be any other way from the Senator \nfrom Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The majority leader keeps saying he is determined to \nget this assistance to the people and he is determined to try and get \nthis done this week. Have I heard that correctly?\n  Mr. LOTT. I would like very much to be able to do that. It is going \nto take more than just me though. But that is my desire.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I understand. But the reason I ask the majority leader \nthis, since he is the majority leader, is that--and I put this in the \nform of a question. Is the majority leader aware--and I believe you are \nbecause I think that, agree or disagree on issues, you are very adept \nat sort of understanding the mood of people in Mississippi or for that \nmatter in the country--is the majority leader aware that the people in \nour States are just getting sick and tired of it all and they do not \nunderstand all the debate about census and all the debate about \ncontinuing resolution and all the rest; they do not mind our having \nseparate debate on that and they understand there are disagreements. \nThey do not understand why we just cannot get a clean disaster relief \nbill to them.\n\n  Can the majority leader commit to us that that is what we will do \nthis week, get a clean disaster relief bill that will provide the \nassistance to people that need it and we will get it done this week? \nCan the majority leader make that commitment?\n  Mr. LOTT. I say again I would like that to happen. I am hopeful, and \nI believe we can get a clean bill through this week but it will not be \n$8.6 billion. It would be only--the only chance we have to do that, \nwhat you are suggesting at this point, would be the truly emergency \nportions of the bill.\n  Now, we may also get an agreement on the bigger package and language \nthat would be attached to it, but based on what I have experienced \nduring the last 4 days, I think that is going to take a little longer.\n  Keep in mind now, I have not been up in Minneapolis, MN, or the delta \nof\n\n[[Page S5474]]\n\nMississippi and not thinking about this. I have been on the phone. I \nhave been probing. I have suggested a variety of ways to solve these \nproblems. I did it on Friday. I did it on Monday. I did it last night. \nI am trying to find a way to solve this problem, and I am open to \nsuggestions with regard to the census language, for instance. I confess \nthis openly here because I am not ashamed of it at all. I went to the \nDemocratic leader, and I said I think you see what our concerns are. Is \nthere some language that you all could live with?\n  This is not insignificant. When you talk about changing the way the \ncensus is done, this is not without major implications. We do have \nlanguage in the Constitution with regard to the census. I talked to the \nSecretary of Commerce this very morning. I am not sitting over in a \ncorner just trying to outlast you guys. I have talked to FEMA, the head \nof FEMA. I have talked to the Secretary of Commerce. I have talked to \nthe Chief of Staff of the President of the United States. I have talked \nto the President of the United States, the Democratic leadership, the \nSpeaker of the House.\n  This morning I was talking to the Secretary of Commerce. I said one \nof the things--or he suggested one of the things we might do would be \nto set up a process where there could be a quick judicial determination \nof this constitutional question.\n  That is important. And census is important for more than just how you \ncount. It is also important from the standpoint of how many \nrepresentatives a State has--very important. It also has a great impact \non how you get Federal funds. I have towns in my State of Mississippi, \nand I know it is true in Minnesota, that because of the census count, \neither undercounting or not proper counting programs, that are not \neligible as far as some of our Federal programs, some of the Federal \ngrants and loans, and so this is very important for a long time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Last question.\n  Mr. LOTT. Sure. I will be glad to yield further for a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will not hold the floor any longer. I just want to \nsay to the majority leader I am a little troubled by the very lengthy \nexplanation on the census count only because again I think the question \nthat we have put to the majority leader is why not take that issue, \naround which there is disagreement, and debate it separately and why \nnot take the issue of appropriations bills and the continuing \nresolution and debate it separately? But that is what we do not agree \non. That is controversial. We can have an honest debate. Why link it to \nwhat should be a disaster relief bill----\n  Mr. LOTT. I have an answer.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Providing assistance to people in our States?\n  Mr. LOTT. I have two answers to that question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Does the majority leader understand that in our \nStates----\n  Mr. LOTT. I have two answers.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. People do not care a lot about what the majority \nleader is talking about; they have got a whole lot of pain they are \ndealing with. We want to get help to them. Can we get the commitment to \nget help to them?\n  Mr. LOTT. As a matter of fact, I have two answers. I have suggested \nto you today, to the leader on your side of the aisle and the Senators \nfrom North Dakota, there is a way we can get the emergency funding and \ndo it quickly if we make up our minds and are determined to do that \nwhile we continue to work on the solutions here.\n  But the other point with regard to the census, the reason why I make \nthe explanation is to show once again an abundance--we can solve this. \nWe can solve this problem, but there is a reason why we have to do it \nnow. The die is being cast; the Census Bureau and the Department of \nCommerce have indicated we are going to do this. And if we wait until \nOctober to deal with this issue, we are going to be in a position of \nhaving to reverse something that is already set in place. They are \ngetting ready to do it. So we do not have the luxury of saying, well, \nwe will pick up on this in July or September or October. It would be a \nfait accompli by then.\n\n  So that is a consideration. But we will continue to work on that, and \nwe will find--I think we can find a way to do this this afternoon.\n  Does the Senator from North Dakota wish to ask another question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes. I do not want something the Senator said a moment \nago to stand here and be misinterpreted. The Senator indicated \npotential existed--in the past some kind of emergency provision--that \nit would not be $8.6 billion. I want to make clear--I assume you do not \nmean, as some have suggested on the other side, that, well, if we come \nback to disaster relief, the folks who are waiting for that relief are \ngoing to get a whole lot less relief because we are going to cut it. \nThat has been the implication by some.\n  Now, we have had agreement on the disaster package in this \nlegislation. There has been no disagreement. Republicans and Democrats \nhave agreed. We have put it in. It is done except it has not gotten \nthrough to the President for his signature. But I assume the Senator \nfrom Mississippi supports the full complement of disaster relief that \nis in the bill and is not in any way saying that he would at some point \nrevisit and diminish the amount of disaster relief in the bill. Could \nyou clear that up?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am not here to negotiate the exact amount. I think we \nhave to work with the committee.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is not what I am asking.\n  Mr. LOTT. Well, I am trying to answer the question. I am not going to \nsay here that it is going to be--I do not know, for instance, what the \nexact amount is, what the total amount is that would be alleged to, or \nwould be needed for the disaster assistance, so how can I say what the \nnumber would finally be? But I am prepared to say this, that there is a \ndifference between the total amount that is requested over a period of \nmonths and years for disaster and those parts of it that are urgent, \nthat need to be addressed now, and that is the part I am really focused \non. But I am not prepared to say it would be even limited just to that. \nI think we need to look at what is really needed right now and in the \nshort term or in the foreseeable future and go with that number. I \nthink we have to talk--are you on the appropriations committee?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes. I was part of the conference.\n  Mr. LOTT. You would certainly be involved in that process.\n  Mr. DORGAN. But the Senator supported, when the bill passed the \nSenate the Senator supported the conference report that had this \npackage of disaster assistance in it. I just do not want someone to \nmisinterpret--maybe I am putting words in your mouth, but I do not want \nsomeone to misinterpret when you say, well, there may not be $8.6 \nbillion. My assumption is that you support and others in the Senate \nsupport the quantity of disaster aid that was decided upon by the \nconference committee. Is that not correct?\n  Mr. LOTT. I also supported, I believe it was about $1 billion right \nbefore the Memorial Day recess.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. And I realize the situation is different now. But I do not \nknow, I do not know how much different it is. I have supported a lower \nfigure. I supported a higher figure.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Now, look, again, this bill is $8.6 billion and it has got \na lot more in it than just disaster aid. It has some disaster relief \nthat is not emergency and not needed for months and even years.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield for one additional question. I \nappreciate the majority leader's indulgence.\n  I am more concerned than I was before I left my chair.\n  My assumption has been that we negotiated a disaster relief package. \nIt is significant. It is important. And it is vitally needed by the \nareas in my part of the country but many others around America as well, \nand I hope very much that there is no one here who seriously entertains \nbacking away from that commitment.\n  In any event, one of the reasons that I ask this question is the \npiece that the Senator from Mississippi provided as samples of \nnonemergency spending in the supplemental included, for example, $694 \nmillion for the highway trust\n\n[[Page S5475]]\n\nfund. And let me just describe something. Maybe the Senator does not \nunderstand this, but we have, for example, in North Dakota right now a \nhighway called Highway 57. It is a link to the Spirit Lake Indian \nNation. It is now under water, incidentally. That Indian nation is \nvirtually isolated out there, and there are young kids who need \ndoctors' attention and medical help who at this point have to go far \naround in order to get it. Their lives are at risk. Commerce stops. \nEmergency medical assistance is not available. And so we need to deal \nwith these emergency road needs, for example, in Devils Lake which has \nbeen flooded every year.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I can respond to that, it is interesting the Senator \nwould raise that. As a matter of fact, I believe that one of the things \nthat will probably be indicated as urgent disaster need would be in the \ntransportation area which is different from the $694 million that is in \nthe bill, and let me just emphasize this. The President in that area \nasked I think for about $300 million, but along the way that figure \ngrew to almost $1 billion. I have seen this figure I believe that is \nthere, $694 million. I think that has to do with ISTEA and the \nallocation formula and that there is a separate emergency \ntransportation item that we might consider. It may not be accurate, but \nthat is the impression I have. That $694 million is for funds all over \nthe country not related to the disaster.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would say to the Senator that I have visited with the \nDepartment of Transportation Secretary and others, and they are \nawaiting this disaster bill in order to unlock the money necessary to \ndeal with these critical road problems in the one area I have \nmentioned, which is Devils Lake, where an entire Indian tribe is \nisolated out there because the roads are inundated with water. But let \nme go back to the point I originally made today to the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  I urge you to consider this afternoon doing the following, which \nwould very simply and quickly unlock this issue. There are two major \nstumbling blocks to having the President sign this disaster bill. One \nis the attachment of the anti-Government-shutdown provision and the \nsecond is the census issue. Let us, as the Senator from Minnesota and \nothers have suggested, set them aside, debate them separately. We will \nnot stand in the way of debating and voting on those issues. And let's \ntake the other bill that has been crafted by a bipartisan majority, \nRepublicans and Democrats in the Senate and the House, and I was on the \nconference committee, let us take that to the floor, vote it out, send \nit, and get it signed and get disaster relief. We could do that this \nafternoon.\n  I just don't understand why that is not possible today. Maybe the \nSenator from Mississippi can tell me why that is practically \nimpossible. I would think it would be the easiest and most immediate \nsolution to getting disaster aid to disaster victims.\n  Mr. LOTT. As a matter of fact, one of the things that amazes me is \nthe President of the United States would veto a disaster bill because \nhe doesn't want language in there that says we won't have a Government \nshutdown. As a matter of fact, if we can get this problem worked out \nnow, it will avoid a problem we are surely going to have in October, \nwhere, once again, like we do almost every year, we have these fun and \ngames where there is a threat of various departments or agencies or \nGovernment shutdowns that has been used by Democrats and Republicans--\nmost effectively, by the Democrats. And all I am saying is, you know, \nwe could work this out. I have suggested some language that I believe \nmost of you could live with, and we ought to go ahead and do that and \nget this issue resolved and move on.\n  Of course, obviously, the purpose here would be to separate these \nthings out where the President could veto them, if he wanted to, and \nnot resolve the problem. Why move these on down the line toward another \ndisaster--as I have already pointed out, a manmade disaster--at the end \nof the fiscal year?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/10/senate-section/article/S5470-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5475-S5476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me just say, in order to allow other Members to speak, \nwould the minority leader be willing to allow us consent to provide for \nspeeches by Senators Daschle, Grams, Hutchinson, Dorgan, Sarbanes, \nBond, Wellstone, Nickles, or his designee, say for 10 minutes each, and \nfollowing those statements that I be recognized?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, there are many other Senators who want to \nbe recognized to speak, so I wouldn't want to exclude other Senators \nwho would like very much to participate.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would not want to exclude them. I think this would just \nget an agreement that these Senators that are here, waiting for an \nopportunity to speak--I would like to amend that list to include the \nSenator from North Dakota--that we get a lineup of speakers, led off by \nthe distinguished Democratic leader. Senator Grams has been waiting to \nspeak; Senator Hutchinson, who is an original cosponsor of the \nGovernment shutdown prevention language, and Senator Dorgan and Senator \nSarbanes have been waiting. Senator Bond is here and wishes to speak on \nhis birth defects bill. That has been blocked now. It is a bill we \nshould be able to have some limited debate on and get agreement to move \non.\n  Senator Wellstone, I am sure, would like to be recognized, Senator \nConrad and Senator Nickles, or his designee, for 10 minutes each with \ntheir statements, and then I be recognized at end of that group.\n  Then, if others come in, we will get time for others to speak, too. \nThere is no desire to cut Senators off. I am just trying to set up some \nregular order where I don't hog all the time and I am in a position of \nsaying to you I will yield for a question only so I do not lose control \nof the floor.\n  Let's set up an orderly process and we all get our chance to make our \nspeeches, make our statements, without being just a question or \nresponse to the question. Would the Senator object to that?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would have two concerns. One is that \nsome Senators may wish to speak longer than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Would you like to make it 15?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Second, they may wish to come back and speak again.\n  Mr. LOTT. We wouldn't limit that, either.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I wouldn't want it to be precluded.\n  Mr. LOTT. I hope before the afternoon is over, we will have an \nopportunity to get an agreement for an extended period of time of \ndebate which would be open, with the normal recognition of the Chair \nand going back and forth on both sides of the aisle, that would go on \nfor quite some time.\n\n  Again, I want to talk to the Senator about what length of time he is \ntalking about.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, so long as no Member is precluded a \nsecond time or speaking for a period longer than 10 minutes at a later \ntime, and so long as no other Senator is precluded from speaking at all \nby this unanimous consent request --I think that is the assertion, now, \nof the majority leader?\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could suggest, again, let's start with this and then I \nwill talk to the Democratic leader, and we will go from there. This is \njust to get it started.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I reserve the right to object, and I ask the majority \nleader a question. On two occasions, on the two most recent business \ndays, we were subject to a motion to adjourn and required to vote on \nthat, even though many of us did not feel we should adjourn. We wanted \nto continue to discuss this issue and attempt to see if we couldn't get \nthe Senate to do its business and pass a clean bill providing disaster \nrelief.\n  I would just like to understand what we might face later today. I \ncertainly would object to any unanimous-consent request propounded by \nanyone under any circumstances unless there is some assurance we are \nnot going to face another motion for adjournment and simply be voted \ndown and told the disaster bill is not a subject they want us to visit \nabout on the floor of the Senate for any extended length. Some of us \nfeel very strongly we would like to spend some time on the Senate floor \ntalking about the disaster relief bill and ways to solve this so we can \nget disaster relief to disaster victims.\n  So, I guess, before I would agree to a unanimous-consent request, I \nwould like to have some understanding\n\n[[Page S5476]]\n\nwhether we are going to face an adjournment request later.\n  Mr. LOTT. Well, could I inquire if the leader would be willing to \ngive us consent for our committees to meet, if we could go ahead and \nlock in a unanimous consent-agreement, or an agreement on how long you \nall would like to go tonight? Would the Senator like to respond to \nthat?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we discussed this matter in the caucus. I \nthink it was unanimous in the caucus that committees would not meet \nthis afternoon, because we really need to have attention focused on \nthis issue. I am afraid I am not able to give that agreement to the \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could say, then, I would like to--and I \nwill talk to the Senators about how we do this--with their cooperation, \nand I am talking about not just committee meetings, because we will do \nwhat we need to do there. But when we begin the debate or comments \nother Senators are going to make, we will talk with you about how much \ntime we think we need and how we will do that. It is my inclination \ntoday to try to get it worked out, where we could have an \nunderstanding, an understood period of time, and to not go with a \nmotion to adjourn.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator would agree to the proposition \nthat we not propose a motion to adjourn the Senate without agreement \nobtained with the minority leader for such a motion.\n  Mr. LOTT. You know, I am asking here for some process whereby the \nSenators from the various States would have a chance to make comments \nfor a specified period of time. I asked for 10 minutes. Do you want me \nto expand that to 15?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I think there are Senators who wish to speak longer than \n10 minutes. Whether it is at the first opportunity or whether they have \nthe opportunity to come back, that is a concern. But I share the \nconcern expressed by the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could--excuse me for interrupting you, but we are \ngoing to have an opportunity for them to speak now and speak again \nlater. And we will have to work out the process to do that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object, what is the assurance that \na Senator would not be precluded from giving a second speech? Because, \nas the majority has outlined this proposal, as I understand it, a \nSenator would be able to speak 10 minutes or 15 minutes, but then would \nbe precluded from speaking again, unless the majority leader would \nalter his unanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe if we get another consent, that that would not \napply. Of course, the way the Senate works, if a Senator asks for a \nspecified period of time to speak, that usually is acquiesced to.\n  Here is the alternative. If you like, I'll just keep talking here. We \ncan go right on until some other time here in the afternoon. But I \nwould like to have a free-flowing discussion, so I would like to do it \nin an orderly way.\n  I asked unanimous consent, and then we will get an agreement, I \npresume later on, that we will have an extended period of time for \ndebate during which Senators will be able to speak for extended periods \nof time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Would he entertain a unanimous-consent request which \nwould say we would not adjourn without the consent of both leaders \ntonight? Because I think, if that were the case, then there would be no \nobjection on this side to working through whatever schedule may \naccommodate speakers on both sides.\n  Mr. LOTT. It is my intent, Mr. President, to work with the leader and \nget an agreement on what time will be needed. I would like to do that. \nI prefer not to move for adjournment. I think we could work that out. I \nam indicating to you I would like for you to be able to have that time \ntonight. But I have been asked for three different things to agree to. \nI asked for one thing in return, and that's for committees to meet. I \nam going to have to go through a parliamentary procedure here in order \nfor committees to be able to meet.\n  Let us do this. Let us talk while others are talking and we could \nwork this out. I think there is no question we can get that done.\n  Mr. President, I renew my request that the Senators that I outlined \nbe allowed to speak for 10 minutes and that I be recognized at the end \nof this list, at which time, if there are other Senators who wish to \nspeak, they will be recognized or we will work out an order so the \ndebate can continue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object, Mr. Leader, I say to you I \nwould be forced to object if there is no assurance that the rights of \nthis Senator and other Senators will be protected. Because, as the \nSenator has outlined, the Senator would be able to speak perhaps 10 or \n15 minutes and that's it, under this formulation.\n  Mr. LOTT. I am saying to the Senator from North Dakota, I would like \nto be able to work with him to do that. I intend to do that. We will \ntalk and we will make that agreement. We will make it in a request at a \nperiod of time after we have had some of these speeches so we can talk.\n  I don't know exactly what you all are thinking about or what you \nwant, but there is no desire to cut the Senator from North Dakota off \ntoday. I want him to be able to make his case. I am going to work with \nyou to do that, and I think the record will show I have done that sort \nof thing in the past. I am telling you here, now, we are going to find \na way for you to be able to make the speech you want to make. What more \ncan you ask of me now? And then, we will talk that through while others \nare speaking.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am constrained to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next hour \nbe equally divided between Senators Lott and Daschle and, at the end of \nthat hour, that Senator Lott be recognized to move to adjourn.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I can inquire of the Senator from South \nDakota, is it his desire that we not have any further debate at this \ntime?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is the desire on the part of many of \nour colleagues to speak longer than the time allotted in the unanimous \nconsent request, and it is certainly the desire of our colleagues not \nto allow the Senator the opportunity to adjourn the Senate. For that \nreason, I am compelled to object.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have very important committee work that \nneeds to be done. As the Senate knows, the bulk of the work and the \nwriting that goes on in the Senate does occur in committees at the \nhearings and markups. We have a very important markup now that we need \nto get done in the Armed Services Committee. The defense of our country \nis, obviously, something we want to pay very close attention to. We \nhave less than a week in which the Armed Services Committee needs to \ncomplete its work.\n  I would prefer that we get an agreement that the Armed Services \nCommittee, as is always--almost always--the case, be allowed to meet \nwith these other committees. I understand the Senator has a problem, \nsome objections from his conference. I also would prefer that we have \nan hour of debate equally divided so that Senators who have been \npatiently waiting for quite some time can be heard, including Senators \nhere now, and Senator Grams of Minnesota who has been waiting to be \nheard.\n  I also had hoped that we could work together and get a time worked \nout whereby we could have extended debate tonight. It doesn't appear \nthat we can work that out. So, I would be prepared to proceed at this \ntime.\n  Does the Senator have any other comment he would like to make before \nI propound a unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the distinguished majority leader \nmentions the defense markup. I also remind him, as he is very aware, \nthere is money in this supplemental for our troops in Bosnia. Time is \nrunning out there, too. There is virtually no time left for us to get \nthe supplemental assistance to the troops in Bosnia. It sends a \nterrible message to them not to address this legislation more \nsuccessfully than we have.\n  I can't think of anything more important in that regard, not only to \naddress the disaster victims but to address the troops in Bosnia, to \naddress all of those who are waiting for some sign that we understand \nhow difficult their circumstances are, including people defending our \ncountry in faraway lands.\n  So, I am compelled to object, and I only hope that at some point in \nthe not-too-distant future, we are going to be able to resolve this \nmatter, because they can't wait any longer.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I also had hoped that we would be able to \nwork out an agreement where there wouldn't be objection to my motion to \nproceed to the Birth Defects Prevention Act--this is broadly supported \nlegislation; I don't see how there could be objection to it--while we \ncontinue to work to find ways to move other legislation while \ncommittees are meeting.\n  I understand the pressure that Senators feel on both sides of the \naisle on other issues, but I don't see why that should cause us to halt \nor prevent us from taking up a very noncontroversial, broadly \nbipartisan supported legislation like S. 419.\n  I am also hopeful that this week we could take up the adoption \nlegislation that we have been holding in abeyance for a week. And the \nSenator from Ohio, Senator DeWine, has done very good work on that and \nI believe is prepared to spend time on the floor when we call up that \nlegislation. I hope it will be in the next coming days.\n  Let us be clear about what this legislation does, the birth defects \nlegislation. No one in this body needs to be told that birth defects \nare the leading cause of infant mortality in this country. They are \ndirectly responsible for one 1 of every 5 infant deaths. Here is a \nchance to do something about that, not in a week, not in a month, but \nthis afternoon with, I am sure, not very long debate but enough debate \nso that the issue can be properly addressed.\n  We have spent the last couple of hours or so talking about other \nissues other than this bill which we had hoped to call up and begin \ndebating.\n  No one needs to be told that every year some 150,000 infants are born \nwith a serious birth defect. Here is a chance to do something about \nthat.\n  Here is a chance to foster the most effective--and, by the way, the \nmost cost effective--ways to prevent birth defects.\n  We now know that folic acid vitamin supplements can prevent spina \nbifida. We know that programs to promote avoidance of alcohol, \nespecially early in pregnancy, can dramatically reduce a whole range of \nbirth defects.\n  We want to get that knowledge out to those who need it. Senator \nBond's bill would do that through regional research programs to \nidentify the causes of clusters of birth defects.\n  His bill, which, by the way, is cosponsored by more than a score of \nSenators on both sides of the aisle, makes the Centers for Disease \nControl the lead agency for surveillance of birth defects and \nprevention activities to reduce their incidence.\n  His bill proposes grants to public and nonprofit groups to foster \npublic awareness in ways to prevent birth defects. It would also set up \na National Information Clearinghouse on Birth Defects.\n  This legislation, to which there has been objection, is really \nimportant and is endorsed by a wide range of groups: The American \nAcademy of Pediatrics, the American Association of Mental Retardation, \nthe American Hospital Association, the Association of Maternal and \nChild Health Programs, the American Public Health Association, the \nCouncil of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, the March of Dimes, \nthe National Association of Children's Hospitals, the National \nPerinatal Association, the National Easter Seal Society, and the Spina \nBifida Association.\n  On their behalf, I again renew my concern. There has been objection \nto this bill. On their behalf, I ask that we confer and see if we \ncannot find a way to bring up this legislation, if not today, tomorrow, \nwhile we work on other solutions to other problems.\n  It is not a partisan issue. It is not controversial. And all that \nSenator Bond has sought has received support across the political lines \nand he has urged that we take it up this week. It would be different if \nit were controversial or if this were a partisan issue. But it is not. \nIt is one that I think we certainly need to get passed. And a lot of \ngood work has gone into it. And I will continue to ask that it be \nbrought up this week. And I will certainly confer with the leaders on \nthe other side of the aisle as we try to find a way to bring to the \nconsideration of the Senate legislation that would help with this very \nserious and very difficult problem of birth defects.\n  So now I ask----\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield for a comment or question from the \nDemocratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. As I indicated earlier, Mr. President, I am a cosponsor \nof this legislation. So obviously I am very supportive of it. But it \nshould be noted this legislation has not had a hearing, it has not been \nmarked up in the committee.\n  The majority leader--and it is his right to do so--is discharging the \ncommittee to bring this bill to the floor. Now, that is an abnormal \nprocedure. That is not something we do every day. Yet the distinguished \nmajority leader has seen fit to bring this bill to the floor without an \nofficial markup, and then to amend it with an amendment that we only \nsaw late yesterday. And so it is really not normal legislative \nprocedure to consider a bill of this import, even though there may not \nbe much controversy associated with it, to discharge it, to amend it \nwith an amendment nobody has seen, and to move in this process.\n  So it is not only our concern for the disaster legislation but our \nconcern for\n\n[[Page S5478]]\n\nprocess here that makes me skeptical about the approach the \ndistinguished majority leader has chosen to employ in this regard. So I \nwould hope we could work together, if we can once get this disaster \nbill passed, to take up the bill, but I really hope we can respect the \nnormal order here and allow the committees to move and to consider \nbills and then report them out, put them on the calendar, and take them \nup off the calendar as we would in normal circumstances.\n\n  But I thank the majority leader for his willingness to allow me to \ncomment on that particular bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would respond to that, if I could, that \ncertainly it is again not controversial. There has been a lot of work \ndone on it. There have been hearings on this bill. And I believe an \nalmost identical provision, if not identical, was a part of the \ncomprehensive health legislation that came up last year. That was a \ndifferent Congress, but it is not as if it is a new idea. It has been \naround for awhile. And a number of Senators are very familiar with what \nit would do, including the Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. President, because he has been so diligent in his effort to wait \nto be heard, and recognizing that it does not appear we are going to be \nable to work out some agreement where he could make a statement, I, if \nI can, yield to the Senator from Minnesota for the purposes of a \nquestion so that he could at least address a question that frames his \nconcerns in this area.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. Leader.\n  I just would like to take a few moments to address a couple concerns \nand questions. And as I think we are all very disappointed in the fact \nthat yesterday President Clinton vetoed the emergency aid bill which \nwould provide $5.5 billion in disaster relief nationwide--and that \ncomes with a major portion of those dollars directed toward rebuilding \nand repairing those communities that have been devastated by floods in \nmy home State of Minnesota and, of course, the Dakotas--our legislation \nI think sent a very clear message that the people of Minnesota have not \nbeen forgotten by Congress at this time.\n  And I just really am concerned and disturbed by the fact that the \nPresident has used, as his primary excuse for vetoing the emergency \nflood relief bill, our inclusion of a measure that would go on to \nprotect these very same victims this fall from what could become a \nmanmade disaster if we do not come to some time agreement between the \nCongress and the President on funding legislation in the budget debates \ncoming this fall. So for those reasons, I raised repeatedly on the \nfloor that I believe that delivering this bill to the President is of \nutmost importance.\n  And I just ask the leader if all considerations have been made or \ntaken into account of trying to get this issue to the President again, \nto have him somehow--I would like to remind my colleagues who voted for \nthis bill a week ago, that if they say these issues are so \ncontroversial, why did they then vote and approve this bill by 67 \nvotes, as the majority leader said, last week and move this on to the \nPresident?\n  So when they say that we are unbending and not willing to compromise \non the issue, that it is ``our way or no way,'' really that is what we \nare hearing from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, that if it is \nnot the President's way, it will be no way.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will respond to the question and comments \nframing that question by the Senator from Minnesota. I appreciate what \nhe has had to say. And I appreciate his interest in getting this \nassistance provided. He has been constructive and helpful in that he \nhas been suggesting a variety of ways we could try to come to an \nagreement on how to proceed here.\n  He is absolutely right that, as a matter of fact, what we passed last \nweek was a compromise. There had been funds added, language added. And, \nas a matter of fact, the language dealing with the Government shutdown \nprevention was a compromise provision. Senator McCain, one of the \noriginal sponsors, along with Senator Hutchison, offered an amendment \nand actually raised the level of funding whereby the Government would \ncontinue basically at the current year level until an agreement was \nreached on the next year's appropriations bills.\n  So it was compromise language. I mean, it should not go without \npeople's notice that it got 67 votes here in the Senate. This matter \ncan be resolved. It can be done quickly. It could have already been \ndealt with if the President just signed the bill.\n  The President is not without tools to work with the Congress. But he \nmust understand--and I know the American people understand--that we, as \nrepresentatives of the people, have a coequal voice in this Government. \nWe have a right to be heard. And we have a right to have very important \nissues that we are concerned about addressed.\n  So I again appreciate the Senator's patience here and his \nsuggestions. I know he is going to continue to work with leadership on \nboth sides of the aisle and across the Capitol where he served in \ntrying to find an appropriate solution to this problem.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would also like to inquire of the Senator \nfrom Texas. Senator Hutchison, had indicated that she had hoped to be \nable to speak. I wonder if she has a question she would like to \npropound at this time because I would be able to yield to her at this \ntime, under the rules we find ourselves confronted with, only for a \nquestion. So I ask that she frame her comments in the form of a \nquestion.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I was really wanting to question in the arena of a timetable for \nkinds of disaster relief.\n  It was indicated by one of the Senators from North Dakota that \nperhaps it was all or nothing, as if the entire supplemental \nappropriations bill was part of an emergency disaster. And I was just \ngoing to ask the distinguished majority leader if he was not thinking \nthat perhaps there are certainly judgment calls that we can make.\n  I think the majority leader is saying that if we are going to make \nsome very slimmed down bill to provide for emergency assistance--I \nthink the distinguished majority leader would agree with me, there is \nalso $30 million for plane crash investigations; $6 million to the FBI \nto reimburse New York State, but New York State has had ongoing \nexpenses with regard to TWA flight 800; $197 million for the National \nPark Service; $103 million for Fish and Wildlife; $67 million for the \nForest Service; $20 million for the Bureau of Indian affairs; $585 \nmillion for the Army Corps of Engineers.\n  I am just wondering if the majority leader doesn't think that perhaps \nthese are supplemental appropriations that are not of an emergency \nnature and that maybe Congress would be able to make a judgment call if \nin fact we were talking about emergency relief. Because it seems to me \nthat some of the Senators are saying that, ``Look. We want everything, \nbut your issues aren't important. The issue of process, of not being \nable to shut down Government isn't important.''\n  It may not be important to someone on the other side of the aisle, \nbut it is very important to many people on our side of the aisle that \nwe have a process by which we say to people, here is what you can \nexpect. Veterans can expect to get their pension benefits on time, \nregardless of whether Congress and the President have not agreed on a \nparticular appropriations bill, that Federal employees can expect to \nget their checks on time regardless of whether there is an agreement \nbetween the President and Congress.\n  So, you know, I think that there are a lot of issues. And I sincerely \nbelieve that it is important for us to set the process of how we are \ngoing to handle appropriations this year. Perhaps others do not think \nthat is important. But to say, ``You take all of our issues. Throw away \nall of yours. And that's the only thing that will be acceptable,'' \nseems to me to be a little unreasonable.\n  I just ask the majority leader if he would put all of these other \nsupplemental appropriations in the same position as some part of the \nemergency bill that really is an emergency where funds really might not \nbe available if there are funds like that?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in responding to the question by the Senator \nfrom Texas, obviously I think that she\n\n[[Page S5479]]\n\nis suggesting a route that is appropriate. There is a difference \nbetween a supplemental appropriations in its normal sense and a \nsupplemental appropriations that includes some emergency provisions. \nClearly, they could be separated out and moved as the Senator from \nTexas has suggested.\n  I want to commend the Senator from Texas for her work as a member of \nthe Appropriations Committee, a member that knows what is in the bill \nand what is not. And I think some Senators have not had an opportunity \nto look at all the things that have been added in terms of language and \nadditional spending and programs which may be worthwhile but which are \nmuch more in the supplemental range, not in the emergency range, and \nalso could be dealt with in the regular appropriations process.\n  We are in the period of time now in this year when we ought to be \ndoing our regular appropriations bills. And the need for a supplemental \nfor many of these provisions has been long since past.\n  Also, I just have to say, the idea of resolving this issue about the \nannual confusion at the end of the fiscal year, the threats of and in \nfact the shutdowns of programs or Agencies, Departments of the \nGovernment, that idea originated with the Senator from Texas and \nSenator McCain. They are the ones who said we need to resolve this now, \nnot October 1 or October 15 or November 1 when we are going through \nthese fiascoes.\n  The suggestion was that we solve this problem now. The language that \nwas introduced, which was subsequently compromised, by the way, to \nraise the funding above what the Senator from Texas wanted, originated \nfrom her.\n  I challenge anybody in this institution or anywhere to suggest that \nthe Senator from Texas is not concerned about the need for the disaster \nassistance or the funds for the Department of Defense. She knows that \nthis issue is important, and she also knows it can be resolved. It can \nbe resolved quickly and it can be resolved in terms of working out \nlanguage that would serve the American people well in stopping these \nannual Government shutdown activities.\n  I commend her for the work she has done, the leadership she has \nprovided, and for the fact she continues to say we can work through \nthis with language which may be different from what she originally \nstarted with but with language that is acceptable, or that we go with \nemergency language only.\n  I yield to the Senator from Texas for a further question.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I appreciate the distinguished majority leader \nyielding to me for a question because I do have a question. I think it \nis not a matter even of the supplemental appropriations, that they are \nnot worthy, but I think timing is the issue.\n  I just sense that all of a sudden the ground is shaking. First they \nsaid, ``Just pass the clean emergency help to the victims.'' That was \nthe first thing that was said. Now, then, you said, well, OK, let's \ntalk about what is an emergency, and I am seeing all of a sudden a \ndifferent argument, a different argument that says, oh, wait a minute, \nwhat do you mean, that there might be some parts of this bill that \nwould not be part of the emergency?\n  In fact, there are billions in this bill that are supplemental. They \nare good. We hope they will pass. But they are not an emergency.\n  So if you are going to say that it is not important to provide for \nthe orderly transition of fiscal years right now in the first \nappropriations bill that has come on the floor this year--Mr. \nPresident, I think the distinguished majority leader will agree that we \nhave not had another appropriations bill on the floor. If we are not \ngoing to set the process right now for how we are going to handle the \ntransition of fiscal years in an orderly and responsible way, when \nwould we do it? Would we do it 1 month before the end of the fiscal \nyear so people would not be able to plan, so that we would not know for \nsure exactly what was going to happen, so that Federal employees would \nnot know for sure that we would not have another Government shutdown, \nso that veterans would not know for sure that their pension checks \nwould be on time?\n  I think to say that now all of a sudden it is not just emergency \nrelief but also everything in the supplemental appropriation which is \nimportant to many people in this body--but so is the resolution about \nnot shutting down Government important to a number of people in this \nbody.\n  I think the distinguished majority leader in good faith said, well, \nwould you like for us to consider a pared down emergency for anything \nthat would not be covered already under the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency funds which we know have at least $2 billion in the \ncoffers right now that are going right now to the victims in North \nDakota, South Dakota and Minnesota? The money is going in. There may be \na few places where it is not going in, so the distinguished majority \nleader, as I understand it, is saying, OK, we should make a list of \nthose where there really is an emergency, not supplemental but \nemergency, and would you consider working with us to pass that?\n  Now, all of a sudden, it seems that the argument is changing and we \nare saying, oh, no, we not only need the emergency appropriations that \nmight not be covered if there are categories like that, but, in \naddition, we must also have all of the supplemental appropriations for \nthe National Park Service, for the Fish and Wildlife Service, for the \nForest Service, for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, for the Army Corps of \nEngineers, for the Postal Service fund, for the bulk cheese price \nsurvey, for the food stamp changes, for grants to local education \nagencies. Now, I have no doubt these are important appropriations, but \nare they emergency? That is the question that I ask the distinguished \nmajority leader.\n  Once he said, ``I am willing to talk about a pared down real \nemergency,'' all of a sudden it seems to me that now we are shifting to \na different issue. We are shifting now to a whole different argument, \nand they are saying you have to take everything in the bill that the \ndistinguished Senators from North Dakota want, take out everything that \nthe distinguished Senators on this side of the aisle were hoping to get \nin the way of process to establish a process in the appropriations \nbill, the first one this year.\n  It is like saying we have all the cards. But that is not the way \nAmerica is. We work together here. I think we have the ability to \ndetermine if there are emergencies that are not being met, and if that \nis the issue, then I think we would be able to solve it.\n  I just ask the majority leader if he believes that we have the \nability to determine what is an emergency and what is a supplement.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, clearly, the Senator from Texas, Senator \nHutchison, is right on this. She knows her business. She is on the \nAppropriations Committee.\n\n  I do not know what the exact figure is but probably of the $8.6 \nbillion in this supplemental, well over half of it could not remotely \nqualify as disaster. It is probably in the range of $5 billion to $6 \nbillion of the $8.6 that would not qualify as emergency disaster, \neither because it is not directly needed and/or because it could be \nhandled through the regular appropriations bills. Clearly, a large \nportion of this bill would not qualify as emergency disaster. Again I \ndo not know the exact amount. We have to hear further from the \ncommittee members, and I presume we will as the time goes forward.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the majority reader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will yield if the Senator allows me to make a couple of \npoints. I want to go back and reconfirm something I said a moment ago \nto make sure it is correct in the Record.\n  The bill that we are trying to get brought up, the birth defects \nbill, is not a new bill. It was one that has had a lot of work, and the \nsubstitute that we have now is going to be considered when we get \npermission to bring it up. There has been objection to bringing up the \nbirth defects bill by the Democrats. It is almost identical to the \nlanguage that was approved by the committee on Labor and Human \nResources in 1995 and passed the full Senate in September 1996 as part \nof the Health Profession's Education Consolidation and Reauthorization \nAct, S. 555.\n  So the Senate is familiar with this. The Senate has worked on it. The \nSenate has voted on it. It is not a new\n\n[[Page S5480]]\n\nissue or one that we are trying to put out without it having been \nconsidered by committee or having been considered by the full Senate in \nthe recent past.\n  I want the Record also to reflect that I have tried to get the \nDemocrats to agree for the Armed Services Committee to meet, and other \ncommittees, on very important issues. They have objected to bringing up \nthe birth defects bill. They have objected to the Armed Services \nCommittee meeting, the Foreign Relations Committee meeting, the Science \nCommittee from meeting. I even offered an opportunity for us to divide \nan hour of debate time equally on both sides and to get an agreement \nwhere we could have extended debate tonight, and I suggested even as \nlate as midnight, 6 hours, 7 hours, whatever amount of time that might \nhave been called for. But that was not accepted because they would not \nagree for the Armed Services Committee to meet and to do their markup \nwork.\n  I want to say again, my Democratic colleagues have objected to \nbringing up the birth defects bill, they have objected to very \nimportant committees meeting with very important witnesses, and a \nmarkup of the Department of Defense. They have objected to dividing the \ntime equally so all Senators can be heard in 10-minute segments of \ntheir own time, and they have even refused an offer that I have made \nfor this debate to go on for an extended period of time, perhaps even \nas late as midnight tonight.\n  Now, before I make any further motion, did the Senator from North \nDakota have a question he would like to ask? And I yield for the \npurpose of a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I do, and of course the majority leader has the power of \nscheduling in the U.S. Senate. The objection that we raised was an \nobjection based on the understanding that the unanimous-consent request \npropounded by the majority leader was that he would remain in control \nat the end of the period of whether we had an opportunity to speak \nagain and when we had an opportunity to speak again.\n  We have had, on two occasions now, a motion made to adjourn the \nSenate and a vote on that, and the majority leader has then adjourned \nthe Senate twice last week and now apparently today, and some of us \nfeel very strongly that we wish to continue to discuss and to push and \nprod to see if we cannot get a disaster bill passed without the \nextraneous or unrelated amendments attached to it that have caused a \nveto.\n  Now, the reason I rise to ask a question, as I listened intently to \nthe question asked by the Senator from Texas--and she indicated to the \nmajority leader that this was, really, the only appropriations vehicle \nor the first appropriations vehicle that was available for her to \nexercise an option to deal with the continuing resolution or Government \nshutdown amendment.\n  In fact, there is a House appropriations bill on the calendar, H.R. \n581, that the Senator from Texas and others who wish to propose their \namendment could offer to attach their amendment to. In addition to \nthat, there are 13 additional appropriations bills that will follow \nthat they can certainly attempt to attach their amendment to.\n  But the title of this piece of legislation is an appropriations bill \nmaking emergency supplemental appropriations for recovery from natural \ndisaster and so on. I am assuming that those who decided to attach it \nto this piece of legislation did so because by its very title it is an \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill for recovery from natural \ndisasters.\n  The Senator from Texas makes the point, as the Senator \nfrom Mississippi, there are some things in here that are not an \nemergency. That is a quarrel I suspect the Senator would have with the \nAppropriations Committee heads and others. There may well be some \nthings in here that are not an emergency. I have no objection to taking \nthose things and moving them aside and passing the disaster portions of \nthis bill.\n\n  I say that it seems to me, at least viewing it, that those who have \nattached this amendment to this bill have done so believing that this \nbill is a must-pass piece of legislation because it is an emergency \nand, therefore, it is a way of moving their agenda along on this \nGovernment shutdown amendment. My point is there are 13 more bills. Do \nit on another bill. Do it on the House bill resting at the desk of the \nSenate, but do not do it in a way holding up disaster relief.\n  I am happy to propound the question. It is now 2\\1/2\\ weeks beyond \nthe adjournment for the Memorial Day recess, which is the time when we \nshould have passed this legislation, 2\\1/2\\ weeks beyond that, and the \nfact is we are now in a circumstance where it does not appear we are \nany closer to passing a piece of legislation that the President will be \nable to sign. Will the majority leader, at least from the Senate side, \nindicate to us that he feels that we can get this thing passed this \nweek in a manner that allows it to be signed?\n  Mr. LOTT. I would be willing to work with him in that regard. I think \nwe definitely can do it. I believe we will have some time here in a \nmoment where maybe we can talk about that.\n  Here is the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He is \nconvening. I have seen him work miracles before, and I know he is \nprepared to do that again this time with the help from the Senators \nfrom North Dakota and the Senator from Texas.\n  Does the Senator from Oklahoma wish to ask a question with regard to \nthe situation?\n  Mr. NICKLES. If I could just ask a question, because I understand our \ncolleagues from North Dakota wish to speak on this issue. I know some \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle would like to speak.\n  Correct me if I am wrong; did you not offer to allow debate on this \nand other issues, maybe debate as late at 12 o'clock tonight? That is \nalmost an additional 8 hours.\n  Mr. LOTT. I knew it came as a shock to the Senator from Oklahoma, but \nhe is right.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I did not want to stay for all of that, but I think the \nSenator from Mississippi, the majority leader, is being generous with \ntime.\n  If our colleagues are going to object to the offer that the majority \nleader made, I do not think they are showing good faith, and that does \nnot increase the likelihood of getting things done.\n  Now, correct me if I am wrong; I ask the majority leader this \nquestion, the majority leader asked permission for the committees to \nmeet?\n  Mr. LOTT. Correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. And stated his intentions to allow the Senate to be able \nto debate this and other issues on time equally divided; is that not \ncorrect?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. My comment would be to the majority leader that I think \nyou are being very generous and I hope our colleagues will cooperate.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I appreciate the questioning of the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, and I say that the procedure which I am about to carry \nout here has been forced by the fact that we can't get consideration of \nthe birth defect legislation, we can't get permission for key \ncommittees to meet, and we can't get a time agreement on how the debate \nwill occur.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/10/senate-section/article/S5477-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              QUORUM CALL\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
