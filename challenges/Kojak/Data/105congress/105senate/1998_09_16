The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I said it was a short amendment. It is in \nfact a short amendment. It is a very straightforward amendment. It \nwould actually strike a rider that has been placed in this bill that \ndeals with oil royalty payments that are due Federal taxpayers.\n\n[[Page S10394]]\n\n  Mr. President, Senator Bumpers, Senator Durbin, Senator Daschle and \nSenator Wellstone are joining me today to offer an amendment to repeal \na special interest rider that has been attached to the Interior \nappropriations bill. And I think, to put it in very, very \nstraightforward terms, the taxpayers are being robbed. Now, that is a \npretty strong statement, but I can back it up. They are being robbed to \nthe tune of $5.5 million a month, and that is a lot of money, Mr. \nPresident. It adds up real fast to many, many millions of dollars, and \nover years, hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  If any one of us were standing outside on the street and we saw \nsomeone's purse being snatched, and we saw somebody grab that purse and \ntake the money out and pocket it, we would act like good Samaritans and \nwe would say that is wrong. Well, I think it is wrong when we see the \nmost powerful companies in this country--only 5 percent of the oil \ncompanies in this country are doing this--not paying their fair share \nof royalty payments.\n  How do I know this is a fact? Because there have been lawsuits, Mr. \nPresident. All over this country the oil companies have, in fact, \nsettled and admitted--admitted--they underpaid their royalties.\n  I am very pleased that the Senator from Illinois has wound his way \nover here because he and I have worked on this together, as well as \nSenator Bumpers and Senator Wellstone. I was very proud that in the \ncommittee my motion to remove this rider got the support of Senator \nByrd. And that is because wrong is wrong and right is right. It is \nwrong for the powerful oil companies, with teams of lawyers, to be able \nto take away the rightful funds of taxpayers.\n  Now, what does this rider do?\n  The rider prevents the Interior Department from acting to ensure that \noil companies pay their fair share of royalties for oil drilled on \npublic lands.\n  Now, if you are asking what a royalty payment is, it is very simple. \nIt is like a rent payment. The oil companies drill on Federal land, \nthey have to pay a royalty payment, 12.5 percent of the value of the \noil that they find on Federal land. What do we do with it in the \nFederal Government? It goes straight to the Land and Water Conservation \nFund, which is the fund that purchases parks, to the Historic \nPreservation Fund, and a share of it goes to the States. What do the \nStates do with it? They do with it what State law requires. In the case \nof my State of California, those royalty payments go directly to the \nschools.\n  So this amendment that I am offering, if we are fortunate enough to \npass it and we can strip this rider out, will mean more money for \nschoolchildren and more money for the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  Now, this royalty payment is not a tax. It is a payment that the oil \ncompanies sign on to pay. They sign on to an agreement, just as you do \nif you lease an apartment. It says:\n\n       The value of production for purposes of computing royalty \n     on production from this lease shall never be less than the \n     fair market value of the production.\n\n  Keep that in mind. The oil companies have signed on to a lease that \nsays that their royalty payments ``shall never be less than the fair \nmarket value of the production.''\n  What has been happening? A small percentage of oil companies are \npaying a royalty not on the fair market value of the production, but on \na made up price. A price that they, themselves, make up. I will explain \nthat later. As a result of this phantom price system, they value the \noil at a lower price than the market price. Taxpayers, therefore, are \ngetting 12.5 percent of a lower price. Taxpayers are getting robbed, \nplain and simple. Only 5 percent of the oil companies are doing this, \n95 percent are not. We want to make sure those 5 percent, the bad \nactors, pay their fair share.\n  That is what our amendment will do. It will strip out a rider that \nsays to the Interior Department, ``Stop what you are doing to fix this \nproblem.'' The rider in this bill says to the Interior Department, \nessentially, ``Stop what you are doing to fix this problem.'' The \nInterior Department is trying to get millions of dollars back for \ntaxpayers. They are being stopped by a rider in an appropriations bill.\n  It is a very simple issue. Believe me, it will be contorted to make \nit look complicated, but it isn't complicated. For years, oil companies \nhave been cheating the American taxpayers out of millions, if not \nbillions, of dollars. The Department of Interior took action to stop \nthe cheating. And now, the Senate Appropriations Committee, pretty much \non a party line vote, said to the Interior Department, ``You can't fix \nthe problem.'' What we are doing in our amendment is saying, ``Yes, you \ncan, Interior Department, fix the problem. Do it in a fair way, go \nafter the 5 percent of the oil companies that are cheating the people. \nFix the problem.''\n  Now, how do we know that they are cheating? First of all, common \nsense will tell you. We have a chart that shows the difference between \nthe posted price and the market price. We know that the Interior \nDepartment has already billed 12 companies over $260 million for past \nroyalty underpayments. So we know there is a problem. The Interior \nDepartment wouldn't do that if they didn't think they had proof that \nthere has been cheating. There have been settlements in five States on \nroyalty underpayments. California has collected $350 million; Alaska, \n$2.5 billion; Texas, $17.5 million; Louisiana collected $10 million; \nNew Mexico collected $8 million. So the States are ahead of us on this. \nThey are suing the companies because the States know they are being \ncheated, and they are collecting.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, Mobil Oil paid an additional $56.5 million in \nsettlement. Now, oil companies would not have settled for these large \nsums of money if they truly believed they could justify their royalty \npayments. You don't go and say, ``Here are millions of dollars. I'm \nreally innocent, but let's just get this over with.'' I don't know of \nany company that would turn over $56 million, or $2.5 billion, if they \ndidn't think they were liable for it.\n  Here is the issue. This chart shows ARCO as an example. This is the \nmarket price of oil in the west Texas market, in the blue on this \nchart. This is what ARCO said the price was. It is very easy to see the \nchart and see the difference, the area where we should be collecting \nmoney. Another chart shows the Koch Oil Company, the same thing. This \nis the market price in the blue line in the Louisiana market, and the \nred line is what they said the market price was.\n  We also know that in February 1998 the Department of Justice \nintervened in a lawsuit under the False Claims Act, accusing five major \noil companies of knowingly undervaluing oil extracted from public land \nand thus paying lower royalties. The suit was originally filed in the \nU.S. district court in Lufkin, TX, by three private parties. The \nJustice Department entered the suit because of the overwhelming \nevidence against the companies. These lawsuits are still pending, and \nthe Justice Department is continuing its investigation of the remaining \nseven companies that have been billed by the Interior Department. Under \nthe False Claims Act, the United States may recover, on behalf of \ntaxpayers, three times the amount of its losses plus civil penalties.\n  If anyone comes on this floor and says there is no cheating--and they \nwill--if anyone comes on this floor and says, ``There is nothing there, \nSenator Boxer; what is the fuss?'' I will show them exactly what the \nfuss is all about. And that is the underpayment of royalties that the \noil companies promised to pay. Remember:\n\n       The value of production for purposes of computing royalty \n     on production from this lease shall never be less than the \n     fair market value of the production.\n\n  And we know what the fair market value is because there is an open \nmarket on these prices.\n  Who benefits from this rider that is on this appropriations bill that \nSenator Durbin, Senator Wellstone, Senator Bumpers, and I, and others \nare trying to remove? Who wins? Five percent of the oil companies.\n  If you hear someone come on this floor and say this is an attack on \nsmall oil companies, this is an attack on the mom-and-pop oil \ncompanies, that is just not true. Five percent of the oil companies, \nthe biggest oil companies, are the only ones who are affected by this \nrule; 95 percent of them are not, and there is no change. So we are \ntalking about a rider that protects 5 percent of the oil companies--\nnamely, the biggest oil companies in the country\n\n[[Page S10395]]\n\nwho make billions of dollars and who are not paying their fair share of \nroyalties and basically have admitted it in lawsuit after lawsuit after \nlawsuit--maybe not technically, but when you settle for those amounts \nof money, you know they don't want to go to court about it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe names of the companies who are affected by this rule.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                             Paid vs.                 Liability\n               Companies                 (Oil and gas J.)

Mr. President, let the Record show that we have 1\\1/2\\ \npages of companies that are affected by the rule, and we literally have \n34 pages of all the companies that are not affected by this rule. So \nwe, in this amendment, are going after only the 5 percent of oil \ncompanies that are cheating the taxpayers, and 95 percent of them are \nunaffected by this rule. So the only one that is benefited by this \nrider, as it stands in the bill, is big oil.\n  The delays caused by this and other riders will cost taxpayers--hold \non to your hats--$82 million in taxpayer money lost by this rider--$5.5 \nmillion a month for 15 months, from June of 1998 when the rules were \nexpected to be finalized and this problem was supposed to be taken care \nof.\n  I would like to share with you an editorial in the USA Today about \nthis issue. I am going to read it because I think it is worth reading. \nIt is one thing when I say this; it is another thing when an USA Today \neditorial says it.\n\n       Today's debate: oil, politics and money.\n       Time to clean up big oil's slick deal with Congress.\n       Industry's Effort to Avoid Paying Full Fees Hurts \n     Taxpayers, Others.\n\n  Imagine being able to compute your own rent payments and grocery \nbills, giving yourself a 3 to 10 percent discount off the market price. \nOver time, that would add up to really big bucks. And imagine having \nthe political clout to make sure nothing threatened to change that cozy \narrangement.\n\n       According to government and private studies, that's the \n     sweet deal the oil industry is fighting to protect: the right \n     to extract crude oil from public land and pay the government \n     not the open market price, but a lower posted price based on \n     private deals the oil companies can manipulate for their own \n     benefit.\n       Big oil has contributed more than $35 million to national \n     political committees and congressional candidates in that \n     time--a modest investment in protecting the royalty pricing \n     arrangement that's enabled the industry to pocket an extra $2 \n     billion.\n\n  This is USA Today speaking. I don't associate myself with that \nthought. I think there are people here who are not motivated by this. \nBut I think it is interesting that that is the perception of USA Today. \nThey go on about the lost payments:\n\n       That's millions missing in action from the battle to reduce \n     the Federal deficit and from accounts for the land and water \n     conservation, historical preservation, and several Native \n     American tribes. In addition, public schools in 24 States \n     have been shortchanged. States use their share of Federal \n     royalties for education funding.\n       But the taxpayers have been getting the unfair end of this \n     deal for far too long. One major producer, Atlantic \n     Richfield, has already adopted market pricing for calculating \n     its royalty payments.\n\n  In other words, Atlantic Richfield has stepped out and done the right \nand corporate-responsible thing.\n\n       Instead of protecting industry recalcitrants and campaign \n     contributors, the Congress should protect the public \n     interest.\n\n  I want to identify and associate myself with that thought. I know \ncolleagues believe it is in the best interest of America to stop the \nInterior Department from moving ahead with their rule. But if you \nreally look at it and you see that we are being shortchanged by $6 \nmillion--$5.5 million to be exact--every month, that hurts taxpayers. \nAs I said, it is just the same as seeing a purse being snatched and a \nlittle lady running after the criminal saying, ``Give me back my \nmoney.'' Well, we can do a cartoon here of the oil companies--only 5 \npercent of them, the bad actors here--snatching the taxpayers' purse to \nthe tune of $66 million each and every year, and having the taxpayers \nsay, ``Wait a minute, that's ours. You signed a royalty agreement and \nyou said it shall never be less than the fair market value of the \nproduction.''\n  I know there are many others who wish to speak, Mr. President, so I \nwill soon conclude my remarks. But I want to make one point about why \nthis is happening. The big oil companies are so large that they have \naffiliates to whom they sell. The problem is that if they sell to their \nown affiliates, that is called a ``non-arm's-length transaction.'' So \nif I have a product to sell on the market, because I don't own an \naffiliate, it is a very easy way to calculate the royalty. You go out \non the marketplace, sell it to the highest bidder--you know what the \nmarket price is--and you pay a royalty payment of 12.5 percent on that \nprice. If you own your own affiliate, you can pay whatever you want. So \nthey sell it at a\n\n[[Page S10396]]\n\nlower price because they control the price, and then they go ahead and \npay the royalty payment on the lower price that they control. It is \nvery much like what the USA Today said about being able to manipulate \nthe price. They say, ``Imagine being able to compute your own rent \npayments and your own grocery bill.'' That is a pretty good deal.\n  But if you are the landlord and you pay yourself rent, you could pay \nyourself any amount and you won't evict yourself. That is what is \nhappening here. They are selling the oil at a lower price because they \ncontrol the affiliate, and then they pay the royalty payment on the \nlower price. Whereas, the oil companies that are smaller, that don't \nown the affiliate, have to go by the market price.\n  Let's show that chart one more time. Here you have a case of a \ncompany that owns its affiliate and sells to its own affiliate at the \nposted price--the red line--when the market price that all the smaller \ncompanies have to pay is up here. The difference between the red and \nblue lines is the area of cheating. That is what we are trying to \nrecover.\n  So, Mr. President, I am honored that I have been able to offer this \namendment. I am very pleased that Senator Gorton showed me great \ncourtesy in allowing me to open up the debate this morning because it \nis an issue that is very important. Frankly, when it came up in the \nAppropriations Committee, we had to struggle to even get a minute or \ntwo to discuss it. It was almost as if people didn't want it to be \ndiscussed. I am very proud today that we now have time so Senator \nDurbin can speak on its behalf, as well as Senator Wellstone, and \nothers, and some on the other side can have a chance to be heard.\n  In concluding this portion of my remarks, let me thank my colleagues \nfor their interest. Let me say that there aren't too many \nstraightforward issues around here, and people are going to tell you \nthis isn't straightforward. But for over 2\\1/2\\ years the Interior \nDepartment has tried to come up with a fair way to make sure the oil \ncompanies pay their fair share of royalty payments. They have done so.\n  In my next series of remarks I will read you the accolades the \nInterior Department is getting for the way they went about this. And \nwhat do we do in the face of finally straightening out a mess that has \ncaused lawsuits, has meant that kids in California are not getting \npayments into the classroom, has meant that the Land and Water \nConservation Fund and Native Indian tribes and the Historic \nPreservation Fund have been cheated out of funds? We get a rider that \nsays to the Interior Department: Sorry, we don't like what you are \ndoing. Stop short right here, and let's not do anything to recover \nthese royalty payments.\n  Mr. President, I think that is wrong. I would like to see the \nInterior Department be allowed to do its job and, therefore, we offer \nthis amendment with the best of intentions to allow the Interior \nDepartment to move forward on this rule.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I will later participate in the debate.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me ask the Senator from California, \nIs there any urgency on her side to conclude her remarks? We can wait. \nWe have others who want to speak.\n  Mrs. BOXER. There are several others.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator from California has 1\\1/2\\ hours. We have \n1\\1/2\\ hours. I am not sure we will use all of ours. I don't know \nwhether the Senator from California will use all of theirs. I have a \nfew Senators who want to speak.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think we will be using our time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself just 5 minutes for some \nopening remarks.\n  From our standpoint, I would like very much the distinguished Senator \nfrom Louisiana to take a few minutes of my time because the Senator \nfrom California spoke longer than 5 minutes. I will yield time to the \nSenator from Louisiana for his comments.\n  First of all, Mr. President, it is too bad that the MMS, the Federal \nagency that is establishing these rules, doesn't have better \ncredibility with those that they are proposing rulemaking against. You \nneed not have the industry that you regulate think that you are totally \nagainst them--arbitrary, or somewhat capricious--in order to get your \njob done.\n  As Senator Boxer has indicated on at least three occasions, this only \naffects 5 percent of the oil companies. That is MMS's view. That is the \nagency of the Federal Government that thinks these rules are wonderful.\n  From my standpoint, I would like to tell you what the independent \nproducers say. Frankly, I believe this is as valid as an MMS \nevaluation. The IPAA--that is the independents across America--say that \nthe percentage of oil producers impacted by the oil royalty rule is 100 \npercent. In fact, this is their principal concern this year, that these \nproposed regulations, if adopted, will have a serious impact on many, \nmany independent producers. Frankly, I believe that is the case.\n  First all, MMS, the regulating agency, has permitted so broad a \nlatitude under the rubric of unreasonable that I believe they can do \nalmost anything. It is not certain what the rules will be when they are \ncompleted. They will be very uncertain. Litigation will not disappear. \nIt will become more rampant.\n  I would like the statement from the independent oil and gas \nproducers--many of them from my home State, many very small, many going \nbroke today because of low oil prices--be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Percentage of Oil Producers Impacted by Oil Royalty Rule: 100 percent\n\n       It's time to debunk the mistruths surrounding the proposed \n     oil royalty rule. Opponents of the oil industry and the \n     Minerals Management Service claim that America's independent \n     oil producers will not be affected by the proposed \n     rulemaking. Not true.\n\n\n             Rulemaking will cripple independent producers\n\n       Before exposing the sham on this issue, it's necessary to \n     state the position of independent producers on the proposed \n     oil royalty rulemaking. Under the current proposal, no oil \n     producer will be certain that royalty payments to the \n     government are final. In other words, the Interior Department \n     will have license to knock on the doors of independent \n     producers years down the road and demand additional tax \n     payments for oil drilled on federal lands. Not only is the \n     rule a violation of the lease contract between government and \n     industry, it will badly impact the health of independent oil \n     companies who are already on its knees because of the \n     devastatingly low oil prices.\n       The proposed rulemaking will most certainly lead to years \n     of litigation and audit. In fact, IPAA's Board of Governors, \n     who represent over 8,000 independent oil and gas companies, \n     voted yesterday to pursue options to litigation should this \n     rulemaking be implemented. A proposed rule promoting more \n     government and less certainty should not be finalized. \n     Fighting it in the courts is an expensive proposition, but \n     independents are impacted by the rule and will have no choice \n     but to pursue costly litigation for survival.\n\n\n                          Debunking more lies\n\n       Opponents of the oil industry claim the industry-backed \n     moratorium is anti-environmental. Not true. In 1997, the oil \n     industry generated more than $4 billion in revenues from oil \n     and natural gas production on federal lands, much of which is \n     used for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The rulemaking \n     affects accounting procedures, not the environment.\n       Opponents claim the moratorium will cost taxpayers and \n     school children $60 million per year. Not true. Interior has \n     the ability under the current rules to collect all they \n     believe is due and owing regardless of a moratorium.\n\n\n                 All independent oil producers impacted\n\n       Many changes. Like new duty to market at no cost.\n       Second guessing, moving producers to alternative pricing.\n       Chasing arm's-length prices away from the lease.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are here on the floor of the Senate, \nit seems to me, proposing a set of rules that would like to gouge for \noil bucks, gouge for oil royalties.\n  Let me state for the Senate a couple of facts about oil production in \nthe United States and about the cost of oil that I believe are \nstartling.\n  First of all, about 3 weeks ago--I don't know what the exact \nmeasurement is today--one of my staff members drew some comparisons in \nterms of what oil is worth today, what gasoline is worth today for our \nautomobiles and for our Nation. If you go to a supermarket, I say to my \nfriend from Illinois, or if your wife does, and she buys bottled water, \nshe will pay more for a\n\n[[Page S10397]]\n\ngallon of bottled water than Americans are paying for gasoline for \ntheir cars. That is good economics for America, but it is bad economics \nfor America's oil independents, for America's independent producers. \nBecause, just as that truism indicates that gasoline and oil producers \nhave been at an all-time low for the last 5, 6 or 7 years, oil \nproduction is going down in the United States. Many independents who \nhave been stalwarts are literally saying they do not know if they can \nmake their bank payments for 1 additional month.\n  Here we come to the floor with an amendment that is saying, let the \nregulators impose new regulations, and we sing the praises--at least \nthe Senator from California does--that it is going to get more money \nout of the oil companies. That sounds wonderful. In fact, it is kind of \nalleged here this morning that, you know, they--these oil companies--\nare just taking money out of somebody's purse so we ought to go after \nthem like we would go after somebody who took a purse away from \nsomebody.\n  Mr. President, if you are going to take more money from the oil \nproducers of this country--and we are already becoming more and more \ndependent on foreign oil, and the price of oil is going down and down--\nI ask you, won't you in about 3 or 4 or 5 years get less by way of oil \nroyalties than you are getting today by shutting off American \nproduction and causing some more of them to get closed? Where will the \nroyalty come from as we produce less oil, rather than more?\n  So whether it is $60 million, $70 million, $80 million or $100 \nmillion that allegedly will come in, that is not the test of whether \nthe rules are fair. If we imposed those kinds of regulations on any \nindustry we regulated, could we stand up and say we just got $50 \nmillion from the patent applicants of the United States because we just \nincreased the fee? But you have to ask, what is fair, what is right, \nwhat is just, not just are the regulators right because they picked up \nmore money.\n  Before we are finished, we will go through a litany of arbitrary, \nconfusing regulations that they intend to pursue. They are just looking \nfor a little window--I can tell you these regulators are--because there \nis a moratorium right now. They are hoping against hope that they will \nget an 8- or 10-day window when there is no moratorium so they can slap \non these.\n  I want to tell them here and now that they are going to have a hard \ntime doing that, because I believe we will prevail today, and I believe \nwe will make sure that any bill that goes to the President for \nsignature is going to have this on it.\n  Having said that, I reserve the remainder of my time, excepting I \nwould yield whatever amount of time that Senator Breaux from Louisiana \ndesires.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield time to the Senator, 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much remaining time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 56 minutes remaining.\n  The distinguish Senator from Illinois is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague from the \nState of California.\n  Let me say at the outset that this is about more money for California \nschools. It is about more money for land and water conservation, which \nfunds the acquisition of park space and green space across America. It \nis about more money for historic preservation. It is about more money \nfor Indian tribes, Native Americans, who receive benefits from these \nroyalties. This is about a matter of principle on which the Senator \nfrom California is taking the floor to lead the fight. I salute her at \nthe outset, and say to those who are listening to this debate that we \nare fortunate to have people of the caliber of Senator Boxer from the \nState of California who are willing to wage these battles, because, you \nsee, it would have been so easy for us to really kind of look the other \nway with a wink and nod and let this one slip by.\n  This is not an issue that went before a committee with a lot of \ninvestigation, witnesses and hearings so that America could tune in and \nbe part of the debate. This was done on a disaster bill for tornado \nvictims--a bill that was also designed to buy emergency funds for our \ntroops in the Middle East.\n  You say, What could that possibly have to do with the royalties oil \ncompanies pay for drilling on Federal land? The honest answer is that \nit had nothing to do with it. It was put on at a late moment with no \nhearings and with little publicity.\n  I have been around legislatures for about 32 years--State and \nFederal. I can tell you there are two things to keep your eye open for \ntoward the close of business: find out if there is something that just \ngot popped on a bill without any hearings, and find out whether it \nbenefits some large special interest group. Guess what? Bingo. That is \nwhat we are talking about here. Senator Boxer caught it, brought it up \nin the Appropriations Committee, and said to her colleagues, Please \ndon't do this. At least for the taxpayers of this country, take a close \nlook at what is going on here.\n  I salute her for doing that. Her leadership is important, and this \nissue is important. It is about $66 million a year. And I guess by \nFederal standards people say, wait a minute, in a budget that is \ndealing with $1.5 trillion, what does this mean?\n  Well, it means a lot, because for schoolchildren in her State and a \nlot of other States and for the people I mentioned earlier who are \ndependent on these royalties, this is an important amount of money.\n  I think what is more important than the money involved is the \nprinciple that is involved in this. Consider for a moment, you own a \npiece of property and someone comes to you and says, ``I want to rent \nfrom you under one condition, and that is I decide how much rent I am \ngoing to pay you.'' Well, you say, ``Well, at least let's have some \nstandard. Let's have some objective standard.'' And they said, ``Yes, I \nwill tell you what the objective standard will be. I will ask my Uncle \nLouie what's fair.'' And you say to yourself, ``Why would we sign such \na lease?''\n  That is what has happened here. The land that they are drilling for \noil on is land that we own, ladies and gentlemen. It is the land of the \npeople of the United States. It is not land owned by oil companies. \nThey come on our land with our permission to drill oil from our land to \nmake profits for their companies. That is what this is all about. And \nwe say to them, ``Make a profit. That's fine. That's the American way. \nBut we want one-eighth of your profit. We want one-eighth of the cost \nof the oil.'' Those who are involved in the oil business know that is \nnot an unusual request. The owner of the land gets an eighth.\n  The problem here is that the oil companies have said, ``We will \ndetermine an eighth of what. We will determine what Uncle Louie says is \nan eighth.'' And in this situation they won't take a market price that \nthey are supposed to take. They take a price they have absolutely \nfabricated. They have made it up. They trade among themselves. They \npost prices and say, ``This is the price,'' and we know better.\n  The charts the Senator from California brought to us make it clear \nthe taxpayers are being cheated, because a handful of oil companies are \ndeclaring a price that they are basing the royalty on which is a phony, \nfalse price. State after State has turned around and sued them \nsuccessfully for this sort of cheating. And now we are trying to \npromulgate a law here on Capitol Hill in the Senate which condones this \ncheating, saying, ``Keep on reaching in Uncle Sam's pocket, pull out \nall the money you need, play us for Uncle Sucker, and we are going to \nlook the other way.''\n  I do not think we should do that. I do not think that is fair to a \nlot of people. And I really am, in a way, surprised that a lot of oil \ncompanies that have extraordinarily good business reputations would be \ninvolved in this chicanery.\n  I listened to the Senator from New Mexico give a speech. His speech \nis, as far as I am concerned, very accurate. The oil industry in this \ncountry does suffer some problems, particularly independent producers. \nThey come from my State. Illinois is not a major production State, but \nwe have a lot of\n\n[[Page S10398]]\n\nproducers there who have come to see me. And it is a fact that the \nprice of oil and the products of oil are so low that many of them \ncannot survive. It has domestic and international ramifications; I \ndon't question that. But to argue that that situation with the oil \nindustry in general means that we should give a handful of oil \ncompanies, 5 percent of them, an opportunity to reach in the Federal \nTreasury and pull more money out at the expense of taxpayers begs the \nquestion. If you let this 5 percent turn around and absolutely drill \nthe oil for free and not pay the taxpayers a penny, it would not create \na recovery in the oil sector. I am afraid that is what the other side \nis arguing. We are dealing with a small percentage here.\n  And let me tell you what these royalties mean to these large \ncompanies that are drilling on taxpayers' land. The additional \nroyalties represent approximately 1-100th of 1 percent of the $461 \nbillion in 1996 revenues for these companies. We have crocodile tears \nin the Chamber here about these struggling oil companies at a time when \nwe look at their balance sheets, and many of them are making billions \nof dollars and would say to the taxpayers of this country, ``No, we \ncan't pay you a royalty based on the real market price; we want to \ncreate some fiction.'' And so not in the dark of night but in the \ndarkness of a conference committee room, along comes a provision which \nbasically says the Department of Interior may not investigate, may not \ndetermine whether there is fairness in the price that is being charged. \nNo. The Senate of the United States will shut them down and tell them, \nkeep their noses out of these corporate boardrooms.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for 1 minute?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wanted to know if the Senator was aware, when the \nSenator from New Mexico read from the independent oil producers, the \ndirector of the Minerals Management Service sent us over an \nannouncement that I am going to put on everyone's desk that says:\n\n       We understand that information is being provided to \n     Congressional Members indicating that the proposed Federal \n     oil valuation rule will put independent oil companies out of \n     business. This is untrue. The rule will have no impact on \n     independents who sell on the open market.\n\n  And it goes on that only 5 percent of the companies will be impacted.\n  The reason I interrupted my friend was to see if the Senator had seen \nthis, because I think this is the key part of the debate. We know that \nthe companies that are impacted in fact have billions of dollars of \nrevenue. I just wanted to make sure that Senator Durbin from Illinois \nhad seen this, and we will be putting it on everyone's desk.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy that the Senator from California brought up \nthe point, and I have this in my possession. I do not believe we can \nallow these major oil companies to hide behind the skirts of these \nindependent oil producers who are struggling to survive.\n  A letter from Secretary Babbitt that was sent to USA Today on this \nsubject says that his data tells an entirely different story.\n\n       Business is booming in the Gulf of Mexico. The industry \n     recently paid more than $1.3 for new deep water leases in the \n     gulf. Published reports claim there are more jobs available \n     than workers to fill them.\n\n  This is hardly an industry on its knees. And we are talking here \nabout those who will come on our land, the taxpayers' land, the Federal \nland, draw oil from our land to make a profit, who are unwilling to pay \na fair share of that profit back to the taxpayers of this country.\n  Right outside of this Chamber in the corridor is the bust of a man \nwho I consider to be a real inspiration in public life, Theodore \nRoosevelt. I would like to hear Theodore Roosevelt in this debate. If \nyou take a look at this bust here, if you have a chance to see it, it \nlooks like he is about to charge right off the pedestal; that is the \nkind of man he was. And then when you read the sign below it, it says \nthey picked the more common, thoughtful pose; there was one that was \nmore aggressive. I can imagine Theodore Roosevelt in this Chamber \ntalking about the public lands and the exploitation of these lands by \nspecial interest groups and big corporations at the expense of the \ntaxpayers of this country.\n  I might say to my friend from New Mexico, I believe that that \nSenator, if he were one, would have been on your side of the aisle \nmaking our argument, and thank goodness he was there to set the tone in \nthis century for the profit relationship between corporations and the \npublic good. Thank goodness the Senator from California has the courage \nto stand up here and take on the oil giants when it comes to this \nissue.\n  This is simple and straightforward. Will the taxpayers receive a fair \namount from those who would come on our land to drill oil from the \ntaxpayers' resources and whether or not this is going to pass.\n  I say to my colleague from California and those who support her that \nshe has taken on an important issue, one that is critically important \nnot just for the money for those who would receive it but one \nprinciple: If this position that is being espoused by the other side is \nso right and so good, why did we not have a hearing? Why did this not \ncome before us with witnesses so that all could hear both sides of the \nstories, that the oil companies' executives who are making these \nbillions of dollars could sit there in the chairs before the cameras \nand the microphones and explain it?\n  They could not face the music. They could not take that kind of \nscrutiny, and neither can this program. Let the Department of the \nInterior go forward on behalf of the taxpayers. Let them make sure that \nwe receive a fair amount for those who would take profits from \nAmerica's lands.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time. I yield the time back to the \nSenator from California.\n  Mr. Domenici addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield to Senator Breaux from Louisiana \nas much time as he desires.\n  Before I do that, I just want to make an observation. I just read a \nmost authentic history of Theodore Roosevelt, and my observation to the \nSenator from Illinois is he wouldn't take this case so he wouldn't be \ndown here arguing on anything because he would look at the facts, and \nhe would say I don't want to be on the wrong side of the facts. He \nwouldn't be down here anti-anything. He would leave the argument to \nsomebody else.\n  I yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, it is interesting. During the time I have \nbeen in the Senate and Congress, a lot of times when you don't have the \nfacts on your side you have to create an enemy and talk about the \nenemy. I think this is exactly the case here. It is easy to find an \nenemy in the oil and gas industry. The oil and gas industry are the \nfirst people in the world to admit that they, on any kind of a \npopularity chart, would probably be right at the bottom--or probably \nright above the Members of Congress. The oil industry right in front of \nus, and we would be at the bottom.\n  The point is, if you do not have the facts, you have to get somebody \nto argue against, somebody who people don't generally like. And I \nagree, people don't generally like oil and gas companies. So, let's \nmake them the big bogeyman in this and argue about how bad they are. \nFortunately, that is not the issue in this case. The issue in this case \nis really very simple. The issue is, how do you determine the proper \nvalue for oil that is discovered on Federal lands, and what is the \nroyalty that companies who explore and develop should pay the Federal \nGovernment? It is very clear that companies do not determine how much \nthey have to pay--we do. We passed the OCS Lands Act in 1976 and \ninnumerable other Federal acts in Congress to determine what royalties \nshould be. Congress makes that decision and we have made it many times.\n  The question before the Interior Department in which they, I think, \nmade a mistake is how do you determine the value of the oil. We know \nwhat the percentage is. Interestingly, companies made a proposal to the \nFederal Government and said let us quit fighting over what the value of \nthe oil is; let us just give you the oil. If you are entitled to 15 \npercent of the oil, and we have 100 barrels, let us just give you 15 \nbarrels\n\n[[Page S10399]]\n\nof oil and let you go sell it and you determine what the price is by \nselling it in the marketplace.\n  The Federal Government said we don't want to do that. We think that \nis too complicated--and it is complicated. The problem before this \nCongress is what do we do, in trying to work with the Interior \nDepartment, in helping to determine what is the proper value. How do we \nfind the proper value for oil?\n  Someone said we ought to have hearings on this. We did. We had a \nhearing. We had two hearings. We had hearings in the Senate Energy \nCommittee. We had hearings in the House Resources Committee. Minerals \nManagement Service came and testified, members of the oil and gas \nindustry came and testified and talked about how they were trying to \nwork this problem out. I also hosted, along with Senator Hutchison from \nTexas, Senators Domenici and Bingaman from New Mexico and Senator \nLandrieu from my State and others, meetings between oil industry \nrepresentatives and Interior officials to try to get them to sit at the \nsame table and try to come to a resolution of the very complicated \ntechnical problem of determining how do you find out what the proper \nvalue of a barrel of oil.\n  The oil is brought to the surface in the middle of the Gulf of \nMexico. You can determine what the price is, if you look at what it is \nat the wellhead. One problem in this proposed rule is that we look at \ndifferent prices and at a different time to determine the value. We \ndon't look at what its value is in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico, \nbut we look at it after it is brought onshore. How do you determine \nwhat are the legitimate transportation deductions in reaching the \nroyalty value of crude oil? And, should companies have to pay all of \nthe costs to this point onshore. If it is the Government's oil, \nshouldn't the Government pay the transportation cost of its share? \nTherefore, one of the real conflicts is how do you determine a proper \ntransportation deduction?\n  Companies will argue that the entire pipeline system is part of the \ncost of transporting oil. They say, ``If we do not have this elaborate \nsystem out there, we cannot transport it to the place onshore where the \nGovernment takes ownership, so that should be deductible.'' Minerals \nManagement says ``No, you should not deduct all of that; it should be \nless.'' So this is a battle of what you should deduct and how you reach \na legitimate price. There is nothing mysterious about this. Nobody is \ntrying to rob anyone of anything.\n  Oil and gas companies have paid more in royalties to the Federal \nGovernment than they have received in the price of oil they have taken \nfrom the Federal lands in terms of taxes they have paid and royalties \nthat they have paid over the years since we have had an offshore oil \nand gas industry--companies have paid more to the U.S. Treasury than \nthey have made in finding oil in the Gulf of Mexico. Eventually, in the \nfuture, it will turn around. They will start making more money than \nthey have paid. That is why they are in the business. Up until this \npoint they have still paid more to the Federal Treasury in royalties \nand taxes and benefits to the U.S. Government than they have made in \nselling the oil that they have found.\n  We tried to have meetings with Minerals Management Service to resolve \nthis. This rider is not the best way to handle it. I would admit that. \nBut I think it is appropriate that when Congress sees something \nhappening that is not consistent with what is good policy and what is \nthe law, then Congress has an obligation to say ``hold it,'' ``stop,'' \n``slowdown,'' ``let's continue to try to work this out.'' That is \nexactly what an appropriation rider has done. We have told Interior \nDepartment, in the Interior appropriations bill, that this rule is \nfundamentally flawed. It is not correct. It is not right. It does not \nallow for the legitimate deductions in the costs of transportation that \nshould be allowed, and therefore don't go forward with a rule that is \nfundamentally flawed. Give Congress and the Interior Department time to \ncome to an agreement on what is appropriate and proper.\n  That is the argument. That is the issue. We can talk about how bad \nthe oil companies are. That is a easy thing to say if you don't like \noil companies. I happen to like them. They employ hundreds of thousands \nof people in my State and provide the energy for people to drive to \nwork in the morning. It is part of our national economic security and \npart of the national defense in our country. They do an important \nservice for this country of ours. So the issue is not whether or not \nyou like oil companies. The issue is very simple, Is this a good rule? \nThe answer is no. Should it be stopped? The answer is yes. Should this \namendment be tabled? The answer is also yes. I think when this \namendment is tabled it will allow the administration and the Department \nto continue to work with those who are interested in trying to resolve \nthis and come to a resolution that makes sense. Companies will continue \nto pay.\n  It is interesting, when they had the hearings over in the House, when \nthe administration testified concerning this argument about how much we \nare losing in lost revenue. The Director of the Minerals Management \nService, when she testified at the House Resources Committee on \nFebruary 26, 1998, said that these regulations ``are intended to \nsimplify the royalty payments, make valuation methods reflective of \nmodern market conditions, offer the industry more flexibility, reduce \nadministrative costs, and maintain revenue neutrality.''\n  When MMS proposed the rule, as flawed as it was, it wasn't to \nincrease the amount of money they would get. At least that is what they \nsaid. It is simply to ``maintain revenue neutrality.'' Now the argument \nis we are losing millions of dollars every month. The whole purpose of \nthe rule was to make the way we determine the value of the oil simpler \nand reflect modern market conditions. It doesn't do that. Therefore we \nshould say stop, slowdown, let's continue to negotiate to come up with \nsomething that makes sense.\n  That is what the bill before the Senate does. It should not be \nchanged, and the amendment should be tabled.\n  I yield back the time to the distinguished Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, Senator Boxer stepped out. She yielded \nme 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized \nfor 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask the Senator, may I ask a \nparliamentary question, please?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time has been used by each \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California, Senator Boxer, \nhas 55 minutes. The Senator from New Mexico has 74 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the Boxer amendment would simply let \nthe Interior Department do its job, which is making sure that oil \ncompanies pay full royalties for the oil they are drilling on Federal \nor Indian lands. That is what this amendment does.\n  Right now, some of these companies are not paying the money that they \nowe, and several are being sued for it. Amazingly, there is a rider in \nthis bill, the same rider put in during the conference committee on \nthis spring s supplemental appropriations bill, that stops Interior \nfrom doing its job. That is what this is about. This rider stops \nInterior from issuing rules to collect these royalties. No wonder \nSenator Boxer has sounded the alarm.\n  As a Senator from Minnesota, I am glad that we have Senators who are \nwilling to stand up to oil companies. There are not that many Senators \nwho will do so. The Senator from California has the courage to do so.\n  This kind of sweetheart deal--and that is exactly what it is--is \nsimply outrageous. It is corporate welfare of the worst kind. And even \nworse, in many cases this money is being taken away from our children's \nschools. In 24 States, the State's share of the royalties is used to \nfund public education, so when the oil companies underpay their \nroyalties, education is the loser.\n  In addition, the Federal share of these royalties goes to the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund and the National Historic Preservation \nFund.\n  If the Boxer amendment is adopted, the money will go where it should \nbe\n\n[[Page S10400]]\n\ngoing--to public education, the environment, historic preservation, and \nto Native American communities--instead of corporate bank accounts.\n  Mr. President, this is an unbelievable story. The Interior \nDepartment's Mineral Management Service--MMS--simply wants to collect \nthe money these companies owe the public. Interior Secretary Babbitt \nsays:\n\n       Many of the industry's largest companies are underpaying \n     royalties.\n\n  Just recently, Mobil Oil agreed to a $56.5 million settlement of \nFederal and State lawsuits alleging underpayment of royalties. That is \nwhat has been going on. And there has been a flurry of such \nsettlements: $2.5 billion in Alaska, $350 million in California, $17.5 \nmillion in Texas, $10 million in Louisiana, and $8 million in New \nMexico. MMS has now billed 12 of these companies $260 million for \noverdue royalties. Now the Justice Department has joined a lawsuit \nunder the False Claims Act alleging fraud. According to Justice, \nseveral of these oil companies have been deliberately underpaying their \nroyalties.\n  Remember, this oil belongs to the public and to Native American \ntribes. We are leasing the mineral rights to them, but only under one \ncondition. We are saying, ``Go ahead, take the oil; all we ask is a \n12.5 percent cut on the fair market value.'' I don't think that is too \nmuch to ask. Nor do the people of this country think it is too much to \nask. But apparently the oil companies do.\n  Let me be clear about one thing. This has already come up in the \ndebate. Senator Durbin spoke to it, and Senator Boxer spoke to it as \nwell. We are not talking about all the oil companies. We are not \ntalking about mom-and-pop independents. We are talking about the large \nintegrated companies who sell to affiliates at undervalued prices. They \nmake up only 5 percent of all the oil companies drilling on Federal \nland, but they account for 68 percent of all Federal production.\n  For over 2 years, the Interior Department has been developing \nregulations to put a stop to this highway robbery. This is not new \nauthority. Interior already has statutory authority to collect \nroyalties on the ``fair market value'' of this oil, but the new \nregulations would keep oil companies from manipulating ``fair market \nvalue'' to underpay their royalties. The oil companies don't like that.\n  Here is the question I ask colleagues: Do these companies, do these \nhuge integrated oil companies, really deserve our sympathy? I don't \nthink so. They have been caught--let me repeat that--they have been \ncaught underpaying their royalties.\n  Since when do we have such tremendous sympathy in the U.S. Senate for \npeople who are cheating the public? It is interesting to me. We pass \ncrime bills all the time. Now we have the Juvenile Justice Act--a \ncrackdown on children. Very little sympathy there. Put children in \nadult corrections facilities; very little sympathy for these children.\n  We passed a welfare bill. We don't really know what is happening. We \nknow women have been taken off the welfare rolls. We know the children \nhave been taken off the rolls. But we don't know what kind of jobs they \nhave, what kind of wages. We don't know whether there is good child \ncare for those children. Very little sympathy for these families \neither.\n  We tried to bring an amendment to the floor to increase the minimum \nwage so that working people can make a decent living. There is very \nlittle sympathy on the floor of the Senate for any of these folks.\n  But in through the door walks a CEO from one of these oil companies--\nlarge integrated oil companies that have been underpaying their \nroyalties, oil companies who happen to be heavy campaign contributors--\nand all of a sudden we have sympathy to spare. We have sympathy coming \nout the wazoo. We feel their pain. All of a sudden it is, ``At your \nservice, sir. What can we do for you, sir? How can we serve you \nbetter?''\n  These companies have been caught red-handed. The cops are after them. \nLaw enforcement is closing in. They are in deep trouble, and they are \ndesperate for someone to come to their rescue, and fast.\n  So who do they call? They call their friends. They call the U.S. \nCongress. And guess what. Congress answers the call without a moment's \nhesitation. With a rider in this bill, Congress comes to the rescue and \nrewards them with a ``get out of jail free'' card.\n  The Boxer amendment would revoke this sweetheart deal that lets oil \ncompanies keep ripping off the public, lets them keep shortchanging \neducation, even after they have been caught cheating. If there ever was \na time to be tough on crime, this is it. In fact, I say this is a time \nfor zero tolerance. The rider in this bill sends law enforcement on \npaid holiday. The Boxer amendment puts the cops back on the beat.\n  I say to my colleagues, we have to ask ourselves a question: What is \nour purpose here? Are we elected to fight for people or for the oil \ncompanies? Were we elected to fight for good government or for \ncorporate welfare? Are we going to do what the public wants us to do, \nor are we going to do what the oil companies want us to do?\n  I urge my colleagues to join in a broad coalition that opposes this \n$66 million corporate welfare giveaway. That is what this amendment \nspeaks to. That is what this debate is all about, and all of us will be \nheld accountable.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes left.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. With the indulgence of my colleagues, I ask for a \ncouple of minutes. I have been trying to give a speech for 3 days on \nwhat is happening in Burma. It will take me about 4 minutes. I ask \nunanimous consent that I have 4 minutes as in morning business.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. At this moment?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am not taking near the 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And you are not going to take the rest of the 15 \nminutes?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. No. I thought my colleague wanted to hear me repeat \nthe statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the Senator is \nrecognized for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I think this is a statement with which every single \nSenator will agree.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/16/senate-section/article/S10393-5", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10400-S10401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 BURMA\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to express my outrage at threats \ntoward Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi made Tuesday in the \ngovernment-controlled press in Rangoon. Completely without \njustification the press called for Aung San Suu Kyi to be deported from \nBurma. The regime has again made the ridiculous charge that Aung San \nSuu Kyi is not entitled to Burmese citizenship. This charge is made on \nthe xenophobic and insulting basis that she married a foreigner. The \nregime has long tried to discredit Aung San Suu Kyi with the Burmese \npeople with this type of nonsense--it hasn't worked.\n  The Burmese people voted for Aung San Suu Kyi's party overwhelmingly \nin 1990--electing opposition candidates to 80 percent of the parliament \nseats. She remains the hope of a repressed people longing for democracy \nand human rights. The military regime, which used to call itself the \nSLORC, has tried to improve its image by changing its name to the State \nPeace and development Council. But it is the same regime. It has had to \nprevent Aung San Suu Kyi from speaking publicly because she was drawing \nhuge crowds to the front of her home. It has had to prevent her from \ntraveling freely to visit her supporters since they fear her \npopularity.\n  Far from being a foreigner, Aung San Suu Kyi embodies the very \nhistory of Burma. She is the daughter of the founder of the Burmese \narmy and the leader of Burma's independence movement, General Aung San. \nLike her father, Aung San Suu Kyi has devoted years of her life to the \nBurmese people at great personal sacrifice.\n  The Burmese people strongly identify Aung San Suu Kyi with her \nfather's legacy and his struggle to bring independence and ethnic unity \nto Burma. In fact, displaying pictures of General Aung San has become a \nsymbolic act of defiance and show of support for the opposition. \nUniversity students began demonstrations in 1996 and again in 1998 by \ndisplaying portraits of Aung San as a rallying signal. The authorities \ncan't take action against those\n\n[[Page S10401]]\n\ndisplaying his picture since he is also revered by the regime as the \nnation's founder.\n  The regime rightly fears the power of these symbols but their \nattempts to separate Aung San Suu Kyi from her legacy and deprive her \nof citizenship will fail. The Burmese people see through it. The people \nclearly do not want her deported.\n  I urge the regime to treat this courageous woman with the respect she \ndeserves and to ensure that no harm comes to her. She has stood up to \nthe repressive tactics of the military regime for over 10 years now. In \nrecent months, she has sacrificed her personal comfort and risked her \nhealth facing down the authorities. When denied the ability to travel \nfreely she spent 10 days waiting in her car for the authorities to \nallow her to move. Her exceptional fortitude and her commitment to \nchallenging the regime through non-violent actions are an inspiration \nto those working for human rights around the world.\n  I also express my concern about recent detentions of several hundred \nof Aung San Suu Kyi's supporters. Last week, the regime reacted with \ntypically heavy-handed tactics to prevent her party from convening the \nmembers of parliament elected in free and fair elections held in 1990. \nThe regime has never allowed the parliament elected in 1990 to take \noffice because the voters overwhelmingly elected opposition members. \nAung San Suu Kyi recently called on the regime to convene the \nparliament. When that request was ignored her party decided to convene \na ``People's Parliament'' on its own. The reaction of the military \njunta was predictable. They simply rounded up any opposition politician \nwho might attend the planned events and ``detained'' them. Hundreds of \nparty members are still being held.\n  This outrageous tactic violates the rights of the Burmese people to \nexercise freedom of assembly and political expression. Although this \nbehavior is nothing new or unexpected for this repressive regime we \nmust persist in condemning it. I call on the regime to immediately \nrelease all opposition party members detained and to enter into genuine \ndialogue with the opposition and ethnic minority group about restoring \ndemocracy to Burma.\n  And, again, I call on the military regime to treat Aung San Suu Kyi \nwith respect as the legitimate leader of the opposition and to withdraw \nthe threat of deportation and respect her rights as a Burmese citizen.\n  To reiterate, Mr. President, I want to go on record. I express my \noutrage, and I think it is outrage of Democrats and Republicans, at the \nthreats toward the Burmese opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, made \nlast Tuesday by a Government-controlled press. They are now talking \nabout the possibility of deporting her from Burma.\n  She is a very, very courageous woman. The people overwhelmingly \nelected her in 1990. What has happened since is that this military \nregime, which used to call itself SLORC, which has now tried to improve \nits image by calling itself the State Peace and Development Council, \nhas been just full of brutal repression for the people there.\n  I rise to express my concern about what is happening to this very \ncourageous woman who has been trying to travel, has been trying to have \nan opportunity to speak out in her country and meet with other people. \nShe spent recently 10 days just in her car trying to cross a bridge to \nmeet with people, to speak with people in her own country. This regime \nreally has her under house arrest.\n  In addition, this past week, what happened is that many of the people \nin her party decided that they would convene a people's parliament, \nsince their elections were nullified when this repressive military \ngovernment took over. They held a meeting, and hundreds of them have \nbeen rounded up and are now in prison.\n  I come to the floor of the Senate today to simply say that this is an \noutrageous practice of repression by this Government. I condemn it on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate. It is not always that I think I speak for \nalmost every single Senator, but I believe Democrats and Republicans \nagree on this. I call on this military regime to treat this courageous \nwoman with respect as a legitimate leader of the opposition and to \nrelease people whom they have unlawfully put in jail.\n  Aung San Suu Kyi is a courageous woman. She stands for the very best \nof what our country stands for, which is respect for human rights and \ndemocracy. We need to speak out on the floor of the Senate, and we need \nto send a message to this repressive Government in Burma, that not only \nwill we not do business with you as usual--and we are not doing that--\nbut we, as a Government, we as the U.S. Senate, will continue to speak \nout and condemn your actions, and we will continue to support people in \nBurma, those people who stand up for democracy and stand up for human \nrights.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/16/senate-section/article/S10400-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10401-S10415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  1999\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3594\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Alaska?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to ask Senator Boxer--we \nhave been going back and forth. Senator Murkowski just wants to speak \nfor 3 minutes, and I wonder if we could then have Senator Thomas speak \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Then we would go to your side.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Fine.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield to the two Senators in that order.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I rise as chairman of the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources. I would like to advise my colleagues that we had an \noversight hearing in June on the MMS oil valuation issue. The results \nof that hearing indicated that we should initiate a dialogue with the \nprincipals. That dialogue was entered into. I felt gratified that we \nwere making progress relative to this complex issue and was chagrined \nto find at a later date that the advances we thought we were making \nsimply had been overturned by the policymakers of the Department of the \nInterior and the administration.\n  As a consequence, this conversation about corporate welfare, big oil, \nand big business is incorrect because we are talking about small \ncompanies in many cases. The oil and gas industry has lost a quarter of \na million jobs. This is an industry that now finds itself moving \noverseas where there is a favorable climate for exploration and \nproduction.\n  As evidence of that, Mr. President, in 1973 and 1974, we were 37-\npercent dependent on imported oil; today, we are 52-percent dependent. \nThe Department of Energy suggests we are going to be 66-percent \ndependent in the year 2004 or 2005.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Domenici and Senator Hutchison \nduring committee markup would delay the implementation of the final \nrules on Federal oil valuation until October 1999, or until a \nnegotiated rule can be achieved.\n  The oil and gas industry is struggling in a declining market. This is \nan industry where we have lost a quarter of a million jobs. We are \ntalking about implementation of regulations that would drive this \nindustry out of the United States and make us more dependent on \nimported oil. It is unconscionable. The taxes paid by this industry and \nmortgage payments made by industry employees in their communities are \ncontributions being overlooked in this general climate of ``well, throw \nit out--because somehow big business is cheating,'' if you will. And \nthat is simply unconscionable, Mr. President.\n  As Senator Domenici and Senator Hutchison indicated, they personally \nmet twice with Interior Department officials and industry executives to \nresolve what amounts to a handful of issues concerning the rulemaking. \nIt is rather interesting, because if you look at the MMS proposal, it \nattempts to set the oil royalty away from the lease; that is, \ndownstream, almost near the burner, not as required by law, and set it \non the value added by the companies\n\n[[Page S10402]]\n\nthrough their extraordinary efforts to market the product. And by \ndenying the companies an allowance for reasonable marketing costs, MMS \nunnecessarily and artificially raises the price of oil on which the \nroyalty is based. That is what they are doing here.\n  So, Mr. President, do not be misled by these generalities that \nsomehow this is corporate welfare. This is an effort to help an \nindustry be competitive. The policy of the Department of the Interior \nto mandate royalty valuation, through rulemaking, would be detrimental \nand not resolve the issue, and would leave many unanswered questions \nrelative to the industry's ability to be internationally competitive. \nIt is beyond me, Mr. President.\n  I thought when the Interior officials met, they were going to meet in \ngood faith. It appears that Interior did little more than pay \nlipservice to that effort. The rule is just as unfair now as it was \nwhen discussions of it took place. Only now, Interior is trying to put \nits spin on the issue by saying, ``We gave the industry its meeting. We \naddressed their concerns. Why do we need to have any further delay?''\n  Mr. President, it appears the Interior Department is going to \ncontinue to base its oil royalty on market factors away from the lease. \nAny attempts to strip the Domenici amendment away should be opposed. \nAnd there are three specific reasons. Then I will conclude.\n  First, contrary to what Interior claims, the amendment was scored by \nCBO as having zero effect on the current baseline. Interior's claim \nthat it will save $65 million a year is simply puffery and nothing \nmore.\n  Second, with world oil prices depressed, we do not need to add what \namounts to a new tax on this industry, particularly the independents, \nthe small oil companies. Do not talk to me about big business.\n  Third, delaying oil valuation rules is nothing new. Congress did it \nin 1987. Delay will allow better public policy to be formulated.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join in opposing the removal of the oil \nvaluation amendment from the Interior appropriations bill.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Thomas.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise in strong opposition to the Boxer amendment. Contrary to what \nwe have heard over there about withdrawal and cheating and all these \nthings, there are some real issues here, issues that many of us, \nparticularly those of us who live in public land States, have been \nworking on for a very long time.\n  That is the question--how do you have regulations that extract one-\neighth of the value of Federal oil into the Federal Treasury? Nobody \nobjects to that. That is the law. Nobody argues with that. There are \nsome real issues here.\n  For instance, what is the value in Chugwater, WY, as compared to \nOklahoma City? What is the value when you are close to a collection \npoint as opposed to having to carry the oil for a very long time? Where \ndo you apply the value? Do you have to pay for the transportation to \nwhere it is going in order to have one-eighth of it? There are some \nreal issues here, and we have not been able to come together with the \nbureaucracy to have a satisfactory solution. And that is why this \namendment is there--to have a moratorium on time so that this can, \nindeed, be resolved.\n  I have been involved in some of these meetings here in which we have \ntried to find a solution. I, by the way, have not seen any of my \nfriends from the other side of the aisle there participating in trying \nto find a solution. All they do is come up and complain. I am, frankly, \na little offended at the idea that seems to be promoted that somehow if \nyou are not for this it is because you may have gotten a contribution \nfrom an oil company. I am offended by that.\n\n  People believe in what they are doing here. They believe it is \nimportant to their communities and to their States. They believe there \nought to be jobs. They believe we ought to have a domestic oil \nindustry. These are beliefs. I do not hear anyone saying they are where \nthey are because the environmentalists are having TV ads to support \ntheir candidacy. I suppose you could say that. I do not think that is a \ngreat idea.\n  What we have is some real confusion. Let me give you a little \nexample. We had an independent who was brought back before the agency \nbecause they did what someone in the agency told them to do. They did \nwhat the employee told them to do. And the director of MMS says, \n``Well, you can't go by that because that might not be what the \nAssistant Secretary meant to happen.'' Give me a break. You mean a \ncitizen who goes to an employee of an agency cannot rely on the \ninformation they get there because it might not be consistent with what \nsomeone said who is Assistant Secretary? That is the kind of thing we \nare dealing with here and the kind of thing we need to get resolved.\n  We have met with MMS on a number of occasions. I must tell you, I \nhave been working with this since I was in the House 4 years ago, where \nI suggested, and would suggest again, that the States do the actual \ncollection of the mineral royalty and share it with the Feds. We are \nduplicating it now.\n  MMS is one of the most inefficient agencies we have in this \nGovernment in terms of their cost. It is not clear what it is that they \nare doing. It is clear that it is not a workable situation. When you \ntake the NYMEX and apply it to a place in Oklahoma City, and out in \nWyoming, that is not a workable way to determine what the market value \nis. We need to do something about that.\n  Mr. President, I do not think we ought to be fooled by arguments of \nthe proponents that they are not getting a fair share of the royalties. \nThis amendment is not about reasonable valuation, collection. This \namendment is not about schoolchildren. This amendment is quite simply \none that wants to attack the oil industry by those who are critical of \nbusiness, those who think that this is some kind of an environmental \nquestion. And it is not.\n  It is important that the MMS rule be understood, that it does not \nonly impact large petroleum producers. If that were the case, why would \nthe independents be involved? Why would the independents be interested \nin bringing some kind of court action? It is because they are very much \nimpacted.\n  We have also heard over the last several days that the Governors are \nnot for this. I just bring to the attention of my colleagues a letter \nby the Governor of Wyoming.\n\n       . . . I strongly object to Senator Barbara Boxer's \n     amendment to the Department of Interior's Appropriations \n     Bill. . . . The amendment would allow the Department to \n     implement new and untested federal royalty crude oil pricing \n     regulations.\n\n  And it goes on, in opposition to that.\n  Minerals Management has proposed rules that are complicated, that are \nunworkable, that result in hardship to the producer, result in a loss \nof jobs, a loss to the economy of our State of Wyoming, and I think a \nsecurity issue to this country when we have 55, nearly 60 percent of \nour oil imported. We have an opportunity here.\n  Simply put, this valuation rule is a job killer. We ought not to go \nforward without having some time to make it work.\n  I think the current language in the appropriations bill is fair and \nreasonable. Instead of taking reckless actions and getting up in broad \ngeneralities and talking about the evils of business, we ought to craft \nsome rules that work. We can, in fact, do this.\n  Again, I urge my friends in the Senate to vote against the Boxer \namendment and continue to resolve the question in a way that is \nworkable and a way that really deals with some regulations that will \ncause us to be able to collect these royalties, as we are all willing \nto do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as we agreed before, I will speak 5 \nminutes now and then I will yield 20 minutes to Senator Dorgan.\n  There were many misstatements made here, but I will start from the \ntop. The Senator from Wyoming said that he didn't see me or any Members \non this side at some closed-door meetings that were held between oil \ncompanies, the Department of Interior, and Members of the Senate.\n  A, I was never invited to even one of those meetings. B, had I been \ninvited, I wouldn't have gone, because I don't\n\n[[Page S10403]]\n\nthink it is right for Senators to meet with regulators and companies \nthat are being regulated by those regulators. A, I wasn't invited; and \nB, I wouldn't have gone, and I would have expressed my opinion as to \nwhy I declined the invitation.\n  There were comments made by the Senator saying those of us who oppose \nthe rider in this bill are antibusiness. I want to make something \nclear: 95 percent of the oil companies are doing right by the American \npeople. They are paying their fair share of royalties. I applaud that. \nAs a matter of fact, Atlantic Richfield has stepped away from the big \noil companies and said, ``You know what? We will be a good corporate \ncitizen. We are going to pay the right royalty based on the market \nprice.''\n  So, please, let no one say that this Senator is antibusiness when I \nsupport 95 percent of the oil companies in this particular matter.\n  I also want to point out that we have a letter addressed to Senator \nBingaman, which I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, \nfrom a number of commissioners of public land, including New Mexico, \nTexas, Arkansas, South Dakota, Montana, North Dakota, Colorado, and \nRobert Hight from California, who support the Boxer amendment, as well \nas a letter to Senator Gorton.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                The Western States\n\n\n                                 Land Commissions Association,\n\n                                                September 4, 1998.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: We, the undersigned Lands \n     Commissioners who are members of the Western States Lands \n     Commissions Association, urge your support for Senator \n     Barbara Boxer's amendment to the Department of Interior's \n     Appropriations Bill, S. 2237, to allow the Department of \n     Interior to implement new federal royalty crude oil pricing \n     regulations. The Department's proposed regulations would \n     ensure that oil companies would pay no more and no less than \n     fair market value for federal royalty oil. S. 2237 currently \n     includes a provision which continues the ban on implementing \n     the proposed regulations for the next fiscal year. This delay \n     is costing taxpayers $5 Million per month.\n       The state agencies that are members of the Western States \n     Land Commissioner's Association have a strong interest in \n     ensuring that oil companies pay the market value of federal \n     royalty oil. The member states of the Association share in \n     the revenues collected by the Department of Interior. The \n     failure of the oil companies to pay market value for federal \n     royalty crude reduces the revenues obtained by the federal \n     government and the states.\n       The Department's Mineral Management Service (MMS) has been \n     eminently fair in proposing its new regulations. MMS has held \n     numerous public and private meetings for over two and a half \n     years to allow the industry to comment and the industry has \n     filed over two thousand pages of comments. Based on industry \n     concerns, MMS has revised its proposed regulations a number \n     of times to take into account industry's suggestions and \n     criticisms. For example, MMS has revised its proposed \n     regulations to recognize regional differences, particularly \n     for the Rocky Mountain Area.\n       The proposed MMS regulations are very reasonable. If oil \n     companies sell royalty crude on arm's-length transactions, \n     they pay on the basis of the prices they receive. If they do \n     not sell the oil on arm's-length transactions, they pay on \n     the basis of prices at market centers, adjusted for location \n     and quality differences, which are universally recognized to \n     result from competition among innumerable buyers and sellers.\n       Oil companies presently use their posted prices to value \n     royalty oil. Posted prices are unilaterally set by individual \n     oil companies less than the market value of those crudes. In \n     contrast, the market prices proposed by MMS to value royalty \n     crude not sold by arm's-length transactions are set by \n     innumerable buyers and sellers and are publicly reported on a \n     daily basis.\n       MMS' proposed switch from posted prices to market prices is \n     not a radically new concept:\n       (1) The State of Alaska uses the spot price of Alaska North \n     Slope crude oil quoted for delivery in the Los Angeles Basin \n     as the basis for royalties;\n       (2) Arco, since the early 1990's, uses spot prices as the \n     basis of payments of royalties throughout the country;\n       (3) The recent State of Texas Chevron and State of Texas \n     Mobil settlements rely on the use of spot prices for royalty \n     valuation purposes.\n       Mobil recently settled for $45 million a case brought by \n     The United States Department of Justice that Mobil had \n     underpaid federal royalties throughout the United States.\n       The Department's comprehensive proposal is the logical \n     alternative to posted prices.\n       Industry's efforts to require the federal government to \n     take and sell its royalty oil-in-kind should be rejected. \n     MMS, numerous states and more recently the General Accounting \n     Office (GAO) have voiced legitimate objections to industry's \n     proposal. Mandatory sales of royalty-in-kind oil would not \n     work for the thousands of federal leases which produce low \n     volumes of crude and in remote locations. Moreover, the \n     federal government's lack of easy access to pipelines, and \n     the major oil companies' unwillingness to pay more than \n     posted prices for their crude oil, would also mean that the \n     mandatory in-kind sales would generate even less revenue than \n     are presently generated.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n         Ray Powell, Commissioner of Public Lands, New Mexico \n           State Land Office; Curt Johnson, Commissioner, South \n           Dakota Office of School and Public Lands; Jeff Hasener, \n           Administrator, Montana Department of Natural Resources \n           & Conservation; Robert C. Hight, Executive Officer, \n           California State Lands Commission; Garry Mauro, \n           Commissioner, Texas General Land Office; Charlie \n           Daniels, Commissioner, Arkansas Commissioner of State \n           Lands; Robert J. Olheiser, North Dakota Commissioner of \n           University and School Lands; John Brejcha, Deputy \n           Director, Colorado State Board of Land Commissioners.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              Department of Natural Resources,\n\n                                   Olympic, WA, September 3, 1998.\n     Hon. Slade Gorton,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gorton: I'm writing to urge your support for \n     Senator Barbara Boxer's amendment to the Department of the \n     Interior's Appropriations Bill, S. 2237, to allow the \n     Department of the Interior to implement new federal royalty \n     crude oil pricing regulations. The department's proposed \n     regulations would ensure that oil companies would pay no more \n     and no less than fair market value for federal royalty oil. \n     S. 2237 currently includes a provision that continues the ban \n     on implementing the proposed regulations for the next fiscal \n     year. This delay is costing taxpayers $5 million per month.\n       The members of the Western States Land Commissioners \n     Association, of which the State of Washington is a member, \n     have a strong interest in ensuring that oil companies pay the \n     market value of federal royalty oil. The association's member \n     states share in the revenues collected by the Department of \n     the Interior. The failure of oil companies to pay market \n     value for federal royalty crude reduces the revenues obtained \n     by the federal government and the states.\n       The Department of the Interior's Mineral Management Service \n     has been eminently fair in proposing its new regulations. The \n     service has held numerous public and private meetings for \n     over two and a half years to allow the industry to comment \n     and the industry has filed over two thousand pages of \n     comments. Based on industry concerns, the service revised its \n     proposed regulations a number of times to take into account \n     industry's suggestions and criticisms. For example, the \n     service revised its proposed regulations to recognize \n     regional differences, particularly for the Rocky Mountain \n     area.\n       The proposed Mineral Management Service regulations are \n     very reasonable. If oil companies sell royalty crude by means \n     of arm's-length transactions, they pay on the basis of the \n     prices they receive. If they do not sell the oil by arm's-\n     length transactions, they pay on the basis of prices at \n     market centers, adjusted for location and quality \n     differences, which are universally recognized to result from \n     competition among innumerable buyers and sellers.\n       Many companies presently use their posted prices to value \n     royalty oil. Posted prices are unilaterally set by individual \n     oil companies and are set at a level lower than the market \n     value of those crudes. In contrast, the market prices \n     proposed by the Mineral Management Service to value royalty \n     crude not sold by arm's-length transactions are set by \n     innumerable buyers and sellers and are publicly reported on a \n     daily basis.\n       The service's proposed switch from posted prices to market \n     prices is not a radically new concept:\n       (1) The State of Alaska uses the spot price of Alaska North \n     Slope crude oil quoted for delivery in the Los Angeles Basin \n     as the basis for royalties;\n       (2) ARCO, since the early 1990s, uses spot prices as the \n     basis of payments of royalties throughout the country; and\n       (3) The recent State of Texas/Chevron settlement relies on \n     the use of spot prices for royalty valuation purposes.\n       The Department of the Interior's comprehensive proposal is \n     the logical alternative to posted prices.\n       Industry's efforts to require the federal government to \n     take and sell its royalty oil-in-kind should be rejected. The \n     Mineral Management Service, numerous states, and, more \n     recently, the General Accounting Office, have voiced \n     legitimate objections to industry's proposal. Mandatory sales \n     of royalty-in-kind oil would not work for the thousands of \n     federal leases that produce low volumes of crude and in \n     remote locations. Moreover, the federal government's lack of \n     easy access to pipelines, and the major oil companies' \n     unwillingness to pay more than posted prices for their crude \n     oil, would also mean that the mandatory in-kind sales would \n     generate even less revenue than is presently\n\n[[Page S10404]]\n\n     generated. In addition, it makes sense to evaluate the \n     results of the current Mineral Management Service \n     demonstration program before requiring an approach nationwide \n     to locations that are likely to lose money.\n       The bottom line for states is: These are assets that belong \n     to the beneficiaries of the states' trust lands and they \n     should be fairly compensated when those assets are sold. \n     Thank you for your consideration of my position on Senator \n     Boxer's amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Jennifer M. Belcher,\n                                     Commissioner of Public Lands.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I also will read into the Record the \ngroups that support the Boxer amendment: American Association of School \nAdministrators, American Bioenergy Association, Americans for Clean \nEnergy, American Wind Energy Association, Arkansas State Lands \nCommission, California State Lands Commission, California State \nSuperintendent of Public Instruction, Colorado State Board of Land \nCommissioners, Council of Chief State School Officers, Friends of the \nEarth, Global Biorefineries, Inc., Montana Department of Natural \nResources and Conservation, National Association of State Boards of \nEducation, National Education Association, National Parent-Teachers \nAssociation--the PTA--National School Boards Association, The Navajo \nNation, National Trust for Historic Preservation, New Mexico State \nLands Commissioner, Project on Government Oversight, Public Citizen, \nSafe Energy Communication Council, South Dakota State Lands \nCommissioner, SUN DAY Campaign, Taxpayers for Common Sense, Texas State \nLands Commissioner, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, The Wilderness \nSociety, and the Washington State Lands Commissioner.\n  Later, after Senator Dorgan has finished and colleagues on the other \nside have had a chance to speak, I want to read what the States are \nsaying as to how they view this rule and how they support the fact that \nthere is a process going on to make sure that the largest of the oil \ncompanies--5 percent--pay their fair share of royalty payments so that \nthe taxpayers get what is due them.\n  Those who are supporting the Boxer amendment are standing with the \ntaxpayers. That is very, very clear. I am very honored to have been \nable to offer this amendment.\n  Again, I want to thank Senator Gorton for his indulgence in allowing \nus to have adequate time to debate this amendment.\n  I yield up to 20 minutes to Senator Dorgan.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Boxer, I thought when I proposed that we go \nnext, that I had little statements, not 20-minute ones, and three of \nthem could go because they were short.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If Senator Dorgan would yield--I thought it was only two.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wanted Senator Burns to discuss his 5-minute \nstatement.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent, when Senator Burns completes his \nstatement, Senator Dorgan get 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The distinguished Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank my friend from New Mexico. I will not be long, I \nsay to my friend and neighbor from North Dakota.\n  I want to put some things in perspective. Yes, the lands belong to \nthe United States of America and are held in trust for the citizens of \nthis country. But the citizens of this country and the taxpayers in \nthis country do not participate in the expense of drilling the well. \nThere is no argument on the eighth that is the royalty that goes to the \nsurface owner. After all, the oil companies did buy the leases. They \npaid hard money for those leases. If there is a resource--in this case, \noil--under the ground, they go and find it.\n  That is not to say that every well they put in the ground is \nsuccessful. We have more dry wells than we have wells producing. The \nAmerican people did not make any investment in drilling that so-called \ndry hole, and they didn't even participate in footing the bill; the \nexpense of putting the well down is a producer's.\n  There is no argument with the eighth. I can simplify this very \neasily. ``In kind'' would be right. If you want to participate in the \nvalue added to compute your royalty, as the chairman of the Energy \nCommittee said is being attempted by MMS, then MMS should participate \nin the transportation and the cost of the value added. That is only \nfair.\n  Now, if that is not fair, then I suggest that the Interior Department \ngo out to the well site, take their truck, and every eight buckets of \noil that come out of the ground, they get the eighth one, put it in \ntheir truck, and do with it whatever they want to do with it--go on \nopen markets, like the independents or even the big companies do. It \ndoesn't make any difference. That is their eighth. They have been paid. \nThe market goes up, the market goes down; the risk is the same for the \nsurface owner as it is for the one who is bringing it up. That is very \nsimple. No argument with the eighth.\n  What we are saying is: Fair is fair. If you want to collect the \nroyalty on the value-added product, then there has to be expense \nincurred by those who want to participate in that part of the process \nof getting oil to gasoline and the energy that we need in this country.\n  Senator Domenici brought up the point a while ago that people are \npaying more for their bottled water in the grocery store than they are \nfor their gasoline. There is another aspect of this--and I think \nSenator Dorgan from North Dakota will agree with this--in this economy \ntoday, nobody who produces a raw product is making any money. Our \nfarmers understand that. I will give my old ``F-U'' line here, old \nfarmers union line they call it: Go and price Wheaties at the grocery \nstore at $3.75 a pound and the farmer can't even get $1.75 for a 60-\npound bushel of wheat.\n  Something is out of whack here. So we are not arguing about the \neighth. We are arguing where do you take the eighth and what our \ninvestment or our part of the expense should be. You can't let \neverybody else pay all the expenses and you just participate in the \nharvest of those dollars. It is a very, very simple thing. There is \nnothing difficult about understanding that. But I think that is what we \nought to do. Yes, we are worried about children in schools. I sure am. \nI am worrying about the children of those folks who work awfully hard \nin the oil patch to feed their families, participate in their \ncommunities, and take care of the obligations they have as citizens of \nthe United States of America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is an interesting debate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield briefly, I ask \nunanimous consent that the next speaker on our side be Senator Nickles \nand he be allowed 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is an interesting debate that likely \nwill get very little attention, given the proclivity of the press to \ncover other things going on in our country these days.\n  I rise today to support the amendment offered by Senator Boxer. There \nis a charming quote from Abraham Lincoln that came during his debates \nwith Douglas. At one point, very exasperated because he simply could \nnot get Douglas to understand a point he was making, Lincoln turned to \nDouglas and said, ``Tell me, how many legs does a cow have?'' Douglas \nsaid, ``Four, of course.'' Lincoln said, ``Now, assume that the tail \nwere a leg; how many legs would the cow have?'' Douglas said, ``Five.'' \nLincoln said, ``You see, that's where you are wrong. Just calling it a \nleg doesn't make it a leg at all.''\n  As I heard members discuss this amendment on the floor of the Senate, \nsaying this amendment affects independent oil companies, I thought it \nwas easy to say, but it was totally removed from the facts. This bill \nhas no impact on independent oil companies. It does not have an impact \non independent oil companies. It has nothing to do with the fact that \ncommodity prices are collapsing which is true on the farm and true for \nenergy companies. It has nothing to do with that either. In fact, the \nlower the price for oil, the less royalty fee would be required to be \npaid by the oil industry. So that is not what this issue is about.\n  A lot of folks want to confuse the issue. It is not about that. It is \nnot\n\n[[Page S10405]]\n\nabout independent oil companies who are not affected, and not about the \nprice of oil. When the price of oil goes down, royalty fees go down.\n  Let me describe what it is about. It is very simple. The companies \nwho drill for oil on Federal lands pay a 12-percent royalty to the \nAmerican people for the privilege of doing that on the oil that they \nbring up out of those lands and sell. They are required, because they \nare drilling on lands that are owned by the American people, to pay a \nroyalty fee. That is fair. I suppose some think they ought to drill and \nkeep all the money. But it is fair.\n  Over many years, we have decided that if they are going to get \nsomething the public has, they will pay a fee. That is the 12-percent \nroyalty fee. A fair portion of that fee that goes to the States is used \nfor education. That is an important part of the revenue base of our \nStates. A large part, no, but an important part. How much do we get \nfrom these royalties? When someone wants to produce oil on public \nlands, how much do we get from the royalties of 12 percent? Well, it is \n12 percent of the price of the oil. What is the price of the oil with \nrespect to the independent oil companies that produce it and sell it? \nThat sale price is the price of the oil. They are then required to pay \na royalty fee on the price of the oil. So an arm's length transaction \nbetween a willing buyer and a willing seller establishes the market \nprice for oil. That is not a problem. That is not a matter of \ncontention.\n  But what about a company that is a large integrated company that \nproduces oil and then, as a producer, sells it to itself as a \nwholesaler or a retailer and it produces the oil and prices it and \nsells it to itself? What about that company? What then is the price of \nthe oil, and how much in royalty payments do the American people get \nfrom that transaction? The answer is, the price of that oil in a large \nintegrated oil company is whatever the company says the price of the \noil is.\n  What if they say, gee, well, the price of our oil is $4 a barrel, and \nyou get 12 percent of that? Are we being cheated if, in fact, oil is \nselling for $12 a barrel and they say, ``Ours is only worth $4 because \nwe are selling it to ourselves, and we have artificially priced it \nbecause we want to avoid paying your fees, avoid paying our fair share \nto the American people?''\n  Are we being cheated? Of course we are being cheated. The question \nis, Who cares about that in here? Does anybody care? Does anybody care \nif the American people get taken to the cleaners by somebody that wants \nto underprice something they sell to themselves and, as a result, pay \nthe American people something less than they were supposed to pay? Does \nanybody care about that? A few of us do. We will have a vote on it to \nsee who cares.\n  So what is the royalty fee we get? It is 12 percent times the value \nof the oil. Who establishes the value of the oil? In most cases--95 \npercent of the cases, with all of the independents and some others--it \nis the fair market value, a willing buyer and a willing seller in an \nopen market transaction, which establishes a price upon which a 12-\npercent royalty payment is made.\n  This amendment isn't even a close call, by any standard. I want to \nuse this example to talk about two other things that relate exactly to \nthis, which give me as much concern as this does. In fact, this is not \na very large issue. It is an issue of $66 million a year; $66 million \nis a lot of money, but in the construct of a trillion dollars, or a \ntrillion and a half--the $1.6 trillion budget that we have, and the \n$135 billion of revenue here and there--I mean, it is not that big an \nissue. Yet, they are waging a fight; the major integrated oil companies \nare waging a fight, and you would think you were taking away their last \noil truck.\n  Let me tell you about an exact replica of this debate. We lost it on \nthe floor of the Senate. We have the exact same issue on taxation--\ncorporations, especially foreign corporations, but domestic as well, \nthat sell to themselves and then tell us at what price they sell the \nproduct to themselves, a wholly owned subsidiary, and therefore how \nmuch profit they made and how much income tax they will pay to the \nFederal Government. And 65 percent of the foreign corporations doing \nbusiness in this country, most of whose names you will recognize, do \ntens of billions of dollars of business in America and pay zero in \nincome tax--not a penny. Zero. How do they do that? Let me give you one \nexample. A company sells a piano to its affiliated subsidiary and \nprices it at $50. Would you like to buy a piano for $50? It is exactly \nthe same thing we are talking about with pricing oil you sell \nyourself--undervalue it and pay a tax, or in this case, a royalty, \nbased on evaluation that is artificially low so you can avoid paying \nthe royalty, or as in the case I described, avoid paying the income \ntax.\n  How about a tractor tire? I don't know if anybody in here buys and \nsells tractor tires. Probably not, but $7.60 is the price of a tractor \ntire in a transaction between a corporation--a foreign corporation--and \nits wholly owned subsidiary in the U.S. Why $7.60? The company \nartificially prices it low so that it doesn't pay income taxes in the \nU.S. We voted on that. We voted on something that corrects that \nproblem. We have people in this Chamber, sufficient numbers, who have \nsaid, ``We don't want to correct that. We don't even want to debate \nwhether it is cheating. We don't want to deal with it because big \nbusiness doesn't want that to be changed.''\n  We don't intend to change it. It is the same principle here. Big, \nintegrated oil companies sell to themselves, underprice what they are \nselling to themselves, and, therefore, cheat the American people out of \nroyalty payments that they ought to be making. Then members come to the \nfloor of the Senate and say to us, ``Gee, you are being unfair.'' We \nare not being unfair. We are required to stand up for the interests of \nthe American people. They own that land. They own that land on which \ndrilling takes place. They are owed the 12-percent royalty based on a \nfair computation of the price of that oil.\n  I will tell you one more story. I served in State office before I \ncame here. In our State, we assess a tax on railroads. It is exactly \nthe same principle we are talking about here today. We assess a tax on \nrailroads. When I assumed office as Tax Commissioner, which was an \nelective office, and assumed responsibility for that tax, I asked one \nof the folks who were responsible for that tax--which is an ad valorem \nproperty tax on the railroad system--``How do you do that?'' He said, \n``Sit down and I will show you.'' He said, ``Because the railroads \naren't bought and sold, you look at all of the stocks and all of the \ndebt. Assuming you bought all of their stock and debt, that is the \nvalue of the railroad.'' I said, ``Tell me a little more about that.'' \nHe said, ``Here is the stock. I sell you this railroad. Here is the \nstock.'' I said, ``Gee, what price are you using, par value?'' ``Par \nvalue,'' he said.\n  Remember, we have been doing that for 25 years. The railroads \nindicated to us that that is the value. Using the par value, of course, \nis absolutely ridiculous. Par value has nothing to do with the value of \nthe railroad stock. But the industry had convinced the people in our \nState who value railroads to use an artificially low, absurd value for \nthe railroad stock. They were fat and happy for dozens of years \nunderpaying their taxes. They loved it. The minute I decided to change \nit, they said ``Holy cow. What are you doing to us? Why on Earth are \nyou being unfair to us?'' I said, ``I am not being unfair. I am asking \nyou to do what every other American does--pay your fair share of the \ntaxes.''\n  That is the principle and the issue on which we will be voting. The \nprinciple and the issue here is not about ma and pa. It is not about \nindependents and not whether you support the oil industry. I do. I have \ncast a lot of votes on behalf of the independents, and support the \nmajors as well, because I think they play an important contributing \nrole for this country in providing energy for our future. But in cases \nlike this where you have integrated companies who are undervaluing \ntheir oil so they can underpay the royalty fee they owe to the people \nof the United States, I say let's correct it.\n  Some of my colleagues say that underpayment is not happening.\n  Let's take a look at the rates. Alaska settled with the oil companies \nfor over $2.5 billion. Is that because somebody was making arithmetic \nerrors? I don't think so. California, $350 million; Texas, $17.1 \nmillion.\n\n[[Page S10406]]\n\n  My point is that the States have been plodding their way through this \nissue with respect to royalties owed to the States. Can we not have the \nstrength to stand up here and say to the integrated oil companies, \n``You have a responsibility to be fair to the people of the United \nStates? We are not asking for more than you owe. Your oil prices have \ndeclined. Therefore, you should pay the new price.'' We understand \nthat. ``We are not asking for more than you owe; not a penny more. We \nare asking you on behalf of the people of this country to pay your fair \nshare.''\n  What is happening today--and in this bill that came to the floor of \nthe Senate--is an attempt to intercept a rule that will require these \nfolks to pay their fair share of royalties. And a bunch of folks here \nin the Senate stand up and say, ``No, no, no. We want to protect the \nold order.'' The old order is to let people sell oil to themselves, to \nunderprice it, undervalue it, and avoid paying the American people what \nthey owe them in royalty fees. That is what is wrong.\n  If we turned out the lights and voted on this, people in this Chamber \nwould express that view. I hope when we have a vote on this we will all \ndecide that there is a right and wrong answer. The right answer is to \njust ask the integrated majors who sell oil to themselves to price it \nfairly and abide by the new MMS rules. They have been studied and \nworked on and they are fair. Do this the right way.\n  The Senator from California is not on the floor trying to attack an \nindustry. The Senator from California is not offering an amendment that \nin any way affects the independent oil producers. Ninety-five percent \nof the oil producers in this country will be unaffected by this \namendment, 95 percent of them. In fact, some of those who have been \nunaffected have been convinced to send us letters saying that they are \ngoing to be affected by it. I assume they have been convinced by their \nbigger cousins, or bigger uncles. But the fact is, it is wrong. Calling \na tail a leg doesn't make it a leg at all, as Lincoln said. Saying this \naffects independents doesn't make it affect independents. It does not. \nIt is a very simple, direct approach to say to the integrated oil \ncompanies who sell oil to themselves that they have a responsibility to \nprice oil fairly so that the American people get what they deserve.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, will Senator Nickles yield for an \ninquiry?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Certainly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to state for anybody who \nwould like to speak in opposition to the Boxer amendment that we have a \nfew minutes left. I would like to ask unanimous consent that on our \nside, when appropriate, that the following order for our speakers be \nthe order: Following Senator Nickles, who will speak for 10 minutes, \nthe Senator from Louisiana will speak for up to 5 minutes; then Senator \nHutchison for 25 minutes. That will leave some additional time for \nadditional Senators, or for me. We would like to do it in that order \npursuant to the rotation from one side to another.\n  I ask unanimous consent that be the order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, may I ask the Senator? That sounds fine to \nme. In other words, all of your three speakers will include Senator \nHutchison, and we will finish up with our time. Is that what the \nSenator is suggesting?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't want to do that. I said that Senator Nickles \nwill go next. If you have somebody, they will be next. If you don't, \nSenator Landrieu will go next, and back and forth. But our times are \nnow set for three Senators. As Republicans are recognized, they will \nspeak in that order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to compliment my colleague, \nSenator Domenici, as well as Senator Hutchison, for their leadership on \nthis issue.\n  Mr. President, I want to correct what I hear from my colleagues, the \nproponents of this amendment, and make a couple of statements that I \nthink are factual.\n  One, I think I heard somebody say on the other side--Senator Durbin--\nthat there were not any hearings. We had a hearing. I conducted the \nhearing. I don't conduct hearings very often, but when this issue came \nup, I knew a hearing was needed. Some people have demagogued this issue \nand tried to use it for whatever purposes, political or otherwise. I \nwanted to know the facts. I am chairman of the relevant subcommittee in \nthe Energy Committee so we scheduled a hearing. We had the hearing, I \nbelieve, in June of this year.\n  There are just a couple of points that I would like to make. One, in \ntestimony before the House subcommittee, the director of MMS said the \npurpose of the regulations were not to raise money. She said, that the \nregulations are to be revenue neutral. I hear all of the list of the \ngroups who are supposedly proponents of the Boxer amendment--\nschoolboards and so on--thinking they are going to get a lot more \nmoney. The proposed regulations are supposed to be revenue neutral. It \nis not supposed to raise any money. Proponents are saying, ``Oh well. \nIf we don't pass this amendment, the schoolboard is going to be out of \nsome money,'' and so on. That is false. It is not the case. It is \ncontrary to what the director of MMS has testified to.\n  I don't happen to agree with the director of MMS, or the Assistant \nSecretary of the Interior in proposing this oil valuation regulation. I \nthink they have gone too far. I happen to like Mr. Armstrong. But I \ndon't think their regulation makes sense. That is one of the reasons we \nhad hearings.\n  One of the things we don't do enough of in the Senate and House is we \ndon't have oversight over our various agencies. A lot of times the \nagencies propose rules and regulations, and sometimes those rules and \nregulations don't make sense. They may be well intended, and they may \nhave stated goals of simplicity, clarity, and definability, but they \nmay do just exactly the opposite.\n  Unfortunately, the regulations that MMS has come up with--at least \naccording to the people who work in the industry--the regulations won't \nclarify anything. They won't even raise the Government any money--maybe \nnot as much money as they are raising right now. What they will raise \nis litigation. That doesn't help anybody. That doesn't help the \nGovernment. That doesn't help the schoolboard. That doesn't help the \ntribes. That doesn't help the States or anybody, except for maybe the \nlawyers who are involved in the litigation.\n  Some of us have looked at this. This is one of the regulations that \nwe need to review. I mentioned that we had a hearing. Several of us \nhave had meetings with members of the administration, the Department of \nthe Interior, and MMS proponents of this regulation, and people who \nwork in the industry. We tried to pull them together.\n  Both Senators from Louisiana, both Senators from New Mexico, Senator \nHutchison from Texas, and myself have met with MMS and said, ``Can't we \nfigure this out? Can't we come up with workable, definable, clearly \nunderstandable regulations on how to determine royalty evaluations?'' \nWe have had interesting meetings. But, unfortunately, sometimes it \nappears that MMS is not really listening to some of the complaints and \nreally hasn't made the necessary changes to the regulations to make \nthem workable.\n  I would take issue with some of my colleagues who said, ``Well, these \nbig oil companies, they are cheating, they are selling to an affiliate, \nand they lowball the price, and they make more money, and the \nGovernment is being cheated.''\n  I do not think that is the case. If it is the case, the government \nhas every right to take the company to court, and maybe they can win.\n  What we want to do is have clarity. We want to have definability. We \nwant people to pay exactly what they owe in royalties--not a dime more, \nnot a dime less. And that is our objective. It is easier said than \ndone. And the MMS came up with some proposed regulations. They said, \n``Oh, well, we will put out some prices that are on the exchange, and \nthat will be what the royalty will be based on, on that given date.''\n\n[[Page S10407]]\n\n  But wait a minute. What if there is an arm's length transaction where \nsomebody actually bought and sold? Maybe they didn't buy or sell at the \nsame price posted on the exchange. Market valuation on some exchanges \nis based on some transactions, but you have some transactions below it \nand some above it; you have some transactions that might be a little \nhigher because of a little different weight of oil or different grade \nof oil or a transportation problem or a little different sulfur \ncontent. There are lots of variables in the equation.\n  So to have some bureaucrat say, well, I am going to pick this market \nindex or this posted price somewhere and that will be the value of what \nthe Federal Government will be paid on instead of the actual value of \nan arm's length transaction, that doesn't make sense. I will tell you, \nin my own State we have several different prices on different types of \noil. We have Texas crude; we have Oklahoma sweet, Texas sweet; we have \nCushing prices; we have a lot of different prices, posted prices, and \nso on.\n  So I just mention to my colleagues, I don't think the oil companies \nare trying to cheat anybody. I think the proposed regulations are not \nclear; they need to be clarified. We need to work with MMS to try to \ncome up with better regulations that are clear and work. They haven't \ndone it yet. And their proposal leaves a lot to be desired. Their \nproposal would result in more litigation, and that is not going to help \nany schoolboard in the country.\n  And so I think we have the responsibility in Congress as maybe the \ncountervailing branch of Government, the branch of Government that \nlistens to our constituents when we find a regulatory agency that is \nnot listening, that is not working, that is not promulgating \nregulations that will work, to get their attention. We have an \nobligation to make them work with us to come up with something that is \nreasonable and sound. And if they continue to come up with regulations \nthat will not work, that do not make sense, then we should stop that. \nThis is called checks and balances. It is called balance of power. We \ncannot allow regulatory agencies to run amok.\n  And so I think we have a constitutional responsibility to try to make \nsome progress in this area. If we find regulatory agencies that are not \ndoing what they are supposed to be doing, we should hold them in check. \nThat is what this provision, that the Senator from California is trying \nto strike, strives to do. This provision doesn't say that MMS cannot go \nfurther on their proposed regulations. It basically says let's put out \nregulations that are reasonable and sound. And many of us have tried to \nfacilitate meetings to make that happen.\n  My colleagues on the other side said that this proposed rule exempts \n95 percent of the companies. Independents are not covered. Independents \ntell me they are covered. The regulations are written for all oil \nproducers; 100 percent of all oil producers are covered by these \nregulations. Some of my colleagues have said: Oh, no; it just applies \nto those companies who are selling to marketing affiliates. Guess what. \nMore and more companies today are selling into a company that maybe \nthey have a little piece of or something--a natural gas marketing \ncompany, an oil marketing company, and so on. They are banding together \nin these types of organizations. And so this regulation certainly \nreaches, I would say--I don't know what percentage, but according to \nthe independent petroleum producers--I happen to think they would know \nmore about it than anybody else--it says 100 percent. The independent \nproducers say in a memo, ``Percentage of oil producers impacted by the \nproposed oil royalty rule, 100 percent.'' I happen to think they know \nwhat they are talking about.\n  And so again I compliment my colleagues, Senator Hutchison and \nSenator Domenici, for including this provision in this bill. I think \nthey are right in doing so. I think MMS needs to work with Congress and \nwith the affected parties to make sure that every company pays exactly \nwhat they owe--no more, no less.\n  If colleagues are interested in trying to raise money, they should \ntry to raise the royalty rate, and we can have a debate on that. That \nis certainly within their rights. I don't think they will be \nsuccessful, but they have the right to try that. But to try to raise \nthe royalty rates by changing the regulations or trying to change the \nregulations in a way so that they will raise money is a tax increase by \na regulatory agency, I reject that emphatically. Congress has the power \nto raise taxes, not some unelected bureaucrat in the Minerals \nManagement Service.\n  To all the arguments that our colleagues from California and others \nmade, that this proposed regulation is going to raise so much money and \nit is going to help schools, and so on--no; what we have to do is make \nsure that every company pays exactly what they owe--no more, no less. \nThe current system is not correct. It needs to be improved. However, \nthe regulations proposed by the MMS do not fit the bill. They need to \nbe revised. We are trying to get their attention so they will revise \nthose rules in a workable, definable, understandable way that is clear, \nso that everyone will know exactly what should be paid and will pay \nthat much and no more.\n  Mr. President, again I thank my colleagues for their efforts, and I \nurge my colleagues to support our effort to defeat the amendment of our \ncolleague from California.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like to yield 10 minutes to my colleague from \nArkansas, Senator Bumpers, but I want to just make a point on the \ncomments of Senator Nickles.\n  We have here a chart that shows how many meetings were held before \nthis rule was put into place. I want to make sure that colleagues \nunderstand there were actually many, many months of proposals. That it \nis a fact that the purpose of this rule is not to raise additional \nrevenue. But, if companies pay their fair share, the Mineral Management \nService has shown us, if they do in fact pay the royalty payment on the \nmarket price rather than a made-up price when a company sells to its \nown affiliate, taxpayers will receive $66 million in additional \nrevenue. That is why all these various schoolboards are for it and many \nstate land commissioners.\n  I wanted to point out, when the rule was beginning, there were very, \nvery favorable comments from Louisiana, Wyoming, New Mexico, Alaska, \nand there is a reason for it. We see that these States have had to sue \nin the past, I say to my friend from Oklahoma, for the fair share of \nthe royalty payments that they believed they were owed. And I think \nthat the States are saying to us: ``We don't want to go this route. We \ndon't want to be litigious. We don't want to be in court every day. We \nwant a fair rule.'' I know my friend from Oklahoma wants a fair rule. \nThe issue is, How do you go about it? Do you go about it by shutting \ndown the ability of the Interior Department to proceed on what many in \nthe States are saying is fair, even New Mexico? The Tax Revenue \nDepartment said, ``The MMS should be commended for the effort they have \nmade in developing oil valuation regulations that are fair to all \ninterested parties.''\n  We can see that the oil companies settled for $2.5 billion in Alaska; \nin New Mexico, $8 million; in California, $350 million; in Texas, $17.5 \nmillion. The fact is, oil companies are settling because they are not \nin a strong position. When you pay a royalty payment based on a made-up \nprice and not a market price, you open yourself up to lawsuits.\n  I also wanted to point out that if you really look at the companies \nthat are affected by this--and we have put this in the Record--they \nmake in the billions of dollars, and these royalty payments are a tiny \npercent. As a matter of fact, what we have learned is that one of the \ncompanies, Shell Oil, which would see the greatest increase in their \nroyalty payment, that great ``increase'' is equal to 7-100ths of 1 \npercent of Shell Oil's revenue every year.\n  So, we are not talking about huge sums of money to these giant oil \ncompanies. What we are really fighting about here is the principle, the \nissue that they should pay their fair share. And even if $66 million \ndoes not look like a lot of money to some of my colleagues, it is a lot \nof money when it goes into various States and into classrooms.\n  I yield 10 minutes to Senator Bumpers at this time.\n\n[[Page S10408]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for \nyielding to me.\n  Mr. President, just to put this thing in perspective, I call on all \nof my colleagues to recall the number of times they have appeared \nbefore their local chamber of commerce and Rotary Clubs and told them \nthat, once they get to the U.S. Senate, or even the House of \nRepresentatives, it is going to be a new day. They are going to protect \nthe people's rights. They are going to take care of their money. We \nhave pledged: ``I will treat your property and your money as though it \nwere my own.''\n  I have made that speech, and I daresay 99 other Senators have made it \nas well. So I say, we have to ask ourselves, are we fulfilling our \ncommitment and our solemn vow to the people back home? Ask yourself \nthis question: If you had an oil well, and you discovered that your \nlessee was selling your oil to an affiliate or a wholly-owned \nsubsidiary, and they were selling it at a price considerably less than \npublished spot prices of that oil--would that be acceptable to you as a \nprivate landowner? Let's assume your lessee is selling your oil to an \naffiliate for $12 a barrel, but the spot price of that oil is $14 a \nbarrel--if you were the royalty owner, wouldn't you question that? \nWould you tolerate it?\n  I read a story in USA Today from which I quote:\n\n       States, native American tribes and landowners are suing for \n     the full, open-market price fees, and a few oil companies \n     have begun to cut settlement deals from Alabama to New \n     Mexico, rather than face trial. According to the Watchdog \n     Project on government oversight, there is more than $2 \n     billion in uncollected Federal royalties at open-market \n     prices, and the total grows by $1 million every week.\n\n  When you vote against Senator Boxer's amendment, are you keeping \nfaith with the people back home who own this oil? It does not belong to \nthe U.S. Senate, it belongs to the taxpayers of America. When the \nSecretary of the Interior signs a lease with Exxon, Mobil, or whoever, \nthe lessees agree to pay a royalty, usually 12.5 percent, on the oil \nthey take from the Federal land. However, having agreed to that, they \nnow are not paying that. While I appreciate that oil prices are \ncurrently low, that does not provide justification to cheat the \ntaxpayers of America out of the fair royalty on their oil.\n  If this case did not have any merit, why did Mobil recently settle \nwith the U.S. Government for $45 million on this very issue? They have \nessentially agreed to the very same thing Senator Boxer is saying they \nowe. Why are Native Americans suing for royalties? Why are States \ncollecting big, big settlements with the oil companies? Precisely for \nthe very reason Senator Boxer brought this amendment up. All she is \nsaying is let's collect on the lease for what the oil brings, not for \nsome fictitious price created by selling to yourself, by selling to an \naffiliate. If you are going to treat the taxpayers' money as though it \nwere your own, ask yourself what would you do? Why, you wouldn't \ntolerate this for 10 seconds, would you, if you found out that the oil \ncompany that had the lease on your land had been selling oil to a \nwholly-owned affiliate at $2 under the spot price for which they could \nhave sold it?\n  This reminds me of a coal case. We found out that Ohio Power Company, \na utility company in Ohio, had been buying coal from one of its wholly \nowned affiliates for 100 percent more than they could have bought it on \nthe open market. You talk about a cozy relationship. This was a \nslightly different situation, but I am just telling you, these things \nhappen. So, if you vote against Senator Boxer's amendment, don't go \nhome and tell people how you are treating their property as if it was \nyour own, because you wouldn't tolerate it for a second.\n  Mr. President, the Minerals Management Service is the agency we \ndepend on to manage royalties on Federal lands leased for oil and gas. \nWe expect them to get the most for it they can get. Congress has set \nthe royalties on oil here. We say the Secretary of the Interior cannot \nlease it for less than 12.5 percent, and then say to the Minerals \nManagement Service, ``But if you catch the oil companies pulling \nshenanigans, don't do anything about it''? If Senator Boxer's amendment \nfails, that is what we are saying.\n  So I regret that the price of oil is low, and the Senator from Texas \nhas made that point a number of times; oil prices are low. Most of you \nknow I have spent 9 years trying to make the Federal Government make \nthe hard rock mining companies pay royalty on the land we give them for \n$2.50 an acre. I faced it. I am leaving here at the end of this year. I \ndon't know what will happen after that, but I can tell you one thing, I \ntried for 9 years. I stood where I have been standing right now for 9 \nyears and squealed like a pig under a gate, saying the same thing I am \nsaying now: You are cheating the American taxpayers.\n  You think about us giving away 3.2 million acres of land in this \ncountry for the last 130 years for $2.50 an acre, land that had \nbillions and billions of dollars of minerals under it, and what did the \ntaxpayers get back? They got 557,000 abandoned mine sites that are \ngoing to cost them $70 billion to reclaim. Royalties? Zip. Nothing. Not \na dime. I lose it every year, and the people who vote against me go \nback to the Chamber of Commerce and say, ``Oh, I'll treat your property \njust as though it were my own.'' If you believe that is the truth, you \nought to be in a mental institution. If that is your idea of treating \nproperty the way you would treat it if it were your own, you need a \nguardian. The situation here is essentially the same thing.\n  The other day when I tried to raise another issue, just an \nenvironmental issue on how we are going to mine these hard rock \nminerals, I lost. I got 40 votes. I knew I was going to lose. The same \npeople who voted against me will go back home and say they are \nenvironmentalists, even though they do not want the Interior Department \nto regulate how we mine and how we reclaim the land after we mine. I \njust got killed on it, 58 to 40. As I say, I am leaving, so the other \nside won. I know a couple of people here who I think will take it on, \nand it will be in capable hands, but I forewarn you: ``It ain't an easy \nbattle.'' That is the most egregious case I have ever run across in my \nlife--billions in gold and palladium and silver taken off the land over \nthe years and taxpayers don't get a nickel for it. All they get is a \nbig environmental Superfund site.\n  Mr. President, in this case I will plead with my colleagues, the \nStates favor this. I understand Wyoming has kicked the traces over, but \nthe rest of them favor this amendment, and they are cutting deals with \nthe oil companies right now. Senator Hutchison said no, the United \nStates is not going to cut a deal; if the Indian tribes and the States \nwant to, that is their business, but oil prices are low, and we are \njust not going to bother with it.\n  Gold prices are low, too, and I know that.\n  Mr. President, I will close by simply reminding my colleagues that I \nhave heard in the last 24 hours that one of the principal candidates \nplanning to run for President says he is reconsidering because he \ndoesn't know whether he wants to subject his family to what goes on up \nhere.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. He says he doesn't want to subject his family to the \nkind of things to which politicians are being subjected. There are two \nsides to that story, and I understand that.\n  When I ran for Governor 28 years ago--I won the Democratic primary \nalmost 28 years ago today--I had a slogan: ``Let's get our State \ntogether.'' We had been bickering and nothing was happening in the \nState. I said, ``Let's get our State together,'' and when I was \nGovernor, I called people together, Republicans and Democrats, and we \nworked well together. We had 4 great years, if you will pardon a self-\nserving statement.\n  I always said politics is a noble profession. My father said it a \nlong time before Jack Kennedy did. He believed it. He served in the \nlegislature. He wanted his two sons to go into politics. How long has \nit been since a parent has said they want their son or daughter to go \ninto politics?\n  In any event, he didn't say all politicians are noble, he said public \nservice is an honorable, noble profession. I have always believed that. \nI think it\n\n[[Page S10409]]\n\nstill is. I think what a tragedy it is that the country is in the \nsituation it is right now and the effect that has on people and their \nwillingness to serve and their wanting to serve as I did. I think about \nus voting on things here where it is obvious to me--I don't want to \nseem arrogant about this, but this is not even a debatable amendment \nabout what is fair and what is right. We all know what it is. So I \nplead with you, do your duty. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nLouisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask the Senator if she will yield for 2 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes, I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to Senator Bumpers, in particular \nI speak of the last 2 minutes of his statement. I commend him for what \nhe said and his concerns about the condition of our country, and in \nparticular--I use a different word--but the cynicism that is generating \nby leaps and bounds about politicians and people in public life. We \ncan't have our democracy and have that continue indefinitely. It will \ngo right to the heart of it.\n  Having said that, I was going to say something a little bit more \njovial and just suggest that your eloquence is going to be greatly \nmissed, but the fact that you keep losing, could it mean that you \nhappen to be wrong? I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I say to my wonderful colleague from \nArkansas before I get into the substance of my remarks, I have \ntremendous respect for him for his tremendous fight over such a long \nperiod of time on issues like this. Yesterday, we were together in our \narguments because we have very similar feelings, which I think is \nshared by many in this body, about paying the taxpayer their fair share \nwhen it comes to minerals. I say to Senator Bumpers, he is going to be \nmissed. I am going to pick up the fight, as I told him before, on hard \nrock mining, but there are some big differences between what we talked \nabout on mining yesterday and what we are speaking about today.\n  One of those big differences is in hard rock mining there are no \nroyalties paid. It is a system that cries out for reform and change. In \nthis instance--and I know you say, ``Well, there is Landrieu; she's \nfrom an oil and gas State. We knew she was going to say this.'' Trust \nme, when this issue first came up, I didn't know what I was going to \nsay, for a number of reasons. Maybe I should say something about that \nfirst.\n  Before you came here, you were a Governor, but I was a State \ntreasurer and I managed a billion dollars that came from the Outer \nContinental Shelf. Because we are a poor State, because we haven't \nmanaged our resources as well as we could have in the past, and because \nof other issues--we didn't have computers in the classrooms--I managed \nthat money more carefully than I manage my own. It came from these \nroyalties, and I treasured every single penny, because with every dime, \nwe could then hire a new teacher or put a computer in a classroom or \nbuy software for kids. I am there with you on that 100 percent. We had \nthat billion dollars, and it is growing every day and we are happy for \nit in Louisiana.\n  I believe as deeply as I can express that we want the taxpayers to \nreceive their absolute fair share to the penny because these dollars \ncan be put to good use, and I hope they will be put to better use, \nbecause the other point I want to make is I am getting ready to \nintroduce--I hope with Senator Bumpers and others and Senator Hutchison \nfrom Texas--a bill that will help redistribute these royalties that we \nget and have been getting since 1955 to the tune of $120 billion, which \nthe Federal Government has received from these royalties; to \nredistribute it in a better way; to invest it in our environment; to \ninvest it in the expansion of our national parks; to invest it for the \nexpansion of our urban parks; to prevent species from becoming \nendangered, a real investment in our environment, a real payback in the \nright and noble sense to the taxpayer.\n  I am 100 percent on the record for just royalties being paid, for \nsubstantial royalties being paid when appropriate, so I don't want \nthere to be a question--and I so much respect the Senator for his \nfight--but this issue is about really litigation and lawsuits and \nunclear regulations. It is not necessarily an environmental or \nantienvironmental issue, and it shouldn't be a drilling or a \nnondrilling issue.\n  It is about whether we should adopt a rule that is either going to \nstop the litigation, or we are going to adopt this new rule that isn't \ngoing to stop the litigation. The rule that we have to consider for \nwhich we are now asking for a suspension is not going to do anything, \nas much respect as I have for Senator Boxer, in stopping the \nlitigation.\n  To put this in perspective, let me say to my colleagues that last \nyear, Minerals Management Service received $6 billion from royalties. \nAt issue here is $66 million, which is less than 1 percent of the \ntotal. This isn't about oil companies not wanting to pay royalties. I \nsay to the distinguished Senator from California, they sent to the \nFederal Treasury $6 billion last year, and the year before it was $4 \nbillion, and since 1955 it has been $120 billion. They are not opposed \nto sending their fair share, but because the regulations are \ncomplicated, they are difficult--the oil industry is reorganizing \nitself, driven by technology and the pressures--may I have 2 more \nminutes?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 2 more minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The oil industry is reorganizing itself in such a way \nthat all it is asking for, I say to the Senator from California and \nothers, is a fair rule that is clearly understood so that they can pay \ntheir fair share, get out of the courtrooms, cut their cost of their \nlawyers and accountants, pay the taxpayers their fair share, and get on \nwith their business.\n  It is in nobody's interest for this to continue in this way--not for \nbusiness, not for jobs, not for the taxpayer. That is what this \nargument is about, with all due respect to everyone who has said, I \nthink, very tough things about oil companies wanting to cheat.\n  Most of the oil companies I know do not want to cheat. Most of the \noil companies are happy to pay their tab, they just would like a clear \nsignal about what tab it is that they owe. And they do not want to \nspend their time in court.\n  I am afraid if we let this rule go through, we are going to spend \nmore time in court, waste more taxpayer money and not move us 5 feet \ndown the ballfield on this subject. So that is why I am opposing \nSenator Boxer's amendment and supporting to give us additional time to \nwork out some language so that everybody can pay their fair share, and \nthe taxpayers can benefit, and we can all get out of the courtrooms and \nget on to running our businesses.\n  Thank you so much.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much.\n  I thank my dear colleague from Louisiana for giving us her \nperspective from her State. And I greatly respect it. I want to pick up \non something she said. She said, ``It's in nobody's interest to \ncontinue in this way.'' And what is ``this way''? This way is lawsuit \nafter lawsuit after lawsuit. And she is right, we should not continue \nin this way.\n  We have seen Louisiana sue the oil companies and collect $10 million \nbecause the oil companies are cheating on their royalty payments. They \nsettled. The oil companies would not have settled for these large sums \nwere they not cheating. Alaska settled for $2.5 billion; California \n$350 million so far; New Mexico, $8 million so far; private royalty \ninterests $15 million so far; and Texas $17.5 million so far.\n  In other words, given the current status, without a change in the \nrule, which Interior is trying to put into place, we will continue in \nthis way--lawsuit after lawsuit. And no one can say--I mean, you would \nhave to be born on another planet to say that oil companies would \nsettle for over $2.5 billion\n\n[[Page S10410]]\n\nif they had not been making a mistake on their royalty payments which \nthey send to the taxpayers of this great Nation.\n  I think the issue here is: Do we want to continue in this way, which \nis what the rider does? It keeps us for another 12 months, for a total \ndelay of 15 months, in this way of litigation and lawsuit and \naggravation and all the rest.\n  What we are saying with our amendment is: It is time to change the \nway we do things. And my friends are saying, ``Oh, all we need to do is \nmeet and we'll fix it up,'' and so on. ``Everything will be fine. We \nknow we can resolve this. We can negotiate it.''\n  This rule started back in December of 1995. We are headed toward the \nend of 1998. There were 14 pubic hearings, 5 solicitations for comment, \nall sorts of things, to resolve this matter. The basic issue is this: \nCompanies that sell to their affiliates are paying a royalty on a made-\nup price, a phantom price, rather than paying it on the fair market \nprice--which 95 percent of the oil companies are doing.\n  Just 5 percent of the oil companies are involved in this and will \nhave to pay a fair share. It is not the mom and pop folks. It is a list \nhere, a page and a half long, compared to 34 pages long of those \nunaffected. Shell makes $29 billion a year in total revenue, Exxon $134 \nbillion. We are talking about the biggest corporations who, in fact, \nthemselves are admitting by settling all these myriad of lawsuits, that \nthey have not paid their fair share to the States or to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used her 3 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Here is where we are. Here is the market price, the real \nprice. You know, this is a capitalistic system. I am stunned by my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle. I used to be a stockbroker, so \nI know what supply and demand means. A market price is supply and \ndemand. It is the fair price. When the market price goes down, the \nroyalty payment goes down. When the market price goes up, the royalty \npayment goes up.\n  But they are not paying on the market price, these 5 percent of the \ncompanies who own their affiliates and sell to their affiliates. They \nmake up the price and they pay a royalty on that price. How would you \nlike to be able to do that in your life? It is a pretty sweet deal; and \nit is wrong. I think that the various States are saying, thank you very \nmuch to the Minerals Management Service for moving forward. All of them \nhere are saying: We commend you. ``The Minerals Management Service must \nbe complimented,'' said Wyoming's Governor in 1997. Louisiana said it, \nAlaska said it.\n  I withhold for the remainder of the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTexas is recognized for 25 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator from Texas permit me to use a minute \noff our time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Of course.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Not off your time; off the bill.\n  Mr. President, let me just say, immediately after Senator Landrieu \nspoke, I wanted to get up, but I did not timely, so Senator Boxer \nspoke. But I commend her. I think she made a very brief statement \ntoday, but I think it was right on point. For those who are looking for \na succinct wrap-up of what this issue is about, that 5 minutes is a \nvery good summary.\n  The issue is whether the new set of rules is going to solve the \nproblem of litigation and of making things clear and reasonable and \neasy to understand, or is it going to invite more litigation? And I \nthink the industry, small and large, come down on the side that it is \ntoo complex, leaves too much to the subjectivity of the Mineral \nManagement Service, and has a number of rules that are so arbitrary and \nonerous that this is not going to help us out of the mess we are in. I \nam saying it my way; I think Senator Landrieu said it her way. But \nbefore we are finished, we will talk about that some more.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to answer some of the arguments \nthat have been made earlier in the debate. First, it keeps being said \nthat the oil companies are not paying their fair share, that they are \nin lawsuits about it, and that they have been settling the lawsuits and \ntherefore they must be guilty. All of this is totally separate from the \namendment before us today.\n  There is a disagreement between the oil companies and several States \nabout how the valuations under the present regulation have been made. I \nwant the oil companies to pay their fair share. So does the Senator \nfrom California, so does the Senator from New Mexico, so does the \nSenator from Louisiana. These matters are in court, and they will be \nsettled in court. They have nothing to do with the amendment before us \ntoday. In fact, as the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from \nLouisiana have said, the oil royalty valuation process is very \ncomplicated.\n  The new MMS proposal is very complicated. In fact, I would make the \ncase that we do not change anything in the process as far as making it \nclear what is owed. It is just a matter of the Mineral Management \nService raising the rates on oil companies at a time when oil prices \nare at an all-time low. That is the issue.\n  A second argument has been made that this only affects big oil \ncompanies. I would just say that I have received a memo from the \nIndependent Producers Association of America that represents the small \nindependent oil producers. And what they say is: ``Percentage of oil \nproducers impacted by proposed oil royalty rule--100 percent.'' Because \neveryone who is in this industry knows that whatever is the standard \nfor royalties on public lands is also the standard throughout the \nindustry.\n  So to say that we are only talking about 5 percent of the large oil \ncompanies in America is absolutely untrue. We are talking about small \nproducers, independent producers, and we are talking about marginal \nproducers. Those are the ones that are drilling 15 barrels or less a \nday. They are operating at very low margins. With the oil prices at 11- \nand 12-year lows, they are not even making a profit in many instances. \nSo we are affecting oil jobs in our country.\n\n  Now, it was said by the Senator from Illinois that the amendment \ndelaying the rule was put on an emergency supplemental appropriations \nbill. That is true. It was put on an emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill and passed by both Houses of Congress and signed by \nthe President. The reason it was put on is because the Bureau of \nMineral Management Services announced they were going to finalize a \nrule without going through the congressional process that they had been \ntold they must do. There was no alternative but to immediately stop \nthat. Otherwise, they were going to implement a rule without reporting \nto the appropriate congressional committees.\n  Of course, Congress exercised its prerogative to say no, that is not \nwhat we told you to do. After all, we do make the laws and the policies \nof this country. Raising taxes is the prerogative of Congress for a \nvery good reason--because we are accountable to the people. If we are \ngoing to set the policies of this country, we must consider many \nthings. We must consider jobs, we must consider crises, we must \nconsider security, how much of our oil needs to be imported, is there a \nsecurity issue in our country. The reason that elected representatives \nmake policy is because we are accountable. We look at other factors \nsuch as how much of our oil we are importing, how many jobs are going \nto be affected, and what is the overall situation in the economy of our \ncountry.\n  I want to talk about the first part of a policy decision that \nCongress considers, and that is jobs. Oil prices are at a 12-year low \nin this country. I refer to a chart for the jobs at risk in our country \nif we now raise the cost of drilling on oil companies. Let's take some \nexamples: In California, 115,000 jobs are at stake; in Missouri, 31,000 \njobs are at stake; in Montana, over 9,000; New Hampshire, over 3,000; \nNew Jersey, almost 30,000; Nevada, over 7,000; Ohio, 54,000; \nPennsylvania, 48,000; Texas, 253,000; Virginia, almost 30,000.\n  Now, those are the jobs at stake.\n  Let me just read to Members recent articles that talk about the job \nlayoffs\n\n[[Page S10411]]\n\nthat are occurring right now because, of course, the industry is on its \nknees.\n\n  August 28, 1998:\n\n       J. Ray McDermott, a builder of offshore petroleum \n     platforms, has laid off 41 employees in Houston [Texas], \n     cutting about 10 percent of that office's staffing.\n       [McDermott] left open the possibility that more layoffs \n     could result if the oil market remains in a slump.\n\n  August 29, 1998, Halliburton lays off 100:\n\n       The state of the oil industry is being blamed for the \n     layoffs of about 100 employees at Halliburton Energy Services \n     [in Oklahoma.]\n\n  August 12, 1998:\n\n       Schlumberger laid off several hundred people in the second \n     quarter and plans further cuts, as falling oil prices lower \n     demand for its services and products.\n       Schlumberger's news comes as a number of oil-field-service \n     companies have been cutting staff in recent months. The \n     industry is struggling with some of the lowest crude oil \n     prices in 12 years.\n\n  Oil and Gas Journal, August 3, 1998:\n\n       Triton Energy Ltd., Dallas, laid off 65 employees from its \n     Dallas office as a part of a corporate restructuring and \n     cost-reduction plan. The move cuts Triton's Dallas staff by \n     more than one third.\n\n  August 18, 1998:\n\n       Low prices particularly hurt small producers who rely on \n     marginal, or stripper, wells producing less than 10 barrels \n     of oil a day. Some 74 percent of New Mexico's 24,000 wells \n     are considered marginal.\n       Some small producers have cut back or eliminated new \n     drilling projects. . . .\n       Others have shut-in wells--stopping pumping, a solution \n     intended to be temporary but which often results in permanent \n     loss of production.\n       Tom Dugan of Dugan Production Corp. in Farmington [New \n     Mexico], said, ``Essentially our income has been cut in half \n     within the last six or seven months.''\n       Dick Frank, the state Department of Labor's area director \n     in Lea County [New Mexico], said the unemployment rate in the \n     oil rich county has been climbing, reaching 6.7 percent in \n     June.\n\n  Oil and Gas Journal, July 20, 1998:\n\n       An independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States \n     survey has found that the plunge in oil prices is forcing \n     marginal well shut-ins in the U.S. Rocky mountains. Twenty \n     producers have shut in more than 200 marginal wells. . . .\n\n  Big U.S. Independent Union Pacific Resources said it will slash its \nrig count from 49 to 18 for the balance of the year, further depressing \nan already shaking North America land rig market.\n  Oryx Energy battened down the hatches, July 28, saying it will cut \nits 1,000-worker payroll costs 20 percent, or $14 million a year, and \nsell another 35 million of properties in response to continued weak oil \nprices.\n  I think it is very important that we look at the impact on people, on \ntheir families, their lives, on States that are not going to have sales \ntax revenue if people don't have jobs in States that will have to start \npaying unemployment compensation because people don't have jobs.\n  Yesterday, in the debate on the mining bill, Senator Harry Reid from \nNevada said, ``These are the best blue-collar workers in America,'' and \nhe was talking about gold prices being the lowest in years. I can make \nthe same arguments today. The Senate voted for keeping the mining \nindustry intact yesterday. As Senator Bumpers said, he lost his \nargument.\n  The same arguments apply today. We have oil prices at their lowest in \n11 years and we have the best blue-collar jobs in America. In fact, oil \nand gas jobs are among the highest paid in our economy. In Montana, for \nexample, the average oil and gas jobs pay $32,380 compared to $20,500, \nwhich is the average of jobs in Montana. Every oil industry job creates \nan average of 2.3 service-related jobs.\n  This is a very important issue for jobs in our country. As you can \nsee, almost every State is affected. It not only creates jobs in the \nindustry, but over two jobs in the service industry are related to oil \nproduction in our country. What could be bad about that? Yet, we are \ntalking about raising fees and taxes on the companies that are on their \nknees, with low prices, that are laying people off as we speak. It \ndoesn't make sense.\n  The other side has said, ``We are losing $5.5 million a month.'' In \nfact, I thought Senator Landrieu made a very important point. We are \ntalking about $6 billion in revenue to the Federal and State \nGovernments, and they want to tear it down, saying they are going to \nadd $5 million a month. You would jeopardize a steady stream of revenue \nfrom an industry that is on its knees, that is shutting down wells as \nwe speak, to try to gain $5.5 million a month. Even if you thought you \nwere going to get $5.5 million a month, you would have to assure that \nthe companies are going to stay in business.\n  If they go under, you are not going to get $5.5 million a month; you \ncould lose $5.5 million a month, and those are jobs that we now have in \nplace. Why would we jeopardize those and risk losing revenue, when you \nhope they will stay in business and gain revenue? That is not a very \ngood hope when the industry is on its knees.\n  Let's talk about the policy of raising taxes. In fact, we have shown, \nboth in Congress and in 13 States, that lowering the taxes on the oil \nand gas industry have actually increased revenues. In fact, the \nCongress passed the Offshore Drilling Deep Water Royalty Relief Act in \n1995. They gave tax relief, they gave tax breaks, lowered taxes, to \ncompanies that would go out and do the expensive drilling in the water, \nespecially the Gulf of Mexico. For doing this, the Government has \nreceived $3.1 billion in bids on those leases in the gulf. This has \ncreated over 3,500 direct jobs to manage the increased activity. In \nfact, it has created $3 billion in revenue. So we have shown that when \nwe lower revenue, we increase the amount that comes into the Federal \nGovernment.\n  When we lower taxes, we increase revenue. This has been duplicated in \nmy State of Texas, where they have given tax relief to drill the \nmarginal wells which are less than 15 barrels a day in Texas. Or if \nsomeone goes in and unplugs a plugged well, they will get a tax break. \nHere is what that has done in Texas: 6,000 wells were returned to \nproduction; $1.65 billion came into the Texas economy; 10,000 direct \nand indirect jobs were created every year; and $22 million more went \ninto the Texas treasury--$22 million by giving a tax break. Thirteen \nStates have inactive well recovery programs that are doing the same \nthing.\n  Yet, the amendment before us today would go in exactly the opposite \ndirection. It would increase the amount that the oil companies would \nhave to pay, putting many of these small producers in jeopardy because \nthat will be the industry standard, creating a loss of jobs and, I \nsubmit, a loss in revenue.\n  I have a chart that shows the economic effect of the abandonment of \nmarginal wells just in 1997. The lost revenue to California was $45 \nmillion; Kansas, $24 million; Louisiana, $8 million; New Mexico, $19 \nmillion; Oklahoma, $29 million; Texas, $97 million. These are lost \nrevenues because marginal wells went under. They had to plug the wells. \nThis doesn't even address the lost jobs or the lost sales tax revenue \nto these States.\n  So I think we have the evidence that raising taxes is going to cost \nrevenue to the Federal Government, not raise revenue to the Federal \nGovernment, because so many of the wells in this country are marginal; \nthey produce under 15 barrels a day. So if they go under, these States \nare not going to get more money for their schoolchildren, they are \ngoing to get less. That is what the amendment before us would do.\n  Let's talk about another policy issue that Congress must address when \nwe increase taxes on an industry. We import over 50 percent of the oil \nthat we need in this country--the oil we need to drive our cars to \nwork, the oil we need to operate our plants, the oil we need to produce \nfuel for every home in America. Fifty percent is imported. This is a \nnational security issue. It is an economic issue.\n  Does anybody remember what it was like when we had the severe oil \nshortage several years ago and people had lined up for 5 hours to get \ngas for their cars? They could not fill them up; they were limited. \nThey were limited in the amount or the number of gallons they could put \nin because we had an oil shortage.\n  This country cannot depend on imports if we are going to have control \nof our own economy. How could we be talking about shutting down wells \nand causing our dependency to become greater? It does not make sense. \nIt would be highly irresponsible of this Senate to do something that \nwould jeopardize every person driving a car in this country, every \nplant that operates, and every home that depends on\n\n[[Page S10412]]\n\noil or gas for its energy. We should not be even considering something \nso irresponsible.\n  I have letters of support from many organizations. I ask unanimous \nconsent that they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Citizens Against Government Waste,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 10, 1998.\n     Hon. ------ ------,\n     U.S. Senate\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 600,000 members of Council \n     for Citizens Against Government Waste, we respectfully ask \n     you to oppose any efforts in the Senate to strike the \n     provision in the Interior Appropriations Bill that delays the \n     implementation of a final crude oil valuation rule, unless a \n     resolution between MMS and industry can be reached. The \n     Minerals Management Service (MMS) proposed new oil valuation \n     rules that would eventually raise taxes on producers. The \n     rulemaking effort has involved several revisions to the \n     original proposal, but remains ambiguous, unworkable, and \n     would create even greater uncertainty and unnecessary \n     litigation.\n       Passage of this provision in the Interior Appropriations \n     Bill will provide the time necessary for the MMS and the \n     industry to reach a fair and workable agreement on the rule, \n     benefiting both sides. The taxpayers have a vested interest \n     in this issue, because the rule proposed by the MMS would \n     lead to an unnecessary administrative burden for both the \n     government and the private industry as auditors, accountants, \n     and lawyers attempt to resolve innumerable disputes over the \n     correct amounts due.\n       Please take this opportunity to prevent the current \n     proposed rule, which benefits no one, from being implemented. \n     We urge you to oppose any amendment to strike the provision \n     for delay of final valuation rule in the Interior \n     Appropriations Bill as it reaches the floor for debate in the \n     full Senate this week.\n       It is my hope that you give this suggestion serious \n     consideration. If I can be of further assistance, please do \n     not hesitate to contact me.\n           Regards,\n                                                  Council Nedd II,\n     Director, Government Affairs and Grassroots.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Citizens for a Sound Economy,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 11, 1998.\n       Dear Senator: I write on behalf of the 250,000 members of \n     Citizens for a Sound Economy regarding the Boxer amendment to \n     S. 2337, the Interior Appropriations bill. This amendment \n     allows the Executive branch to operate unchecked in its \n     efforts to legislate through regulation.\n       Our members have long opposed the reckless regulating that \n     is consuming some federal agencies. Historically, the cost of \n     this type regulation is passed on to the consumer in the form \n     of higher prices for commodities. Specifically, the Boxer \n     amendment circumvents the authority of Congress to ensure \n     that agencies of the federal government operate within the \n     bounds of the law, and it will have the ultimate effect of \n     increase the cost of oil and gas for every American. The \n     appropriators have attempted to support sensible \n     environmental policy through the appropriations process. The \n     Boxer amendment will reverse their sensible policies.\n       As the Senate considers S. 2337, I ask you to consider the \n     effect the Boxer amendment will have on consumers and their \n     wallets and vote to defeat the Boxer amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Matt Kibbe,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    National Black\n\n\n                                          Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 10, 1998.\n     Re Oil Royalties.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: The membership of the NBCC wants to \n     applaud you for your courageous stand taken against the \n     Minerals Management Services attempt to totally control the \n     method (or madness) of collecting oil royalties. Your \n     leadership is certainly pro-business and ensures us of a \n     continued prosperous economy.\n       The cost of fuel is extremely influential in most levels of \n     our economy and our competitiveness in the global market. Any \n     approach in how we assess royalties is very critical to each \n     and every one of us. Congress should certainly be involved as \n     they truly represent the people, not bureaucrats.\n       Thank you for your strong position and consider us your \n     ally on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Harry C. Alford,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           People for the USA,\n\n                                    Pueblo, CO, September 4, 1998.\n     Hon.------ ------,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: We understand that when the full Senate \n     debates the Interior Appropriations bill next week, there may \n     be an effort to remove the provision which prevents the \n     Minerals Management Service (MMS) from issuing a new ruling \n     on oil royalty valuations until Oct. 1, 1999. On behalf of \n     the 25,000 members of our grassroots People for the USA \n     campaign, I am respectfully asking you to resist any such \n     efforts to remove this provision.\n       We feel very strongly that this provision will be critical \n     to helping devise a royalty collection system that is truly \n     fair to the federal government and the oil industry. The \n     provision requires the MMS to take the time to develop a more \n     workable rule and not undermine Congress by changing yet \n     another law through bureaucratic regulation.\n       The new rule proposed by MMS is far too complex and could \n     lead to the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs in the \n     energy industry, where so many of our members are employed. \n     Please oppose any amendment that would strip this provision \n     out of the Interior Appropriations bill. Our members and \n     their communities are counting on you.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                                Jeffrey P. Harris,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. First is Citizens Against Government Waste. In part, \nthey write:\n\n       On behalf of the 600,000 members of the Council for \n     Citizens Against Government Waste, we respectfully ask you to \n     oppose any efforts in the Senate to strike the provision in \n     the Interior Appropriations Bill that delays the \n     implementation of a final crude oil valuation rule, unless a \n     resolution between MMS and industry can be reached. The \n     Minerals Management Service proposed new oil valuation rules \n     that would eventually raise taxes on producers.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       Passage of this provision in the Interior Appropriations \n     Bill will provide the time necessary for MMS and the industry \n     to reach a fair and workable agreement on the rule, \n     benefiting both sides.\n\n  Here is a letter from the Citizens for a Sound Economy:\n\n       I write on behalf of the 250,000 members of Citizens for a \n     Sound Economy regarding the Boxer amendment to the Interior \n     Appropriations bill. . . . Historically, the cost of this \n     type regulation is passed on to the consumer in the form of \n     higher prices for commodities.\n\n  Of course, it makes sense that if we are going to raise the rates \nthat producers have to pay, it is going to raise the price of every \ngallon of gas that you buy at the pump.\n\n       Specifically, the Boxer amendment circumvents the authority \n     of Congress to ensure that agencies of the Federal Government \n     operate within the bounds of the law, and it will have the \n     ultimate effect of increasing the cost of oil and gas for \n     every American.\n\n  This is in a letter from the National Black Chamber of Commerce:\n\n       The cost of fuel is extremely influential in most levels of \n     our economy and our competitiveness in the global market. Any \n     approach in how we assess royalties is very critical to each \n     and every one of us. Congress should certainly be involved as \n     they truly represent the people, not bureaucrats.\n\n  This is from the People for the USA:\n\n       The new rule proposed by MMS is far too complex and could \n     lead to the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs in the \n     energy industry, where so many of our members are employed. . \n     . .\n       On behalf of the 25,000 members of our grassroots People \n     for the USA campaign, I am respectfully asking you to resist \n     any such efforts to remove this provision.\n\n  Mr. President, we are talking about tax policy in this country. If \nyou vote for the amendment before us today, we are saying that the \nMineral Management Service can walk away from Congress and the \ncongressional intent and congressional mandate that they report to us \nabout any kind of fees or increases.\n  If they do this--and if we allow them to do this--we will shut down \nmarginal wells throughout our country, which we have already seen \nhappening because of the low prices. Thousands of people will be out of \njobs. We will lose revenue in our States and our Federal Government, \nhurting the schoolchildren of our States when they are not able to have \nthat income stream that is now steady--$6 billion worth of steady \nincome stream--which will become shaky from marginal producers because \nthey cannot make ends meet. They are laying off people every day \nbecause of the low price of oil.\n  This is not the time to raise prices. We should not let unelected \nbureaucrats do it, and we should not jeopardize the energy independence \nof our country by allowing a bureaucracy to raise taxes when that is \nthe prerogative of Congress.\n  Thank you. Mr. President, I thank Senator Domenici for his \nleadership, along with the bipartisan group that is trying to make sure \nwe keep jobs and energy independence and gasoline pumps filled \nthroughout our country.\n\n[[Page S10413]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. How much time \ndoes Senator Boxer have and how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time remaining for Senator Boxer is 7 \nminutes 15 seconds. The time remaining for the Senator from New Mexico \nis 13 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you. Mr. President, I thank Senator Boxer for \nagreeing to this unanimous consent. I very much appreciate it for some \npersonal reasons.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when all debate time is consumed, or \nyielded, that the amendment be set aside until the hour of 5:50; and, \nat that time, there be 10 minutes for debate for closing remarks prior \nto the vote on the motion to table the Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, since I have considerably more time than \nthe distinguished Senator from California, I would like to make a few \nremarks and then save a few minutes for Senator Gorton, the manager of \nthe bill.\n  Mr. President, fellow Senators, first of all, there has been a lot of \ntalk about lawsuits that are out there that have been going on for \nyears on end. Essentially, fellow Senators, the reason that a new set \nof regulations and rules were supposed to be adopted was so we wouldn't \nhave all of that litigation; so that we have a more clear-cut \ndefinition of what is market value for oil and gas, rather than leave \nso much to subjectivity, to arguments and disputes.\n  Let me suggest, if that is the case, that I can almost promise the \nU.S. Senate that if the rules that the Minerals Management Service is \nproposing to adopt are adopted that they will all be back in court over \nand over again, because they are unintelligible. They leave many \nopportunities for the Minerals Management Service to second-guess. They \nleave at times many opportunities to go back in an audit and even undo \nthe market value as determined by a company upon the advice of people \nfrom the MMS.\n  Mr. President, when I was a Senator in the middle of the Iranian-\nprompted crisis where we had lines--Senator Hutchison's statement was \nthat they even shot at each other in New York in one of those lines \nearly in the morning because somebody thought one car was moving ahead \nof them. You might have been Governor, I say to the occupant of the \nChair, when that happened. You may remember that.\n  During that period of time, a gentleman in my State, who is currently \none of the most successful and marvelous businessmen in the retail \nmarketing of oil and gas products in my State, was down in a little \noffice where his business was beginning. He begged me to come and see \nhim. I went to see him. And a grown man was on the brink of falling \napart. Whenever he would talk, he would cry, because the then-U.S. \nGovernment Energy Department had been told by Congress to enforce some \nvery vague rules about gouging.\n  Here comes auditors to that man's office. He can't give them enough. \nThey come back month after month, and his business is floundering. And \nthey want more information. They want to go back further in time. They \nwant him to bring in his customers and let them talk to the enforcing \nagency about the various arrangements.\n  I pledged to him right then that, not knowing the facts, I would see \nthat he was treated fairly. He was. He succeeded in getting around \nthat, and is surviving, as I have just indicated, bountifully.\n  Mr. President, what we don't want to let happen is we don't want a \nnew set of regulations that permit a bureaucracy, however much we must \nrely on them--the MMS--to go into American energy producers in the \nmanner that I have just described for my good friend down in Artesia, \nNM.\n  I contend that is what is going to happen, because, pursuant to \ncongressional requests, some of us, Democrats and Republicans, sat down \nat the table with the MMS and the industry. And it is absolutely a \ncinch based upon the disagreements that occurred around that table and \nthe failure on the part of the MMS to consider what many of us thought \nto be a very reasonable request; that if we let these get adopted, we \nhaven't seen anything yet with reference to tying up this money in \nlitigation and arguments. As a matter of fact, there is even a position \nin these new rules where the MMS can actually contend that a company \nwould sell below market value to avoid the 12.5-percent royalty. Does \nthat make sense to anyone? When you sell below market and give \nsomething away, you are giving away 12.5 percent to the Government, but \nyou are keeping 87.5 percent of your own money. Right? But there is \nsomething in here to make sure they don't sell below market. There are \nso many nuances. I am not sufficiently expert. Again, I think I know \nwhen I see something that isn't going to work.\n  Let me conclude. Industry is not to blame for the current rule. The \nMMS wrote it. All producers are affected by it--not 5 percent. Under \ncurrent law, MMS can collect the royalties that are fair market value. \nNothing is stopping them. Anybody thinking we are going to stop \ncollecting royalties is mistaken. We are going to keep on collecting \nthem under a set of rules that are very unreasonable and complicated. \nBut why substitute another set that we think is going to do equally as \nbad and maybe move even more arbitrarily against the producers of \nenergy in this country? There is a concept within it that you are \nguilty until proven innocent. There is, as I said before, a notion that \nproducers will sell cheaply to avoid a royalty. Why would anybody do \nthat? I just explained that to the Senate.\n  There is extensive opportunity for second-guessing. The scourge of \nthe regulated is to have regulators second-guess. That is the scourge. \nYou have one answer and you thought you were abiding by it. But they \nsecond-guess it and you get audited. And there is another set of rules. \nThese rules are unworkable. One well, 10 different valuation \ncalculations for on-shore oil; one well, 8 different valuation \ncalculations for off-shore.\n  For whatever has been said here today about who we are working for in \nopposing the Boxer amendment, actually what I believe is happening is \nwe are saying to a bureaucracy of the U.S. Government that we have had \na good view of how you make rules, we think you are doing it in an \nunreasonable manner, and we would like you to do it better, so we are \nnot going to give you any money to enforce what you have proposed to \ndo.\n  Essentially, all the arguments have been made about how important gas \nand oil production is for our Nation. We understand that. But this is \nnot an issue about anybody cheating. It is an issue about whether a new \nset of rules is better than the old ones when we firmly believe they \nare not.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n7 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like to ask my friend if it is OK if when we come \nback I close the debate with 5 minutes. Would that be all right with \nthe Senator from New Mexico?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We each get 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. I would like to close. I ask unanimous consent that \nI get to close the debate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. When we do our 5 minutes each.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator so much. I just want to say to my \nfriends, Senator Domenici and Senator Gorton, again, how much I \nappreciate their courtesies. This is a very important issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask if you would advise me when I have 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise the Senator when she has \nused all but 2 minutes of her time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have really enjoyed this debate. I was \nsaying to Senator Gorton I thought it was very important to have it \nbecause when it was raised in committee, it was a truncated debate. \nThis has given us a chance to really show both sides.\n  I think another reason I have enjoyed the debate is because it goes \nto the\n\n[[Page S10414]]\n\nheart and soul of why I want to be in the Senate; and that is to look \nout for real people, the real people who make this country go, who get \nup every day and go to work and save to get a car and hopefully save to \nget a condominium or a home and to get the American dream.\n  I think there is another part of that American dream that sometimes \ngets overlooked, and that is our heritage; that we have much more as \nAmericans than our personal possessions, important though they are. We \nown the parks. We own the waters, the coastal waters. And others cannot \ndestroy those because they belong to us.\n  I think it is important for us to note that we are talking about the \nmost powerful oil companies--5 percent of oil companies, some of which \nmake in the many billions of dollars. And I pointed this out before. \nFor example, Exxon, in 1996, generated $134 billion in revenue from oil \nand gas. And the vast majority of the oil companies impacted by this \nrule are huge. The impact on Exxon, for example, would be one one-\nhundredth of 1 percent of their revenue.\n  My friend from Texas says that is going to cause a disaster. Well, \nthe one good thing about royalty payments, as they are owed to the \nhard-working Americans of this country, because it is, in fact, oil \ndrilled on their land which they own, that we all own as Americans, is \nthat the royalty payments go down with the price of oil. So it is very \nfair. And here you see, again, the lease that is signed by the oil \ncompanies wherein they promise to pay a fixed royalty which is a \npercentage of the value of the production, and therefore when oil \nprices are up, the American people get more. It is a rent that is \nbasically paid on a floating basis depending on the market price of \noil.\n  Now, my friend from New Mexico, for whom I have the greatest respect \nand admiration, says it is very complicated to figure out what is the \nmarket price of oil. And as I said before, I was a stockbroker in a \nformer life, and I know that oil prices are posted and listed every \nday. I would place into the Record this publication, ``Platts Oil Price \nReport.'' If you look at it, you will see every single day, every \nsingle market. The market price listed here reflects the price of oil. \nSo when my colleague worries that the Interior Department is off on the \nwrong track, I would say I agree with the New Mexico Tax Revenue \nDepartment which said:\n\n       The MMS should be commended for the effort they have made \n     in developing oil valuation regulations that are fair to all \n     interested parties. They should also be commended for \n     recognizing an issue and following through with it to \n     resolution, in an environment where litigation abounds, \n     unfounded criticism is made public and political mechanisms \n     are used to mandate positions.\n\n  You cut through that and what they are saying is very clear, that the \nMMS is, in fact, working hard to come up with a solution to this \nproblem.\n\n  Now, I showed before, I think, the most telling chart of all. Mr. \nPresident, this is where we are. The oil companies sign a lease with \nus, the American people, promising to pay rent, in essence, for \ndrilling on Federal lands. It is supposed to be based on market price, \nand here you see with ARCO in the west Texas market, the market price \nvery clearly shown and the ARCO posted price, which is their, in \nessence, made-up price.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank you, Mr. President. I will take another 30 \nseconds and withhold. What we are going after is this difference. We \nthink the taxpayers deserve to have the fair royalty payment paid. That \nis why I raise this issue.\n  I will reserve the remainder of my time to close this debate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 3 minutes to Senator Gorton and the remaining \ntime to Senator Gramm of Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. I have been in the Chamber through most of this debate as \nI am the manager of the bill under discussion now. I believe that I am \nthe only one, at least on this side of the issue, who has no immediate \nconstituent interest in the subject. But I do have certain observations \nfrom listening to the debate on the part of others.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Nickles, mentioned at one point that \nthe Minerals Management Service had said that this was a revenue-\nneutral proposal, although in fact it seems not to be that case. The \nproponents of this amendment emphasize that there is a lot of money \ninvolved here for schools and for parks and for other purposes.\n  It occurs to me that if this is a debate over revenues to the Federal \nGovernment, we are in effect talking about a tax, a tax on certain \ncompanies engaged in the oil business. And if we are speaking about a \ntax, it seems to me we ought to be deciding that question here in the \nCongress of the United States. Under our Constitution, taxes are not \nlevied by regulatory agencies of the Government. They are determined \nand they are levied by the Congress.\n  If, in fact, this amendment will produce tens of millions of dollars \nfor various governmental purposes, then it is inevitable that someone \nis going to pay for those purposes. One of two things is going to \nhappen, it seems to me. And one of my colleagues can correct me if I am \nwrong. Either it will be reflected in the price of gasoline and other \npetroleum products that every consumer in the United States pays and \nwill be in effect an increase in the gas tax, or if these companies can \nsimply import more and produce less domestically, it will simply drive \nAmerican producers out of business because their cost of business will \nbe increased.\n  But one of those two consequences seems to me to be inevitable. \nEither this is going to be a tax on the American people by increasing \nthe cost of their gasoline, or it is going to increase our dependence \non foreign oil and drive American producers out of business. I think \nthat conclusion is absolutely inevitable. I think that is a policy \ndecision that should be made by the Congress of the United States and \nnot by an obscure Federal agency, and for that reason I oppose the \namendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send a letter to the desk and ask \nunanimous consent it be printed in of the Record from the Revenue \nDepartment of New Mexico indicating they support the oil moratorium.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              State of New Mexico,\n\n\n                              Taxation and Revenue Department,\n\n                                      Santa Fe, NM, July 20, 1998.\n     Hon. Pete Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Domenici: Thank you for giving me the \n     opportunity to comment on your appropriation rider placing a \n     moratorium on MMS oil valuation regulations. After careful \n     consideration, we have determined that the moratorium would \n     allow MMS and the industry more time to reach a consensus, \n     therefore we are in favor of the moratorium.\n       If I can be of further assistance, please contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   John J. Chavez,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I congratulate my colleagues, especially my dear colleague \nfrom New Mexico and my fellow Senator from Texas, for doing an \noutstanding job. I think anybody who has listened to the debate, and \nwho started the debate with an open mind that was not totally empty, \nwould conclude that you are right and this amendment should be tabled.\n  My opposition to the amendment is very simple. Congress should make \ndecisions about collecting fees and imposing taxes. Article I, section \n8, clause 1 of the Constitution says, ``The Congress shall have the \npower to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises.''\n  We should not be granting our constitutional powers to faceless \nbureaucrats who have agendas that may not reflect the will of the \nAmerican people. If our colleagues wanted to mandate by law that we \nraise royalty fees, that would be one thing. But to simply set a \nprocess in place where bureaucrats are going to effectively raise \ntaxes, I think, is fundamentally wrong. So I want to urge my colleagues \nto reject this amendment, and I want to especially congratulate those \nwho I believe have made an excellent case in opposition to the \namendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. There is little time remaining. I just want to say again \nwhat\n\n[[Page S10415]]\n\nthe USA Today editorial said, because I think it sums it up beautifully \nand it doesn't come up with the same conclusion that the Senator from \nTexas, Mr. Gramm, comes up with. It comes up with another conclusion, \nand that is, ``Industry's effort to avoid paying full fees hurts \ntaxpayers and others.''\n  Since 1920 when Congress passed the Mineral Leasing Act, the MMS has \nbeen acting to set the rules that guide the payments of royalties. So, \nnow, all of a sudden we have a move to say this is wrong. I think is \nkind of interesting, all of a sudden it is wrong, something that has \nbeen in place since 1920. This is what the MMS is supposed to do. So I \nthink this editorial really says it.\n  Imagine being able to compute your own rent payments and grocery \nbills, giving yourself a 3 percent to 10 percent discount off the \nmarket price. Over time, that would add up to really big bucks. And \nimagine having the political clout to make sure that nothing threatened \nto change that cozy arrangement.\n  And they basically say, ``Taxpayers have been getting the unfair end \nof this deal for far too long.''\n  Mr. President, I say to Senators, we have an opportunity to end this \ncozy deal today. I know some of my colleagues feel they need more time, \nthey want to work on a more fair way to collect these royalties. I \ncannot imagine, as someone who knows supply and demand--I am an \neconomics major, I was a stockbroker--it is pretty simple. You have the \nmarket price. Pay the royalty based on the market price. This is a \ncapitalistic system. We do not have industry executives sitting in and \ndeciding what the market price is in the dead of night in the back of \ntheir corporate headquarters. These 5 percent of oil companies, the oil \ngiants, are the ones who are getting away with thievery. Let's end it \nnow. Support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, has all time now been used on this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All but 8 seconds.\n  Mr. GORTON. We yield back that 8 seconds.\n  What now is the order before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is set aside until 5:50, at \nwhich time there will be 10 minutes equally divided between the parties \nfor debate.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3581\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, over the past three decades, concern for our \nenvironment and natural resources has grown--as has the desire to \nrecycle and reuse. You may be surprised to learn that one major \nenvironmental statue actually creates an impediment to recycling. \nSuperfund has created this impediment, although unintended by the law's \nauthors.\n  Because of the harm that is being done to the recycling effort by the \nunintended consequence of law, the distinguished Minority Leader, Mr. \nDaschle, and I introduced The Superfund Recycling Equity Act (S. 2180). \nThis bill removes Superfund's recycling impediments and increases \nAmerica's recycling rates.\n  We had one and only one purpose in introducing the Superfund \nRecycling Equity Act--to remove from the liability loop those who \ncollect and ship recyclables to a third party site. The bill is not \nintended to plow new Superfund ground, nor is it intended to revamp \nexisting Superfund law. That task is appropriately left to \ncomprehensive reform, a goal that I hope is achievable in the 106th \nCongress.\n  While the bill proposes to amend Superfund, Mr. President, it is \nreally a recycling bill. Recycling is not disposal and shipping for \nrecycling is not arranging for disposal--it is a relatively simple \nclarification, but one that is necessary to maintain a successful \nrecycling effort nationwide. Without this clarification, America will \ncontinue to fall short of its recycling goal.\n  S. 2180 was negotiated in 1993 between representatives of the \nindustry that recycles traditional materials--paper, glass, plastic, \nmetals, textiles and rubber--and representatives of the Environmental \nProtection Agency, the Department of Justice, and the national \nenvironmental community. Similar language has been included in \nvirtually every comprehensive Superfund bill since 1994. In fact, the \noriginal agreement, upon which the bill is based, has remained intact \nfor five years. With over 40 Senate cosponsors, support for the bill \nhas been both extensive and bi-partisan. The companion House bill has \nalmost 300 co-sponsors.\n  Mr. President, since Senator Daschle and I introduced S. 2180, some \nhave argued that we should not ``piecemeal'' Superfund. They argue that \nevery part of Superfund should be held together tightly, until a \ncomprehensive approach to reauthorization is found.\n  I generally agree that keeping popular, non-controversial provisions \nin an omnibus bill makes the more controversial provisions easier to \nswallow. And given the broad-based support for the recycling piece \nacross both parties, some think it should be held as a ``sweetener'' \nfor some of the more difficult issues. Superfund's five-year history \nsuggests, however, that the recycling provisions--as sweet as they \nare-- have done little, if anything, to help move a comprehensive \nSuperfund bill forward. Rather, ``sweeteners'' like brownfields and \nmunicipal liability are what keep all parties at the table.\n\n[[Page S10417]]\n\n  Holding the recyclers hostage to a comprehensive bill has not helped \nreform Superfund, and continuing to hold them hostage will not ensure \naction in the future. What it does ensure is that recycling continues \nto be impeded and fails to attain our nation's goals.\n  Mr. President, this recycling fix is minuscule compared to the \noverwhelming stakeholder needs regarding Superfund in general, but so \nsignificant for the recycling industry itself. It is easy to see why \nthis bill has achieved such widespread bi-partisan support among our \ncolleagues.\n  S. 2180 address only one Superfund issue--the unintended consequence \nof law that holds recyclers responsible for the actions of those who \npurchase their goods.\n  Therefore, S. 2180 does not address the very contentious and \nimportant issues of cleanup standards or natural resource damages.\n  It does not deal with orphan shares or municipal liability. The goal \nof this bill is to remove the liability facing recyclers, not to \nestablish who should be responsible for those shares if the unintended \nliability is removed.\n  It does not deal with municipal liability specifically, but if \nmunicipalities ship materials for recycling, they would be treated the \nsame as any other recycler. Thus, municipalities are provided some \nrelief under S. 2180 for recycling transactions.\n  It does not deal with owner/operator liability because such liability \nwas intended by Superfund. Any changes in owner/operator liability \nshould be considered within the context of comprehensive Superfund \nreform.\n  Likewise, issues of relief for generators who ship for disposal, \nrather than for recycling, are not addressed by S. 2180. Waste \ndisposal--indeed proper, environmentally sound waste disposal--is a \nbasic tenet of Superfund. Reforms should be considered within the \ncontext of comprehensive Superfund revisions.\n  Senator Daschle and I have heard from various parties who want to add \nminor provisions outside the scope of the bill. Although many have \npresented interesting and often compelling arguments, I find that none \nof these parties has been able to demonstrate the broad base of support \nthat has made the Superfund Recycling Equity Act so unique. No group \nhas been able to demonstrate the support of the broad-based, truly non-\npartisan group that has long recognized the need for recycling reform. \nI will continue to ask that any party wishing to enlarge the narrow \nfocus of S. 2180 show support on both sides of the aisle, as well as \nfrom the Administration and the environmental community.\n  Mr. President, much time, energy and expertise went into crafting an \nagreement where few thought it was possible. That agreement has been \nmaintained through three separate Congresses where all sorts of \nattempts to modify it have failed. Congress should accept this \ndelicately crafted product.\n  S. 2180 shows Congress' commitment to protect and increase recycling.\n  S. 2180 repeats what we all know and support--that continued and \nexpanded recycling is a national goal.\n  S. 2180 removes impediments to achieving this goal, impediments \nCongress never intended to occur.\n  Mr. President, the 40+ Senators who have already co-sponsored this \nbill recognize the need to amend Superfund for the very important \npurpose of increasing recycling in the public interest. Let's act this \nyear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/16/senate-section/article/S10416-4", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO VIVIAN DUBREUIL\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I join baseball fans everywhere in \ncongratulating Mark McGwire of the Cardinals and Sammy Sosa of the Cubs \non already breaking the single season home run record this year. I hope \nthat the House will soon pass the bill that we named for another \nextraordinary man, who once wore number 21 for the Cardinals. \nCoincidentally, Curt Flood wore number 21, which is Sosa's uniform \nnumber, and played for the Cardinals, which is the team for which \nMcGwire now plays. The Curt Flood Act, to end what is left of \nbaseball's antitrust exemption has passed the Senate and is awaiting \naction by the House. Baseball's resurgence is being fueled by the \noutstanding efforts of a number of players should be aided by enactment \nof our legislation.\n  I came to the Senate floor in early July to note the possibility that \nthe single-season record for home runs might be broken this year. I \nnoted that at this year's All-Star break, Mark McGwire had 37 homers, \nKen Griffey, Jr. 35 and Sammy Sosa 33, as they headed toward Roger \nMaris' record 61. I urged the Senate to find inspiration in the \noutstanding seasons that these and other players and teams were having \nand to improve the Senate's effort in meeting its responsibilities with \nrespect to judicial vacancies.\n  I went on to compare the Senate's pace in confirming much-needed \nfederal judges to Mark McGwire's home run pace. It is time for an \nupdate. Today, McGwire's season total stands at 63. Over the weekend \nSammy Sosa thrilled Chicago and baseball fans everywhere by passing the \nmarks set by Babe Ruth and Roger Maris and totaling 62. Ken Griffey, \nJr., now leads the American League with 52 homers, making this first \nseason in major league baseball history in which three players have hit \nas many as 50 home runs.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate confirmation total is stalled at 39. As \nrecently as 1994, the last year in which the Senate majority was \nDemocratic, the Senate confirmed 101 judges. It has taken the \nRepublican Senate three years to reach the century mark for judicial \nconfirmations--to accomplish what we did in one session. As Chief \nJustice Rehnquist correctly observed in his year-end report last year: \n``The Senate confirmed only 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in 1997, well \nunder the 101 judges it confirmed in 1994.''\n  The Senate has not even kept up with normal attrition over the past \ntwo years, let alone made a real difference in filling longstanding \njudicial vacancies. Both the Second Circuit and the Ninth Circuit have \nhad to cancel hearings due to judicial vacancies. Chief Judge Winter of \nthe Second Circuit has had to declare a circuit emergency and to \nproceed with only one circuit judge on their 3-judge panels. Recently, \nhe has had to extend that certification of emergency.\n  Yet in spite of that emergency, the Senate continues to stall the \nnomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit. Her \nnomination has been stalled on the Senate calendar for over six months. \nChief Judge Winter's most recent annual report noted that the Circuit \nnow has the greatest backlog it has ever had, due to the multiple \nvacancies that have plagued that court.\n  For a time Judge Sotomayor's nomination was being delayed because \nsome feared that she might be considered as a possible replacement for \nJustice Stevens, should he choose to resign from the Supreme Court. \nPerhaps now that the Supreme Court term has ended and Justice Stevens \nhas not resigned, the Senate will proceed to consider her nomination to \nthe Second Circuit on its merits and confirm her without additional, \nunnecessary delay.\n  When confirmed she will be only the second woman and second judge of \nPuerto Rican descent to serve on the Second Circuit. Just as Sammy Sosa \nis a source of great pride to the Dominican Republic and to Latin \nplayers and fans everywhere, Judge Sotomayor is a source of pride to \nPuerto Rican and other Hispanic supporters and to women everywhere.\n  Judge Sonia Sotomayor is a qualified nominee who was confirmed to the \nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of New York in \n1992 after being nominated by President Bush. She attended Princeton \nUniversity and Yale Law School. She worked for over four years in the \nNew York District Attorney's Office as an Assistant District Attorney \nand was in private practice with Pavia & Harcourt in\n\n[[Page S10418]]\n\nNew York. She is strongly support by Senator Moynihan and Senator \nD'Amato.\n  Ironically, it was Judge Sotomayor who issued a key decision in 1995 \nthat brought an end to the work stoppage in major league baseball. If \nonly the breaking of the single season home run record could signal the \nend of the work stoppage in the Senate with respect to her nomination.\n  Instead of sustained effort by the Senate to close the judicial \nvacancies gap, we have seen extensive delays continued and unexplained \nand anonymous ``holds'' become regular order.\n  I began this year challenging the Senate to maintain the pace it \nachieved in the last nine weeks of the last session when 27 judges were \nconfirmed. Instead, the Senate has confirmed only 39 judicial nominees \nin 24 weeks in session. Had the Senate merely maintained the pace that \nit set at the end of last year, the Senate would have confirmed 72 \njudges--not 39 judges--by now.\n  Last week The Washington Post included an editorial critical of the \nSenate for holding nominees without a vote on the Senate calendar. It \nwas right to do so. We have 12 qualified nominees on the Senate \ncalendar awaiting action. Including those still pending before the \nCommittee, we have a total of 45 judicial nominations awaiting action, \nsome of whom were first received over three years ago.\n\n  The Senate continues to tolerate upwards of 74 vacancies in the \nfederal courts with more on the horizon--almost one in 10 judgeships \nremains unfilled and, from the looks of things, will remain unfilled \ninto the future. The Judiciary Committee needs to do a better job and \nthe Senate needs to proceed more promptly to consider nominees reported \nto it.\n  Unfortunately, the only record that the Senate is on pace to set this \nyear with respect to judicial nominations is the record for the amount \nof time it takes to be confirmed once the nomination is received by the \nSenate. For those few nominees lucky enough to be confirmed as federal \njudges the average number of days for the Senate confirmation process \nhas continued to escalate. In 1994 and 1995 judicial nominees took on \naverage 86 or 87 days from nomination to confirmation. In 1996, that \nnumber rose to a record 183 days on average.\n  Last year, the average number of days from nomination to confirmation \nrose dramatically yet again. From initial nomination to confirmation, \nthe average time it took for Senate action on the 36 judges confirmed \nin 1997 broke the 200-day barrier for the first time in our history. It \nwas 212 days.\n  Unfortunately, the time is still growing and the average is still \nrising to the detriment of the administration of justice. The average \ntime from nomination to confirmation for judges confirmed this year is \n259 days. That is three times the time it took before this partisan \nslowdown began in earnest.\n  I have urged those who have been stalling the consideration of the \nPresident's judicial nominations to reconsider and work to fulfil this \nconstitutional responsibility. Those who delay or prevent the filling \nof these vacancies must understand that they are delaying or preventing \nthe administration of justice. Courts cannot try cases, incarcerate the \nguilty or resolve civil disputes without judges.\n  The federal judiciary's workload was at least 60 percent lower than \nit is today when the Reagan-Bush administrations took office. The \nfederal court's criminal docket alone is up from 28,921 cases in 1980 \nto 50,363 last year. That is an increase of over 70 percent in the \ncriminal case filings in the federal courts.\n  During the Reagan and Bush administrations, Democratic and Republican \nSenates promptly considered and confirmed judges and authorized 167 new \njudgeships in response to the increasing workload of the federal \njudiciary. While authorized judgeships have increased in number by 25 \npercent since 1980, the workload of the federal courts has grown by \nover 60 percent during the same period. That is why the prolonged \nvacancies being perpetuated by delays in the confirmation process are \ncreating such strains within the federal courts.\n  Unlike other periods in which judicial vacancies could be attributed \nto newly-created judgeships, during the past four years the vacancies \ncrisis has been created by the Senate's failure to move quickly to \nconsider nominees to longstanding vacancies.\n  In the early and mid-1980's, vacancies were between 25 and 34 at the \nbeginning of each session of Congress. By the fall of 1983, the \nvacancies for the entire federal judiciary had been reduced to only 16.\n  With attrition and the 85 new judgeships created in 1984, vacancies \nreached 123 at the beginning of President Reagan's second term, but \nthose vacancies were reduced to only 33 within two years, by the fall \nof 1986. A Democratic Senate in 1987 and 1988 reduced the vacancies \nstill further to only 23 at the end of the 100th Congress.\n  It was not until additional judgeships were created in 1990 that the \nnext significant increase in vacancies occurred and then, again, the \nDemocratic Senate responsibly set about the task of helping fill those \nvacancies with qualified nominees. Although President Bush was \nnotoriously slow to nominate, the Democratic Senate confirmed 124 \nnominees in President Bush's last two years and cut the vacancies in \nhalf.\n  With respect to the question of vacancies, it is also important to \nnote that in 1997 the Judiciary Conference of the United States \nrequested an additional 53 judgeships be created and the Republican \nCongress has refused to consider that workload justified request. My \nbill to meet that request, S. 678, the Federal Judgeship Act of 1997, \nhas received no attention since I introduced it over a year ago. Had \nthose additional judgeships been created, as they were in 1984 and 1990 \nunder Republican Presidents, current judicial vacancies would number \n127 and total almost 14 percent of the federal judiciary.\n  No one should take comfort from the number of confirmations achieved \nso far this year. It is only in comparison to the dismal achievements \nof the last two years that 39 confirmations could be seen as an \nimprovement. The President has been doing a better job of sending the \nSenate scores of nominees more promptly. Unfortunately, qualified and \ncapable nominees are still being delayed too long and stalled without \naction.\n  In commending Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and the others major league \nplayers who have inspired the nation with their achievements, I pledge \nto continue to work for comparable achievements by the Senate in \nconnection with judicial confirmations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/16/senate-section/article/S10417-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10418-S10419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              NATIONAL HISTORIC TRAILS INTERPRETIVE CENTER\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a project that is \nextremely important to the city of Casper and the State of Wyoming. The \nNational Historic Trails Interpretive Center, located in Casper, is a \nunique project designed to showcase the importance of Wyoming as a \ncenter for a number of historic trails in the West. The site selected \nfor the Center overlooks the place where the Oregon, California, Mormon \nand Pony Express Trails cross the North Platte River. In addition, the \nhead of the Bridger Trail and a fork of the Bozeman Trail can be seen \nfrom the spot.\n  The city of Casper and the State of Wyoming have been working very \nhard to build an interpretive center that will attract visitors from \nthroughout the nation and provide them with a quality recreational and \neducational experience. The facility will showcase the important role \nhistoric trails played in the development of the West and the \nincredible hardships faced by settlers as they migrated to all of the \nwestern states. The project is strongly supported throughout Wyoming \nand would be funded through a unique ``public/private'' funding program \nusing local, state and federal sources.\n  Wyoming's congressional delegation has been working on obtaining \nfederal funds for the Historic Trails Center for many years. Throughout \nmy time in the Senate, as well as my years serving as Wyoming's only \nCongressman, I have worked hard to obtain planning and architectural \nmoney for the Center and requested assistance from the Appropriations \nCommittee in obtaining the roughly $5 million in federal funds needed \nto complete the project. Unfortunately, construction funds have never \nbeen included in the appropriations bill.\n\n[[Page S10419]]\n\n  This year, the House of Representatives has included $2.6 million in \nthe fiscal year 1999 Interior appropriations bill for completion of the \nNational Historic Trails Center. Although this is only half of the \nmoney necessary to complete the project, I am extremely pleased the \nHouse took this action and recognized the importance of constructing \nthis facility. Currently, the Senate version of the Interior \nappropriations bill does not include funds for the Trails Center. I \nunderstand the difficult funding choices faced by the Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee as this bill was crafted, but I am \nextremely disappointed that the Senate version of this legislation did \nnot provide funds for the Center.\n  As the Senate completes its work on the Interior appropriations bill \nand this legislation moves to a conference with the House, I plan to do \neverything I can to ensure that funds for the Historic Trails Center \nare included in the final bill. Clearly, this project has merit and \nwould be a valuable addition to our nation's cultural and historic \nlandmarks. Over the coming days, I plan to work with Senators Gorton \nand Byrd to ensure that the House funding level is protected during the \nconference on this legislation.\n  The National Historic Trails Interpretive Center is a worthy project. \nI urge the Senate to recede to the House language on this important \nmeasure and begin the process of completing this outstanding facility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/16/senate-section/article/S10418-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1645, the \nChild Custody Protection Act. This bill makes it a federal offense to \nknowingly transport a minor girl across state lines to circumvent her \nhome state's parental consent or notification laws and obtain an \nabortion. This bill sends an important message that we will support \nthose states that have tried to protect minors from making a decision \nof this magnitude without the involvement of the parents. We should do \neverything we can to ensure that parents are able to exercise the \nresponsibilities of guiding and protecting their children, and I \napplaud Senator Abraham for his leadership on this issue.\n  A few of my constituents raised some concerns about S. 1645 that I \nwould like to address. First, the bill imposes no burden on the right \nto an abortion, and it adds no new provisions or restrictions on state \nlaws. S. 1645 is designed merely to preserve the integrity of parental \ninvolvement laws in states that have chosen to enact them. Second, the \nlegislation does not violate the constitutional right to travel. Like \nthe recently enacted Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act, the Child Custody \nProtection Act only punishes travel that is undertaken with the intent \nof dodging legitimate state laws. Third, in cases where teenagers are \nafraid to tell their parents, there are judicial bypass procedures to \naddress these situations. A study performed by the American Journal of \nPublic Health of these bypass procedures found that only 1 out of 477 \ngirls was denied judicial authorization. Fourth, S. 1645 recognizes the \nrole of states in ensuring that legal abortions are safe--to allow \nvalid state laws to be avoided is to undermine the safety of the \nprocedure and endanger the health of those minors. Fifth, parental \ninvolvement laws enjoy the support of 74 percent of Americans according \nto a 1996 Gallup poll. While S. 1645 does not alter any state's laws \nregarding abortion, it does ensure that states that do have these \npopular laws have a more realistic chance of enforcing them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/16/senate-section/article/S10419-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/16/senate-section/article/S10419-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT OF THE COMMODITY CREDIT CORPORATION FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996--PM 157\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by the provisions of section 13, Public Law 806, 80th \nCongress (15 U.S.C. 714k), I transmit herewith the report of the \nCommodity Credit Corporation for fiscal year 1996.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to provide for \nthe establishment of a program under which long-term care insurance may \nbe obtained by Federal employees and annuitants; to the Committee on \nGovernment Affairs.\n\n\n           civil service long-term care insurance benefit act\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I introduce the Civil \nService Long-Term Care Insurance Benefit Act. This legislation is an \nimportant first step in helping Americans prepare for their long-term \ncare needs.\n  I am pleased to have my colleague Senator Graham of Florida join me \nas a cosponsor of this legislation, which has also been introduced in \nthe House of Representatives by Representative John Mica.\n  The Civil Service Long-Term Care Insurance Benefit Act will establish \na program under which long-term care insurance may be obtained by \ncurrent and former employees of the federal government. The premiums \nwill not be subsidized by the government and will be paid for entirely \nby the employee or retiree. However, this legislation will make long-\nterm care insurance more affordable to by using the government's \npurchasing power to negotiate volume discounts.\n  It is my belief that the participation of a large employer such as \nthe federal government in the long-term care insurance market will act \nas a catalyst to encourage other large employers to offer similar \nplans. This legislation will establish a larger market for long-term \ncare insurance and help ensure the availability of competitively \npriced, high quality insurance products.\n  This measure will encourage Americans to be pro-active and prepare \nfor their long term care needs by making insurance more widely \navailable and affordable. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                S. 2477\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Grassley, today in introducing legislation that will give many \nAmericans a better chance of financial security in retirement, and make \nthe Federal Government a role model for American companies.\n  The issue is long term care insurance. When starting to work on this \nlegislation, several facts seemed most important:\n  In 1995 the average cost of nursing home care in the United States \nwas $37,000 per year. In some urban areas of the country, that cost can \nreach $70,000 per year. Medicare provides short-term care coverage, but \nthe average nursing home stay is two and one-half years. In fact, \nMedicare paid for only five percent of national nursing home costs.\n  Not all long term care occurs in nursing homes--85 percent of nursing \nhome care is nonskilled care. Again, Medicare does not cover nonskilled \ncare, so all of these costs must be covered by the patient and his or \nher family members.\n  Medicaid will provide nursing home and some nonskilled care coverage, \nbut an individual must be extremely low income, or become low income, \nto qualify for Medicaid. This program currently pays for over half of \nnursing home expenses in the United States. But who wants to see their \nlifetime savings, and their children's inheritance, wiped out to pay \nfor the cost of a catastrophic long term illness.\n  Unfortunately, many of us will face this circumstance. It is \nestimated that the majority of women and one-third of men who reach the \nage of 60 will need nursing home care before the end of their life. \nMany of the baby boom generation are already facing this issue as they \ndeal with their parents' needs.\n  Long term care is one of the most important retirement security \nissues facing us today. According to a 1997 survey sponsored by the \nNational Council on the Aging, more Americans (69 percent) were worried \nabout how to pay for long term care than were worried about how they \nwould pay for their retirement (56 percent). This level of concern was \ntrue for all age groups and income levels among those surveyed.\n  Although many companies are considering offering this insurance to \ntheir employees, as of 1996 only 13.2 percent of long-term care plans \nwere employer-sponsored.\n  Today, Senator Grassley and I are moving the Federal Government into \na leadership role by creating a model long term care insurance program \nfor Federal employees. I am very pleased to be working, once again, \nwith Senator Grassley to develop another proposal in our ongoing \nefforts to improve retirement security for all Americans.\n  We are introducing today the Civil Service Long-Term Care Insurance \nBenefit Act, a companion to the legislation by our colleague in the \nHouse, Representative John Mica of Florida.\n  We will offer private companies the opportunity to compete to provide \nlong-term care insurance to Federal employees. Our plan will not be at \na high cost to taxpayers; premiums will be fully paid by Federal \nemployees--however, by pooling the numbers of workers in the federal \ngovernment, lower group rates are achieved.\n  Only plans qualified under the Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act of 1996 may offer this insurance to Federal workers \nthrough our legislation, but beyond that, we will let the marketplace \ndetermine the cost and services of plans employees may purchase. \nFlexibility is important in this relatively young industry as insurance \ncompanies are still in the process of determining how to most \neffectively provide this product. Competition among the various \ncarriers, group discounts and volume of sales will keep these premiums \naffordable.\n  Eleven million individuals, including employees and retirees, their \nspouses,\n\n[[Page S10425]]\n\nparents, and in-laws would be eligible under our proposal. This bill is \njust a first step, but an important one. In encourage your support as \nwe continue to improve retirement security, in all of its aspects, for \nall Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GORTON:\n  S. 2478. A bill to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to convey \ncertain land to FERC permit holders; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n           mount baker snoqualmie national forest legislation\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in recent years, I have become \nincreasingly frustrated with the inability of the Forest Service to \ncomplete work on several small hydroelectric projects located on the \nMount Baker/Snoqualmie National Forest in my State. The Service's \ninability to make important decisions on these renewable energy \nresources is based on an inaccurate interpretation of the President's \nNorthwest Forest Plan (``ROD'') which has stopped these projects from \ngoing forward.\n  The President's Northwest Forest Plan states clearly that \nmultipurpose uses of the federal forests are not precluded, and that \nthe plan must follow existing law applying to such uses. Yet, since its \nadoption in 1994, the Forest Service has and continues to paralyze the \ndevelopment of small hydroelectric projects by ignoring laws applying \nto multipurpose. This inaction has delayed and stifled review of such \nprojects by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission--the agency \nresponsible for issuing federal licenses for hydroelectric projects.\n  Forest Service interpretation of the ROD intrudes directly on the \nability of the Commission to perform its hydroelectric licensing \nfunction of balancing development and nondevelopment issues. Both the \nCommission, when determining consistency with the purpose of a national \nforest under Section 4(e) of the Act, and the Forest Service, when \ndetermining whether to issue a special use permit, must apply existing \nlaw fairly. Forest Service inaction on pending projects (some of which \nhave been under review for over a decade) prevents FERC from completing \nits licensing responsibilities.\n  In terms of federal forest management, the six small hydroelectric \nprojects proposed for the Mount Baker/Snoqualmie National Forest are \nvirtually inconsequential. All are located well above areas affecting \nanadromous fish, and would occupy a total of 10 to 40 acres each, with \nmost of the sites being untouched except for the portions needed for \nproject facilities. Adverse impacts to fish, wildlife or other \nenvironmental resources are subject to mitigation by FERC and the \nForest Service.\n  Project proponents in my state have spent millions of dollars to \nsecure approval of six projects located in the Mount Baker/Snoqualmie \nNational Forest, including project design and environmental analysis \nnecessary to gain approval from the Forest Service and FERC. In spite \nof the fact that the 1994 ROD instructs the Forest Service to use \n``transition'' provisions to approve pending projects, it has not done \nso, and continues to add project review requirements not allowed by the \nROD or existing law. As a result, the Forest Service is stopping FERC \nfrom making timely licensing decisions on these projects. Shifting \nstandards of review an delay by the Forest Service have deprived \nproject proponents of their right to rely upon clear standards for \nproject approval before expending funds in reliance on such standards.\n  Many aspects of these projects were found to be in compliance with \nprior forest regulations and other environmental laws, and are being \nsubjected to duplicative and inconsistent review. Provisions of the ROD \ndeveloped for application to extremely large-scale timber harvest are \nnot meant to impact small-scale hydroelectric projects. \nTimber management regulations are totally disproportionate with the \nscale of any potential environmental impacts of small-scale \nhydroelectric facilities. In fact, the ROD itself explicitly recognizes \nthat uses other than timber harvest do not require the same level of \nrestrictions.\n\n  The Forest Service continues to use the ROD as a reason for imposing \nnew study requirements, increasing mitigation demands, and ignoring \nagreements on project compliance with forest plan standards and FERC \nrequirements. Each new requirement adds onerous financial burdens on \nproject proponents, delays project approval, and undermines the \nregulatory need for an end to project review so a final licensing \ndecision can be made by FERC.\n  Actions by the Forest Service have placed that agency in direct \nconflict with FERC, a result not intended by the ROD. FERC's \njurisdiction over hydroelectric project licensing is unaltered by the \nROD, which itself calls for increased interagency cooperation, not \nconfrontation.\n  Mr. President, I have tried in recent years through my position as \nChairman of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee responsible \nfor funding the Forest Service's annual budget to get some answers from \nthis agency as to why it was holding up these hydroelectric projects. \nIn 1995, I inserted language directing the Forest Service to ``conduct \nan expeditious review'' of projects covered by the ROD. In subsequent \nhearings, I have continued to ask agency witnesses for a status report. \nTo date, none of the responses from the Forest Service have satisfied \nmy concerns or adequately addressed this issue.\n  For this reason, I am introducing legislation today that would \nexpedite the hydroelectric project review process. It will require the \nForest Service to convey to permit holders and license applicants for \nthese projects at fair market value the parcels of land necessary for \ndevelopment of these projects. While I would prefer and am still \nhopeful that this issue can be resolved in negotiations between the \nproject proponents and the agency, clearly this process is broken and \nneeds to be fixed. This legislation should serve as a catalyst for \nresolving outstanding hydroelectric project review issues. Project \nproponents deserve at least that much.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 2479. A bill to establish the Commission on the Advancement of \nWomen in Science, Engineering, and Technology Development; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n  the advancement of women and minorities in science, engineering and \n                       technology development act\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto create a commission on the advancement of women and minorities in \nscience, engineering and technology development. The House version, \nH.R. 3007, introduced by my good friend, Congresswoman Morella, passed \nthe House under suspension of the rules on Monday.\n  Six years ago, I testified before the House Education and Labor \nCommittee in support of this legislation, as cochair of the \nCongressional Caucus on Women's Issues. It was a priority for the \nCaucus in 1992, and it remains one of the top seven priorities for the \nCaucus this year.\n  Since the 102d Congress, when Congresswoman Morella first introduced \nthis bill on behalf of the Caucus, we have learned more about the \nbarriers facing women and minorities when they try to enter \nnontraditional jobs, such as engineering and research, but \nunfortunately the general facts haven't changed much.\n  For example, the National Science Foundation's 1996 report, ``Women, \nMinorities and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering,'' \nfound that even those women who have obtained a degree and are teaching \nin science and engineering still face barriers to climbing up the \nladder to success. The report found that a substantial salary gap \nexists between men and women with doctorates in science and \nengineering. It also found that among doctoral scientists and \nengineers, women are far more likely to be employed at 2 year \ninstitutions and, are far less likely to be employed in research \nuniversities, and are much more likely to teach part-time.\n  And the National Research Council's 1995 report, ``Women Scientists \nand Engineers Employed in Industry: Why so Few?,'' found that women are \nstill facing paternalism, sexual harassment, allegations of reverse \ndiscrimination, lower salaries and different standards for judging the \nwork of men and women.\n  The purpose of the 11 member Commission created under this bill is to \nreview the information on the problems\n\n[[Page S10426]]\n\nfacing women and minorities in moving into the areas of science and \nengineering and make recommendations for changes in policy that would \nremove these artificial barriers which currently prevent women and \nminorities from entering and excelling in these fields.\n  We are all aware of the important role that technology plays in our \neconomy today, and for the nation, a workforce possessing technological \nskills is more than just an earnings issue--it's an issue of meeting \nnational employment needs. Today, experts agree that more than half of \nthe new jobs being created require some form of technology literacy. \nAnd by the year 2000, six out of every 10 new jobs will require \ncomputer and networking skills currently possessed by only 22 percent \nof the labor force. We must bridge the gap between ``skills demanded'' \nand ``skills known'' if our Nation is to even fill the jobs that will \nbe available just four years from today.\n  In order to meet those demands--which are crucial to the future \neconomic growth of our country--we must ensure that women and \nminorities have access to, and are not kept from, jobs in the science, \nengineering and technology fields. The bill I am introducing today will \nhelp us find ways to level the playing field and take down artificial \nbarriers that are keeping women and minorities from careers in these \nareas.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 2480. A bill to prevent the introduction and spread of \nnonindigenous pests and pathogens through the importation of wood \narticles, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                 the invasive pest control act of 1998\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to \nprevent additional introductions of invasive pests. Last fall, the \nNortheastern states were startled by reports of an Asian longhorned \nbeetle infestation in Brooklyn and Amityville, New York. This summer, \nwe heard of additional infestations in Chicago and the beetle has been \nfound in wood packing material in South Carolina, California, New \nJersey and Texas. Although the beetle has been found primarily in port \ncities, the shipment of wood packing materials across state lines could \nlead to the spread of this insect into forested areas across the \ncountry.\n  This beetle is a serious pest of hardwood trees in its native \nenvironment in China, where it has few natural enemies. Here, it has \nnone. If this pest becomes established in our forests, it could turn \ninto the gypsy moth of the 21st century. And, as we learned from the \nspread of the gypsy month along the East Coast, repeated introductions \nof the Asian Long-Horned Beetle and its spread could have a staggering \neconomic and ecological impact on our forests.\n  It also seems that the beetle has a sweet tooth--attacking mostly \nNorway and sugar maples. As Vermont and the Northeast begin the leaf \npeeping season this fall, the threat of an Asian longhorned beetle \ninvasion has us all checking our trees for possible signs of the pest. \nNot only is the sugar maple the source of our world famous Vermont \nmaple syrup, but it is also what turns our treasured Green Mountains \nbrilliant yellow, orange and red each year. It is what attracts so many \nvisitors to our state this time of year. The wood is also highly prized \nfor furniture, paneling and wood flooring.\n  Without immediate attention, spread of this insect into forested \nareas of New York, Vermont and Massachusetts could threaten the \nimportant maple sugar and fall foliage industries of the Northeast. \nThese things can chew trees into sawdust. The last thing I want to see \nin my backyard is one of these bark-eating, sap-sucking intruders from \nAsia.\n  What is even more alarming is that we do not yet have a way to treat \nthis pest. The only way to get rid of it is by destroying all the \ninfested trees. The best way to fight this pest, and similar non-native \nwood borers, is to make sure they do not get into our country in the \nfirst place. That is why I am introducing legislation today to prevent \nadditional introductions of the beetle and other invasive pests into \nthe United States.\n  The ``Invasive Pest Control Act'' will stiffen the requirements for \ntreatment of imports that use solid wood products and wood packing \nmaterial like pallets and crates. It will require that these imports \neither be debarked, kiln-dried or fumigated, depending on size, before \nthey enter the United States. After five years, the use of these \npacking materials will be prohibited. This will give importers plenty \nof time to find alternative materials to ship their products. It will \nalso give us a long-term insurance policy against future pest \nintroductions.\n  I want to make clear that the Asian longhorned beetle is only one of \nmany invasive pests that present a serious threat to our forests. \nSpruce bark beetle and Mediterranean pine engraver beetle are two other \ninvasive pests that we should be concerned about. My legislation will \nhelp prevent all of these stowaways from sneaking into our ports and \nthen into our forests.\n  This legislation is only a first step in preventing future \nintroductions of these pests. We also need to increase funding for the \nAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service to increase the number of \ninspectors at our ports and improve shipping information on imports to \ntrack the source of these pests. We also need to launch a public \nawareness campaign to help detect any infestations within our country. \nIn Vermont, we have beetle-identification cards to help the public spot \nthe beetle in their backyards or sugarbushes. We need to do this in all \nthe high-risk areas.\n  All of these steps will help protect our forests and forest economies \nfrom the Asian longhorned beetle and other pests that could wreak havoc \nif they get their antennas in the door.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows;\n\n                                S. 2480\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Invasive Pest Control Act of \n     1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the importation of unprocessed logs, lumber, and other \n     unmanufactured wood articles into the United States may \n     result in the introduction of nonindigenous pests and \n     pathogens to native North American forests;\n       (2) when environmental conditions are favorable, \n     nonindigenous pests and pathogens may prey on and devastate \n     native North American tree species, devastate habitat, \n     disrupt other native species and the environment, and disrupt \n     the economy of affected forest areas;\n       (3) the Comptroller General of the United States has \n     reported that the potential economic disruption to \n     communities affected by nonindigenous pests and pathogens \n     entering the United States, including forest pests, costs an \n     estimated $41,000,000,000 annually in lost production and \n     expenses for prevention and control;\n       (4) commercial forestry is estimated to lose forest \n     products valued at $4,000,000,000 each year due to \n     infestations of nonindigenous pests and pathogens;\n       (5) once introduced into the United States on unprocessed \n     logs, lumber, and other unmanufactured wood articles, \n     nonindigenous pests and pathogens are unintentionally or \n     unknowingly transported and introduced into inland forests \n     and habitats by truck transport and train shipment to mills, \n     consumers, and producers and by a variety of other means, \n     including wind, water, and wildlife;\n       (6) examples of nonindigenous pests and pathogens infesting \n     forests of the United States that have caused or have the \n     potential to cause adverse economic and ecological effects \n     include--\n       (A) Dutch Elm disease, which--\n       (i) was introduced into the United States in the 1920's \n     with a shipment of European logs delivered to the Port of New \n     York and then forwarded to the Midwest by train;\n       (ii) has spread throughout the United States, now to an \n     estimated 1,000,000 trees; and\n       (iii) has decimated the American and other native elm \n     species;\n       (B) the Gypsy Moth, which--\n       (i) has no natural predators in the United States;\n       (ii) spread rapidly and now infests Northeast forest in \n     approximately 200,000 square miles, with smaller infestations \n     occurring in several other areas from the Carolinas to \n     British Columbia; and\n       (iii) feeds on hundreds of different tree species and \n     during outbreaks can defoliate many hardwood and shrub \n     species in their path, seriously weakening trees and stunting \n     the growth of, and eventually killing, many of the trees;\n       (C) the Asian Long-Horned Beetle, which--\n       (i) is a new exotic pest that has been discovered at ports \n     across the United States;\n       (ii) has no natural enemies and has attacked mostly Norway \n     and sugar maples,\n\n[[Page S10427]]\n\n     some of the most valuable trees in the Northeast; and\n       (iii) is considered a serious threat to the maple sugar \n     industry, lumber industry, homeowner property values, and \n     tourism in the Northeast; and\n       (D) more recent nonindigenous pests and pathogens that have \n     become established in the forests of the United States and \n     are causing economic and ecological degradation with respect \n     to the natural forest resources of the United States, \n     including the Port Orford Cedar Root Rot, the Pine Wilt \n     disease, the Eurasian poplar rust fungus (discovered on the \n     West Coast), and the pine shoot beetle (introduced in the \n     Great Lakes area); and\n       (7) if preventive management measures are not taken in a \n     timely manner throughout the United States to prevent \n     nonindigenous pests and pathogens from entering the United \n     States on unprocessed wood products or to control their \n     entry, further introductions and infestations of \n     nonindigenous plants and pathogens will occur.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purpose of this Act are--\n       (1) to prevent the unintentional introduction and \n     dispersion of nonindigenous pests and pathogens into forests \n     of the United States through the importation of unprocessed \n     logs, lumber, and other unmanufactured wood articles;\n       (2) to preserve and protect the health of the forests of \n     the United States, the forest-dependent economy of the United \n     States, native North American tree species, and irreplaceable \n     habitat from the potentially devastating effects of \n     nonindigenous pests and pathogens;\n       (3) to coordinate federally conducted, funded, or \n     authorized research, prevention, control, information \n     dissemination, and other activities regarding forest pests \n     and pathogens; and\n       (4) to understand and minimize the economic and ecological \n     impact of nonindigenous pests and pathogens.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Public Buildings Act of 1959 to improve \nthe process of constructing, altering, and acquiring public buildings, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n[[Page S10428]]\n\n                the public buildings reform act of 1998\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Public \nBuildings Reform Act of 1998. Let me start by expressing my thanks to \nthe Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator \nChafee, and the Chairman of the relevant subcommittee, Senator Warner, \nfor their support of this bill.\n  Mr. President, the Public Buildings Reform Act will go a long way to \nhelping Congress make wise decisions on public buildings construction. \nIt will help Congress achieve some discipline with respect to the cost \nof new Federal buildings and courthouses. Specifically, the bill will \nbring some sanity to the Federal building and courthouse construction \nprogram.\n  I have been working on Federal building issues for a number of years. \nAnd the more I have learned about the issue, the more concerned I have \nbecome. It is very important that we reform the Federal building and \ncourthouse construction program. This bill will do just that.\n  Why do we need reform? Because of the amount of funding that is \ndevoted each year to new courthouse and other Federal building \nprojects. We need to spend this money wisely and only on those projects \nthat are truly needed.\n  The Public Buildings Reform Act will help do just that. It \naccomplishes two major goals--prioritization of courthouse projects and \nother Federal buildings projects; and gaining control of the courthouse \nconstruction design guide.\n  The Public Buildings Reform Act of 1998 is similar to legislation I \nintroduced a few years ago. At that time, the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee unanimously passed this legislation--which then went on \nto pass the entire Senate.\n  However, the House failed to act on this legislation. So we find \nourselves in the position of trying again. I and my colleagues \nintroduce this legislation at this time so that the debate on public \nbuildings reform will continue.\n  I have been pleased that GSA and the Administrative Office of the \nCourts have made numerous improvements to the public building approval \nprocess since 1995. But these improvements must be codified so that \nthere is no question that they will be continued in the future. Also, \nthere are further steps that need to be taken in the area of Federal \nGovernment asset management.\n  It is my hope that in the coming months, Congress will look hard at \nthe public buildings approval process and will prepare legislation that \ncan be enacted in the next Congress.\n  Working with GSA, the Courts and others, I am confident we can take \nthe steps necessary to assure the taxpayers that there are appropriate \ncost controls in place. That is our job.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2481\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Buildings Reform Act \n     of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SITE SELECTION.\n\n       Section 5 of the Public Buildings Act of 1959 (40 U.S.C. \n     604) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(d) Consideration of Costs.--In selecting a site for a \n     project to construct, alter, or acquire a public building, or \n     to lease office or any other type of space, under this Act, \n     the Administrator shall consider the impact of the selection \n     of a particular site on the cost and space efficiency of the \n     project.''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish programs regarding early detection, \ndiagnosis, and interventions for newborns and infants with hearing \nloss; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n  the early hearing loss detection, diagnosis and intervention Act of \n                                  1998\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Early Hearing \nLoss Detection, Diagnosis and Intervention Act of 1998, which will \nserve as a companion bill to H.R. 2923, introduced in the House by \nRepresentative Jim Walsh. I am pleased to have, as the lead cosponsor, \nmy colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, who has long been a champion of \nthe hearing impaired.\n  We have a tendency to associate hearing problems with the aging \nprocess, and it is true that the largest group of Americans suffering \nfrom hearing impairment are those in the 65 to 75 year age range. At \nthe other end of the spectrum, however, approximately 1.5 to 3 out of \nevery 1000 children--or as many as 33 children per day--are born with \nsignificant hearing problems. According to the National Institute on \nDeafness and Other Communication Disorders, as many as 12,000 infants \nare born each year in the U.S. with some form of hearing impairment.\n  In the last several years, scientists have begun to tell us that the \nfirst years of a child's life are crucial to their future development. \nThis makes early detection and intervention of hearing loss a necessity \nif we are to ensure that all our children get the strong start they \ndeserve. Currently, the average age of diagnosis of hearing loss is \nclose to three years of age. Yet it is believed that speech and oral \nlanguage development can begin as early as 6 months of age. Without \nearly diagnosis and intervention, these children are behind the \nlearning curve--literally--before they have even started. They should \nnot be denied a strong start in life simply for the lack of a simple \nscreening test.\n  There are many causes of hearing loss, and in many states a newborn \nchild is screened only if the physician is aware of some factor that \nputs that baby in a risk category. Our four states--Rhode Island, \nHawaii, Colorado, and Mississippi--currently require the screening of \nall newborns. in 16 other states, babies are screened only if they are \nbelieved to be a risk. This screening process, while important, detects \nonly 50 percent--or half--of the hearing problems in young children.\n  Universal screening is not a new idea. As early as 1965, the Advisory \nCommittee on Education of the Deaf, in a report of the Secretary of \nHealth, Education and Welfare, recommended the development and \nnationwide implementation of ``universally applied procedures for early \nidentification.'' In 1989, former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop used \nthis year 2000 as a goal for identifying 90 percent of children with \nsignificant hearing loss before they are one year old. And just last \nyear, the National Institutes of Health convened an expert panel at the \nNational Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, and \nthe panel made a recommendation that the first hearing screening be \ncarried out before three months of age to ensure that treatment can \nbegin before six months of age.\n  It is time to move beyond the recommendations and achieve the goal of \nuniversal screening. In addition to the four states that require \nscreening, the Bureau of Maternal and Child Health, in conjunction with \nthe Centers for Disease Control, is helping 17 states commit to \nachieving universal hearing screening by the year 2000. This plan will \nlead to the screening of more than 1 million newborns a year, but it \nstill leaves more than half the states without universal screening \nprograms.\n\n  The purpose of the bill I am introducing today is to provide the \nadditional assistance necessary to help all the states in implementing \nprograms to ensure that all our newborns are tested and to ensure that \nthose identified with a hearing impairment get help. Specifically, the \nbill:\n  (1) Authorizes $5 million for the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to work with the states to develop early detection, diagnosis \nand intervention networks;\n  (2) Authorizes $5 million for the Centers for Disease Control to \nprovide technical assistance to State agencies and to conduct applied \nresearch related to infant hearing detection, diagnosis and treatment/\nintervention; and\n  (3) Authorizes $3 million for the National Institutes of Health to \ncarry out research on the efficacy of new screening techniques and \ntechnology.\n  A baby born today will be part of this coutnry's future in the 21st \ncentury. Surely we owe it to that child to give them a strong start on \nthat future by ensuring that if they do have a hearing impairment it is \ndiagnosed and treatment started well before their first year of life is \ncompleted. I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Harkin in \nsupporting the Early Hearing Loss Detection, Diagnosis and Intervention \nAct of 1998.\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, along \nwith my colleague, Senator Snowe, the ``Early Hearing Loss Detection, \nDiagnosis, and Intervention Act of 1998.''\n  The Early Hearing Loss Act would help States establish programs to \ndetect and diagnose hearing loss in every newborn child and to promote \nappropriate treatment and intervention for newborns with hearing loss. \nThe Act also would fund research by the National Institutes of Health \nto determine the best detection, diagnostic, treatment and intervention \ntechniques and technologies.\n  Every year, about 12,000 children in the United States are born with \na hearing impairment. Most of them will not be diagnosed as hearing \nimparied until after their second birthday. The consequences of not \ndetecting early hearing impairment are significant, but easily \navoidable.\n  Late detection means that crucial years of stimulating the brain's \nhearing centers are lost. It may delay speech and language development. \nDelayed language development can retard a child's educational progress, \nminimize his or her socialization skills, and as a result, destroy his \nor her self-esteem and confidence. On top of all that,\n\n[[Page S10431]]\n\nmany children are diagnosed incorrectly as having behavioral or \ncognitive problems, simply because of their undetected hearing loss.\n  In 1988, the Commission on Education of the Deaf reported to Congress \nthat early detection, diagnosis, and treatment were essential to \nimproving the status of education for people who are deaf in the United \nStates. This Act is our opportunity to finally implement that common-\nsense recommendation.\n  Mr. President, this Act would help states develop programs that many \nof them already are working on; it would not impose a single federal \nmandate. Eight states already have mandatory testing programs; nine \nothers have legislation pending to establish such programs. Other \nstates have achieved universal newborn testing voluntarily. These \nprograms can work; they deserve federal help.\n  One of the highlights of my Congressional career, indeed, of my life, \nhas been working on policies and laws to ensure that people with \ndisabilities have an equal opportunity to succeed in our society. This \nis especially meaningful to me, because my brother Frank became deaf as \na child.\n  I watched Frank grow up, and I saw how few options and support \nservices were available for people who were deaf. I remember the \nfrustrations and challenges Frank faced, and I told myself early on \nthat I would do all I could to break down the barriers in our society \nthat prevented people who were deaf from reaching their potential. By \nsupporting early screening, diagnosis, and treatment programs, this Act \nwould go a long way toward accomplishing that goal.\n  I would like to thank Senator Snowe for her hard work and support of \nthis Act, and I hope our colleagues will join us in this worthy \neffort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Biden, Ms. Moseley-\n        Braun, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lautenberg, Ms. Mikulski, \n        Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Reid, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. \n        Torricelli):\n  S. 2484. A bill to combat violent and gang-related crime in schools \nand on the streets, to reform the juvenile justice system, target \ninternational crime, promote effective drug and other crime prevention \nprograms, assist crime victims, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n       SAFE SCHOOLS, SAFE STREETS AND SECURE BORDERS ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, joined by Senators Daschle, Biden, \nMoseley-Braun, Murray, and other Democratic Senators, I am introducing \ncomprehensive crime legislation, the Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and \nSecure Borders Act of 1998, to keep the crime rate in this country \ngoing down. Past Democratic anti-crime initiatives, such as the 1994 \nViolent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, have resulted in an \nhistoric decrease in crime rates in the United States. The FBI reports \nthat violent crime in 1996 was at the lowest level since 1989, and that \nthe overall crime rate was lower than any year since 1984. Preliminary \nfigures for 1997 show that serious crime dropped an additional four \npercent last year. These are very good numbers.\n  Yet, according to recent reports in the Los Angeles Times, people \nstill feel that crime is the number one public policy issue that needs \nattention. Americans still feel vulnerable to becoming crime victims, \nand want policy makers to do more. Thus, even with the decrease in \ncrime rates, this is not the time to stop working on additional ways to \nreduce crime. Senate Democrats want to do more. We must do more to \nensure that the crime rates continue their downward trend next year, \nthe year after, and the years after that.\n  The Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1998 builds \non the successful programs we have implemented in the 1994 Crime Law \nand addresses emerging crime problems. The bill is comprehensive. It is \nrealistic. It is fully funded, without reaching into any cookie jars. \nIt is designed to be enacted, without partisan or ideological \ncontroversy. In fact, the bill contains a number of initiatives that \nenjoy bipartisan support. We have tried to avoid the easy rhetoric \nabout crime that some have to offer in this crucial area of public \npolicy. Here is a chance to actually make a difference. It is a ``Can \nDo'' Act.\n  The Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act targets \nviolent crime in our schools, reforms the juvenile justice system, \ncombats gang violence, cracks down on the sale and use of illegal \ndrugs, enhances the rights of crime victims, and provides meaningful \nassistance to law enforcement officers in the battle against street \ncrime, international crime and terrorism. The Act represents an \nimportant next step in the continuing effort by Senate Democrats to \nenact tough, common-sense and balanced reforms to our criminal justice \nsystem. That is why the International Brotherhood of Police Officers \nhas endorsed this bill.\n  The bill has ten comprehensive titles to address crime in our \nschools, crime on our streets, and crime on our borders and abroad. I \nshould note that the bill contains no new death penalties and no new or \nincreased mandatory minimums. We can be tough without imposing the \ndeath penalty, and we can ensure certain punishment without removing \nall discretion from the judge at sentencing.\n  Title I of the bill deals with proposals for combating violence in \nschools and punishing juvenile crime. This title has four subtitles \ndealing with assistance to schools, reform of the federal juvenile \nsystem, assisting States on prosecuting and punishing juvenile \noffenders and reducing juvenile crime, and protecting children from \nviolence, including violence from the misuse of guns.\n  Assistance to Schools. Americans are dismayed and grief-stricken at \nthe recent shootings at schools across the country. While homicides at \nAmerican schools have remained relatively constant in recent years, the \nnumber of students who have experienced a violent crime in school \nincreased 23 percent in 1995 compared to 1989. We need to make sure our \nchildren attend school in a safe environment that fosters learning, not \nfear.\n  The bill would provide COPS grants for school-based partnerships \nbetween schools and law enforcement to combat school-related crime. It \ncontains a proposal developed by Senator Bingaman to establish a School \nSecurity Technology Center using expertise from the Sandia National \nLabs, and provide grants from the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program \nenabling schools to access technical assistance for school security.\n  Federal Prosecution of Serious and Violent Juvenile Offenders. The \nbill would also make important reforms to the federal juvenile system, \nwithout federalizing run-of-the-mill juvenile offenses and ignoring the \ntraditional prerogative of the States to handle the bulk of juvenile \ncrime. One of the significant flaws in the Republican juvenile crime \nbill, S. 10, is that it would--in the words of Chief Justice Rhenquist \n--``eviscerate this traditional deference to state prosecutions, \nthereby increasing substantially the potential workload of the federal \njudiciary.'' The Chief Justice has raised concerns about \n``federalizing'' certain juvenile crimes and has urged that ``federal \nprosecutions should be limited to those offenses that cannot and should \nnot be prosecuted in the state courts.'' The Democratic proposals for \nreform of the Federal juvenile justice system heed this sound advice \nand respect our Federal system.\n  Among other reforms, the Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure \nBorders Act would allow federal prosecution of juveniles when the \nAttorney General certifies that the State cannot or will not exercise \njurisdiction, or when the juvenile is alleged to have committed a \nviolent, drug or firearm offense.\n  Prosecutors would be given sole, nonreviewable authority to prosecute \nas adults 16 and 17 year olds who are alleged to have committed the \nmost serious violent and drug offenses. Limited judicial review is \nprovided for prosecutors' decisions to try as adults 13, 14 and 15 year \nold juveniles, and 16 and 17 year olds, who are charged with less \nserious federal offenses. These juveniles are permitted under strict \ntime limits to ask a judge for a ``reverse waiver'' and transfer to \njuvenile, rather than adult, status.\n  Assistance to States for Prosecuting and Punishing Juvenile \nOffenders, and Reducing Juvenile Crime. The bill would authorize grants \nto the States for incarcerating violent and chronic juvenile offenders \n(with each qualifying State getting at least one percent\n\n[[Page S10432]]\n\nof available money), providing graduated sanctions, reimbursing States \nfor the cost of incarcerating juvenile alien offenders, and a pilot \nprogram to replicate successful juvenile crime reduction strategies.\n  Protecting Children from Violence. The bill contains important \ninitiatives to protect children from violence, including violence \nresulting from the misuse of guns. Given the recent tragic shootings \ncommitted by children, Americans want concrete proposals to reduce the \nrisk of such incidents recurring. At the same time, I certainly do not \nwant to demonize guns or the legitimate use of guns for protection and \nsecurity or for sport.\n  The bill would impose a prospective gun ban for juveniles convicted \nor adjudicated delinquent for violent crimes. It would require \nrevocation of a firearms dealer's license for failing to have secure \ngun storage or safety devices available for sale with firearms. The \nbill would enhance the penalty for possessing a firearm during the \ncommission of a crime of violence or drug offense and for violation of \ncertain firearm laws involving juveniles. In addition, the bill would \nauthorize competitive grant programs for establishment of juvenile gun \ncourts and youth violence courts.\n  Title II of the bill addresses the problem of gang violence. We all \nshare a concern about the growing gang problem in our cities and in \nrural areas of this country. More than 665,000 gang members belong to \n23,000 youth gangs in the United States, and the numbers are growing.\n  This part of the bill would crack down on gangs by making the \ninterstate ``franchising'' of street gangs a crime. It will also \nincrease penalties for crimes during which the convicted felon wears \nprotective body armor or uses ``laser-sighting'' devices to commit the \ncrime. The bill also doubles the criminal penalties for using or \nthreatening physical violence against witnesses and contains other \nprovisions designed to facilitate the use and protection of witnesses \nto help prosecute gangs and other violent criminals. For example, the \nbill would clarify that the federal gratuity statute does not apply to \ncooperation agreements, contrary to the Tenth Circuit's recent \nSingleton decision. The Act also provides funding for law enforcement \nagencies in communities designated by the Attorney General as areas \nwith a high level of interstate gang activity.\n  Title III of the bill would set forth a number of initiatives in nine \nsubtitles to combat violence in the streets. The Safe Schools, Safe \nStreets, and Secure Borders Act continues successful initiatives in the \n1994 Crime Act by putting more police officers on our streets, \nproviding for the construction of more prisons, preventing juvenile \nfelons from buying handguns, and increasing the security of women and \nchildren against domestic violence. Specifically, the bill would extend \nCOPS funding into 2001 and 2002; increase the state minimum for Violent \nOffender Incarceration grants from .25 to .75 percent, establish a \nstate minimum of .75 percent for Truth-in-Sentencing grants, and extend \nboth these grant programs into 2001 and 2002; extend authorization for \nthe Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) funding and local law enforcement \ngrant programs.\n  A significant problem that arose this year was the loss of \nconfidentiality that had previously attached to the important work of \nthe U.S. Secret Service. The Departments of Justice and Treasury and \neven a former Republican President advise that the safety of future \nPresidents may be jeopardized by forcing U.S. Secret Service agents to \nbreach the confidentiality they need to do their job by testifying \nbefore a grand jury. I trust the Secret Service on this issue; they are \nthe experts with the mission of protecting the lives of the President \nand other high-level elected officials and visiting dignitaries. I also \nhave confidence in the judgment of former President Bush, who has \nwritten, ``I feel very strongly that [Secret Service] agents should not \nbe made to appear in court to discuss that which they might or might \nnot have seen or heard.''\n  The Safe Schools Act provides a reasonable and limited protective \nfunction privilege so that in the future Secret Service agents are able \nto maintain the confidentiality they say they need to protect the lives \nof the President, Vice President and visiting heads of state. This \ntitle of the bill includes a number of provisions to address the \nfollowing matters:\n  Domestic violence: In addition to extending authorized funding for \nVAWA, the bill would punish attempts to commit interstate domestic \nviolence, expand the interstate domestic violence offense to cover \nintimidation, and punish interstate travel with the intent to kill a \nspouse.\n  Protecting Law Enforcement and Judiciary: The Act recognizes that law \nenforcement officers put their lives on the line every day. According \nto the FBI, over 1,000 officers have been killed in the line of duty \nsince 1980. The Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act \ncontains provisions to protect the lives of our law enforcement \nofficers by extending the Bulletproof Vest Partnership grant program \nthrough 2003. It also establishes new crimes and increases penalties \nfor killing federal officers and persons working with federal officers, \nincluding in the prison context, and for retaliation against federal \nofficials by threatening or injuring their family members. The Act \nenhances the penalty for assaults and threats against Federal judges \nand other federal officials engaged in their official duties.\n  Cargo/Property Theft: The bill also contains an important initiative \nproposed by Senator Lautenberg to deter cargo thefts.\n  Sentencing Improvements: This subtitle doubles the maximum penalty \nfor manslaughter from 10 to 20 years, consistent with the Sentencing \nCommission's recommendation, applies the sentencing guidelines to all \npertinent federal statutes (such as criminal prohibitions in statutes \noutside titles 18 and 21 of the United States Code), and other \nimprovements.\n  Civil Liberties: The bill includes the ``Hate Crimes Prevention \nAct,'' which was originally introduced by Senator Kennedy and has the \nstrong bipartisan support of over twenty Members, and other initiatives \ndesigned to bolster support for enforcement of civil rights.\n  These program initiatives are funded by extending the Violent Crime \nReduction Trust Fund for two more years--from downsizing the Federal \nGovernment and not from touching the projected Federal budget surplus.\n  Title IV of the bill outlines a number of prevention programs that \nare critical to reducing juvenile crime. These programs include grants \nto youth organizations and ``Say No to Drugs'' Community Centers, \nreauthorization of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, Anti-Drug Abuse \nPrograms and Local Delinquency Prevention Programs. Additional sections \ninclude a program suggested by Senator Bingaman to establish a \ncompetitive grant program to reduce truancy, with priority given to \nefforts to replicate successful programs.\n  The bill would also reauthorize the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \nPrevention Act (JJDPA) similarly to H.R. 1818, which passed the House \nby an overwhelming majority last year. This section creates a new \njuvenile justice block grant program and retains the four core \nprotections for youth in detention, while adopting greater flexibility \nfor rural areas and modifies the membership of the state advisory \ngroups.\n  The Republican juvenile crime bill, S. 10, would gut these core \nprotections for juveniles in detention. Republican sponsors of this \nbill have scrambled to change this bill since they refused to fix it \nduring Committee mark-up, but even as revised this bill remains \nseriously flawed. A letter sent just last week from the National \nCollaboration For Youth (comprised of the American Red Cross, Big \nBrothers, Big Sisters, Boy and Girl Scouts of America, United Way, the \nYMCA and the YWCA, and other prominent voluntary health and social \nwelfare organizations), criticized the revised S. 10 for being ``ill-\nconceived'' and for exposing youngsters ``to increased risk.'' \nAccording to these experts who work intensively with children, S. 10 as \nrevised ``could ironically lead to more juvenile crime--not less--if \nenacted.'' The Democratic crime bill puts ideology aside, and follows \nthe advice of these experts.\n\n  Title V of the bill contains six subtitles on combating illegal drug \nuse. Illegal drugs are too often at the heart of crime. This Act would \nhelp break the cycle of drug use by criminals, requiring States to test \nprisoners for drugs\n\n[[Page S10433]]\n\nand to provide drug treatment programs, so that the convicts would not \nreturn to the streets still addicted, and still caught up in a cycle of \ncrime. It would protect our children by increasing penalties for \nselling drugs to kids and drug trafficking in or near schools, and \ncrack down on ``club drugs.'' It would go a step further and encourage \npharmacotherapy research to develop medications for the treatment of \ndrug addiction, a proposal Senator Biden has urged. It would fund drug \ncourts, which subject eligible drug offenders to programs of intensive \nsupervision. This title also would reauthorize the Drug Czar/Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy, as Senator Biden has recommended in \nlegislation he has introduced with bipartisan support.\n  Title VI of the bill deals with criminal history records and the use \nof new technologies for law enforcement purposes. We can not \nunderestimate the usefulness of criminal history records, which can \nhelp solve crimes and help prevent crimes. The bill contains the \n``Interstate Identification Index''(III) Compact to decentralize the \nFBI's maintenance of the national criminal history database and provide \naccess to criminal history records for noncriminal justice purposes in \naccordance with state rules. This provision has bipartisan support and \nhas already passed the Senate.\n  The compact is a reciprocal, voluntary system of sharing criminal \nhistory records (including juvenile records) for noncriminal justice \npurposes among the States and FBI that is efficient, more accurate than \nthe current system, promises to save money, and allows each \nparticipating State to effectuate its own access policies.\n  In addition, this title contains the ``Crime Identification \nTechnology Act,'' to provide $250 million each year for five years in \ngrants to States for identification and communications systems and \nforensic labs. This legislation has strong bipartisan support and has \nalso already passed the Senate and is pending in the House.\n  Title VII of the bill is intended to increase the right of victims \nwho unfortunately become involved in the criminal justice system. The \ncriminal is only half of the equation. We would guarantee the rights of \ncrime victims. All States have some victims' rights laws on the books, \nbut they lack the training and resources to make those rights a \nreality. This bill provides a model Bill of Rights for crime victims in \nthe federal system, and makes available to the States grants to fund \nthe hiring of State and Federal victim-witness advocates, training, and \nthe technology necessary for model notification system. This bill would \nmake victims' rights a reality.\n  Specifically, this title reforms federal law and evidence to enhance \nvictims' participation in all stages of criminal proceedings by giving \nvictims a right to notice of detention hearings, plea agreements, \nsentencing, probation revocations, escapes or releases from prison, and \nto allocution at hearings, as well as grants for obtaining state-of-\nthe-art systems for providing notice. In addition, this title would \nprovide grant programs to study effectiveness of restorative justice \napproach for victims and to study crimes against persons with \ndevelopmental disabilities and for development of strategies to combat \nsuch crimes.\n  Title VIII of the bill details provisions for combating money \nlaundering. Crime increasingly has an international face, from drug \nkingpins to millionaire terrorists, like Usama bin Laden. The money \nlaundering provisions of this bill hit these international criminals \nwhere they live - in the pocketbook.\n  These provisions would prove to be a key tool in winning the war on \ndrugs. We must have interdiction; we must have treatment programs; we \nmust tell kids to say ``No'' to drugs. But we have to do more, and \ntaking the profit away from the drug lords is an effective weapon. This \nDemocratic crime bill would strengthen these laws.\n  FBI Director Freeh recently testified at a hearing before the \nJudiciary Committee that enhanced money laundering provisions would be \nan important tool against the likes of international terrorists, such \nas bin Laden. FBI Director Freeh praised the following provisions set \nforth in this title of the bill.\n  Fugitive Disentitlement to stop drug kingpins, terrorists and other \ninternational fugitives from using our courts to fight to keep the \nproceeds of the very crimes for which they are wanted. Criminals should \nnot be able to use our courts at the same time they are evading our \nlaws.\n  Immediate seizure of U.S. assets of foreign criminals, so terrorists \nand drug lords will not be able to keep their money one step ahead of \nthe law enforcement.\n  Limits on Foreign Bank Secrecy to stop criminals from hiding behind \nforeign bank secrecy laws while they use U.S. courts.\n  These and other money laundering provisions in the bill should find \nbipartisan support for quick passage before the end of this Congress.\n  Title IX sets forth important proposals for combating international \ncrime. In particular, the bill would punish violent crimes or murder \nagainst American citizens abroad, deny safe havens to international \ncriminals by strengthening extradition, promote cooperation with \nforeign governments on sharing witnesses and evidence, and streamline \nthe prosecution of international crimes in U.S. courts. Provisions \ninclude: giving the FBI authority to investigate and prosecute the \nmurder or extortion of U.S. citizens and state and local officials \ninvolved in federally-sponsored programs abroad; providing for \nextradition under certain circumstances for offenses not covered in a \ntreaty or absent a treaty; giving the Attorney General authority to \ntransfer and share witnesses with foreign governments, and obtain and \nuse foreign evidence in criminal cases; prohibiting fugitives from \nbenefitting from time served abroad fighting extradition; adding \nserious computer crimes as predicate offenses for which wiretaps may be \nauthorized; and providing court order procedures for law enforcement \naccess to stored information on computer networks.\n  Finally, Title X contains provisions to strengthen the air, land and \nsea borders of this country. The bill would punish violence at the \nborders, increase authority of maritime law enforcement officers at the \nborders, increase penalties for smuggling contraband and other \nproducts, strengthen immigration laws to exclude foreign fleeing \nfelons, and persons involved in racketeering and arms trafficking. \nSpecific sections include: punishing ``port-running,'' which is driving \nor crashing through Customs entry ports; sanctions for not cooperating \nwith maritime law enforcement officers by obstructing lawful boarding \nrequests and commands to ``heave to''; and denying admission into the \nU.S. of persons whom consular officials have reason to believe are \ninvolved in RICO acts, arms trafficking, or alien smuggling for profit, \nor are fleeing foreign prosecution.\n  The Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act is a \ncomprehensive Act. Nothing in this bill is just for show or rhetorical \nflourish. Keeping our schools safe, keeping our streets safe, keeping \nour citizens safe when they go abroad, and keeping our borders secure \nare matters on which we can and should make progress. I look forward to \nworking for passage of as many parts of this bill as possible in this \nCongress.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today Democrats in the Senate are \nintroducing a bill--The Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders \nAct of 1998, which builds on a legacy of success Senate Democrats have \nhad in the area of anti-crime legislation.\n  The Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1998 \ncontinues successful initiatives in the 1994 Crime Act, reforms the \njuvenile justice system, combats gang violence, cracks down on the sale \nand use of illegal drugs, ensures the rights of crime victims, and \nprovides valuable tools to law enforcement officers as they battle \ninternational crime and terrorism.\n  While this bill goes a long way to fight crime in our communities and \nprotect our borders, today I want to speak about the horrific and \ntragic acts of violence that have occurred in no less than 14 of our \nnation's schools over the past 18 months, most recently as schools were \npreparing to close for summmer recess, less than 100 miles from our \nNation's Capitol--in Richmond, Virginia--and how this bill targets this \nschool-based violent crime.\n  Over the past 18 months, 18 children and four adults have been killed \nas a result of school shootings.\n\n[[Page S10434]]\n\n  When is it going to stop? The nation had seen enough when two \nstudents in Jonesboro, Arkansas, ages 11 and 13, began shooting during \na false fire alarm. Four girls and one teacher died on that terrible \nday in March. Since then, 8 more have fallen prey to these school \nkillings.\n  The number of students who have experienced a violent crime in school \ncontinues to rise, with a 23 percent increase between 1989 and 1995.\n  Mr. President, if we are looking for reasons why our schools erupted \nin gunfire this year, we need only look at the annual survey released \nrecently by the PRIDE organization, a respected non-profit group that \nworks with young people and their families and communities to create \ndrug-free and safe environments. Their annual PRIDE surveys have been \nused by 5,500 schools, the Office of National Drug Control Policy's \nPerformance Measures of Effectiveness, and this Congress to monitor \nstudent drug use.\n  The results of the latest PRIDE survey are appalling. Almost a \nmillion students--some as young as 10--carry guns to school.\n  Even worse, half the students carrying guns are also carrying \ngrudges--over half said they had threatened a teacher, and almost two-\nthirds had threatened to harm another student.\n  What's more, these students are bringing other problems.\n  Nearly two-thirds are monthly users of illicit drugs, such as \ncocaine, heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine. According to Dr. \nThomas J. Gleaton, one of the authors of the study, this means that, on \naverage, for every classroom in every school building in America, one \nstudent showed up with a gun this year. Out of these students, two-\nthirds were using drugs regularly and carrying grudges. Add together \nthis volatile mix of drugs, guns, and hostility, and the result is what \nwe have seen this year.\n  If you are not moved by the statistics, look at the shootings. Look \nat the horror visited on those school children in Rhode Island, Oregon, \nWashington, Arkansas, Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Look at Texas, \nor Mississippi, Missouri or California, or the tragic events last year \nin Alaska. This is a national plight afflicting all our communities. As \nleaders of our nation, we should all be saddened and discouraged by our \nlack of attention to this critical problem.\n  How many more children must die before we face up to this crisis?\n  How can we provide our children with hope for tomorrow if they fear \nfor their life today?\n  I can think of no other issue closer to the hearts and minds of the \nAmerican people than the safety of our children.\n  Mr. President, we know some things work to prevent youth violence, \nand we have included these measures in our bill.\n  This bill will establish partnerships between schools and local law \nenforcement agencies to put specially trained community-oriented \nofficers in schools. We know from the success of the COPS Program that \na positive relationship between the community and law enforcement is \ncritical to successful crime prevention. This approach will also \nbenefit schools by providing additional protection and adult \nsupervision to curb violence in schools. In addition, this bill creates \na School Security Technology Center to serve as a national resource to \nlocal schools trying to make their schools as safe as possible for \nstudents.\n  The PRIDE survey contained some hopeful news as well, Mr. President. \nWhile drug use is still dangerously high, this past school year, for \nthe first time in seven years, the use of alcohol, tobacco, and other \ndrugs by young people decreased across the board. Students who were \nheavily involved in after-school activities were more than twice as \nlikely to stay away from drugs than students who never participated in \nthese activities.\n  Mr. President, we should support after-school programs. Let's give \nour kids coaches and mentors now--and they won't need wardens and \njudges later.\n  Our bill will protect children from becoming crime victims by \nproviding additional funding for proven prevention programs in crime-\nprone areas and creating after school ``safe havens'' where children \nare protected from drugs, gangs and crime with activities including \ndrug prevention education, academic tutoring, mentoring, and abstinence \ntraining.\n  We recognized the importance of community involvement when we passed \na bill that I joined my colleagues in introducing--the Drug-Free \nCommunities Act. That bill recognized that the entire community must \nbecome involved to prevent the proliferation of drugs.\n  This year, let's increase our support and encouragement for \nprevention programs that include parents and children, law enforcement \nand teachers, mentors and coaches.\n  I wish the events of the last 18 months told a different story, but \nunfortunately it has become evident that some safeguards are needed. If \nyou doubt that, look at what happened in Greensboro, North Carolina, \njust four months ago when Carlos Gilmer was accidentally shot and \nkilled at his sixth birthday party after he and his four-year-old \nplaymate found a loaded gun in a purse.\n  No new crime bill program, by itself, will solve this problem of \nyouth violence. But, we can do something. We know some things that \nwork.\n  How will we feel if there is another Jonesboro, or Springfield? How \nwill we look at ourselves if we have not done everything in our power \nto prevent such a tragedy? Let us act now, so we won't have to face \nthose questions. The Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act \nof 1998 will go a long way to prevent future acts of school violence.\n  There is much that divides our two parties. But the issue of our \nchildren's safety is--or should be--one area on which we can agree. We \nmust protect our children from violence and prevent our children from \nbecoming violent.\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to voice my strong support \nfor the tough, common sense approach to fighting crime that is embodied \nin the ``Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1998''. \nI want to urge every one of my colleagues--Democrat and Republican--to \nstand behind this bill and in the closing weeks of this Congress to \npass these measures to protect Americans from the crime in our streets, \nin our schoolyards, and around the world. With lives on the line, there \nis no time to wait, no time to hesitate, and no time to be partisan.\n  Four years ago we came together and passed a crime bill that was \ntough on crime and smart on prevention. I am proud to have helped lead \nthe fight four years ago to put 100,000 cops on the street, and now \nit's working. Crime is down 22% in Massachusetts and communities tell \nyou it's because we've restored the notion of community policing. In \nBoston, juvenile crime is down to levels we haven't seen since the \n1950's--and Mayor Tom Menino is proving that a combination of tough \npunishment and outreach to at-risk young people is a prescription for \nsafety, a prescription for crime prevention. None of this would have \nbeen possible if this Senate hadn't come together to get serious about \ncrime. Now in America we need to get serious again about crime \nprevention.\n  This crime bill continues to build on the achievements of the 1994 \nCrime Bill, focusing on the new epidemic of crime in our schools, flaws \nin the juvenile justice system, the crisis of gang violence, and the \nsale and use of illegal drugs. We wrote this bill keeping in mind both \nthose we are fighting for and those who lead the fight in our streets--\nthat's why it enhances the rights of victims and gives more tools to \nlaw enforcement officers as they take on international crime and \nterrorism.\n  From expanding the COPS Program, providing additional funds for \nprisons and jails, helping the fight against violence against women, \nand creating partnerships between schools and law enforcement agencies, \nthis bill targets resources on the ground where they're needed the \nmost. This bill is smart and tough when it comes to building a better \njuvenile justice system--giving federal prosecutors the authority to \nprosecute some juvenile criminals as adults when they commit the most \nheinous of crimes; banning gun purchases by juveniles who have been \nconvicted of violent crime; and providing the badly needed funds for \nyouth violence courts. These measures respond to the demand from those \nbrave social workers, prosecutors, and police working on juvenile\n\n[[Page S10435]]\n\ncrime at ground zero with inadequate resources.\n  This bill also represents a critical response to the crisis of \ninternational crime and terrorism. Mr. President, we are facing a \nthreat that is global in nature: transnational crime organizations that \nclosely resemble multinational corporations; terrorist organizations \nthat have pledged to send more and more Americans home in body-bags. \nThis bill does more than send the message that we won't tolerate \nterrorism--it makes it clear that we're going to give our law \nenforcement personnel the tools to stop terrorists dead in their \ntracks.\n  Mr. President, the clock is ticking on this Congress. But even louder \nis the ticking time-bomb of crime in our schools, violence in our \nstreets, and terrorism abroad. This Senate has the chance to act \ndecisively to pass the ``Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders \nAct'' to fight crime, to defuse the threats before this nation. We have \nno reason to stall. The time is now to move forward with measures that \nare smart, tough, and effective.\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my \ncolleagues, Senators Daschle, Biden and Leahy, in introducing the Safe \nSchools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1998. This \ncomprehensive legislation, which will add to the success of the 1994 \nCrime Bill, is based on a tough, common-sense strategy: Put more police \nofficers on the street, build more prisons for violent offenders, take \nguns out of the hands of felons, and protect families from the scourge \nof domestic violence.\n  In the wake of the historic 1994 Crime bill, we have seen a dramatic \ndecline in crime rates across the nation. In 1996, we experienced the \nlowest violent crime rate since 1989. On the whole, the overall crime \nrate was lower than any year since 1984. And it appears that we will \ncontinue in this success: Preliminary figures released by the Federal \nBureau of Investigation show that nationwide, serious crime dropped an \nadditional four percent in 1997.\n  While these numbers are impressive, recent events have shown that \nthere is still much that must be done in order to equip our nations law \nenforcement agencies and local communities with the tools they need to \naddress the latest scourge of violence in our schools, in our nation's \nembassies around the world, and at our borders. This multi-faceted \nlegislation has many well-written, well-thought out proposals which I \nbelieve greatly help our nation continue winning the fight against \ncrime and terrorism in our ever-changing world.\n  Among the many parts of this legislation, I am most excited about \nadditional funding for continuing the fight against domestic violence. \nWe first took up this issue with the historic passage of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act. This legislation, which improves on our commitment \nto fighting against violence against women, will provide additional \ngrants dedicated to the arrest and prosecution of batterers, shelter \nfor 400,000 abused women and their children, and continued access to \nthe National Domestic Violence Hotline. These initiatives are paramount \nin ensuring safety from crimes committed within the home.\n  And there are other parts of this legislation that I believe are \nespecially poignant given the latest outbreak of violence in our \nnation's schools. This legislation finally brings the juvenile justice \nsystem up to date with the juvenile crime of the day, by giving Federal \nprosecutors sole, nonreviewable authority to prosecute 16 and 17 year \nolds as adults when they are alleged to have committed the most serious \nfederal violent and drug offenses. It would also provide grants to \nStates to incarcerate violent juvenile offenders, establish graduated \nsanctions, and encourage pilot programs to replicate successful \njuvenile crime reduction strategies. A proposal to further curb the \nthreat of gang violence and crime and to reduce the drug-related crime \nhas also been included in this bill. Finally, this legislation would \nprovide grants for juvenile gun and youth violence courts, and for \ntruancy prevention and comprehensive delinquency prevention activities.\n  I am most pleased, however, that this legislation contains two \nprovisions that were included in my Safe Communities and Schools Act, \nwhich I introduced early this month. That legislation, which has been \nincorporated into this bill, will help put an additional 25,000 police \nofficers on the street and create new grants under the COPS program for \nschool and local law enforcement efforts against school-yard violence.\n  As you know, the COPS program has played a vital role in reducing our \nnation's crime rate. Since inception of the program in 1994, the \nDepartment of Justice has authorized an additional 76,000 police \nofficers to walk the beat. These additional police officers have been \ninstrumental in helping reduce crime and making people feel safe in \ntheir communities.\n  For example, in my home state of Illinois, the COPS program, which \nhas put 4,113 police officers on streets across the state, has been \nextremely effective. Between the time that the Crime Bill was passed \nand the end of last year, serious crime fell by 17 percent. Recent \nstatistics show that for the first six months of 1998, serious crime \nthroughout Illinois is down 2.8 percent over 1997.\n  Despite the positive gains that have been made in the wake of the \n1994 Omnibus Crime bill, the latest influx of violence in our nation's \nschools is evidence that their is still much work to be done. Although \nwe are seeing record reductions in the incident of youth-on-youth \ncrime, the extremely violent nature of crimes now being committed by \njuveniles is nothing short of stunning. Extending the COPS program and \nmaking more funds available to communities to combat school violence \nwill free the hands of local law enforcement and give them the \nopportunity to develop new and innovative ways of reducing youth crime.\n  Finally, this legislation seeks to place reasonable, Constitutional \nrestrictions on gun purchases and gun ownership. It would ban \nprospective gun purchases by juveniles who have been adjudicated \ndelinquent or convicted of violent crimes and would require gun dealers \nto make gun safety devices available for sale or have their licenses \nrevoked. It would also impose tougher penalties for possession of guns \nduring the commission of a crime of violence or drug offense.\n  Overall, this bill provides a holistic response to the varied nature \nof crime being committed at home and abroad against American citizens. \nIt is a sensible approach to a devastating problem. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation, and to push for its immediate \npassage.\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Safe \nSchools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1998 introduced by my \ncolleague, Senator Leahy. I urge all my Senate colleagues to support it \nas well.\n  Mr. President, there no doubt are many issues that are on the minds \nof Americans. Certainly, crime, particularly juvenile crime, \ndelinquency and drug and alcohol abuse, are issues that I hear most \nabout when I am in my home state of New Mexico. Although recent crime \nstatistics shows a clear downward trend in crime on our nation's \nstreets, crime reduction must remain a priority at the federal level.\n  This bill comprehensively addresses the problem of juvenile crime, \nand it strikes a balance between the need to deal with serious juvenile \noffenders in a swift and meaningful way and the clear, practical \nnecessity to prevent our youth from getting in trouble in the first \nplace.\n  I am delighted that the managers of this bill have included two \nseparate bills which I previously introduced, and I thank Senator Leahy \nfor his accommodation. The first, my Truancy Prevention and Juvenile \nCrime Reduction Act, deals with the problem of truancy, which long has \nbeen neglected as a root cause of juvenile crime. The second, my Safe \nSchools Security Act of 1998, addresses the problem of school violence \nand provides resources, such as technical expertise and security \ntechnology, to schools that are experiencing the most serious problems \nin their schools.\n  I first want to discuss truancy, which not many people realize is the \ntop-ranking characteristic of criminals. High rates of truancy directly \nare linked to high daytime crime rates, including violence, burglary \nand vandalism. As much as 44 percent of violent juvenile crime takes \nplace during school hours, and as much as 75 percent\n\n[[Page S10436]]\n\nof children ages 13 to 16 who are arrested and prosecuted for crimes \nare truants. It is startling to know that some cities report as many as \n70 percent of daily student absences are unexcused, and the number of \nabsences in single city can reach 4,000\n  Moreover, society pays a very heavy social and economic price due to \ntruancy. Only 34 percent of inmates have completed high school \neducation, and we all are well aware of the staggering costs associated \nwith incarcerating an individual. Sadly, as many as 17 percent of youth \nunder the age of 18 that enter adult prisons have not completed eighth \ngrade, 75 percent have not completed 10th grade.\n  Most studies indicate that when parents, schools, law enforcement and \ncommunity leaders all work together to prevent truancy, to intervene at \nits early stages, and to create meaningful accountability, we can \nincrease school attendance and reduce daytime crime rates.\n  One such program is the Daytime Curfew Program in Roswell, New \nMexico, and the Truancy Intervention Project in Fulton County, Georgia, \nadministered by Judge Glenda Hatchett. Another successful program \nincluded in this Act is the Grade Court, which is Farmington, New \nMexico, administered by Judge Paul Onuska. All of these programs \nintegrate parental involvement with schools, law enforcement, \njudiciary, and other community stakeholders in a collaborative effort \nto reduce truancy and juvenile crime. These are the kinds of programs I \nbelieve we should be encouraging, but unfortunately we in the Congress \nhave not yet met the challenge.\n  This Act authorizes $25 million per year targeted at building upon \nintegral partnerships between local government, schools, law \nenforcement, and the courts. Without a doubt, $25 million is a very \nsmall price to pay when you consider the dividends we expect when young \npeople stay in school and out of trouble.\n  The Youth Law Center, the Children's Defense Fund, and the National \nNetwork for Youth, which has more than 500 community youth-serving \norganizations and personnel nationwide all agree with the importance of \ncombating truancy and enthusiastically have voiced their support for \nthis initiative.\n  The second provision of this bill I would like to discuss deals with \nthe safety of our public schools. We spend a great deal of time here \ntalking about improving academic achievement of our nation's school \nchildren, and I believe we are making great progress. I also believe, \nhowever, that we cannot expect a child to perform up to his or her \npotential in an environment in which they cannot feel safe and secure. \nObviously, a learning environment has to be a safe environment. \nHowever, recent tragedies in Mississippi, Arkansas, Kentucky, \nPennsylvania, and Oregon, for example, strongly suggest that we can and \nshould do much more to keep our school safe.\n  Recently, the Department of Education released the results of a \ncomprehensive study called Violence and Discipline Problems in U.S. \nPublic Schools: 1996-97. The study shows that 10 percent of schools \nsurveyed had at least one serious violent crime during the 1996-97 \nschool year. Also, during the 1996-97 school year, approximately 4,000 \nincidents of rape or other types of sexual battery were reported in \npublic schools across the country. Additionally, there were \napproximately 11,000 incidents of physical attacks or fights in which \nweapons were used and approximately 7,000 robberies in schools that \nyear.\n  As grim as the statistics are, we also must recognize the emotional \neffect that school crime has on our children. According to a separate \nstudy, 29 percent of elementary, 34 percent of junior high, and 20 \npercent of high school students say they are worried about becoming \nvictims of crime at school. Seventy-one percent of children ages 7 to \n10 say they worry they might get shot or stabbed at school. I cannot \nimagine how a child can be expected to achieve up to his or her \npotential if they are worried about their physical safety. Clearly, we \nmust respond, and I believe this is an area in which we can make a \nsignificant difference, and we should take advantage of the resources \nwe presently have to address this problem.\n  Many people are familiar with the fine work of our National \nLaboratories, which for decades have been leaders in energy and defense \nresearch and development. These Labs have many years of experience \nsupporting and helping to protect high-risk facilities and assets for \nthe Department of Energy, the Department of Defense, the Department of \nState, and many other federal agencies in some capacity, through the \nuse of security technology. The result of this capability is that our \nnation's government facilities enjoy some of the finest security and \nsafety programs in the world. This expertise should be fully utilized \nto improve the safety of our schools.\n  Alreacy Sandia Laboratories has taken the initiative. Two years ago \nSandia began a pilot project at Belen High School in New Mexico, \nwhereby Sandia security experts implemented a security regimen and \ninstalled a variety of security technology. Sandia is the first to \nadmit that they do not know the first thing about running a public \nschool, and Belen readily will admit to a lack of expertise in \nsecurity. Nevertheless, the match was perfect. Working together, Sandia \nand Belen high school officials changed the school by utilizing a \ncomprehensive security design and technology, including cameras, metal \ndetectors, and sensors.\n\n  The results are very impressive. Since the pilot project was \nimplemented at the school, on-campus violence is down 75 percent, \ntruancy is down 30 percent, theft from vehicles parked in the school \nparking lot is down 80 percent, vandalism is down 75 percent. These \nstatistics are compelling, and with this level of success already \ndemonstrated, the effort should be expanded to allow more schools to \naccess the expertise and technology.\n  This technology is not cheap, and schools already are challenged to \npurchase basic educational materials and equipment. However, I believe \nthat with the right technical assistance and technology, not only will \nthis help schools become safe for the children, but schools will save \nmoney. Incredibly, the Belen school principal, Ron Marquez, reported to \nme that before the pilot went into effect, Belen high school had \napproximately $50,000 per year in losses due to stolen school property. \nOne year after the pilot, Belen has had only $5,000 in insurance \nclaims. The savings translates into, for example, less cost to repair \nvandalized property, or property that has been defaced by graffiti.\n  We must take advantage of this success and put this expertise to use \nwhere it certainly will have very positive results.\n  One other provision in this bill that I believe will make a \ntremendous difference to communities that are struggling to reduce \njuvenile crime is the provision that allows communities to replicate \nproven juvenile crime reduction strategies. Specifically, this bill \nprovides resources to communities that collaborate with local, state, \nand federal agencies to address the juvenile crime problem. In my state \nof New Mexico, we are helping bring together community leaders, \nschools, judges, law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, and grass-roots \ncommunity organizations in order to develop and implement the Boston \nStrategy to Reduce Juvenile Violence. As anyone would agree, when \ncommunity leaders work and communicate with one another on a common \nproblem, usually good things. The City of Boston has had great success \nin reducing its violent crime rate. For example, after being at or near \nthe top of the list among cities in terms of homicide, Boston's \njuvenile homicide rate dropped to zero, and its overall homicide rate \ndropped by sixty percent between 1995 and 1997.\n  There is clear value to helping communities do the same kinds of \nthings, and this bill helps in a substantial way.\n  I thank Senator Leahy for his hard work to craft this important \nlegislation and Senator Daschle for his leadership, and I am very \npleased to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GORTON:\n  S. 2485. A bill to amend the title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nallow States to use the funds available under the State children's \nhealth insurance program for enhanced matching rate for coverage of \nadditional children under the medicaid program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n[[Page S10437]]\n\n                      children's health equity act\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, last year, Congress and the \nPresident agreed to provide $48 billion over the next 10 years as an \nincentive to states to provide health care coverage to uninsured, low-\nincome children. To receive this money, states must expand eligibility \nlevels to children living in families with incomes up to 200% of the \nfederal poverty level.\n  Washington State has a strong record of ensuring that its low-income \nkids have access to health care. Four year ago, my state decided to do \nwhat Congress and the President have just last year required other \nstates to do. In 1994, Washington expanded its child Medicaid \neligibility level to 200% of the federal poverty level (FPL) all the \nway through to the age of 18.\n  During the negotiations of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act (BBA), \nCongress and the Administration recognized that certain states were \nalready undertaking Medicaid expansions up to or above 200 percent of \nFPL, and that they should be allowed to use the new SCHIP funds. \nUnfortunately, this provision was limited to those states that enacted \nexpansions on or after March 31, 1997 and disallowed Washington from \naccessing the $230 million in SCHIP funds it had been allocated through \n2002. As a result, Washington State cannot use its SCHIP allotment to \ncover the 90,000 children currently eligible, but not covered for \nhealth care at or below 200 percent of poverty. Exacerbating this \ninequity is the fact that many states have begun accessing their SCHIP \nallotments to cover kids at poverty levels far below Washington's \ncurrent or past eligibility levels.\n  The bill I am introducing today, along with Senator Murray, corrects \nthis technicality and is a top priority for the Washington State \ndelegation as we near the end of the 105th Congress. Congresswoman Dunn \nhas also introduced a companion measure in the House of Representatives \nthat is cosponsored by the entire Washington delegation.\n  This bipartisan, bicameral initiative represents a thoughtful, \ncarefully-crafted response to the unintended consequences of SCHIP and \nbrings much-needed assistance to children currently at-risk. Rather \nthan simply changing the effective date included in the BBA, this \ninitiative includes strong maintenance of effort language as well as \nincentives for our state to find those 90,000 uninsured kids because we \nfeel strongly that they receive the health coverage for which they are \neligible.\n  This bill does not take money from other states nor does it provide \nadditional federal subsidies for children the state is now covering, it \nsimply allows Washington to continue to do the good work they have \nalready started by focusing on new, uninsured children at low income \nlevels first.\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my \ncolleague Senator Gorton in introducing legislation to improve access \nto health insurance for low income children in Washington State. This \nbill would amend the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) \nto allow our State access to their allotment of federal funds to \nprovide health coverage to an additional 90,000 eligible children.\n  This is not an effort to supplant state funds. This does not take \nfunds from other states. It simply allows Washington to access their \nallotment of SCHIP funds to cover those children who currently lack any \nhealth security. Because of their lack of access to health insurance, \nthese children have little or no access to health care and no access to \npreventive services.\n  These are children whose parents work hard but do not have access to \nhealth insurance or cannot afford the cost of premiums. These parents \nwork hard and pay taxes, unfortunately they have little discretionary \nincome to provide important health security for their children.\n  Last year, this Congress made a commitment to cover the 10 million \nuninsured children in this country. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 \nincluded an expansion in children's health insurance benefits as a down \npayment on meeting the needs of these 10 million vulnerable children. \nThis Congress took the right step in working to achieve the goal of \nguaranteeing every child in this country a healthy childhood. What we \nare attempting to do in this legislation that we are introducing today, \nis to honor this commitment to the children in Washington State.\n  In 1994 Washington State stood up for our vulnerable children. We \nimplemented an expansion in our Medicaid program to cover children up \nto 200% of poverty. We knew at the time that it was a huge undertaking, \nbut we recognized that investing in our children's health was a wise \ninvestment. Because of the final language adopted in the Balanced \nBudget Act, Washington could not access their SCHIP funds to cover \nnewly enrolled children below the 200% of poverty threshold and above \nthe federal Medicaid requirement.\n  As a result, Washington State was penalized for being a leader in \nchildren's health. We are here today proposing a technical fix that \nrewards Washington State and allows them to cover an additional 60,000 \nto 90,000 children. This is not done at the expense of other States, \nbut rather by using Washington's existing allotment.\n  I can assure my colleagues that Washington State will honor our \ncommitment to our children. But without access to these funds, \nenrolling these children will be almost impossible. If we all share the \nsame goal of insuring these 10 million children, we must enact this \nlegislation. The health care needs of low income children in Washington \nare just as great and just as important as they are for low income \nchildren in other states.\n  I am hopeful that we can act on this legislation. This technical \nremedy will go a long way in meeting our shared goal of guaranteeing \naccess to quality, and affordable health care for all children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT:\n  S. 2487. A bill to amend the Equal Access Act to provide equal access \nfor elementary and secondary school groups to expense reimbursement and \nmaterials, and to provide equal access for community groups to meeting \nspace; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                      equal access improvement act\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nfurthers an important object of government--promoting religious liberty \nand the free exercise of religion. Specifically, I rise to introduce \nthe Equal Access Improvement Act, a bill that would ensure that \nbenefits currently provided to non-curricular school groups and \ncommunity groups be extended on a non-discriminatory basis to all \ngroups without regard to the religious nature of the organization.\n  This bill reflects and reinforces an important principle that \npervades the Supreme Court's decisions concerning religious liberty--\nthe principle of non-discrimination. The Supreme Court has recognized \nagain and again that neutral laws that provide benefits without regard \nto the religious nature of recipients do not run afoul of our \nconstitutional traditions. What is more, laws that specifically exclude \nreligious entities from a class of beneficiaries are inconsistent with \nour Constitution's guarantee of the free exercise of religion. Laws \nthat discriminate against specific religions or against religious \norganizations in general are incompatible with our nation's founding \ndocument and with a fundamental respect for people of faith.\n  The bill would ensure that student prayer clubs are provided the same \naccess to school facilities as other non-curricular school clubs. Our \nschools reflect many of the problems that plague our larger culture. \nJust as in the larger culture, prayer can play an inimitable role in \ndealing with violence, drugs, and the other challenges in the schools. \nDenying access to school facilities for student prayer groups, while \nsimilar groups are granted access, sends precisely the wrong message. \nPrayer is an answer. Prayer is not the problem. There is no reason to \ndeny benefits to a group because they engage in prayer or because they \nhave some other religious component.\n  Nothing in this bill provides any special treatment to religious \ngroups. The bill removes discrimination against religious groups and \nreligious activities. It does not introduce any new discrimination in \nfavor of religious groups. The bill enshrines the principal of \nneutrality that is at the heart of the Constitution's guarantees of \nreligious liberty.\n\n  The Equal Access Improvement Act builds on the work of the 98th \nCongress, which passed the original Equal\n\n[[Page S10438]]\n\nAccess Act. The bill extends those provisions to reflect subsequent \nSupreme Court and lower court decisions and to reflect the experience \nwe have had with the Equal Access Act in the last fourteen years. I \nhave consulted with organizations and individuals who have litigated \ncases under the Equal Access Act and incorporated many of their \nsuggestions for improving the law.\n  Specifically, the bill extends the existing law's provision ensuring \nequal access to meeting space to include equal access to school \nfacilities, including expense reimbursement. Just as a school prayer \nclub should not be denied access to a class room when it is open to the \nchess club, so too if the school pays to print a newsletter or pays for \nrefreshments for one club, it should not discriminate on the basis of \nthe religious content of the group's speech or activities. In the same \nway that the original Equal Access Act extended and reinforced the \nSupreme Court's decision in Windmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 (1981), \nbeyond the public university context, this legislation would extend and \nreinforce the Supreme Court's decision in Rosenberger v. Rector and \nVisitors of the University of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819 (1995).\n  The legislation also guarantees students a right to distribute \nliterature without regard to the religious content of the literature. \nIt guarantees access to community groups to school facilities on an \nequal basis without regard to the religious character of the group. \nFinally, the legislation extends equal access guarantees to \nintermediate school students.\n  Let me emphasize that this bill, like the original Equal Access Act, \ncreates no obligation for a school to provide meeting space or other \nfacilities to any non-curriculum based group or any community group. \nThe legislation simply provides that if a school does make its \nfacilities available to non-curriculum based groups or to community \ngroups, then the school cannot discriminate against other groups on the \nbasis of the religious content of their speeches or activities. What is \nmore, the legislation expressly preserves the ability of schools to \nenforce content-neutral policies denying or limiting access to all \ngroups.\n  Passage of this legislation would have many benefits. However, none \nmore important than to reinforce the principle that nothing in the \nConstitution requires--or permits--the government to discriminate \nagainst groups on the basis of the religious nature of their speech or \nactivities. As the Supreme Court recognized long ago, when the \ngovernment accommodates religious practice and eliminates \ndiscrimination based on religion ``it follows the best of our \ntraditions.'' Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, 314 (1952).

A bill to establish the Northwest Straits Advisory \nCommission; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n        The Northwest Straits Marine Conservation Initiative Act\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague \nin the House, Representative Jack Metcalf, to introduce the Northwest \nStraits Marine Conservation Initiative Act.\n  Mr. President, I have always believed that the best way to solve \nproblems is to bring people together and find consensus on an issue. \nThe Northwest Straits Marine Conservation Initiative Act is the direct \noutgrowth of just such an approach.\n  The Northwest Straits include the marine waters of the Strait of Juan \nde Fuca, the San Juan Islands, and the northern portion of Puget Sound. \nIt is a scenic and unique ecosystem critical to a broad array of \nsensitive fish and wildlife, including orcas, sea birds, salmon, bottom \nfish, and bald eagles.\n  Recognizing the importance of this precious marine ecosystem, the \nNorthwest Straits were proposed for inclusion in the National Marine \nSanctuaries program in some capacity as far back as 1979 when the \nNational Marine Sanctuary Program was in its infancy. Although the \nNorthwest Straits lie entirely within state waters, the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) spent the next seventeen \nyears evaluating the inclusion of this special area into the marine \nsanctuary program. This process involved substantial public \nparticipation. In recent years, it became clear there was insufficient \nlocal support to move forward with a Northwest Straits Marine Sanctuary \ndesignation for the area.\n  In response to these local concerns, Rep. Metcalf and I included a \nprovision in the 1996 reauthorization of the Marine Sanctuaries program \nbarring final designation of a Northwest Straits Marine Sanctuary \nwithout Congressional approval. Having thus put the marine sanctuary \nprocess on hold, in the Spring of 1997 we established a Citizen's \nAdvisory Commission (the Commission) to identify the key marine \nresources and values of the Northwest Straits, as well as the threats \nto them, and recommend appropriate protective measures and a means of \ncoordinating related federal, state, and local actions. The Commission \nis broadly representative of local interests including County and Port \nCommissioners, environmental and conservation groups, shipping \ninterests, academics, and Indian Tribes.\n  The Commission met diligently for eighteen months to fulfill their \nmission. In addition to the Commission members, a representative of \nGovernor Gary Locke participated in meetings and federal, state, and \nlocal agencies provided information and technical assistance. All \nCommission meetings have been open to the public and interested \nparties. The Commission has researched and reviewed the issues \nsurrounding the Northwest Straits exhaustively and presented their \nformal recommendation to Representative Metcalf and myself on August \n20.\n  The Commission has concluded that the very fabric of the Northwest \nStraits is unraveling, manifesting problems and trends that cross \ngeographic and jurisdictional lines. While the ecosystem is \ncomplicated, the trends are simple: bottom fish, sea birds, \ninvertebrates, salmon, and even some marine mammals have declined \nprecipitously since 1980. This depletion of marine resources has hurt \neconomies and communities around the Northwest Straits and further \ndegradation portends far more serious impacts in the future. Existing \nmanagement schemes, while sufficient in terms of legal authority, have \nfailed to achieve the coordination and focus to change these trends.\n  While the Commission has not reached a consensus to endorse or reject \nany future alternative management scheme, the Commission recommends a \nset of steps that would not displace current management \nresponsibilities but seek to compliment them by supplying key missing \ningredients for success: sound science and broad support for solutions. \nThese steps include the establishment of a network of local, county-\nbased Marine Resources Committees (MRCs) committed to making all \npossible progress at the local level to protect and conserve the \nresources of the Northwest Straits using existing state and local \nauthorities, and based on sound scientific information and the overall \nneeds of the Northwest Straits ecosystem. The MRCs will coordinate \nactivities through a Northwest Straits Commission consisting of \nrepresentatives of the MRCs, Indian Tribes, the scientific community, \nand state agencies. The Commission will provide technical assistance, \nintegrate science, develop an ecosystem-level coordination, and \ncoordinate funding.\n  In addition, the Commission will assess the performance of the MRCs \nagainst a series of benchmarks. These Benchmarks of Performance shall \ninclude the assessment and establishment of a scientifically-based \nregional system of Marine Protected Areas, the assessment and \nestablishment of a scientifically-based regional system to protect \nnearshore habitat, a net gain in open shellfish harvest areas, and \ndiscernable increases in bottom fish and other key marine indicators. \nShould these benchmarks fail to be met, further consideration of \nalternative approaches, including a marine sanctuary designation may be \nresumed.\n  In addition, this bill calls for a review of the effort after 5 years \nby the National Research Council, with particular emphasis on the \nachievement of the Benchmarks of Performance. With the authorization \nfor this ``Local Marine Conservation Initiative'' expiring in 6 years, \nthis NRC report will help us assess the accomplishments of this effort \nto determine whether it should be continued.\n  Mr. President, the Northwest Straits Marine Conservation Initiative \nAct represents the right way to address environmental challenges. By \npulling all of the interested parties together to analyze and research \nnot only the issue, but each other's perspectives, partnerships can be \nforged that will provide long-term benefits. This pragmatic and \nachievable proposal will truly improve resource protection in the \nNorthwest Straits. It is an innovative, exciting way to address the \nmarine conservation challenges before us. I am excited about this \napproach and the way it empowers local communities and local citizens \nto take the initiative to protect their home waters. In many ways, this \napproach is a test or experiment. The local leaders have the next \nseveral years to demonstrate that a coordinated, informed, and \nempowered local decision-making process can provide true protection for \nthe Northwest Straits. I believe they can meet this challenge. I look \nforward to Congress' timely consideration of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of commission \nmembers\n\n[[Page S10440]]\n\nand a letter from Governor Gary Locke be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n Murray/Metcalf Northwest Straits Local Citizen's Advisory Commission \n                                Members\n\n       Lew Moore, co-facilitator.\n       Dan Evans, co-facilitator.\n       Brain Calvert, Friday Harbor Port Commissioner.\n       Donn Charnley, former State Legislator.\n       Dwain Colby, former County Commissioner.\n       Jim Darling, Executive Director, Port of Bellingham.\n       Kathy Fletcher, People for Puget Sound.\n       Dave Fluharty, University of Washington/School of Marine \n     Affairs.\n       Don Hopkins, Port of Everett Commissioner/Longshoreman.\n       Harry Hutchins, Steam Ship Operators.\n       Cheryl Hymes, former State Legislator/Evergreen Freedom \n     Foundation.\n       Phill Kitchel, Clallam County Commissioner.\n       Mac McDowell, Island County Commissioner.\n       Andrew Palmer, local marine conservationist.\n       Doug Scott, Friends of the San Juans.\n       Terry Williams, Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission/\n     Tulalip Tribes.\n       Dennis Willows, University of Washington/Friday Harbor \n     Marine Labs.\n\n\n                           technical support\n\n       Kelly Balcomb, Center for Whale Research.\n       Tom Cowen, Puget Sound Water Quality Action Team.\n       Daniel Farber, WA State Parks and Recreation Commission.\n       Todd Jacobs, NOAA--Olympic Coast Marine Sanctuary Manager.\n       Dan James, Pacific Northwest Waterways Association.\n       Eric Johnson, WA Public Ports Association.\n       Bob Nichols, Governor Gary Locke's Office.\n       Lisa Randlette, WA State Dept. of Natural Resources.\n       Terry Swanson, WA State Dept. of Ecology.\n       Kathy Soudere, Naval Air Station--Whidbey Island.\n       Shirley Waters, Office of Clallam County Commissioners.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              State of Washington,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                     Olympia, WA, August 20, 1998.\n     Hon.

Instead of proposing a new \n     regulatory authority or layer of bureaucracy, you have wisely \n     sought to complement the roles of existing federal, state, \n     and local authorities by bringing in additional science and \n     creating a forum to build the broad support necessary to \n     advance resource protection.\n       Again, I want to commend you for your work in developing \n     this proposed partnership to restore and protect the \n     magnificent marine resources of the Northwest Straits. My \n     administration and I look forward to working with you as you \n     develop a congressional proposal and work to implement the \n     report's recommendations.\n           Sincerely,\n

Res. 278\n\n       Whereas many of the nations throughout the world, and \n     especially within the Western hemisphere, celebrate ``Dia de \n     los Ninos'' on the 30th of April, in recognition and \n     celebration of their country's future--their children.\n       Whereas children represent the hopes and dreams of the \n     citizens of the United States;\n       Whereas children are the center of American families;\n       Whereas children should be nurtured and invested in to \n     preserve and enhance economic prosperity, democracy, and the \n     American spirit;\n       Whereas Latinos in the United States, the youngest and \n     fastest growing ethnic community in the nation, continue the \n     tradition of honoring their children on this day, and wish to \n     share this custom with the rest of the nation;\n       Whereas one in four Americans is projected to be of \n     Hispanic descent by the year 2050, and there are now 10.5 \n     million Latino children;\n       Whereas traditional Latino family life centers largely on \n     its children;\n       Whereas the primary teachers of family values, morality, \n     and culture are parents and family members, and we rely on \n     children to pass on these family values, morals, and culture \n     to future generations;\n       Whereas more than 500,000 children drop out of school each \n     year and Hispanic dropout rates are unacceptably high;\n       Whereas the importance of literacy and education are most \n     often communicated to children through family members;\n       Whereas families should be encouraged to engage in family \n     and community activities that include extended and elderly \n     family members and encourage children to explore, develop \n     confidence, and pursue their dreams;\n       Whereas the designation of a day to honor the children of \n     the Nation will help affirm for the people of the United \n     States the significance of family, education, and community;\n       Whereas the designation of a day of special recognition of \n     children of the United States will provide an opportunity to \n     children to reflect on their future, to articulate their \n     dreams and aspirations, and find comfort and security in the \n     support of their family members and communities;\n       Whereas the National Latino Children's Institute, serving \n     as a voice for children, has worked with cities throughout \n     the country to declare April 30 as ``Dia de los Ninos: \n     Celebrating Young Americans''--a day to bring together \n     Latinos and other communities nationwide to celebrate and \n     uplift children;\n       Whereas the children of a nation are the responsibility of \n     all its citizens, and citizens should be encouraged to \n     celebrate the gifts of children to society--their curiosity, \n     laughter, faith, energy, spirit, hopes, and dreams: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates the 30th of April of \n     1999, as ``Dia de los Ninos: Celebrating Young Americans'' \n     and requests that the President issue a proclamation calling \n     on the people of the Untied States to join with all children, \n     families, organizations, communities, churches, cities, and \n     states across the nation to observe the day with appropriate \n     ceremonies, beginning April 30, 1999, that include:\n       (1) Activities that center around children, and are free or \n     minimal in cost so as to encourage and facilitate the \n     participation of all our citizens;\n       (2) Activities that are positive, uplifting, and that help \n     children express their hopes and dreams;\n       (3) Activities that provide opportunities for children of \n     all backgrounds to learn about one another's cultures and \n     share ideas;\n       (4) Activities that include all members of the family, and \n     especially extended and elderly family members, so as to \n     promote greater communication among the generations within a \n     family, enabling children to appreciate and benefit from the \n     experiences and wisdom of their elderly family members;\n       (5) Activities that provide opportunities for families \n     within a community to get acquainted; and\n       (6) Activities that provide children with the support they \n     need to develop skills and confidence, and find the inner \n     strength--the will and fire of the human spirit--to make \n     their dreams come true.\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I offer the following \nstatement on behalf of myself and my colleagues Kay Bailey Hutchison, \nJohn McCain, Pete V. Domenici, Spencer Abraham, Christopher S. Bond, \nand Charles E. Grassely. Our purpose is twofold: to join our colleagues \nin recognizing the start of Hispanic Heritage Month, an to submit a \nresolution designating April 30, 1999, as ``Dia de los Ninos: \nCelebrating Young Americans.''\n  Since 1968, we have formally recognized and celebrated the tremendous \ncontributions of Hispanic Americans to the history, strength, security, \nand development of our great nation. This year, we once again embark on \nthis month-long celebration. It is right to honor more than five \ncenturies of contributions by Hispanics to the development not only of \nour great nation, but of the Western Hemisphere and the world. It is \nalso imperative that we recognize that the health and vitality of the \nHispanic American community is pivotal to the strength and future of \nthis nation.\n  Our own experience has shown us that Hispanic Americans are a strong \nand proud people, loyal, patriotic, courageous, and dedicated to their \nfamilies, their country, and their communities. Hispanics have a strong \nwork ethic and tremendous faith in the American dream. They have made \ngreat contributions to the advancement of all people in every area, to \nmusic, the arts, science, engineering, mathematics, and government.\n  I am thrilled to see so many wonderful Hispanic role models help \nlight the way for Hispanic youth to attain the American Dream.\n  Jaime Escalante, a high school mathematics teacher, has been helping \nan unprecedented number of Hispanic students prepare for and pass \nadvanced\n\n[[Page S10442]]\n\nplacement tests in calculus. Amalia V. Betanzos, president of an \nalternative high school with tremendous success rates, has helped us \nall see what faith and encouragement can do for the soul. And Abraham \nChavez, who established the El Paso Symphony, shares his musical talent \nwith children on both sides of the U.S. border. Even with limited \nfunds, he finds various ways to put instruments into the hands and \nmusic into the lives of young children.\n  Such great recording artists as Celia Cruz, Tito Puente, Los Lobos, \nthe late Selena, Freddy Fender, and Gloria Estefan have brought joyous \nLatin rhythms into our homes and our hearts. Great authors, like Luis \nValdez, Victor Villasenor, Nicholasa Mohr, and Luis Rodriguez and great \nscreen artists like Andy Garcia, Jimmy Smits, Edward James Olmos, Rita \nMoreno, Martin Sheen, and the late Raul Julia have entertained while \nthey inspired us.\n  The patriotism and courage of great Americans like Alfred Rascon, who \nimmigrated to the United States from Mexico, should also be recognized. \nAt age 20, a lawful permanent resident, he volunteered to serve in \nVietnam. As a paratrooper combat medic, he twice used his own body to \nshield wounded comrades from enemy guns. Severely wounded, he refused \nto be evacuated until all the wounded were safe. He kept working until \nhe collapsed, so hurt that a priest at the scene gave him last rites.\n  Dr. Antonia Novello, former U.S. Surgeon General, Raul Izaguirre, \nPresident and CEO of National Council of La Raza, Carmen Zapata, \ndirector and co-founder of the Bilingual Foundation of the Arts, and \nAstronauts Ellen Oschoa and Franklin Chang Diaz have helped lead the \nway for our children as they enter the 21st century.\n  Of course, Sammy Sosa, Rebecca Lobo, Nancy Lopez, ChiChi Rodriguez, \nPedro Morales, Gigi Fernandez, and Trent Dimas are but seven of the \nmany great athletes who have shared with us the pride and success born \nof great sacrifice and a hunger for perfection. We are proud of their \naccomplishments. When they win, all America cheers and shares in their \nvictory.\n  Most importantly, let us not forget the many, many other Hispanic \nAmericans, whose daily contributions often go unrecognized, but whose \nlegacy continues to demonstrate the viability of the American dream.\n  But for all their contributions to the strength of our nation, many \nHispanics have not yet fully shared in the dream. The national drop-out \nrate for Hispanics exceeds 30 percent (for non-Hispanics the rate is 11 \npercent, and for blacks, the rate is 12 percent), the highest for any \nethnic group, and their educational attainment levels are among the \nlowest for any ethnic group. Hispanic children are most likely to be \namong America's poor, even though Hispanic males have the highest labor \nparticipation rates. Hispanics are most likely to lack health insurance \nand access to regular health care, yet suffer disproportionately from \ncertain diseases. We must do better.\n  As the youngest and fastest growing minority community in the nation, \nHispanics must share equally in the benefits and opportunities of this \ngreat nation, so that our country grows stronger and can better compete \nin global markets. Indeed, by 2050, according to the latest census \nprojections, one in four Americans will be of Hispanic descent. One \nthing is clear, the health and vitality of this nation depends in large \npart on the degree to which Hispanic Americans are prepared to meet the \nglobal market demands of the next century.\n  For this reason, in 1987, Senator John Chafee and Orrin G. Hatch \nestablished the U.S. Senate Republican Conference Task Force on \nHispanic Affairs, which now numbers 27 senators. The task force \nprovides a unique forum for Hispanic leaders to raise awareness and \nsupport on the national level for key issues facing the Hispanic \ncommunity in the areas of education, economic development, employment \nand health. The task force is aided by a bipartisan, volunteer advisory \ncommittee, for whose service we are very grateful. We acknowledge their \ntremendous contributions, commitment, and dedication to this effort. We \nthank each of the members publicly for they are truly great Americans.\n  It was with their help and guidance this Congress that we were able \nto make small advances in addressing the needs of the Hispanic \ncommunity, including providing access to health insurance to large \nnumbers of children in poverty, making changes to the Higher Education \nReauthorization Act, and supporting increased appropriations to \nstrengthen institutions that provide higher education to low income and \ndisadvantaged students, and reforming job training programs to better \nserve the latino community. We were also able to establish a federal \ncharter for the American GI Forum, a national Hispanic Veterans \norganization. Indeed, we owe no small debt of gratitude to the men and \nwomen who have sacrificed and continue to sacrifice daily to preserve \nour freedoms and democratic government. Hispanic Americans are very \nproud of their record of military service--the highest number of medals \nof honor earned per capital for any ethnic community.\n  Additionally, we submitted an ``English Plus'' Resolution, \nencouraging citizens to master not only the English language, but other \nforeign languages. Enhancing our linguistic abilities will make for a \nmore skilled and competitive labor force, and improve our \ncommunications. We hope to be able to pass the resolution before the \nend of the Congress.\n  It was our Advisory Committee that recommended we join the National \nLatino Children's Institute in calling upon the nation to designate \nApril 30, 1999, as ``Dia de los Ninos: Celebrating Young Americans''--a \nrecommendation with which we wholeheartedly concurred.\n  In contributing to the celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month, we \nthink it is most fitting to introduce a resolution calling on the \ncitizens of our great nation to join with other nations of the world, \nand especially those of the western hemisphere in setting a day aside \nto honor our children. Much in the same way that we celebrate Mother's \nDay and Father's Day, we urge the American people to set aside a day to \nuplift children, to encourage them to dream, and help them to acquire \nthe skills necessary to make those dreams come true. It is a custom \nthroughout Latin America to celebrate ``Dia de los Ninos'' on the 30th \nof April each year. Let us share in this tradition.\n  Indeed, if we take time to listen, to encourage children to read, to \nstay in school, to dream, to plan and work hard to achieve their \ndreams, then America's future is guaranteed to be brighter. Latinos \nhave made great strides, and they continue to progress. They have \njoined the ranks of public officials, managers, CEOs and presidents of \ncorporations, teachers, doctors, lawyers, and congressmen. But there is \nmuch yet to be done. Let us take pride in the contributions of \nHispanics to the history of this nation, let us recognize their gifts \nto America--their patriotism, devotion to family, love of God, and \nfaith in the American dream--and let us invest in the dreams of their \nchildren. Let us extend Hispanic Heritage Month to include a day to \nhonor and celebrate the gifts of all of the nation's children, a day in \nwhich we devote ourselves to uplifting and encouraging them to pursue \ntheir dreams. We invite our colleagues to join us as co-sponsors of \nthis worthy resolution designating April 30, 1999, ``Dia de los Ninos: \nCelebrating Young Americans.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the names of the \nvolunteer advisory committee be printed in the Record, in recognition \nof their contributions.\n  there being no objection, the names were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n   United States Senate Republican Conference Task Force on Hispanic \n               Affairs--105th Congress Advisory Committee\n\n       The Members of the U.S. Senate Republican Conference Task \n     Force on Hispanic Affairs wish to record their high esteem, \n     gratitude and appreciation for the members of the advisory \n     committee to the task force (listed below), for their \n     expertise, hard work, and dedication to assisting task force \n     Senators in better meeting the needs of the nation's Latino \n     community.\n       Loretta Adams; Antonio Amador; George Antuna; Rodolfo \n     Arredondo, Jr.; Patricia Asip; Zulma X.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Karl \nOhs, who will receive the Federal Bureau of Investigation's highest \nhonor later this month for his part in ending the 1996 Freemen standoff \nin Montana. A quiet, unassuming rancher from Harrison, Montana, Karl \nhas displayed uncommon courage and leadership not only during the \nFreemen incident, but throughout his life as a public servant and \ncommunity leader.\n  Born and raised in the farming town of Malta on Montana's Hi-Line, \nKarl was surrounded by agriculture from his birth.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Karl \nOhs, who will receive the Federal Bureau of Investigation's highest \nhonor later this month for his part in ending the 1996 Freemen standoff \nin Montana. A quiet, unassuming rancher from Harrison, Montana, Karl \nhas displayed uncommon courage and leadership not only during the \nFreemen incident, but throughout his life as a public servant and \ncommunity leader.\n  Born and raised in the farming town of Malta on Montana's Hi-Line, \nKarl was surrounded by agriculture from his birth.

COMING TOGETHER TO CONQUER CANCER\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask that the following joint \nstatement of myself and my colleague from Michigan, Senator Spencer \nAbraham, be printed in the Record.\n  The joint statement follows:\n\nJoint Statement of Senator Levin and Senator Abraham in Recognition of \n           The March . . . Coming Together to Conquer Cancer\n\n       Mr. President, we are pleased to join today in recognition \n     of the hundreds of thousands of people gathering here in \n     Washington and in every state in the country on Saturday, \n     September 26, 1998 for The March . . . Coming Together to \n     Conquer Cancer.\n       Statistics tell us that cancer will affect the lives of \n     virtually every American. According to the American Cancer \n     Society, American men have a 1-in-2 lifetime risk of \n     developing cancer, and American women have a 1-in-3 lifetime \n     risk. It is estimated that more than 1.2 million new cancer \n     cases will be diagnosed this year, and cancer kills Americans \n     at a rate of more than 1,500 per day. In our state of \n     Michigan, cancer is the second leading cause of death for all \n     people, and is the leading cause of death for people between \n     the ages of 35 and 49. In 1995, cancer took the lives of \n     nearly 20,000 Michigan residents. What statistics cannot show \n     us are the real people behind the numbers whose lives have \n     been forever changed by cancer. They are parents and \n     children, husbands and wives, sisters and brothers, friends \n     and colleagues. They are counting on us, and on policymakers \n     at all levels, to renew our commitment to the effort to \n     develop a cure for this deadly disease.\n       We are proud that our home state of Michigan is a national \n     leader of The March and in cancer research and treatment. The \n     Karmanos Cancer Institute, one of the premier cancer \n     treatment facilities in the country, is coordinating \n     Michigan's March-related activities. The Michigan March will \n     be held in Lansing to coincide with The March in Washington \n     on September 26th. A steering committee, coordinated by the \n     Karmanos Cancer Institute, is working hard to ensure that \n     people from every corner of Michigan participate in The March \n     in Lansing. Organizers are expecting 10,000 people in Lansing \n     on September 26th, including cancer survivors, friends and \n     family of survivors and of those who have lost their lives to \n     cancer, health care professionals, government leaders, and \n     many others. We know that even though they will be divided by \n     geography, the 10,000 people in Lansing will feel a sense of \n     unity with the hundreds of thousands of others gathering in \n     cities throughout the country for a common purpose.\n       Mr. President, we have all been touched by cancer in one \n     way or another. We all have friends, family, or loved ones \n     who have been its victims. The March will give a voice to \n     those whose voices have been silenced by cancer, and it will \n     serve as a call to action in the war against this deadly \n     disease. We are pleased to stand with those participating in \n     The March in Lansing and in Washington, and encourage our \n     colleagues to join us in expressing our profound respect and \n     gratitude to The March participants for their courageous \n     action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/16/senate-section/article/S10444-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CELEBRATING 7 YEARS OF INDEPENDENCE FOR THE REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA\n\n Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support \nto the Government of the Republic of Macedonia which on September 8th \ncelebrated seven years of independence.\n  Many of us are encouraged with the activities the Government has \nenacted with respect to democracy, human rights and international \npeace.\n  Although a small nation of approximately two million people and the \nsize of Vermont, the Republic of Macedonia, located in the very \nunstable region of the Balkans, has established itself as an example of \npeaceful, constructive, good neighborly country and our reliable ally.\n  The Republic of Macedonia is the only country that, following the \ndissolution of former Yugoslavia in 1991, gained independence in a \npeaceful and legitimate manner, by a way of a referendum and a new \nConstitution, refusing to take part in the war that was waged in the \nother parts of former Yugoslavia, thus showing that at the threshold of \nthe 21st century, it is possible to become independent without \nbloodshed.\n  Not only did the Republic of Macedonia opt against policies of \nterritorial aspirations, forceful changing of borders and ethnic \ncleansing, but also made it very clear that such policies are the cause \nfor conflicts and wars in the ethnically intermixed Balkans.\n  Over the seven years of its independence, the Government of the \nRepublic of Macedonia has instituted a series of economic reforms to \ncontrol inflation, reduce debt, increase exports and foster growth.\n  Recently, many American investors have started to see South-Eastern \nEurope as an economic area of large potential with more than 60 million \npeople, and the Republic of Macedonia as the most strategically located \nin the center of this large market.\n  The United States must continue its support for the Republic of \nMacedonia, especially having in mind the recent developments in \nneighboring Yugoslavia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/16/senate-section/article/S10444-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        RECOGNITION OF THE U.S. NATIONAL COMMISSION ON LIBRARIES\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the \nefforts recently made by the U.S. National Commission on Libraries to \nmobilize resources for the purpose of curbing youth violence in this \nnation.\n  Youth violence in America is, undeniably, a serious and frightening \nproblem today. The recent string of highly publicized school shootings \nhas made this all too clear; over the last ten months, 15 people have \ndied and 42 have been wounded. This terrifying epidemic has spread \nacross the country--from Mississippi to Pennsylvania to Washington. As \na result, cities such as Jonesboro, Arkansas, and Springfield, Oregon, \nwill remain burned in the public mind, forever associated with terror, \nheartbreak, and inexplicable tragedy. When faced with the all too \nhorrifying reality of children killing children, teachers, even \nparents, the nation is shaken to its core, as common associations of \nyouth and innocence are violently broken. Citizens are left to mourn \nand to ask the inevitable question: Why?\n  But wondering why is not enough. Innovative action is required if \nfuture tragedies are to be prevented. And the U.S. National Commission \non Libraries and Information Science is leading the way, having \ncommitted itself to just such action. The Commission is a permanent, \nindependent agency of the federal government charged by Congress to \nadvise the President and the Congress on national and international \nlibrary and information policies and plans. On July 8, 1998, the \nmembers of the Commission unanimously approved a resolution that urges \nall of society--community officials, educators, parents, role models--\nto support efforts made by libraries to assist adults, youth, and \nchildren in finding, through valuable learning resources and \nexperiences, solutions to this outbreak of violence. The Commission's \nrecognition of the important and constructive role libraries can play \nin the lives of America's children is commendable. It is commitment \nlike this that may help to curb the terrifying tide of violence--both \nin the school and in the home.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the Resolution of the Commission be printed \nin the Record and serve as a model to all of us and our community \norganizations as we struggle to come to terms with violence among our \nyouth.\n  The Resolution follows:\n\n     U.S. National Commission on Libraries and Information Science\n\n       Resolution in Recognition of the Important Role of \n     Libraries in the Lives of American Children\n       WHEREAS we have seen the recent outbreak of children \n     venting rage and anger by killing parents, teachers and \n     schoolmates,\n       WHEREAS we know that mental development, positive \n     socialization and emotional stabilization must begin at birth \n     if children are to grow up with full success,\n       WHEREAS we are concerned about the needs of tens of \n     thousands of young persons now in corrections or on probation \n     who may return to destructive behaviors if they receive no \n     redirection,\n       Be it Resolved That the U.S. National Commission on \n     Libraries and Information Science urges that our society--\n     officials and educators at all levels, community leaders, \n     parents and other adult caregivers, confidantes and role \n     models--utilize the vast potential of libraries and support \n     the current and potential abilities and efforts of librarians \n     in assisting adults, youth and children to seek positive \n     outcomes through wise use of information, and\n       Be it Further Resolved: That, in seeking solutions through \n     better parenting and learning experiences for young children \n     and redirection for troubled older children and adolescents, \n     libraries can be a major delivery point.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/16/senate-section/article/S10444-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10444-S10445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. As the Senate considers appropriations for the \nNational\n\n[[Page S10445]]\n\nEndowment for Arts and the Humanities Act, the primary source of \nfederal support for the arts, humanities and museums, I wish to express \nmy support for these programs.\n\n\n                      Arts as Part of Our History\n\n  Mr. President, throughout this nation's history, the arts have been \nan integral part of our background and heritage. Over the years, music, \ndance, art, and personal expression have evolved to reflect our \nchanging culture and attitudes. In a country of great diversity, from \neducation and socioeconomic background to political perspective and \nreligious views, all people should have the opportunity to experience \nAmerica in its many forms, including the arts.\n\n\n                            NEA Is a Success\n\n  In 1966, when Congress created the National Endowment of the Arts, \nthe mission was to expose all people, across the nation, from \nCalifornia to Maine, from New York to North Dakota, of all backgrounds \nand origins, to music, dancing, theater, art and literature. Since \nthen, the NEA has more than succeeded with its mission. The NEA helps \nsupport community festivals, rural chamber music, arts centers, \ngalleries, arts libraries, town halls, children's organizations, and \nother social and civic institutions where families can experience the \narts. NEA-sponsored programs build bridges of understanding among \ndiverse groups of Americans.\n\n\n                           Economic Benefits\n\n  The arts also stimulate local economies. By attracting tourist \ndollars, the arts stimulate business development, encourage urban \nrenewal, attract new businesses, and improve the overall quality of \nlife for our cities and towns. Nationally, nonprofit arts organizations \ngenerate an estimated $37 billion in economic activity and return $3.4 \nbillion in federal income taxes to the U.S. Treasury each year. In \nother words, for every $ 1.00 dollar spent by the NEA, $34.00 are \nreturned to the United States. Every $1.00 spent by the NEA attracts \n$12.00 to the arts from other sources.\n\n\n                      Increased Job Opportunities\n\n  The arts also create job opportunities for more Americans. More than \n1.7 million Americans are employed in the non-profit arts industry. \nThis number is higher than any other profession including legal \nservices, police and firefighting, mining, advertising, and forestry \nand logging. Since 1970 the number of artists employed in the U.S. has \nmore than doubled. Even with this increase, the United States still \nspends nearly fifty times less on the arts than any of its major \nallies.\n\n\n                 Creates State and Federal Partnerships\n\n  To ensure that people across the country have access to arts \nprograms, the NEA promotes partnerships between the state and arts \nagencies, schools and local organizations. This cooperative system of \narts support links local, state and regional associations in order to \nensure that support and assistance is provided to organizations that \nwork with culturally diverse populations, older adults, people with \ndisabilities, and individuals living in institutions. Before the NEA, \nonly 5 states had state-funded arts councils. Today, all 50 states do. \nCurrently, the NEA sustains 25 partnerships with federal agencies \nincluding the Departments of Education and Justice, the Center for \nSubstance Abuse Prevention, and the National Science Foundation.\n\n\n                           education Benefits\n\n  The arts can improve learning and be part of a well-rounded \neducation. Research from 1995-97 from the College Entrance Examination \nBoard shows that students who studied the arts scored an average of 83 \npoints higher than non-arts students on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, \nthe SAT. Children with a piano background have also scored better on \nmath tests.\n  The NEA and the state arts agencies provide $30 million in annual \nsupport for more than 7,800 arts education projects in more than 2,400 \ncommunities. In 1997, the NEA invested $8.2 million, 10 percent of its \nannual grant dollars, in kindergarten through grade 12 arts programs. \nArts education improves life skills including self-esteem, teamwork, \nmotivation, discipline, and problem solving that help young people \ncompete in a challenging and high-tech workforce.\n\n\n              nea affects california and states nationwide\n\n  Cutting funding means cutting programs. NEA has supported many \nCalifornia efforts: programs such as the I Do Dance Not Drugs program \nin South Central Los Angeles that works with latch-key kids would be \ndemolished; a grant to the Pacific Symphony Association in Santa Ana, \nCalifornia funds Class Act, 95 a program which supports and enhances \nmusic education for up to 17,000 students at 20 elementary schools in \nOrange County through a series of activities, including repeated \ninteraction with an Orchestra musician and direct exposure and \ninteractive experiences with the Orchestra and the music it performs, \nwould not be possible without NEA funding; to support a comprehensive \neducation program at Berkeley public elementary schools, the Berkeley \nSymphony Orchestra will help train teachers in music, encouraging \nstudent interaction with the composer, an introductory orchestral \nconcert, classroom visits, and a culminating presentation at which \nstudents perform side by side with Berkeley Symphony Orchestra \nprofessional musicians; the California Arts Council supports arts \neducation and the partnership project with the California Assembly of \nLocal Art Agencies to strengthen the State's local art agencies; \nprograms which support Native American artists in Eureka, California to \nput on workshops for students and citizens on art could be terminated.\n\n\n                          Public Supports NEA\n\n  By a margin of 3 to 1, Americans support govemment-funded arts \nprograms. Moreover, a 1996 Lou Harris poll states that 61 percent of \nAmericans said they would be willing to pay $5.00 more in taxes to fund \nthe arts. This is important because private donations tend to support \nlarger arts organizations, not smaller, independent projects and \ngroups. The NEA works hard to fund a wide range of expression.\n\n\n                              NEA Reforms\n\n  With reforms now requiring grantees to adhere to strict guidelines, \ntrying to address the concerns of some who worry that some projects are \nobjectionable can rest assured. National panels of private citizens \nselect grantees in a rigorous, democratic review process.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I would like to remind my colleagues \nthat the total for arts and humanities-related spending for the 1997 \nfiscal year was less than 1% of the total budget. The National \nEndowment for the Arts costs each American about 36 cents per year. \nArts institutions have affected millions of Americans. Whether its been \nwatching a famous play, wandering through a beautiful museum, or having \nthe opportunity to live a dream by singing on stage in a local theater \ncompany, the NEA fosters an excellence, diversity, and vitality of the \narts in the United States which could never be matched by any other \ninstitution. It represents a national commitment to excellence our \nnation's culture, heritage, and, most important, its people. The NEA \nbenefits our citizens, educational institutions, economy, and our \nspirits. We cannont, in good faith, deny Americans access to such an \nnational treasure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/16/senate-section/article/S10444-4", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10445-S10446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                75TH ANNIVERSARY OF ST.

This year marks \nthe 75th year the high school will provide quality education to \nstudents in and around the Belmar area. It is a pleasure for me to \nrecognize this important milestone.\n  St. Rose exists to educate high school age men and women so that they \nmay realize their spiritual, academic, and social potential. St. Rose's \nmission, since beginning as a parish school in 1923, emanates from a \ntradition of Roman Catholic education administered by the Sisters of \nSt. Joseph of Chestnut Hill. The staff of religious and lay faculty is \nresponsive to the needs of a changing world. They have created a safe, \nsupportive, disciplined atmosphere and curriculum that honors and \nnurtures the dignity, worth and capabilities of each student. The \nalumni go on to assume positions of leadership within their communities \nand professional fields.\n  This school has become an extraordinary educational institution that \nhas improved the quality of life for the citizens of New Jersey, and it \nhas long\n\n[[Page S10446]]\n\nbeen an example of the standard that we set for our nation's high \nschools. Through hard work and dedication, the faculty have illustrated \ntheir commitment to building the leaders of tomorrow, and their success \nover the past 75 years serve as an inspiration to all educators.\n  I am proud to recognize St. Rose on its anniversary, and I look \nforward to another 75 years of quality education from this \ninstitution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/16/senate-section/article/S10445-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10446-S10447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Hispanic \nAmericans, as we begin to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month. Events \nwill occur throughout the Nation during this month--which extends from \nSeptember 15th to October 15th--to applaud the achievements of \nHispanics everywhere.\n  The diverse contributions of Hispanics to society, culture, \nacademics, and the economy of our Nation have greatly enriched America. \nFor example, the first two Hispanic Americans to win the Nobel Prize, \nbiochemist Severo Ochoa and physicist Luis Alvarez, in their gain of \nworldwide acclaim, added to America's greatness in their respective \nfields. Dr. Ochoa of New York, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine \nin 1959 for his discovery of ribonucleic acid (RNA). According to a New \nYork Times article of November 3, 1993, Dr. Arthur Kornberg shared the \nNobel Prize with Dr. Ochoa and said upon his death that Dr. Ochoa was \n``a fine teacher, a person of great enthusiasm and optimism.'' The \nNobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Dr. Alvarez in 1968 for \ndiscovering a subatomic particle that can exist for only fraction of a \nsecond. He was born in California and later died in Berkeley, \nCalifornia in 1968.\n  Another great American, Franklin Chang-Diaz, became the first \nHispanic American in space when he flew on a 1986 space shuttle \nColumbia mission. Ellen Ochoa became the first Hispanic female \nastronaut when NASA selected her for that duty in 1990, after receiving \nher Masters and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford \nUniversity. These Americans have presented themselves as ideal role \nmodels for other Hispanic Americans aspiring to excel in science and \ntechnical fields.\n  Our country's Armed Forces have also been proud to have Hispanics \nserve to protect America's freedom and liberty. The U.S. Congressional \nMedal of Honor Society has so far presented 38 Hispanic Americans with \nthe distinguished Medal of Honor for their valor and great bravery. \nWithout the integrity and spirit exemplified by these individuals, \nAmericans everywhere would be facing a less secure world. Latinos have \nbeen with us through the Revolution, expansion to the West, and every \nconflict we have faced as a Nation; more than 400,000 Hispanics served \nthe U.S. during World War II, and nearly 25,000 served during the \nPersian Gulf War.\n  The leadership of this country is augmented by the voices of our \nHispanic elected officials, many who have joined forces in the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus. The Caucus has been working very hard to \nadvance relevant legislation and educate their colleagues about the \nneeds of the Hispanic community. As we review Congressional history, we \ndiscover that the first Latino to serve in Congress, Joseph Marion \nHernandez, entered our halls as a Delegate from Florida in 1822. Our \nbody welcomed Octaviano Larrazolo as the first Hispanic U.S. Senator in \n1928. Currently, I am honored to have the only Hispanic Chief of Staff \nin the U.S. Senate, my good friend Reynaldo Martinez. I feel that we \nshould see more of these success stories as we reach the next \nmillennium.\n  In the state of Nevada, Hispanics have shown their influence in all \nareas, especially in education, business, and politics. Nevada \ncontinues to be the fastest-growing state in the Nation, and Nevada's \nHispanics have increased from 124,408 people out of 1.2 million in \n1990, to 253,329 people out of 1.7 million in 1997, according to Census \nBureau figures released last week. This is a large increase from 10.4 \npercent of the state population in 1990 to 15.1 percent in 1997.\n  Hispanics have been the largest minority in Nevada for years and will \nbecome the largest minority in the rest of the country in 2005. Overall \nin the U.S., Hispanics number more than 30 million people. Along with \nsome of my colleagues, I worked to address urgent needs of this quickly \ngrowing segment of our U.S. population, forging inroads with various \nHispanic organizations through our Senate Hispanic Working Group. The \nWorking Group has met regularly throughout the past year, encouraging a \ntwo-way learning process in which we have come to better understand \nimportant concerns that Hispanic Americans have, while expressing to \nthe Hispanic community our earnest desire to address these concerns. \nThe group has forged ties with Hispanic organizations such as the \nNational Council of La Raza, League of United Latin American Citizens, \nNational Association of Latino Elected Officials, American GI Forum, \nMexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, National Latino \nChildren's Institute and MANA A National Latina Organization. I am very \npleased that our Leader, Senator Daschle, asked me to work with Senator \nBingaman and Senator John Kerry in this effort.\n  Practical, everyday issues Democrats have worked to address for \nHispanic Americans are many in number and quite varied. For instance, \nwe united to pass an amendment to the education IRA bill which I \noffered, along with my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, to \nhelp reduce the alarming number of high school dropouts in this \ncountry. Although the amendment was added to the bill, it was \nregrettably stripped in conference.\n  This effort was particularly aimed at addressing the \ndisproportionately high rate of Hispanic high school dropouts--a rate \nwhich has hovered at 30 percent. This is by far the highest rate \ncompared to all other racial and ethnic minority groups--a rate that is \nsimply unacceptable. Nevada has also seen dropout rates among Hispanics \nof more than 16 percent. We must continue to find out why these \nstudents are left behind, and eventually feel compelled to curtail \ntheir learning opportunities. These are opportunities that could help \nthese disenfranchised young people begin a career, support their \nfamilies now and in the future, and make something of their lives.\n  My own life was transformed by the power of education. My father \nnever received an education higher than elementary school and my mother \nnever graduated from high school. But because I was lucky enough to \nhave access to educational opportunities, the support of good teachers, \nand a supportive community, I was able to accomplish what my parents \nhad dreamed for me. Democrats want to make sure that every American has \nthe opportunity to obtain a good education and realize their full \npotential.\n\n  We have also been trying very hard to reform our health care system. \nMillions of Americans worry every day about health care as they fight \nall manner of illness and disease, or care for a loved one who is sick. \nMany Americans, including Hispanic Americans who make up almost one in \nevery four uninsured individuals in the U.S., wonder about how they \nwill obtain the care they need when they need it, how they will pay for \nit, whether or not the care is quality care, and how much control they \nwill have over their own health care decisions. We have managed to \nelevate on the national level one comprehensive solution to many \nfamilies' health care worries in Patients' Bill of Rights legislation. \nWe did this because people want to change the way managed care works, \nor more accurately, doesn't work. Regrettably, partisans have fought \nagainst full consideration of managed care reform in the Patients' Bill \nof Rights that would address issues at the heart of Americans' health \ncare concerns. Democrats will continue pushing to increase patient \nprotections for all Americans.\n  We have also, time after time, come to this floor to talk about \nstrengthening retirement security for current and future generations. I \nhear our young people's anxiety about their retirement--that nothing \nwill be available to help them when it's time to leave the workforce. \nUnfortunately for Hispanics, out of the one in ten who are part of the \nworkforce, only one in three or 32 percent of the 13.2 million working \nHispanic Americans participate in employee pension plans. The \nparticipation rate for other minorities is 44 percent and for white \nAmericans, 51 percent. The situation is bleaker for Hispanic women, who \nearn on average\n\n[[Page S10447]]\n\nonly 57 cents for every dollar earned by men and are thus unable to \nbuild savings or save for retirement.\n  Our solution is the Retirement Accessibility, Security, and \nPortability Act of 1998, a comprehensive pension bill that includes a \nwide range of proposals designed to help Americans prepare for a secure \nretirement. This legislation would expand pension coverage, strengthen \npension security, promote pension portability, and increase equity for \nwomen. We are also working to save Social Security--a program that has \nsucceeded in keeping millions of older Americans out of poverty, \nhelping people who don't have pension plans or inadequate pensions, and \nserving as a necessary safety net. Americans shouldn't face great \nanxiety in their golden years and should rather be free to enjoy their \ngrandchildren, second or third careers, and as active a lifestyle as \nthey desire.\n  We have accomplished other things with the support of Hispanic \nAmericans during this Congress, such as halting an assault on the \nDisadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program. During Senate \nconsideration of ISTEA II, the comprehensive highway funding bill, \nDemocrats succeeded in protecting the DBE program which helps to ensure \nthat minority- and women-owned small businesses have a fair opportunity \nto compete for Federal-aid highway and transit construction projects. \nIn my state, $26.6 million or 11 percent of 1997 contracting dollars \ncoming into Nevada went to minority- and women-owned businesses. In \n1996, the DBE program brought in $4.2 million for minority-owned firms, \nor 7.3 percent of Federal contracting funds. It is imperative that we \ncontinue our diligence in helping these businesses fight against \ndiscrimination and flourish in their respective industries.\n  This year, we fought for a restoration of Food Stamps to legal \nimmigrants who unfairly lost their benefits. As my colleagues recall, \nthe Republican welfare bill in 1996 introduced several provisions \nharmful to legal immigrants, including a prohibition that cut 935,000 \nindividuals from the Food Stamp program alone. Although eligibility \nlater was restored in 1997 for certain immigrants in selected Federal \nassistance programs, many others remained ineligible for necessary \nbenefits in the Federal safety net that helps poorer families. We \nincluded a partial, $818 million restoration in the agricultural \nresearch bill conference report, defeating a motion to recommit the \nconference report with instructions stating that Food Stamp benefits be \nrestored only to refugees and asylees who were lawfully residing in the \nU.S. on August 22, 1996. Immigrants were inequitably subjected to an \narbitrary cutoff of benefits that hurt them dearly and took food out of \nthe mouths of young children. We made sure that at least part of this \ninjustice was reversed.\n  I hope that a similar range of issues will be addressed in a \nstatewide Hispanic Leadership Summit--the second one in a series--which \nwill take place in Nevada this October. The first Hispanic summit I \nhelped arrange in 1997 served as a catalyst for discussions in issue \nforums on education, health care, crime and community health, business \nand employment, and political awareness, and this year's summit will \nspur discussion on the same issues. In addition to identifying Nevadans \nto serve in leadership roles for the community in these areas, summit \nparticipants proposed solutions to various problems, such as \neducational programs to address high school dropout rates, alternatives \nto gangs, improved adult education and bilingual education/English as a \nSecond Language programs, and better access to higher education. I \nencourage my colleagues to hold events such as this one in their own \nstates, as a way to further encourage solidarity and real progress as \nthe Nevada summits did for the Hispanic community in my state.\n  Many accomplishments of Hispanic Americans came to light at the \nsummit, and Hispanic Heritage Month presents us a terrific opportunity \nto celebrate those accomplishments once again. For example, as Hispanic \nconsumers grow in number and purchasing power, producers, retailers and \nadvertisers are recognizing Hispanics' strong economic muscle and \nfinding selective marketing to Hispanics increasingly important. The \nHispanic share of total buying power in my state grew from 6.4 percent \nin 1990 to 8.2 percent in 1997--an increase from $1.38 billion to $3.17 \nbillion in less than a decade. Nationally, Hispanic buying power rose \nfrom 5.2 percent or $210 billion in 1990 to 6.1 percent and $348 \nbillion in 1997, according to the Selig Center for Economic Growth at \nthe University of Georgia. Hispanic Americans are helping to grow the \neconomy.\n  Hispanic entrepreneurs are also becoming a significant force in \nNevada's economy, and the U.S. as a whole. Nevada's 3,900 Hispanic-\nowned firms earned $484 million in sales and receipts in 1992--double \nthe number of firms existing in 1987 (1,767 businesses) and triple the \nsales and receipts logged in 1997 ($142 million), according to the \nCensus Bureau. As of 1996, there were an estimated greater than one \nmillion Hispanic-owned businesses in the U.S. Also growing in number \naround the country are Hispanic Chambers of Commerce--which numbered \n169 in 31 states in 1995, according to Hispanic Business, Inc. This \nincluded the Latin Chamber of Commerce of Nevada in Las Vegas and the \nHispanic Chamber of Commerce in Reno. I am encouraged to see that these \nbusinesses have come a long way and that they are projected to grow \neven more dramatically in the next five to ten years.\n  In closing, Hispanic Americans have much to celebrate this month. I \nfeel there is no better occasion than now to personally congratulate a \nfew winners who have made the Silver State quite proud. The Latin \nEnergy Dancers of Carson City, Nevada are being recognized this week by \nthe National Latino Children's Institute--my warm congratulations go \nout to this group on being declared as one of the institute's La \nPromesa Award Winners 1998. Congratulations to Father Omar Botia for \nbeing this year's recipient of the Humanitarian of the Year \n``Adelante'' Award. Father Omar, my friend, has contributed much to the \nHispanic community in Reno, not only in the spiritual realm, but also \nin recognizing the need for improvement of their temporal situations. \nAlso, MANA, A Latina Organization recently opened a new chapter in my \nstate in Las Vegas--I wish them the best in their new endeavor. Let \nthis month be a celebration for achievements and honors like these, \nthrough which the Hispanic community will continue to grow and \nflourish. Hispanic Heritage Month will be a time for us to remember the \ncontributions that the Hispanic community has shared with us and has \ngiven to this, only adding to its greatness. We are reminded this month \nthat the United States is a country of true diversity, which revels in \nthe differences of its individuals, and rejoices in the common strains \nthat unite us as Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/16/senate-section/article/S10446-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10447-S10448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the \nLatino community. As we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, I want to \nrecognize the contributions made by millions of Latinos in our nation. \nNew Jersey is a truly multi-cultural state and I am honored to help \nrepresent this vigorous community in the United States Senate.\n  Mr. President, this month we celebrate a community with leadership \nwhich is notable in every facet of our society; which continually \ncommits to family, education and business; and which is a vital force \nin our economy. Latinos have persevered, often under difficult \nsituations, yet remain hopeful even as they strive for change. Hispanic \nelected officials and community leaders work to increase involvement in \nthe electoral process, break the cycle of poverty and improve people's \nlives. Many Latino soldiers have made the ultimate sacrifice in giving \ntheir lives for the common good of our country. Today, I want to honor \nthese brave Americans and their families. And I also want to honor \nLatina/o heroes and heroines like the late Julia de Burgos, Arturo \nAlphonso Schomburg, Cesar Chavez, Roberto Clemente, Puerto Bibliophile \nand Don Pedro Albizu Campos among others. These teachers, advocates, \nathletes, and activists have brought pride to their community, enriched \nour country, and provided role models for all of us to emulate.\n  I commend the Latino community for its courage and persistence and\n\n[[Page S10448]]\n\nwant to warmly acknowledge the talent and vitality its expanding \npopulation brings to our nation. I thank the community for leading by \nexample, and for promoting a national policy agenda which highlights \nvery basic human necessities that should be the right of every \nAmerican.\n  Mr. President, a democratic and prosperous society, such as ours, \nshould not step back from a national commitment to provide assistance \nto those who strive to achieve the American dream, despite the odds. In \nparticular, I want to emphasize the importance of a quality education \nfor the success of Latino children. Our Latino young people are a great \nsource of strength and hope for the future and they should be able to \nparticipate fully in the American experience. We should not cut off \nbenefits to children, the elderly, and disabled immigrants who entered \nour country legally and may have no other means of survival. Quality \nchild care, early childhood development and work training initiatives \nare also critical investments that can make all the difference to \nLatino children.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to honor New Jersey's Hispanic community \ntoday and to have the opportunity to ensure that Latino contributions, \ninsights and sacrifices do not go unnoticed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/16/senate-section/article/S10447-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE C. CLYDE ATKINS\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I join the citizens of South \nFlorida in celebrating the distinguished career of Federal Judge C. \nClyde Atkins, a man held in the highest esteem by his peers in the \ncommunity and within the legal profession.\n  Born in Washington, D.C., Judge Atkins began his legal career when he \nattended the University of Florida where his law studies--which he \nsupported by working at campus jobs--earned him a legal degree in 1936. \nHe practiced law in Stuart, Florida before moving to Miami where his \ndistinguished legal performance was highly recognized. He served as \nPresident of the Dade County Bar Association from 1953 to 1954, and as \nPresident of the Florida Bar Association in 1960.\n  In 1966, he was appointed a United States District Judge for the \nSouthern District of Florida, having been nominated by President Lyndon \nJohnson. He served as Chief Judge from 1977 to 1982, during which time \nhe was appointed by United States Supreme Court Chief Justice Burger as \nChairman of the Judicial Conference Committee on Operation of the Jury \nSystem. Additionally, President Jimmy Carter appointed him a member of \nthe National Commission for the Review of Antitrust Laws and \nProcedures, on which he served from 1978 to 1979. In his present \nposition on the federal bench, Judge Atkins has served 32 outstanding \nyears, longer than anyone there presently.\n  Integrity and fairness are words synonymous with the characteristics \nand judicial talents Judge Atkins has exhibited in serving the public. \nHe is particularly credited with ending segregation in Dade County's \nschools; preserving the rights of the homeless; vigorously upholding \nthe tenets of free speech; and granting the equal treatment of \nrefugees. As an affirmation of his legal acumen, the University of \nMiami School of Law established the C. Clyde Atkins Moot Court Series, \nwhere law students are able to hone their own legal talents.\n  A driven and conscientious worker, Judge Atkins has been highly \npraised by his colleagues and associates, and has garnered the highest \nrespect from within and beyond the legal community. He has been \nrecognized by numerous community organizations, especially the Catholic \nChurch to which he has held a strong and abiding devotion during his \nlifetime. Judge Atkins has been President of the St. Augustine Diocesan \nUnion of Holy Name Societies and President of the Miami Archdiocesan \nCouncil of Catholic Men, as well as receiving the National Conference \nof Christians and Jews Outstanding Catholic Award. He has been honored \nby the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and the Greater Miami \nJewish Federation awarded him with the Lifetime Achievement Award.\n  Amidst these impressive accomplishments, I believe that Judge Atkins \nwould cite his 61 year marriage to the former Esther Castillo as the \nmost cherished, treasured, and important part of his life. Together, as \nlifetime partners, they raised three children and have enjoyed the \npleasures of grandparenting, as much as my wife Adele and I have.\n  Mr. President, I join all those who honor Judge Atkins for his \nlifetime of commitment to the people of our state. His competence, \nunswerving integrity and devotion to the bench, his mild and gentle \nmanner, and his consummate respect for the law have given the people of \nFlorida a person who serves as a role model for all to emulate.\n  We cherish his service and wish him well as he continues to provide \njudicial leadership and inspiration to future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/16/senate-section/article/S10448-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SUBMITTING CHANGES TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ALLOCATION\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.
