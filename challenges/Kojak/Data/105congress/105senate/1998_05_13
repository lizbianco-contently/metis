The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the privilege of \nthe floor be extended to Dr. Anne Vopatek, a fellow on my staff, during \nthe consideration of S. 1873 and all relevant motions thereto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it should be noticed by those who are \ninterested in the subject of missile defense that what we are actually \ndebating and deciding this morning is whether or not the Senate should \nproceed to consider the bill that has been introduced by me and the \ndistinguished Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye.\n  This bill is not going to be voted on up or down today; what we will \nhave a vote on at 11:30 is whether or not to proceed to consider the \nbill. When the majority leader decided to call up this legislation, \nthere was an objection made to proceeding to consider the bill. So \nunder the procedures of the Senate, the majority leader, who is in \ncharge of making decisions about the schedule of the Senate and how we \ntake up legislation in the Senate, was\n\n[[Page S4750]]\n\nobligated to file a motion to proceed to consider the bill. That motion \nis debatable.\n\n  Under notice from the opponents of the bill, it was clear that motion \nwould be debated at length. So to get to the bill, it was decided by \nthe majority leader that a cloture motion should be filed on the motion \nto proceed, bringing debate on the motion to a close. If we get 60 \nvotes on that cloture motion, then we can proceed to consider the bill \nand it can be open for amendment, and Senators who have alternative \nideas, or think that the current policy is the policy we should have \nfor missile defense, can make those points and the Senate can consider \nthose views. But until this cloture motion is approved, we can't get to \nthat point. We can't get to the point of considering this bill on its \nmerits and considering any amendments which Senators would have.\n  So I am trying to put in context what is before the Senate, what the \nissue is here. The issue this morning is whether or not the Senate \nthinks this is a matter of such seriousness and consequence to our \nnational security that we ought to consider it, that we ought to debate \nit, that we ought to let the Senate work its will on a proposal to \nchange our policy with respect to national missile defense. I can't \nthink of a more interesting and serious time, given the events which \nare occurring in the world today, for the consideration of this issue. \nIt is on everybody's mind, Mr. President, because of the tests which \nhave been undertaken in India of a nuclear warhead. India now announces \nto the world they are prepared to use this as a part of their nuclear \nweapons arsenal, that they have it available, and that they are a \nnuclear weapons state. This is a dramatic change in the situation in \nIndia. It is a dramatic change in the security interests of the entire \nworld.\n  At this time, we find the United States relying upon a policy with \nrespect to missile defense of developing a national missile defense \nsystem in two stages, unlike any other defense acquisition program that \nwe have ever had, or that we now have. We have a technology program--\none that is developing the capabilities to have an effective defense \nsystem, but we do not have any policy with respect to ever putting that \nsystem in the field, or to integrating it into our national defense \nstructure. That decision hasn't been made. We are suggesting in \noffering this bill that the time has come for the United States to say \nto the world we are going to develop and deploy a national missile \ndefense system.\n  We are going to protect the security interests of the United States \nand the territory of the United States. As a matter of national policy, \nthe Federal Government is going to obligate itself to undertake to \nprotect the security interests of the citizens of the United States and \nthe United States itself from ballistic missile attack. It seems to me \nthat is an obligation that is very clear for us, in moral terms, as a \ngovernment.\n  With India having a missile capability of a range of about 1,400 \nmiles already, according to recent reports that are available to the \nSenate, Pakistan having tested for the first time on April 6 a new \nmedium-range missile with a range of 1,500 kilometers, and India \nannouncing that it is concerned that Pakistan is a covert nuclear \nweapon state, although it hasn't announced that, we are seeing evidence \nthat around the world--in North Korea, in Iran, and, of course, in \nRussia and China--there are nation states that are developing, or now \nhave, longer range missile capabilities than ever before. Some have the \nadded capability of nuclear weapons and, some have other weapons of \nmass destruction that can be delivered with those long-range missile \nsystems. And the United States is defenseless against attack from long-\nrange ballistic missiles.\n  It has been our policy up until now to have the capacity to destroy \nany nation that would think about using a nuclear weapon against us. \nRussia and the United States have had over a period of time this mutual \nassured destruction relationship: If you destroy me, you can be assured \nI will destroy you. That confrontation and that balance of power has \nprevented any use of a missile system or nuclear weapon against the \nterritory of the United States, even though that is not a very happy \nrelationship to have.\n  Now, we hope, we are moving toward a better and more stable \nrelationship, but there is still always the chance of an unauthorized \nlaunch even from Russia. We are working to destroy and build down the \nweapons stockpile. That is good. But we are not yet to the point where \nthere is no risk. This is not a risk-free relationship with Russia. \nThere could be an accidental launch. If there is, we have no defense \nwhatsoever.\n  With respect to China, it is certainly unlikely that we are going to \nhave any missile attack from there. Nonetheless, there is an emerging \nlong-range missile system capability in China that is growing more \nsophisticated, that is going to continue to grow and develop more \nlethality and longer ranges, and it presents a threat--unlikely, but, \nnonetheless, there could be an unauthorized or accidental launch of a \nmissile from China.\n  Already we are seeing the North Koreans developing--and already \ndeploying--some medium-range missile systems. They are now developing, \nwe are told, a missile with a range of 6,000 kilometers. That missile \ncould reach Alaska. It could reach Hawaii. Who knows what their plans \nare for continuing to develop missiles with increased ranges.\n  We found out, through a year-long series of hearings that we \nconducted last year in our Subcommittee on International Security, \nProliferation, and Federal Services, that it is much easier now than \never before for nation states who want to improve and develop their \nmissile systems, and to give them longer ranges, to do so with the \naccess they have to information from the Internet and to experts in \nRussia and other nation states where they already have the \ncapabilities.\n  Iran provides an example of the surprises we face. One surprise \noccurred when we found out that Iran had acquired the technology, the \ncomponents, and the expertise to put together a medium-range missile \nsystem. They are in the process of doing that now. One State Department \nofficial said that they could have that missile system available by the \nend of this year.\n  Last year, when we had the Director of Central Intelligence before a \ncommittee of the Senate talking about the advancements that had been \nmade in Iran, he said that he thought--this is in 1997--that it would \nbe up to 10 years before Iran would have medium-range missile system \ncapability. Then he sent word up, that because of new developments and \nthe acquisition of expertise and components from Russia, Iran had made \nsurprising advances and they would have the capability to deploy such a \nsystem much sooner. It is because of gaps and uncertainties, he said, \nthat you can't predict when people are going to get these technologies \nand other equipment from foreign sources, or how quickly they can \ndevelop an ICBM threat--you just can't predict that.\n\n  So we have seen in Pakistan now, in India, of course, in China, \nRussia, in Iran, and in North Korea solid evidence of what we are \ntalking about today. And that is that there is in the world today a \nreal threat to the security of this Nation because of the emerging \ncapabilities and technologies for developing and deploying long-range \nmissiles, that there are available in these countries weapons of mass \ndestruction that can be carried by these missiles over long ranges, and \nthat it is time for the United States to acknowledge this threat and \nsay as a matter of policy that we are going to deploy a national \nmissile defense system.\n  That is what this bill says. It doesn't set out what kind of \narchitecture the missile defense system should have or any deadlines \nfor doing it. We would rely upon the orderly processes of authorization \nand appropriation, as we have for all other defense acquisition \nprograms, to determine how soon it is developed and when it is \ndeployed. But what we are saying today is that, as a matter of policy, \nwe are going to deploy a national missile defense system.\n  I think it is also important to notice that this does not require a \nviolation of any existing arms control agreement. In our early \ndiscussions of this legislation, we heard others say that this puts in \njeopardy the ABM--the antiballistic missile--agreement. It does not. \nThat agreement contemplates that a party to the agreement could have a \nnational missile defense system. It permits a\n\n[[Page S4751]]\n\nsingle site for interceptor rockets. We have been proceeding under the \ncurrent administration plan that this is the kind of a system that \nwould be developed, and eventually, if--under the administration's \npolicy--a threat is perceived to exist, then an effort would be made to \ndeploy the system.\n  So the real difference in what we are presenting to the Senate today \nis that this is a policy that is announced to the world and to rogue \nstates that may be saying, ``Look, the United States is defenseless. We \nhave an opportunity to put some pressure on them by developing a \nmissile system that is capable of striking the United States. We can \ncoerce them, intimidate them, and blackmail them because they are not \nat this point considering deploying a defense against intercontinental \nballistic missiles.'' We would end that kind of thinking in nations who \nmay be taking that approach by saying, ``Yes, we are. You are not going \nto see the United States any longer taking a wait-and-see approach.'' \nAnd that is what the administration's policy is--to wait and see if a \nthreat develops.\n  We are saying, ``Mr. President, you have signed Executive orders over \nthe last 4 years, starting in 1994, saying that the United States is \nconfronted with a national emergency because of the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction and missile systems around the world.'' The \nPresident has acknowledged that, and he signed Executive orders that \nsay that. But now it is time to say we are going to do something about \nit, we are going to do something to protect our security interests \nagainst this national emergency that exists. Up until now, we have said \nwe will wait and see if there is a real threat. That puts us at risk \nhere in the United States.\n  I am saying that we had better get busy. We had better get busy and \ndevelop and deploy a system. It would be much better for all of us if \nwe deployed a system that may be a year or two years early getting to \nthe field than waiting until it is a year too late.\n  That is the issue and it is important given what is happening in the \nworld today, given the fact that our intelligence agencies were not \nable to even detect that this test in India was about to take place, \ngiven that they weren't able to detect, as far as I know, that Pakistan \nwas going to test, or even had, the new missile they tested in April, \nand given they weren't able to detect that Iran was going to be able to \nput together a medium-range ballistic missile within 1 year rather than \nwithin as many as 10 years. The latest assessment was as many as 10 \nyears; now it is perhaps within 1 year. These are not the only \nsurprises, they are just the most recent ones. Some of us have known \nabout these surprises before now, but now the whole world knows about \nthem. They are acknowledged at the highest levels of our Government. If \nwe can't detect that India is about to test a nuclear warhead, if we \ncan't detect that Pakistan has a missile system that has a range five \ntimes greater than what we thought they had, if we can't detect that \nIran is developing a medium-range missile with technology and \ncomponents imported from other countries, and they will be able to put \nthat in the field as many as 9 years earlier than we had thought 1 year \nago, then we need to change our policy and quit assuming that we are \ngoing to be able to detect the development of an intercontinental \nballistic missile system somewhere in the world that can threaten the \nterritory of the United States.\n\n  That is the point of this legislation. We can't be sure. And if we \ncan't be sure that we can detect the threat, we need to be prepared to \ndefend against that threat. The Senate ought to consider this issue, \nand so today we are going to vote on cloture on the motion to proceed \nto consider that issue. I urge the Senate to vote to invoke cloture. We \ndon't need to drag out a debate on a motion to proceed to this issue. \nSure, there are other things that are on the schedule for today, and \nthe leader has committed to taking up other bills after this vote, but \nI am optimistic that we will have enough Senators who understand the \nseriousness of this and the urgency of this for us to turn to the \nmissile defense bill. I hope Senators will consider this, and I am \nhappy to yield to other Senators.\n  I know the distinguished Senator from Michigan is in the Chamber. We \nhave had a number of Senators who have asked for time. I hope my friend \nfrom Michigan will allow me to yield to the Senator from Oklahoma, who \nhas another commitment at 10 o'clock, for whatever time he may consume \nbetween now and 10 o'clock.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the great State of Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me say that I applaud \nthe senior Senator from Mississippi for bringing this up. Yesterday I \nspent some time in the Chamber and evaluated the arguments against this \nso that I could respond to those arguments. And I will just take a \ncouple moments because I am supposed to be presiding, and I would like \nto respond to those objections to this legislation that came from the \nfloor.\n  First of all--and I think this has been discussed already by the \nsenior Senator from Mississippi--the possible effect this would have on \nthe ABM Treaty. I know he presents a very persuasive case that it would \nnot have any threat. Quite frankly, even if it did have a threat to the \nABM Treaty of 1972, I would still be supporting this, because I think \nwhen you talk to most people who were around in 1972, back when we had \ntwo superpowers--we had the U.S.S.R. and the United States--it was not \nthe threat in the world, quite frankly, that it is now, because it was \nmore predictable; we knew what the U.S.S.R. had, and they knew what we \nhad. We had an agreement that I didn't agree with back then. It was \ncalled mutually assured destruction; that is, we agree we won't defend \nourself and you agree you won't defend yourself. And then, of course, \nyou shoot us, we shoot you, everybody dies, and nobody is happy.\n  That was a philosophy we lived by which I didn't agree with at the \ntime. And I have to hasten to say, this came in a Republican \nadministration. This was Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon. But \nregardless of how flawed that might have been as a policy at that time, \ncertainly now it should not have any application. In fact, I have \nquoted many times Henry Kissinger on this floor. When I asked him the \nquestion: Do you feel with the changing threat that's out there and the \nenvironment we are in right now, with some 25 nations with weapons of \nmass destruction, biological, chemical and nuclear, that it still makes \nsense to abide by the ABM Treaty? And he said--this is a quote--``It's \nnuts to make a virtue out of your vulnerability.''\n  That is Henry Kissinger. He was the architect of this ABM Treaty. Of \ncourse, I was one who voted against the START II Treaty and even said \nin the Chamber we had no indication that Russia was going to be signing \nthis anyway. And, of course, we know what is happened since that time. \nSo I think that argument on the ABM Treaty, even if it did offend that \ntreaty, I would still support this legislation from the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  The second objection yesterday was the cost. They said--and this is a \nquote--``We don't know how much it will cost since the bill does not \nspecify any particular system.'' Well, it doesn't. And I am glad this \nbill does not specify a specific system. I have a preference. Mine \nwould be the upper-tier system. The upper-tier system is very close to \nwhere we would be able to deploy this thing. We have a $50 billion \ninvestment in 22 Aegis ships that are floating around out there today. \nThey have a capability of knocking down missiles, but they can't go \nbeyond the upper tier. So it doesn't do us any good except with short-\nrange missiles that stay in the atmosphere.\n  If you have from North Korea a missile coming over here that takes 30 \nminutes to get here, it is only in the last minute and a half that we \nwould be able to use any current technology to knock it down, and then \nwe couldn't do it because we don't have anything that would be that \nfast, so we are naked.\n  And the cost is not that great. The opponents of defending America by \nhaving a national missile defense system keep saying over and over \nagain that it is going to cost billions and billions. I have heard $100 \nbillion, a whole range. And I suggest to you that we have some specific \ncosts. With that $50 billion investment, it would be about $4\n\n[[Page S4752]]\n\nbillion more to reach the upper tier with the Navy upper-tier system. \nThere might be another billion and a half on Brilliant Eyes so we would \nbe able to accurately detect where in the world one would be deployed.\n  And anyone who is among the 81 who supported last week the expansion \nof NATO--I was one who did not support it--you might keep in mind that \nif you are concerned about not having an accurate cost figure for this \nprogram to defend America from a missile attack, look what we voted on \nlast week in ratifying NATO expansion. We agreed that we are going to \nexpand that to the three countries, and the cost figures had a range \nfrom $400 million to $125 billion. Now, I can assure you we are a lot \ncloser to being able to determine what this cost would be.\n  The last thing, I think, is that when this is all over and the dust \nsettles, maybe what happened yesterday in India and this morning in \nIndia might really be a blessing, because at least now we can diffuse \nthe argument that was quoted of General Shelton when he said there is \nno serious threat emerging, and he said our intelligence said that we \nwill have at least 3 years' warning of such a threat. Well, that is the \nsame intelligence that did not know what India was doing.\n\n  If you try everything else and that does not work, let's just look at \nwhat is common sense. We know that we have these countries that have \nweapons of mass destruction. We know that both China and Russia and \nperhaps other countries have missiles that will reach all the way to \nany place in the United States of America today. Using the polar route, \nthey can reach any place in the United States of America. And with that \nout there, why would we assume that China would not do it, or that it \nwould not be an accidental launch, or with some of this technology they \nare selling to countries like Iran, that other countries wouldn't use \nit? I am not willing to put the lives of my seven grandchildren at \nstake by assuming that somehow we are going to have 3 years' warning. I \nthink that is totally absurd.\n  Lastly, I would only share with you that I went through a personal \nexperience with our explosion in Oklahoma City, which I think everyone \nis aware of, that took 168 lives. And as tragic as that was, and what a \ndisaster that was--and as I walked through there and I saw the firemen \nand all of them risking their lives to try to save one or two people \nafter some time had gone by--and you have to have been there, not just \nseeing it on TV, to really get the full impact on this--the explosive \npower that blew up the Murrah Federal Office Building in Oklahoma City \nis one-tenth the power, the explosive power, of the smallest nuclear \nwarhead known today.\n  So I just think my only regret is that we didn't do this 3 years ago \nor 4 years ago, because somebody back in 1983 was pretty smart when \nthey said we need to have a system that could be deployed for a limited \nattack by fiscal year 1998. Here we are, and we are overdue.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \nexcellent remarks.\n  Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from Texas is prepared to \nspeak, I am prepared to yield to her 10 minutes.\n  I yield to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the great State of Texas is \nrecognized for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior \nSenator from Mississippi, who has provided great leadership in this \narea. In fact, I said to the Senator from Mississippi yesterday, if I \nam ever going to need a consultant on the timing of introducing bills, \nI am going to call him immediately, because, of course, what has \nhappened just in the last 5 days, proves how absolutely correct the \nSenator from Mississippi has been in pursuing this very important \nlegislation. I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his leadership.\n  It is clear that the greatest security threat the United States faces \ntoday is that we do not have a defense for incoming ballistic missiles. \nIn fact, if you look back at the latest war that we have had, the gulf \nwar, the largest number of casualties in that war was from a single \nballistic missile attack.\n  We had the Patriot, and the Patriot was actually a missile that was \nsupposed to hit airplanes. We quickly tried to make the Patriot into \nsomething that would hit missiles, and, phenomenally, it actually had a \n30-percent success rate. But when we have our troops in the field and \nwe have the capability to do better than 30 percent, how could we even \nthink of not going full force to protect our troops in any theater \nwhere they might be, anywhere in the world, and to protect the citizens \nof the United States within the sovereign territory of our country? How \ncould we be sitting on technology without saying this is our highest \ndefense priority?\n  Today, we have a chance to say this is our highest defense priority. \nBecause if we cannot protect our citizens in our country and our troops \nin the field, we are leaving ourselves open. And we don't have to do \nthat. Today, we know that over 30 countries in the world have ballistic \nmissile technology. The Senator from Mississippi has gone through what \nsome of these countries now have. Just in the last 5 days, we have seen \nNorth Korea threaten to go back on the agreement they made and refuel \ntheir nuclear reactors. We have seen, in the last few weeks, that China \nhas been buying our technology without our permission--except for the \nPresident letting people do it, presumably because they contributed to \nhis campaign. Pakistan is now deploying a missile with a 1,500 \nkilometer range. India, as we know, in the last 2 days has actually--\nhas actually--tested nuclear weapons. So, of course, the arms race \nbetween Pakistan and India has been rekindled.\n  Iraq--we fought the Desert Storm war because Iraq was getting \nballistic missile technology, and we know they have chemical and \nbiological weapons. Iran--they are receiving assistance from the \nRussians to develop missile systems. Russia is willing to export a good \npart of their scientific basis for nuclear weapons, and we don't know \nhow secure is what is left in Russia.\n  So, how can we look at the facts and not address them vigorously, if \nwe are doing what is right for the American people? We have the \ncapability to do this if we make it a priority. The Senator from \nMississippi is introducing a bill that basically says this is a \npriority, that we will go forward full bore with the capabilities that \nwe have, doing the technological research, doing the testing. All of us \nare very disappointed that the recent THAAD test was not successful. \nBut we should not back away from it. We should be going forward full \nbore to try to make sure that we have a national missile defense \nsystem, an intercontinental missile system, and a theater missile \nballistic system that would defend against any incoming missiles.\n  Let me make another argument, and that is, as we are going through \nall of the countries that we know are now building ballistic missile \ncapability with chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, what would \nbe the very best deterrence from them making that investment? What \nwould be the best deterrence, so India would not feel that it is \nnecessary for their security to test ballistic missiles? The best \ndeterrence would be the capability to deter a launched missile in its \nboost phase. Simply put, if we can take a missile as it is just being \nlaunched and turn it back on the country that is trying to send that \nmissile, isn't that the best deterrence for that country not to send \nthe missile in the first place? Because, obviously, no country is going \nto launch a ballistic missile if it is going to come back on its own \npeople.\n  So, if we can get that defense technology, perhaps that is the best \nway to stop this arms race. Most certainly, the joint threat to us, and \nto our allies, should be our highest priority. This bill establishes \nmissile defense as a top priority because it says we are going to fund \nballistic missile defenses and we are going to deploy them as soon as \nthe technology is there.\n  The argument against it is incomprehensible to me, although I do not \nin any way suggest that those making the argument aren't doing it with \ngood faith. I am positive that they believe they are doing the right \nthing. But to say that the world's greatest superpower is going to wait \nand see what other countries might get, what ballistic missile \ntechnology, and then set on a program full bore that would defend\n\n[[Page S4753]]\n\nagainst that--they could not be talking as representatives of the only \nsuperpower left in the world. They cannot be thinking what a superpower \nmust do, which is to do what no one else in this world has the \ncapability to do. We are the only country that has the capability to \nput the resources behind a ballistic missile defense capability. We are \nthe only country that can do that. Why would we hesitate for one \nmoment? Why would we leave one of our troops in the field unprotected \nfor one more moment than is absolutely necessary? There is no excuse. \nWhy would we leave the people of our country unprotected for one more \nmoment than is necessary, when we have the resources to go full force?\n  It is not an argument from the superpower to say when we know that \nsomeone has perfected a technology that could reach the United States \nthen we will deploy our full forces. How many people will die or be \nmaimed because we are not going full force right now? What better \nquality-of-life issue is there for our military than to give them every \nsafety precaution, protecting them in the field that we have the \ncapability to do?\n  We are the leadership of the greatest superpower in the world. We \nmust say we cannot wait for one more moment for the full priority to be \ngiven to missile defense technology and capability for our country, for \nthe people who live here, from potential terrorist attacks, and for \nanyone representing the United States of America in the field.\n  When our young men and women pledge their lives for our freedom, how \ncan we not give them every protection they deserve to have when they \nare, in fact, defending our ability to speak on this floor today?\n  Mr. President, I hope our colleagues on both sides of the aisle will \nin a very bipartisan vote say, ``We will not walk away from our \nresponsibility to provide the protection to our people that they expect \nand the protection of our troops in the field, wherever they might be, \nfighting for our freedom or for the freedom of oppressed people in \nother places.'' We must give them the protection that we have the \ncapability to do. It is a very clear-cut issue. Thank you, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from \nTexas for her excellent statement and thank her for her assistance in \nthe development of this legislation and our policies on missile \ndefense.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that James \nNielsen of Senator Kyl's staff be granted the privilege of the floor \nduring the debate on the motion on S. 1873.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The bill before us could lessen the security of this Nation, and that \nis the reason so many of us oppose it. Will the bill add to our \nsecurity by committing us to deploy a system before it is even \ndeveloped, threatening the abrogation of a treaty between ourselves and \nthe Russians which have allowed significant reductions in the number of \nnuclear weapons in this world?\n  In my judgment--more important, in the judgment of the uniform and \ncivilian military leaders of this country--this bill does not \ncontribute to our security. This bill risks a reduction in the security \nof this Nation. This bill could contribute to the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction, in this case, nuclear weapons which is the \ngreatest threat that this Nation faces. It is the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction, in this case, nuclear weapons, which is \nthe greatest threat that this Nation faces. And yet this bill, which \npurportedly is aimed at a defense against ballistic missiles, could, \nbecause it threatens a very significant treaty between us and the \nRussians which has allowed for significant reduction of nuclear \nweapons, increase the threat to this Nation from nuclear weapons \nproliferation.\n\n  That is not me saying it, although I believe it; that is Secretary \nCohen saying it, that is General Shelton saying it, that is the \nmilitary leadership of this Nation saying it.\n  I think we all believe in the security of this Nation with equal \npassion. I don't doubt that for 1 minute. I think everybody in this \nChamber, everybody who serves in this Senate has an equal commitment to \nthe security of this Nation. The issue here is how do we contribute to \nthe security of this Nation?\n  The answer comes, it seems to me, from General Shelton in a letter \nwhich he wrote to me on April 21. He is the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, as we all know. What he says is the following:\n\n       Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the American \n     Missile Protection Act of 1998 (S. 1873). I agree that the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their \n     delivery systems poses a major threat to our forces, allies, \n     and other friendly nations. U.S. missile systems play a \n     critical role in our strategy to deter these threats, and the \n     current National Missile Defense Deployment Readiness Program \n     (3+3) is structured to provide a defense against them when \n     required.\n       The bill and the NMD program--\n\n  And he is referring to our current program--\n\n     are consistent on many points; however, the following \n     differences make it difficult to support enactment.\n\n  Then he goes through those differences, why it is that he does not \nsupport enactment of the bill before us; why it is that the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff does not support enactment of this bill.\n  One of the things that we hear from the proponents of this bill is \nthat there is no policy on missile defense in this country. There is no \npolicy to deploy a missile defense. We hear that over and over. Here is \nwhat General Shelton says, as his second reason for not being able to \nsupport this bill:\n\n       Second, the bill asserts that the United States has no \n     policy to deploy [a national missile defense] system. In \n     fact, the [national missile defense] effort is currently a \n     robust research and development program that provides the \n     flexibility to deploy an initial capability within 3 years of \n     a deployment decision. This prudent hedge ensures that the \n     United States will be capable of meeting the need for missile \n     defenses with the latest technology when a threat emerges.\n\n  So his second reason for not supporting this bill is this bill says \nwe don't have a policy to deploy a system. In fact, General Shelton \nwrites, we have a current robust research and development program that \ngives us the flexibility to deploy a system at the right time. That is \nwhat is called a prudent hedge strategy. That is the 3+3 Program. That \nis the 3+3 policy which we adopted in the Senate 2 years ago.\n  Section 233 of that bill says:\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to--\n       (1) deploy as soon as possible affordable and operationally \n     effective theater missile defenses capable of countering \n     existing and emerging theater ballistic missiles;\n       (2)(A) develop for deployment a multiple site national \n     missile system that: (i) is affordable and operationally \n     effective against limited, accidental, and unauthorized \n     ballistic missile attacks on the territory of the United \n     States, and (ii) can be augmented over time as the threat \n     changes to provide a layered defense against limited, \n     accidental, or unauthorized ballistic missile threats;\n       (B) initiate negotiations with the Russian Federation as \n     necessary to provide for the national missile defense \n     systems. . .\n       (C) consider, if those negotiations fail, the option of \n     withdrawing from the ABM Treaty in accordance with the \n     provisions of Article XV of the Treaty. . .\n       (3) ensure congressional review, prior to a decision to \n     deploy the system developed for deployment under paragraph \n     (2), of: (A) the affordability and operational effectiveness \n     of such a system; (B) the threat to be countered by such a \n     system; and (C) ABM Treaty considerations with respect to \n     such a system.\n\n  There is a policy. And the policy is a prudent hedge strategy. The \npolicy, most importantly, is to develop a national missile defense \nsystem as quickly as we can so we can be in a position to make a \ndeployment decision as quickly as possible. We have a policy. That is \nnot me saying it. That is General Shelton saying it.\n  Our policy is to put the horse before the cart. This bill would put \nthe cart before the horse, because what this bill does is say--not just \ndevelop and make a decision after you have developed whether to deploy, \ndepending on the circumstances which exist--this bill says commit \nyourself now to deploy a system no matter what the consequences are, no \nmatter what the circumstances are, as soon as you have something which \nis technologically feasible.\n  Now, what is wrong with that? Why not do what we have never done in \nhistory, which is to commit ourselves to\n\n[[Page S4754]]\n\ndeploy a system before we have even developed it? What is wrong with \nthat? What is wrong with it is that, No. 1, there is no consideration \nof the costs of the system. We do not even know what the system is. We \nare developing it as quickly as possible, but we do not know what the \ncosts of that system are. We do not know what the threats are at the \ntime when we have a system developed.\n  We do know that North Korea could--could--have a capability to hit \nparts of this Nation as early as 2005. We know that is a possibility. \nBut we do not know that that threat will continue. It depends on \nwhether they can successfully test a long-range missile.\n  But what is really critical here, in terms of our battle against \nproliferation, is that what this bill commits us to is to deploy a \nsystem which almost certainly will violate a treaty between us and the \nRussians. Do we care? Do we care if we breach a treaty called the ABM \nTreaty? Is it just a cold war relic, that ABM Treaty? Or is it a real \ndeal between us and Russia, a deal that matters, and the breaking of \nwhich will have consequences? And the consequences will be that they \nwill not ratify START II, will not negotiate START III and will, \ntherefore, not reduce the number of weapons that threaten us.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The consequences of committing ourselves to deploy a \nsystem which almost certainly will violate that agreement are real-\nworld consequences. They threaten our security. They will contribute to \nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Is that me saying it? \nYes. More importantly, is it Secretary Cohen saying it and General \nShelton saying it? Yes.\n  This is what General Shelton said in his final reason for not \nsupporting this bill. The Chairman of our Joint Chiefs says:\n\n       Finally, the bill does not consider affordability or the \n     impact a deployment would have on arms control agreements and \n     nuclear arms reductions. Both points are addressed [he says] \n     in the [current national missile defense program] and should \n     be included in any bill on [national missile defense].\n\n  Our highest military officer is telling us that the impact that a \ndeployment will have on arms control agreements and nuclear arms \nreductions should be included in any bill on national missile defense.\n  Well, Mr. President, they are not included in this bill. And they \nshould be. The security of this Nation requires that we at least \nconsider the impact of deployment of a system on arms reduction, \nbecause if we commit to deploy a system, and that commitment destroys a \ntreaty between us and the Russians, and leads to nonratification of \nSTART II and the reversal of START I and the nonnegotiation of START \nIII--and that is the fear here that General Shalikashvili has expressed \nin a letter that he wrote when he was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs--we \nhave done severe damage to the security of this Nation.\n  For what reason would we take that risk? In order to develop a \nsystem? No. We are developing that system right now. And we should. We \nare developing a national missile defense system. And we should. It is \nthe commitment to deploy which risks the security of this Nation \nwithout consideration of the impact on arms reduction.\n  That is the mistake that this bill makes. That is what General \nShalikashvili pointed out in his letter to Senator Nunn in May of 1996 \nwhen he said:\n\n       . . . efforts which suggest changes to or withdraw from the \n     ABM Treaty may jeopardize Russian ratification of START II \n     and, as articulated in the Soviet Statement to the United \n     States of 13 June 1991, could prompt Russia to withdraw from \n     START I. I am concerned [General Shalikashvili said] that \n     failure of either START initiative will result in Russian \n     retention of hundreds or even thousands more nuclear weapons \n     thereby increasing both the costs and risks we may face.\n       We can reduce the possibility of facing these increased \n     costs and risks by planning an NMD system consistent with the \n     ABM treaty.\n\n  That is General Shalikashvili. Is this resolution consistent with the \nABM Treaty? Probably not. It is very unlikely we could deploy a system \nconsistent with the ABM Treaty which defends the entire continental \nUnited States. But there is an easy way to do it, if that is the intent \nof the resolution: Just put down ``treaty compliant'' system in the \nresolution. Just add those two words, ``treaty compliant'' system. Put \nthe words ``treaty compliant'' before the word ``deployment,'' and that \nwould solve that problem.\n  Those words are missing, and they are not missing inadvertently. It \nis obvious that many supporters of this resolution do not care whether \nor not there would be a violation of the ABM Treaty because they \nbelieve that we should unanimously withdraw from that treaty. But such \nan action will lead to exactly the result which we should dread as much \nas anything, which is the increase in the number of nuclear weapons on \nthe face of this Earth.\n  Finally, Mr. President, on the ABM Treaty--how many minutes do I have \nleft?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his additional 5 minutes. \nThe Senator has 42 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 \nadditional minutes.\n  Mr. President, the ABM Treaty is not some abstract relic. It is a \nliving commitment which has been reasserted at the highest levels at a \nsummit in Helsinki in 1997.\n  President Clinton and President Yeltsin issued the following joint \nstatement. Now, this isn't some person writing an op-ed piece in some \nnewspaper. These are the Presidents of two nations with the largest \nnuclear inventories in the world, President Clinton and President \nYeltsin, expressing their commitment to strengthen the strategic \nstability and international security, emphasizing the importance of \nfurther reductions in strategic offensive arms, and recognizing the \nfundamental significance of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty for these \nobjectives, as well as the necessity for effective theater missile \ndefense systems, considered their common task to preserve the ABM \nTreaty, prevent circumvention of it, and enhance its viability.\n\n  Then later in that same statement, both Presidents state that the \nUnited States and Russia have recently devoted special attention to \ndeveloping measures aimed at assuring confidence of the parties that \ntheir ballistic missile defense activities will not lead to \ncircumvention of the ABM Treaty, to which the parties have repeatedly \nreaffirmed their adherence.\n  This bill before the Senate, where there is a motion to proceed \npending, surely will undermine the confidence of Russia that we are \nadhering to a treaty. Since the commitment which this bill makes to \ndeploy missile defenses will almost certainly--almost certainly--\nviolate that treaty--and again I emphasize, if that is not the intent \nand if that is to be precluded, then the words ``treaty compliant'' \nshould be added. But I think, as we all know because we debated this \nissue so many times, that is not the intent of this resolution.\n  Mr. President, I hope the words of our top military officers will be \nheeded and that the danger of this bill will be considered. Its intent, \nobviously, is to contribute to the security, but its effect is to \nlessen the security of this Nation. We simply cannot afford that risk.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have agreed to yield 5 minutes to the \nchairman of the full committee at some point. I hope he can be \nrecognized soon.\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much time does the Senator desire?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Five minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will consume 10 minutes. I have no \nobjection to Senator Thompson speaking now if he would like.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, in his State of the Union Address, President Clinton \nunderscored the importance of foresight. He said, ``preparing for a far \noff storm that may reach our shores is far wiser than ignoring the \nthunder until the clouds are just overhead.'' He was not talking about \nweapons proliferation\n\n[[Page S4755]]\n\nand national missile defense, but he could have been--and he probably \nshould have been.\n  Well, we are hearing the thunder now. It is coming from Iran, where \nthe Shahab-3 missile program made up years of development time in just \none year, reminding us that some countries are more technically clever \nthan we give them credit for, and that outside assistance can \ndramatically accelerate technical progress.\n  It is coming from Pakistan which has now launched a missile with five \ntimes greater range than their next most capable missile, and five \ntimes what the United States had given them credit for just six months \nearlier.\n  It's coming from North Korea, where the Taepo-Dong 2, capable of \nstriking Alaska and Hawaii, is nearing flight testing, and where the \nNo-Dong is now being deployed, despite the administration's assurances \nthat North Korea would never deploy that missile after only one flight \ntest.\n  It is coming from Russia, where the government appears either \ndisinclined, or incapable of controlling the flood of hardware and \ntechnical assistance flowing to rogue states around the globe.\n  It is coming from India, where this week their government exploded \nfive nuclear weapons, to the complete and admitted surprise of the \nUnited States policy-making and intelligence community.\n  It is coming from China, where the government repeatedly breaks its \nnonproliferation promises, and is then rewarded with technology \ntransfers from the U.S.\n  Despite these and other ominous examples, the United States continues \nto maintain a non-proliferation policy of self-delusion and a missile \ndefense policy of vain hope. For years, we convinced ourselves that \ndeveloping countries could not, or would not, fully develop nuclear and \nother weapons of mass destruction, or the missiles to effectively \ndeliver. Now we know they have. They continue to hope that maybe rogue \nstates will prove less clever than they have in the past, or that our \nintelligence community will prove more clever, or that our luck just \nholds out.\n  My friends, it is time to wake up. The technology to develop nuclear \nand other weapons of mass destruction is widely available. Many \nnations, some quite hostile to the U.S. now possess them and are on a \ncrash course to acquire the missiles to carry them to America. And \nthird countries, Russia and China in particular, appear happy to help. \nWeapons of mass destruction are not going away. The United States will \nsoon face this threat and it's time to prepare.\n  When the day arrives that America is handcuffed by our vulnerability \nto ballistic missile attack, when our world leadership is in question \nbecause of that vulnerability, or when--heaven help us--an attack \nactually occurs, what will we tell the American people? That we had \nhoped this would not happen? That we believed the threat was not so \nserious?\n  It should now be clear to all that our present non-proliferation and \nmissile defense policies are out-dated and insufficient. We must \nprepare now for that ``far-off storm.'' The first step in doing so is \nto pass S. 1873, the America Missile Protection Act, and commit the \nUnited States to a policy of deploying national missile defenses. I \ncommend Senator Cochran for his thoughtful leadership on this bill and \nthe many hours he has spent working as Chairman of the International \nSecurity and Proliferation Subcommittee to highlight America's \nvulnerabilities in this area.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 10 minutes to Senator Bingaman.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Thank you.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent two fellows in \nmy office, Bill Monahan and John Jennings, be given floor privileges \nduring consideration of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to join Senator Levin in \nexpressing my opposition to Senate bill 1873, the American Missile \nProtection Act. The policy expressed in this bill of putting the United \nStates in a position where we are required to deploy a national missile \ndefense system as soon as it is technologically possible I think is a \nmajor mistake and undermines our long-term security. We are rushing \nprematurely--if this legislation becomes law, we will be rushing \nprematurely to deploy a national missile defense system where that is \nnot necessary and where it could undermine our real security interests.\n  Why do I say it is not necessary? I say it is not necessary to pass \nthis legislation because we already have in place a program to develop \na national missile defense for this country. The administration is \ncommitted to the development of a national missile defense over 3 \nyears, so that by the year 2000 the United States will be positioned to \ndeploy an initial capability within 3 years after that, if it is \nwarranted by the threat. We need to continue to assess this threat as \nwe move ahead.\n  The Cochran bill, which we are considering here, seeks to commit our \ncountry to deploy the first available missile defense technology, \nnational missile defense technology, regardless of a whole variety of \nissues. Let me just discuss those briefly.\n  The first set of issues that this bill would sidestep entirely is the \nissues that we have required the Pentagon to take into account in all \nweapons systems that we develop. We have had a long history, even in \nthe time I have been here in the Senate, of developing weapons systems \nwhen we had not adequately considered the cost and we find out they are \ncosting substantially more than we committed to, where we had not \nadequately considered the performance capability of the system and we \nfind out the system doesn't work as we earlier hoped it would. And we \nhave put in place, and we have required the Department of Defense to \nput in place, procedures to assure that they keep a sensible balance in \nthe development of their weapons programs. There is a Defense \nDepartment directive, which is No. 5000.1. It sets out the Department's \nbasic guidance on weapons system acquisition. It spells out the \nregulations governing procurement and states: ``All programs need to \nstrike a sensible balance among cost, schedule, and performance \nconsiderations given affordability constraints.'' What we would be \nsaying in this legislation is that none of that is required with regard \nto this program. That would be shortsighted and would undermine our \nreal long-term security needs.\n\n  The bill threatens to exacerbate the scheduling and technical risks \nalready present in this national missile defense program. The Armed \nServices Committee, about a month ago, heard testimony from General \nLarry Welch, who is the former Chief of Staff of the Air Force. He led \na panel of experts to review U.S. missile defense programs at the \nrequest of the Pentagon. That panel found that pressures to deploy \nsystems as quickly as possible have led to very high levels of risk in \nthe test programs of THAAD, the theater high-altitude air defense \nsystem. It is a theater missile defense system, not a national missile \ndefense system. They pointed out the high levels of risk and failure in \nthat program and in other missile defense systems. This confirmed \nsimilar findings in a GAO study that Senator Levin and I requested \nearlier.\n  This Senate bill we are considering today, S. 1873, would generate \nthe same pressures to hastily field a national missile defense system \nthat have resulted in what General Welch referred to as the ``rush to \nfailure'' in the THAAD program. That program is now 4 years behind \nschedule. It is still waiting for the first intercept, as was proposed \nwhen the program was designed. They have had five unsuccessful \nintercept tests. The most recent was yesterday in my home State of New \nMexico, at White Sands Missile Range. Despite the delay in the THAAD \ndevelopment program of over a year since the previous test flights, \nthey still have not been able to have a successful test. Now, national \nmissile defense involves even more complex and technological challenges \nthat will risk failure if we rush to deploy that system as well. What \nwe need to do is to take the lessons General Welch is trying to teach \nus, by pointing to the problems in the THAAD program, and use those \nlessons to do better in the development of a national missile defense \nprogram.\n  Secretary Cohen's letter has been referred to by Senator Levin and, \nof course, the position of the Chief of the\n\n[[Page S4756]]\n\nJoint Chiefs of Staff. This is one of these cases where the Pentagon \nclearly is opposed to the legislation we are considering. Yet, we, in \nour ultimate wisdom on the Senate floor, believe that we know better \nwhat is in the national security interests of the country than do the \npeople in charge of implementing that national security policy. I think \nit is shortsighted on our part.\n  Senator Levin also pointed out that not only does this legislation \nput us in a position where we are mandating pursuit of this program, \nregardless of the various factors we believe are important in \ndeveloping of any system, but we are also pursuing it without adequate \nconsideration of the arms control implications. There is no question \nthat in this world we need to have the cooperation of the Russians in \norder to effectively limit proliferation of nuclear and other types of \nweapons of mass destruction. If we take action in this Congress and in \nthis country to abrogate the ABM Treaty at this point, it is almost a \ncertainty that the START II Treaty will not be ratified by the Duma and \nthat our ability to continue to build down the nuclear weapons arsenals \nof the two countries will be substantially impeded.\n\n  I believe it is clearly in our best interest to defeat this bill, to \nvote against cloture, and not to even proceed to full debate of this \nbill. The administration has indicated its strong opposition to the \nlegislation, as have the Pentagon and various former members of our \nnational security policy team.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that when the final vote comes here--I \ngather it will be in about 45 minutes or an hour--Senators will join in \nresisting the effort to move ahead with this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am happy to yield 5 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, first of all, I ask \nunanimous consent that Mr. Brad Lovelace, a fellow in my office, be \ngranted floor privileges throughout debate on both S. 1873 and S. 2060, \nthe fiscal year 1999 DOD authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, yesterday, India conducted \nthree underground nuclear tests, further destabilizing relations among \nPakistan, India, and China. Today, two more tests were conducted.\n  The whole world was caught by surprise--including the U.S. \nintelligence community and the Clinton administration. In fact, \nadministration officials were quoted in the Washington Times yesterday \nsaying that, ``Our overhead [satellites] saw nothing, and we had zero \nwarning.''\n  The most ominous response came from Pakistan, which recently tested \nits newest ballistic missile, with a range of 1,500 kilometers, and now \nsays it may conduct a nuclear test of its own.\n  It is against this very stark backdrop that we are today, this week, \nconsidering the American Missile Protection Act of 1998.\n  I want to commend my colleague, Senator Cochran, for his long-time \nleadership on this issue. He deserves a lot of credit. It is a very \ntimely situation, I must say.\n  S. 1873 would establish a U.S. policy of deploying a national missile \ndefense system capable of defending the territory of the United States \nagainst a limited ballistic missile attack as soon as is \ntechnologically possible. How could anyone be opposed to that? It is \nirresponsible to be opposed to it.\n  The current administration plan for ``3+3'' means that an NMD system \nwill be developed for 3 years. And when a threat is acknowledged, this \nsystem will be deployed in 3 years. It is a naive plan. It assumes that \nwe see all emerging threats and that when we see one, we can \nconfidently deploy a complex system in 3 years. It is just not \nfeasible.\n  Well, we saw how easy it was to see three nuclear devices that were \ntested by India yesterday. We didn't know about it. We didn't know they \nwere coming. Even John Pike of the Federation of American Scientists, a \nlong-time critic of missile defense, says it is ``the intelligence \nfailure of the decade.'' Mike McCurry said, ``We had no advance \nnotification of the tests.''\n\n  According to administration officials quoted in the Washington Times, \nthe United States has been ``watching this site fairly carefully and on \na fairly regular basis.'' If that is careful and regular and we don't \nknow about it, I don't know how we can possibly expect to be able to \ndeploy missiles 3 years after we know they are being produced. If we \ncan't detect in advance activities at facilities that we are watching, \nwhat is going on at facilities we don't know anything about and are not \nwatching? This is extremely dangerous policy, Mr. President.\n  How can this administration continue to believe that we will have \nadvance warning and plenty of time to respond to a missile threat when \nwe cannot even detect in advance three unanticipated nuclear tests?\n  This week's failure to predict India's nuclear tests is part of a \npattern.\n  Pakistan--in a 1997 U.S. Defense Department report on proliferation, \nPakistan was only credited with a missile that could fly 300 \nkilometers. Yet, they tested one at 1,500 kilometers. Here again, the \nUnited States was unable to predict the appearance of a new ballistic \nmissile system.\n  Iran--the DCI told the Senate a few months ago that the intelligence \ncommunity was surprised at the progress made on this Shahab-3 because \nof Iranian indigenous advances and help received from Russia.\n  The Director of Central Intelligence told the Senate that, ``Gaps and \nuncertainties preclude a good projection of when the `rest of the \nworld' countries will deploy ICBM's,'' thereby explaining why we might \nbe surprised in the future.\n  From an intelligence standpoint, there is nothing fundamentally \ndifferent between medium- and long-range missiles--nothing. We will be \njust as surprised by ICBM developments as we have been with Iran and \nPakistan's shorter-range missiles.\n  These questions and failures, combined with yesterday's events in \nIndia, completely invalidate the administration's approach to NMD. The \nfact is, we don't know where all of the threats will come from and how \nfast they will develop. It is irresponsible to stand on this floor and \noppose a policy that says we ought to produce this system when it is \ntechnologically feasible.\n  According to Tom Collina of the Union of Concerned Scientists, India \ntests were designed to ``finalize a warhead for delivery on a \nmissile.'' Mr. Collina added that ``it will not take long for India to \ntake the next steps to have a fully deployed, fielded system.''\n  Yet, the administration persists in misleading the American people, \nand in a Senate hearing on May 1 of this year, the Director of the Arms \nControl and Disarmament Agency [ACDA] stated that the Defense \nDepartment will design a system as the threat emerges, to answer that \nthreat.\n  How will the Director of ACDA know when the threat is emerging or has \nemerged?\n  Trying to deploy an NMD system in 3 years is difficult and extremely \nrisky. It requires doing everything at once--impossible to run a low \nrisk test program to make sure everything fits together first. It \nleaves no margin for failure or problems--if one thing goes wrong the \nwhole program could collapse. It is a dangerous way to approach \ndefense.\n  The events in south Asia confirm once and for all that we cannot base \nthe security of the United States on rosy assumptions about our ability \nto detect and predict existing or emerging threats around the world.\n  North Korea: In addition to the news out of south Asia, I find that \ntoday's New York Times reports that North Korea has announced they are \nsuspending their compliance with the 1994 Nuclear Freeze Agreement that \nwas intended to dismantle that country's nuclear program.\n  Who will tell the citizens of a destroyed Los Angeles or New York \nthat they were left undefended from ballistic missiles because their \nGovernment ``did not see an emerging threat''?\n  With our inability to track and detect ballistic missile development \nand nuclear tests, and the inherent challenges of fielding highly \ncomplex defense systems, we must support the\n\n[[Page S4757]]\n\nAmerican Missile Protection Act of 1998.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, with the permission of the Senator from \nMichigan, I yield myself 8 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I support the strongest possible defense against the \nmost credible threats to our Nation s security. But I do not support \nthis legislation, and I want to explain why.\n  Nearly 30 years ago, the Department of Defense spent $21 billion in \ntoday's dollars on an antiballistic missile system. It was built in my \nState of North Dakota. The military declared that antiballistic missile \nsystem operational on October 1, 1975. On October 2, 1975, the next \nday, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to close it--mothball it. \nIt was too expensive to run, and it didn't offer us much in the way of \nmore security. It wouldn't protect this country. Mr. President, $21 \nbillion for what?\n  The bill on the floor today would require us to deploy a system as \nsoon as it is technologically possible. A quarter century ago it was \ntechnologically possible to spend $21 billion and build an \nantiballistic missile site in North Dakota. That system had interceptor \nmissiles with nuclear warheads on them. That was technologically \npossible. It was completely irresponsible, but it was technologically \npossible.\n  I don't know whether this bill relates to that technology. The bill \nitself doesn't tell us what kind of technology we'd be required to \ndeploy.\n  I assume it relates to a hit-to-kill technology, where you try to hit \none bullet with another bullet. The failure on Monday of a test flight \nfor THAAD, a theater missile defense system, suggests that hit-to-kill \nis not nearly as possible as some suggest, at least not now.\n  But I would ask the question: If it was technologically possible to \ncreate an antiballistic missile system in Nekoma, ND, a quarter century \nago, it is technologically possible now, using the nuclear interceptor \napproach. Does this bill, then, require immediate deployment?\n  Let's step back a bit and look at this bill in the context of the \nsecurity threats this country faces. One threat is, indeed, a rogue \nnation, or a terrorist group, or an adversary getting an \nintercontinental ballistic missile and putting a nuclear warhead on it \nand having the wherewithal to aim it and fire it at this country. That \nis, in my judgment, a less likely threat than, for example, a terrorist \ngroup or a rogue nation getting a suitcase-sized nuclear device, \nputting it in the rusty trunk of a Yugo, parked on a New York City \ndock, and saying, ``By the way, we now threaten the United States of \nAmerica with a nuclear device.''\n  The threat of a truck bomb or suitcase bomb, is that addressed by \nthis bill's requirement to deploy a national missile defense system? \nNo, this system doesn't defend us against that. How about a chemical \nweapon attack in the United States? No, this wouldn't defend us against \na chemical weapons attack. A biological weapon attack here? No. A \ncruise missile attack, which is far more likely than an ICBM--a cruise \nmissile attack? Cruise missiles are proliferating all around the world. \nPutting a nuclear device on the tip of a cruise missile and aiming at \nthis country, would this bill defend us against that? No. It wouldn't \ndefend us against that threat, either. A bomber attack, dropping a \nnuclear bomb? No. Loose nuclear weapons inside the old Soviet Union \nthat must be controlled and we must be concerned about, does this deal \nwith that? No.\n  Obviously, this bill deals with one threat. And it is probably the \nless likely threat--an ICBM with a nuclear warhead aimed at this \ncountry by a rogue nation or by a terrorist group.\n  But this bill tells us to deploy as soon as technologically \npossible--notwithstanding cost, whatever the cost. No matter that the \ncost estimates from the Congressional Budget Office range up to nearly \n$200 billion to construct and maintain a national missile defense \nsystem. Cost is not relevant here, according to this bill. It requires \nus to deploy when technologically possible.\n\n  This bill also requires us to deploy notwithstanding the impact on \narms control. The fact is that strategic weapons are being destroyed, \nnuclear weapons are being destroyed. Different systems are being \ndestroyed today in the Soviet Union as a result of arms control: arms \ncontrol has destroyed 4,700 nuclear warheads; destroyed 293 ICBMs and \n252 ICBM silos; cut the wings off of 37 former Soviet bombers; \neliminated 80 submarine missile launch tubes; and sealed 95 nuclear \nwarhead test tunnels.\n  That is an awfully good way to meet the threat--destroy the missile \nbefore it leaves the ground. Arms control is giving us missile defense \nthat works right now.\n  I have shown my colleagues this before, and with permission I will do \nit again. This is a piece of metal from a silo in Pervomaisk, Ukraine. \nThe silo held a Soviet missile aimed at the United States of America. \nThere is no missile there anymore. The warhead is gone. The missile is \ngone. The silo is destroyed. And where this piece of metal used to be, \nin a silo holding a missile aimed at this country, there are now \nsunflowers planted. Not the missile--sunflowers. How did that happen? \nBy accident? No. By arms control agreements, by treaties.\n  But this bill says, deploy a national missile defense system \nnotwithstanding what it might mean to our treaties, notwithstanding \nwhat it might mean to future arms control agreements, notwithstanding \nwhat it might mean to arms reductions that occur now under the Nunn-\nLugar money that we appropriate, which has resulted in sawing off \nbombers' wings, resulted in digging up missiles buried in the soil of \nUkraine and Russia.\n  I just do not understand the rationale here. How can we get this \nnotion of defending against a small part of the threats our country \nfaces? This bill doesn't address the cruise missile threat, or the \nsuitcase bomb threat, or a range of other threats. It just tries to \naddress this sliver of threat.\n  And this bill requires us to deploy a system as soon as \ntechnologically possible notwithstanding any other consideration, \nnotwithstanding how much money we are going to ask the taxpayer to pay, \nnotwithstanding what the credible threat is at the moment, \nnotwithstanding the impact on arms control agreements. I just do not \nunderstand that logic.\n  I must say I have the greatest respect for the author of this \nlegislation. I think he is a wonderful legislator. I hate to oppose him \non this, but I just feel very strongly that we should continue with the \nnational missile defense research program. I might add that the \nAdministration is seeking over $900 million for research funding for \nthis program this coming year. We should continue that aggressive \nresearch.\n  We ought to continue working on a range of defense mechanisms to deal \nwith threats, not just ICBMs, but cruise missile threats and a range of \nother threats, including the terrorist threat of a suitcase nuclear \ndevice in this country. But we ought not decide that one of those \nthreats ought to be addressed at the expense of defending against other \nthreats.\n  Mr. President, let me make one final point. I have told this story \ntwice before on this floor because I think it is important for people \nto understand what is being done in the area of arms control and \nmissile defense right now--not what is proposed to be done in this \nbill.\n  On December 3 of last year, in the dark hours of the early morning, \nnorth of Norway in the Barents Sea, several Russian antiballistic \nsubmarines surfaced and prepared to fire SS-20 missiles. Each of these \nmissiles can carry 10 nuclear warheads and travel 5,000 miles, and can \nreach the United States from the Barents Sea.\n  Those submarines, last December 3, launched 20 missiles that soared \nskyward, and all of our alert systems knew it and saw them immediately \nand tracked them at Cheyenne Mountain, NORAD, you name it.\n  And in a few moments at 30,000 feet all of those missiles exploded.\n  Why? Because this was not a Russian missile attack on the United \nStates. In fact, seven American weapons inspectors were watching the \nsubmarines from a nearby ship. These self-destruct launches were a \nquick and inexpensive way for Russia to destroy submarine-launched \nballistic missiles, which it was required to do under our START I arms \nreduction treaty.\n\n[[Page S4758]]\n\n  On the morning of December 3 of last year when, at 30,000 feet, those \nRussian missiles exploded, it was not an accident. And it was not a \nthreat to our country. It was a result of arms control agreements that \nsaid we must reduce the threat of nuclear weapons, we must reduce \ndelivery systems. The fact is, the Nunn-Lugar program, which we fund \neach year in order to further these arms reductions, is working.\n  We also should, as we make certain Nunn-Lugar continues, be concerned \nabout the ABM Treaty, be concerned about a range of other threats, and \nwe ought to invest money in research and development on the ballistic \nmissile defense system.\n  But we ought not under any set of circumstances say a system here \nmust be deployed no matter what its cost, no matter what the threat and \nno matter what its consequences to arms control agreements. That is not \nin this country's interests. That is not in the taxpayers' interests.\n  Does our country need to worry about the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons? Of course we do. The nuclear tests by India in just the last 2 \ndays demonstrate once again that we have a serious problem in this \nworld with respect to the proliferation of nuclear devices.\n  But what it ought to tell us is that we need to be very, very \naggressive as a Nation to lead in the area of nonproliferation. We need \nto make certain that this club that possesses nuclear weapons on this \nEarth does not expand. We need to do everything we possibly can do in \nforeign policy to try to see that our children and grandchildren are \nnot victims of the proliferation, wide proliferation of nuclear weapons \nthat then hold the rest of the world hostage.\n  But in dealing with the various threats we face, it seems to me the \nquestion for all of us is what kind of threats exist? And what kind of \ncredible defense that is both technologically possible and financially \nreasonable can be constructed to respond to those threats? This bill is \nnot the answer to those questions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am happy to yield 5 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. President, the administration's position on defending the \nAmerican people is essentially twofold: One, wait until there is a \nthreat; and, two, we will then develop a defense. There are two things \nwrong with this approach: First, as the Indian nuclear testing has just \ndemonstrated to us, we won't necessarily know when there is a threat. \nIn fact, we always seem to underestimate the threat. Secondly, it \nalways seems to take longer than we anticipate to develop complex \nsystems, and this is particularly true with respect to missile \ndefenses.\n  So the legislation introduced by the Senator from Mississippi is a \nmuch better idea, to protect the American people, Mr. President. It \nsimply says that it is our policy to deploy a national missile defense \nas soon as it is technologically possible.\n  Now, what could be more straightforward and more protective for the \nAmerican people? The American people demand no less.\n  I would note that the argument of the Senator from North Dakota just \na moment ago illustrates, I believe, the lack of ideas to oppose this \nsimple legislation of the Senator from Mississippi. His primary \nargument was that we need to continue research because, after all, \nthere are other threats, too, like the suitcase bomb. Of course, there \nare other threats. And our position has always been to prepare to \ndefend against all of the threats but not to ignore one very big threat \njust because there are other threats as well.\n  There have been other charges that the adoption of the American \nMissile Protection Act is somehow going to wreck arms agreements that \nthe United States has entered into. First, there is the complaint about \nthe ABM Treaty that we heard which is particularly puzzling since the \nwords, ABM Treaty don't appear anywhere in this legislation. The bill \ndoesn't require any violation of the ABM Treaty as a matter of fact. It \ndoesn't specify the number of sites, where they would be, or what kind \nof interceptors or missiles we would have. So that argument is \nspecious.\n  Secondly, we have heard the argument that if the United States \ndecides to deploy an NMD even against limited threats, the Russians \nwill refuse to ratify START II or negotiate START III. How many times \ndo we have to pay for START II? I count about eight different things \nthat the Russians have said we have to do in order for them to ratify \nSTART II or fully implement START I or START II. And we could list \nthose but I am going to put them in the Record.\n  The point is the United States needs to take its defense into its own \nhands. We cannot simply rely upon a piece of paper with another \ncountry, particularly where in the case of, first, the Soviet Union, \nand now Russia, after that piece of paper is signed--and remember we \nare putting our safety in the hands of people across the sea who have \nsigned that piece of paper with us--we find that they have changed \ntheir mind and tell us that they can't implement that piece of paper \nuntil we do other things.\n  First of all, it was that we had to address concerns regarding NATO \nexpansion and then the CFE Treaty had to be modified. Then they could \nnot afford to dismantle their weapons, and on and on and on. The point \nhere is we should not place our reliance upon pieces of paper signed \nwith other countries but upon what we can do for ourselves to protect \nthe American people.\n  We heard the argument that the United States must refrain from \nexercising our rights under the ABM Treaty to deploy even a limited \nmissile defense lest we upset the Russians, the same Russians who \noperate the world's only current ABM system. Should we take from this \nsuggestion that the Russians have a right not only to defend themselves \nbut to insist that we do not? And yet that is precisely what the \nopponents of this legislation are saying.\n  Mr. President, the defense of America should not be subject to a \nRussian veto. Linking the deployment of national missile defenses to \nsome hoped-for arms control agreement is to be expected from the \nRussians, but it is unconscionable to be offered by Representatives of \nthis Congress. Arms control for the sake of arms control is not in the \nnational interest, and the Constitution does not allow us to substitute \npieces of paper for the real measures which must be taken to protect \nAmerica.\n  Then there is an argument that committing to deploy an ABM system \nwill cause the sky to fall on offensive arms control agreements. Let me \nquote the Senator from Michigan on this issue:\n\n       Nothing in this bill says that the national missile defense \n     system that it commits us to deploy will be compliant with \n     the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. That is a treaty, a solemn \n     agreement between us and Russia. If we threaten to break out \n     of that treaty unilaterally, we threaten the security of this \n     Nation because that treaty permits Russia to ratify the START \n     II agreement and to negotiate a START III agreement, reducing \n     the number of warheads that they have on their missiles and \n     warheads that could also potentially proliferate around the \n     world and threaten any number of places, including us.\n\n  This statement is incorrect in several ways. First, the ABM Treaty is \nnot a ``solemn agreement between us and Russia.'' The ABM Treaty was \nsigned by the United States and the Soviet Union. That country no \nlonger exists, and the administration spent four years in negotiations \nto see who would replace the Soviet Union as parties to that treaty. \nThe President has certified that he will submit the results of those \nnegotiations to the Senate for advice and consent. When and if the \nSenate agrees, then the ABM Treaty may become ``a solemn agreement \nbetween us and Russia,'' but not until then.\n  Second, S. 1873 does not require ``break out'' from the ABM treaty. \nIn fact, as I have already pointed out, it allows for deployment of \nexactly the system being developed under the administration's so-called \n3+3 program. And there is nothing in any legislation that calls for \nthat system to be treaty compliant. To the contrary, a non-compliant \nsystem is explicitly contemplated by the Defense Department. Here is \nwhat the Department of Defense said about its 3+3 program in the \nSecretary's 1998 report to Congress: ``a\n\n[[Page S4759]]\n\ndeployed NMD system either could be compliant with the ABM Treaty as \nwritten, or might require amendment of the treaty's provisions.'' So \naccording to the Secretary of Defense, the system DoD is developing now \nmay not comply with the ABM treaty. And so this arms control argument \nis nothing but a strawman, erected to be knocked down though it bears \nno resemblance to anything in this bill.\n  Senator Levin cites as an authority for this odd proposition, the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who, in a letter commenting on \nS. 1873, said the bill doesn't consider ``the impact a deployment would \nhave on arms control agreements and nuclear arms reductions.'' Let's \nthink about what General Shelton is saying here. The United States has \na right to deploy a national missile defense system under the ABM \nTreaty, and S. 1873 merely calls for a commitment to exercise that \nright. But General Shelton is saying that our decision to exercise that \nright should be conditioned on the possible impact a deployment would \nhave on future arms control agreements, meaning, presumably, Russian \nobjections. So General Shelton is saying that our right to deploy a \nsystem to protect our citizens--even the severely constrained right \nembodied in the ABM treaty--should be subject to further negotiation \nwith, and the approval of, the Russian Federation.\n  I would find this an extraordinary argument under any circumstances, \nand extraordinarily disturbing coming from the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff. It can't be comforting to the people of the United \nStates to know that their Chairman believes their defense should be \nsubject to the veto of the Russians. When one considers that the \nRussians have exercised their right to defend themselves with the only \noperational ABM system in the world, the position of the Chairman \nbecomes downright bizarre.\n  The complaints about arms control from opponents of the Cochran-\nInouye bill are without merit. They spring from this administration's \ninfatuation with paper agreements, no matter how disconnected from \nreality those agreements may be. We have a paper arms control agreement \ncalled START I, which the Russians are routinely violating. We have \nSTART II, which was negotiated, then renegotiated to give the Russians \na better deal, and still it lies before the Duma unratified. Yet \nopponents of this bill would have the United States forego the defense \nof its people against a threat wholly unrelated to any of these \nagreements, simply because they fear the Russians will insist upon it.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support S. 1873, the American \nMissile Protection Act. This is a simple bill which merely states that \ndue to the increasing ballistic missile threat we face, ``It is the \npolicy of the United States to deploy as soon as is technologically \npossible an effective National Missile Defense system capable of \ndefending the territory of the United States against limited ballistic \nmissile attack (whether accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate).'' \nOutside of the title and findings of the legislation, this is the only \nsentence in the bill.\n  As a matter of fact, S. 1873 is noteworthy for the things it does not \nsay. The bill does not say what kind of system architecture the missile \ndefense system should have. It does not say where such a system should \nbe located, or more generally, whether it should be based on land, at \nsea, or in space. It does not specify a date by which such a system \nshould be deployed, or when we believe specific missile threats to the \nUnited States will materialize.\n  And the bill is silent on arms control issues. It does not address \nwhether continued adherence to the ABM Treaty is in the best interests \nof the United States or whether the treaty should be modified. Nor does \nthe bill discuss the merits of any future arms control agreements. All \nof these issues will have to be debated another day. I am disappointed, \nhowever, that we are still debating whether the United States should \ndeploy a national missile defense system at some point in the future.\n\n\n                               The Threat\n\n  The ballistic missile threat facing the U.S. is real and growing. \nRussia and China already have ballistic missiles capable of reaching \nour shores and several other nations, including North Korea and Iran \nare developing missiles with increasing ranges.\n\n\n                                 China\n\n  In November 1997, the Defense Department published a report titled, \nProliferation: Threat and Response in which it said China already has \nover 100 nuclear warheads deployed operationally on ballistic missiles. \nAccording to this report, Beijing has ``embarked on a ballistic missile \nmodernization program,'' and ``while adding more missiles and launchers \nto its inventory, [is] concentrating on replacing liquid-propellant \nmissiles with mobile solid-propellant missiles, reflecting concerns for \nsurvivability, maintenance, and reliability.''\n  Details about this modernization program have been published in the \npress. The Washington Times reported on May 23, 1997, that a new \nChinese road-mobile ICBM, called the Dong Feng-31, is in the late \nstages of development and may be deployed around the year 2000. This \nmissile's 8,000 kilometer range is sufficient to reach the entire U.S. \nWest Coast and several Rocky Mountain states and it will reportedly \nutilize re-entry vehicle decoys, complicating missile defense. China is \nalso developing the JL-2 SLBM with a 7,300 kilometer range, according \nto Defense Week. That publication reported last April that the JL-2 is \nlikely to be deployed by the year 2007 and will allow China to target \nthe U.S. from operating areas near the Chinese coast. And finally, on \nMay 1st, the Washington Times disclosed that a Top Secret CIA report \nindicated 13 of China's 18 nuclear-tipped CSS-4 ICBM's are targeted at \nAmerican cities. These missiles are reportedly being improved as well, \nwith the addition of upgraded guidance systems.\n  In addition to its modernization efforts, I am also concerned that \nBeijing has shown a willingness to use ballistic missiles to intimidate \nits neighbors. For example, during Taiwan's national legislative \nelections in 1995, China fired six M-9 ballistic missiles to an area \nabout 160 kilometers north of the island. Less than a year later, on \nthe eve of Taiwan's first democratic presidential election, China again \nlaunched M-9 missiles to areas within 50 kilometers north and south of \nthe island, establishing a virtual blockade of Taiwan's two primary \nports.\n\n\n                                 Russia\n\n  Russia retains over 6,000 strategic nuclear warheads, which still \npose the greatest threat to our nation. While we do not believe Russia \nhas hostile intentions, we must be cautious because its evolution is \nincomplete. For example, Russia is continuing to modernize its \nstrategic nuclear forces. According to the Washington Times, Russian \nR spending on strategic weapons has soared nearly six-fold over the \npast three years and Moscow is developing an upgraded version of the \nSS-25 ICBM, as well as a new strategic nuclear submarine armed with a \nnew nuclear-tipped SLBM.\n  At the same time Russia is spending precious resources on its \nmodernization effort, its nuclear command and control complex continues \nto deteriorate. Although unlikely, the threat of an unauthorized or \naccidental launch of a Russian ICBM has increased in recent years as \nRussia's armed forces have undergone difficult changes. For example, \nlast March the Wall Street Journal reported that, according to Russian \ncolonel who spent much of his 33 year career in the Strategic Rocket \nForces, Russian nuclear command and control equipment began breaking \ndown 10 years ago and on several occasions parts of system \nspontaneously went into ``combat mode.'' Even more troubling were \ncomments made by Russian Defense Minister Rodionov last February, who \nin a departure from previous assurances that Moscow's nuclear forces \nwere under tight control stated, ``Today, no one can guarantee the \nreliability of our systems of control . . . Russia might soon reach the \nthreshold beyond which its rockets and nuclear systems cannot be \ncontrolled.''\n\n\n                             Rogue Nations\n\n  Although Russia and China are the only countries that currently \npossess missiles capable of reaching the United States, several rogue \nstates such as North Korea and Iran are aggressively developing long-\nrange ballistic missiles.\n\n\n                              North Korea\n\n  According to the Defense Department's November report, since its \nmissile program began in the early 1980's,\n\n[[Page S4760]]\n\n``North Korea has pursued an aggressive program which has steadily \nprogressed from producing and exporting Scud short range ballistic \nmissiles (SRBMs) to work on development of medium and long range \nmissiles.'' North Korea has deployed several hundred Scud B and C \nmissiles with sufficient range to target all of South Korea, and has \ncompleted development of the 1,000 kilometer range No Dong MRBM, which \ncan reach targets in nearly all of Japan, according to the report. In \naddition, recent press reports indicate North Korea has begun deploying \nthe No Dong missile.\n\n  More ominously, North Korea is developing the Taepo Dong 1 missile \nwith an estimated range of 2,000 kilometers which will be capable of \nstriking U.S. military bases in Guam and the Taepo Dong 2 missile, with \nan estimated range of 4,000 to 6,000 kilometers that could reach Alaska \nand Hawaii. On April 27th, the Washington Post reported that \ndevelopment of the Taepo Dong 2 missile could be completed ``within the \nnext several years.''\n\n\n                                  Iran\n\n  Iran has an ambitious missile program and is currently capable of \nproducing both the 300 kilometer range Scud B and the 500 kilometer \nrange Scud C missiles. This program is becoming increasingly advanced \nand less vulnerable to supply disruptions. As the Defense Department \nsaid in its November 1997 report, ``Iran has made significant progress \nin the last few years toward its goal of becoming self-sufficient in \nballistic missile production.''\n  Tehran has made particularly rapid progress over the past year, \nhowever, due to the infusion of Russian hardware and know-how which has \nsignificantly accelerated the pace of the Iranian program. This Russian \nassistance has been well documented in the press.\n  According to these reports, numerous institutes and companies that \nonce were an integral part of the state-owned military complex of the \nformer Soviet Union have provided a variety of equipment and material \nthat can be used to design and manufacture ballistic missiles. They are \nalso helping Iran develop two new ballistic missiles, the Shahab-3 and \nShahab-4. The Shahab-3 is reportedly based on North Korea's No Dong \nballistic missile and will have a range of 1,300 kilometers with a 700 \nkilogram payload, sufficient to target Israel and U.S. forces in the \nregion. Seven months ago, on September 18, 1997, Assistant Secretary of \nState for Near Eastern Affairs Martin Indyk testified to the Senate \nthat Iran could complete development of the Shahab-3 in as little as 12 \nto 18 months.\n  The Shahab-4 is reportedly based on the Russian SS-4 medium-range \nballistic missile and will have a range of 2,000 kilometers with a \npayload over 1,000 kilograms. When completed, the Shahab-4's longer \nrange will enable Tehran to reach targets as far away as Central \nEurope. According to the Washington Times, an Israeli intelligence \nreport indicates the Shahab-4 could be completed in as little as three \nyears. Israeli intelligence sources reportedly also told Defense News \nthat the long-term goals of Iran's missile program are to develop \nmissiles with ranges of 4,500 and 10,000 kilometers. The latter missile \ncould reach the East Coast of the United States.\n\n\n                             Other Nations\n\n  In addition to North Korea and Iran, roughly two dozen other \ncountries, including Iraq and Libya either possess or are developing \nballistic missiles. The clear trend in these missile programs is toward \nsystems with greater ranges, and as Iran has demonstrated, foreign \nassistance can greatly reduce the time needed to develop a new missile.\n\n\n                    Responding to the missile threat\n\n  The time has come for the United States to defend itself from the \nincreasing missile threat that I have just described. The Cochran bill \nis the first step on this path.\n  Some opponents of the bill have pointed to the Administration's so-\ncalled ``3+3'' program as a better way to deal with the missile threat. \nI have grave concerns about the basic premise of the ``3+3'' program, \nwhich essentially states that the United States should continue to \nexperiment with a variety of missile defense technologies indefinitely, \nand then, at some time after the year 2000, deploy an NMD system within \nthree years. It is significant that the ``3+3'' program is the only \nMajor Defense Acquisition Program that takes this wait-and-see approach \nand assumes a deployment can occur within three years of a decision to \ndeploy.\n  The development of a complex weapons system, such as a new fighter \naircraft or an NMD system can be technically challenging, which is why \nwe structure development programs with clear goals and milestones. We \ndo not continue to tinker indefinitely with the technology needed for \nthe F-22, which will be the next-generation fighter aircraft for the \nAir Force, or the technology for the next version of the M-1 Abrams \ntank until some future date awaiting a decision to deploy. Why should \nwe adopt this approach for national missile defense?\n  Studies on the ``3+3'' program have faulted the Administration's plan \nand its execution. For example, a recent study chaired by retired Air \nForce General Larry Welch criticized the ``3+3'' program stating that a \nsuccessful NMD program should have ``a clear set of requirements, \nconsistent resource support (which includes an adequate number of test \nassets), well-defined milestones, and a rigorous test plan. The study \ngroup believes that the current NMD program is not characterized by \nthese features and is on a high-risk vector.''\n  Last December, the GAO published a study that also was critical of \nthe ``3+3'' program due to its high risk and its acquisition schedule, \nwhich the study said was half as long as that for America's Safeguard \nnational missile defense system that was developed between 1963 and \n1975 and deployed at Grand Forks, North Dakota. The GAO stated that the \nacquisition schedule for the ``3+3'' program was ``shorter than the \naverage time projected to acquire and field 59 other major weapon \nsystems that we examined\" and went on to note, ``these systems are \nprojected to take an average of just under 10 years from the beginning \nof their development until they reach an initial operating capability \ndate.''\n  Mr. President, the general approach underlying the ``3+3'' program is \nflawed and due to the delays the program has already encountered I do \nnot think we should stake our future on the premise that the system can \nbe fielded within three years after a decision to deploy. As the GAO \nsaid in its study, ``Since the 3+3 program was approved, BMDO [the \nBallistic Missile Defense Organization] has experienced a 7-month delay \nin establishing the joint program office to manage the acquisition and \na 6-month delay in awarding concept definition contracts leading to the \nselection of a prime contractor. Also, a sensor flight-test failure \nresulted in a 6-month testing delay.''\n  As my colleagues know all too well, unfortunately, it is not uncommon \nfor U.S. weapons development programs to experience delays. For \nexample, despite the best efforts of the Congress and the \nAdministration to quickly field the THAAD theater missile defense \nsystem, that program is currently projected to reach its first unit \nequipped milestone 13 years after development began. Experience tells \nus that we cannot keep national missile defense technology in a \ncircling pattern and expect to snap our fingers and successfully move \nto deployment in a very short period of time. Nothing in our history \nsuggests this is a sensible approach.\n  Mr. President, we need to get on with the task of constructing an \neffective missile defense system to protect the American people. Like \nother Senators, I have strong views on the disadvantages of the ABM \nTreaty and other related missile defense issues, but unfortunately \nthose debates will have to wait for another day. The United States \ngovernment has a fundamental obligation to provide for our citizens \ndefense. The bill offered by Senator Cochran will help ensure that we \nfulfill this obligation, by committing us to deploying a defense \nagainst the growing ballistic missile threat we face. I urge my \ncolleagues to support its passage.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in the early hours yesterday morning on the \nNew Mexican desert, there was an event that brought home in a very \npractical way one of the series of considered arguments made against \nthe legislation the Senate is considering this morning.\n  The Army Missile Command, the prime contractor, and dozens of \nsubcontractors had been painstakingly\n\n[[Page S4761]]\n\npreparing for the fifth intercept test of the Theater High Altitude \nArea Defense, or THAAD, theater missile defense system. No effort was \nspared in these preparations, because program officials and Department \nof Defense officials acknowledged openly that this would be widely \nviewed as a ``make or break'' test for the system following its \nunfortunate string of previous intercept failures.\n  To the dismay of all involved, this fifth test, too, was a failure.\n  Mr. President, we nominally are debating a different matter this \nmorning. The bill before the Senate involves an immediate decision to \nabandon the so-called ``3 plus 3'' strategy for national missile \ndefense and establish a policy to move as rapidly as possible not only \nto develop an effective national missile defense technology, but to \ndeploy such a system at the earliest possible time. But the White Sands \ntest yesterday morning should be hoisting another red flag for the \nSenate to consider as we vote on this bill.\n  I take a back seat to no one in my support for development of \neffective missile defense technology. I have a strong record of support \nfor developing and fielding theater missile defense systems, for the \nprotection of our ground forces, our naval forces, and other national \ninterests in theater. We know--and we hear and read on virtually a \ndaily basis--of the efforts underway in a number of nations to develop \never more capable short range ballistic missiles capable of carrying \nweapons of mass destruction, nuclear, chemical, or biological. Missiles \nof this type have been used previously. This threat is real, it is \nimmediate, and it is substantial.\n  But this legislation, Mr. President, does not address either of these \nkey policy matters. We have in place an established policy to develop \nand field as rapidly as possible theater missile defense systems. The \nAdministration and the Congress have increased the funding for this \neffort again and again. We have in place an established policy to \ndevelop and perfect as rapidly as possible the technology that would be \nnecessary for a national missile defense system, and to bring that \neffort to a stage where, in three years from a green light, it could be \nfielded and operational.\n\n  As has occurred not infrequently in the course of human history, our \naspirations are getting ahead of our scientific expertise and our \nability to manipulate the laws of physics to accomplish our objectives. \nSome may mistakenly believe, Mr. President, that developing effective \nanti-missile technology is a simple proposition, and that wishing for \nit is to obtain it. Unfortunately that is not the case. To grossly \noversimplify this, this is a task of spotting a warhead, or fragments \nof a warhead, hundreds if not thousands of miles away, and while it \nmoves at several thousand miles per hour, determining which is the real \ntarget, launching another missile in its direction, guiding that \nmissile also traveling at hypersonic speed to a collision point in the \ngreat expanse just inside or outside of the upper reaches of the \nearth's atmosphere, and precisely maneuvering the interceptor to \ncollide with the warhead.\n  It should be self evident that this is a daunting challenge, given \nthat billions of dollars, thousands of hours of the most capable \nscientists and program managers our military and private sector can \nfocus on this task, and the most advanced equipment and technology \nmoney can buy have produced five successive failures in the THAAD \nprogram.\n  Those who have spoken before me today have identified a host of \nreasons why we should not rush to judgment today to decide we will \nspend somewhere between $30 and $60 billion to deploy a national \nmissile defense system that has neither been developed nor proven. If \nthe Senate moves to proceed to the consideration of this legislation, I \nexpect to have something to say about many of those other \nconsiderations.\n  But at this moment, I want to mention to the Senate only two of those \nconsiderations. The first is that it would be irresponsible to make a \ndecision of this magnitude--which might cost U.S. taxpayers upwards of \n$50 billion--before the Senate knows that there is a workable \ntechnology. That is even more irresponsible in my judgment when one \nlooks at the intelligence estimates of the ballistic missile threat \nthat faces the U.S. The simple truth, Mr. President, is that only \nRussia and China have such missiles, and despite the fact that some \nrogue nations such as North Korea have been working to develop more \nadvanced ballistic missiles, our intelligence and military leaders do \nnot expect those threats to materialize for a decade or more.\n\n  Let me reiterate, Mr. President, that the choice the Senate will make \ntoday is not about whether we should make a herculean effort to develop \nanti-missile technology. We are doing that and spending multi-billions \nof dollars to do it as rapidly and well as our best minds can do so. \nThe vote today will not alter that mission or our commitment to it.\n  The vote today is about whether--at a time before a real ballistic \nmissile threat from sources other than Russia and China exists, at a \ntime before we perfect the anti-missile technology on which we have \nbeen energetically working for years so that we know it is ready to be \ndeployed--we will make a national commitment of scores of billions of \ndollars to field the nonexistent system against nonexistent threats.\n  That, Mr. President, would be an unwise decision of great magnitude, \nparticularly at a time when we face very real threats to our national \nsecurity and when we are struggling to provide the resources to ensure \nour military and intelligence capabilities are both appropriate and \nadequate to address those threats. It also ignores the possibility that \nwe will rush pell mell to deploy a national missile defense system \nbased on today's technology when, if we delay the deployment decision \nuntil we believe a real threat is looming, we can then deploy the \nlatest technology--the most reliable technology then available--to meet \nthe threat.\n  The urgency that the bill's proponents are voicing is a false \nurgency, Mr. President. I hope the Senate will look at this carefully \nand will choose the prudent course by rejecting the bill before us.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today as a co-sponsor and supporter \nof S. 1873, The American Missile Protection Act of 1998. This important \nlegislation will remove present barriers to the deployment of an \neffective, reliable missile defense system, so that our citizens will \nbe free from the threat of an attack by missiles launched from across \noceans. Prudence demands that we deploy a domestic missile defense \nsystem as soon as we possess the technology to do so.\n  Missile technology developed during the Cold War has forever \nneutralized what was once our greatest domestic security asset--\ndistance. As a result, today many of our citizens have never known a \nworld in which nuclear missiles were not pointed at their families.\n  It is unconscionable that now, after years of being in the shadow of \nnuclear threat, the most powerful nation in the world still cannot \ndefend its own soil against even one ballistic missile attack.\n  In the post-Cold War era, a multiple array of new threats exist. Not \nonly do we still face the possibility of accidental launch from a \nnuclear state--a possibility not without precedent--but now the \nproliferation of missile components and technology compounds the threat \nbeyond even Cold War-levels. The capability of a rogue state to bypass \nyears of development by clandestinely obtaining nuclear, chemical, and \nbiological materials and long-range ballistic missile technology poses \na new, more sinister threat. Procurement by rogue nations--especially \nby those who have a demonstrated desire to use force outside their own \nborders--cripples our ability to calculate emerging strategic threats \nwith any degree of certainty.\n  Just as a policy of total vulnerability will no longer suffice, \nneither will a policy characterized by the ``gaps and uncertainty'' due \nto the underestimation of the technological capabilities of states like \nNorth Korea, Iran, Iraq, China, and now India.\n  Refusing to implement a National Missile Defense system as soon as it \nis technologically possible will render Americans vulnerable to the \nwhims of any rogue regime that manages to procure ICBM technology.\n  Bearing in mind that this bill itself violates no treaties, nor seeks \nto mandate the particulars of implementing a\n\n[[Page S4762]]\n\nmissile defense system, S. 1873 is important bipartisan legislation \nthat should be passed. By eliminating a dependence on underestimated \ncapabilities, this bill is a decisive affirmation that our country is \nindeed committed to ensuring the security of the American people.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support S. 1873.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1873, the \nAmerican Missile Protection Act. This bill is simple; but extremely \nimportant. It makes it clear that it is the policy of the United States \nto deploy, as soon as technologically possible, a national missile \ndefense system which is capable of defending the entire territory of \nthe United States against limited ballistic missile attack.\n  Alaskans have been justifiably concerned with this issue for some \ntime. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at this \ntime a resolution passed by the Alaska State Legislature which calls on \nthe Administration to include Alaska and Hawaii in all future \nassessments of the threat of a ballistic missile attack on the United \nStates. More than 20% of our domestic oil comes from Alaska, all of it \nthrough the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. Alaskans are concerned, as should \nthe rest of the country be concerned, that a strike at the pipeline \ncould have dire consequences to our domestic energy production.\n  There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Legislative Resolve No. 36\n\n       Whereas Alaska is the 49th state to enter the federal union \n     of the United States of America and is entitled to all of the \n     rights, privileges, and obligations that the union affords \n     and requires; and\n       Whereas Alaska possesses natural resources, including \n     energy, mineral, and human resources, vital to the prosperity \n     and national security of the United States; and\n       Whereas the people of Alaska are conscious of the state's \n     remote northern location and proximity to Northeast Asia and \n     the Eurasian land mass, and of how that unique location \n     places the state in a more vulnerable position than other \n     states with regard to missiles that could be launched in Asia \n     and Europe; and\n       Whereas the people of Alaska recognize the changing nature \n     of the international political structure and the evolution \n     and proliferation of missile delivery systems and weapons of \n     mass destruction as foreign states seek the military means to \n     deter the power of the United States in international \n     affairs; and\n       Whereas there is a growing threat to Alaska by potential \n     aggressors in these nations and in rogue nations that are \n     seeking nuclear weapons capability and that have sponsored \n     international terrorism; and\n       Whereas a National Intelligence Estimate to assess missile \n     threats to the United States left Alaska and Hawaii out of \n     the assessment and estimate; and\n       Whereas one of the primary reasons for joining the Union of \n     the United States of America was to gain security for the \n     people of Alaska and for the common regulation of foreign \n     affairs on the basis of an equitable membership in the United \n     States federation; and\n       Whereas the United States plans to field a national missile \n     defense, perhaps as early as 2003; this national missile \n     defense plan will provide only a fragile defense for Alaska, \n     the state most likely to be threatened by new missile powers \n     that are emerging in Northeast Asia;\n       Be it Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature \n     respectfully requests the President of the United States to \n     take all actions necessary, within the considerable limits of \n     the resources of the United States, to protect on an equal \n     basis all peoples and resources of this great Union from \n     threat of missile attack regardless of the physical location \n     of the member state; and be it\n       Further Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature \n     respectfully requests that Alaska be included in every \n     National Intelligence Estimate conducted by the United States \n     joint intelligence agencies; and be it\n       Further Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature \n     respectfully requests the President of the United States to \n     include Alaska and Hawaii, not just the contiguous 48 states, \n     in every National Intelligence Estimate of missile threat to \n     the United States; and be it\n       Further Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature urges \n     the United States government to take necessary measures to \n     ensure that Alaska is protected against foreseeable threats, \n     nuclear and otherwise, posed by foreign aggressors, including \n     deployment of a ballistic missile defense system to protect \n     Alaska; and be it\n       Further Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature conveys \n     to the President of the United States expectations that \n     Alaska's safety and security take priority over any \n     international treaty or obligation and that the President \n     take whatever action is necessary to ensure that Alaska can \n     be defended against limited missile attacks with the same \n     degree of assurance as that provided to all other states; and \n     be it\n       Further Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature \n     respectfully requests that the appropriate Congressional \n     committees hold hearings in Alaska that include defense \n     experts and administration officials to help Alaskans \n     understand their risks, their level of security, and Alaska's \n     vulnerability.\n       Copies of this resolution shall be sent to the Honorable \n     Bill Clinton, President of the United States; the Honorable \n     Al Gore, Jr., Vice-President of the United States and \n     President of the U.S. Senate; the Honorable Newt Gingrich, \n     Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives; the Honorable \n     Ted Stevens, Chair of the U.S. Senate Committee on \n     Appropriations; the Honorable Bob Livingston, Chair of the \n     U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations; \n     the Honorable Strom Thurmond, Chair of the U.S. Senate \n     Committee on Armed Services; the Honorable Floyd Spence, \n     Chair of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on \n     National Security; and to the Honorable Frank Murkowski, U.S. \n     Senator, and the Honorable Don Young, U.S. Representative, \n     members of the Alaska delegation in Congress.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, last year North Korean defectors \nindicated that the North Korean missile development program already \nposes a verifiable threat to American forces in Okinawa and seems on \ntrack to threaten parts of Alaska by the turn of the Century. The \nTaepodong missile, which is under development, would have a range of \nabout 3,100 miles. From certain parts of North Korea, this weapon could \neasily target many of the Aleutian islands in western Alaska, including \nthe former Adak Naval Air Base.\n  The Washington Times reported last week that the Chinese have 13 of \n18 long-range strategic missiles armed with nuclear warheads aimed at \nAmerican cities. This is incredible, Mr. President. Opponents to the \nmotion to invoke cloture somehow fail to understand that this threat is \nreal and that we have a responsibility to protect the United States \nfrom attack, be it deliberate or accidental. Without question, the \nthreat of an attack on the United States is increasingly real, and we \nmust act now so that we can construct a national missile defense system \nwith the capability of intercepting and deterring an aggressive strike \nagainst American soil from all parts of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I support the motion to invoke cloture and hope that \nmy colleagues will vote overwhelmingly in favor of this legislation in \nthe near future.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose this legislation and I urge the \nSenate not to invoke cloture.\n  Star Wars was a bad idea in the 1980s, and it is a bad idea today. \nDeveloping and deploying a national missile defense system has an \nenormous cost--billions of dollars a year to develop the system, and \nbillions more to deploy it.\n  In addition, it ignores more likely threats to our security, \nespecially the danger of terrorist attacks on our territory and our \ncitizens.\n  Intelligence estimates suggest that there will not be a new, \nintercontinental ballistic missile threat from any rogue nation until \nat least 2010. At a time when we are trying to balance the budget and \nmeet the essential readiness and modernization needs of our armed \nforces, it would be a mistake to spend additional billions of dollars \non the proposed missile defense system.\n  Throughout the Cold War, when the Soviet Union had a far larger \nnuclear arsenal than today, we decided not to deploy missile defenses \nbecause the cost did not justify the protection provided. Now, the Cold \nWar is over. We have far more cooperative relations with Russia and \nother nations of the former Soviet Union, and they have a much smaller \nnuclear arsenal. The Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff \ntell us that now is not the time to deploy a national missile defense. \nIt makes no sense to reject that advice and push ahead on this costly \nsystem.\n  Declaring our intention to deploy a missile defense system now will \nalso put U.S. policy on a collision course with the Anti-Ballistic \nMissile Treaty. Such a step would send a strong signal to Russia that \ncooperation on nuclear arms reductions is not a U.S. priority.\n  In fact, members of the Russian Parliament have stated that they will \noppose ratification of the START II Treaty if the United States begins \nto develop or deploy ballistic missile defenses in violation of the ABM \nTreaty. By endangering the prospects for START II ratification by \nRussia, this bill will ensure that we will face many\n\n[[Page S4763]]\n\nthousands more Russian nuclear weapons in the near future than we will \nface if arms reductions are implemented.\n  This bill also fails to address the most pressing threats to American \nsecurity. As the World Trade Center bombing and the Oklahoma City \nbombing make clear, we do face a serious threat of terrorist attacks. \nBut, it is far more likely, for example, that a terrorist will use \nnuclear, chemical or biological weapons on American soil than that we \nwill be the target of an ICBM attack from a foreign nation. Loose \ncontrols on nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union raise the \nserious threat that such materials can find their way into the hands of \nextremists bent on using them. This bill fails to address these far \nmore likely threats.\n  We should continue to do all we can to prevent the spread of nuclear \nweapons materials. The Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program \nhas removed thousands of nuclear warheads from former Soviet arsenals, \ndestroyed hundreds of missile launchers, and has safeguarded vulnerable \nstockpiles of nuclear materials. The nuclear tests conducted by India \nearlier this week are a wake-up call to the United States and all \nnations that our efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation are \ninadequate. We should do nothing to undermine that high priority even \nfurther.\n  This body has also rightly funded systems to protect our troops from \nballistic missile threats and cruise missile threats. To deal with the \npossibility of future ballistic missile threats to U.S. territory, we \nhave worked with the Administration to prepare a plan that will give us \nample time to deploy a missile defense system if the need is clear. Our \nmilitary leaders continue to agree that this plan is the most sensible \nway to protect the nation against potential future missile threats.\n  We need a strong defense, but we must give the highest priority to \nmeeting the most serious threats. Failure to do so will waste billions \nof taxpayer dollars, and leave the nation less secure. I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we reserve the remainder of our time on \nthis side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If neither side yields time, then time will be \ncharged equally to both sides.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I appeal to the Chair for a different \nruling on that. We are prepared to use our 5 minutes and then proceed \nto hear from the other side. If I speak now, we have used up our 5 \nminutes and then they have 20 minutes to complete debate. That is not \nfair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ruling of the Chair reflects the \nprecedence of the Senate.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, under the ruling of the Chair, if we do \nnot speak, then we are not going to have any time to speak in about 10 \nminutes. That is the way I understand the ruling of the Chair.\n  I ask unanimous consent the running of the time be charged against \nthe opposition, the opponents of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, first of all, let me compliment the \ndistinguished manager of the bill and the ranking member for the level \nof debate that has already occurred on this important piece of \nlegislation. I have extraordinary respect for both Senators and I \nappreciate the manner in which they have presented this critical matter \nto the U.S. Senate.\n  In listening to the debate on S. 1873, I am struck by the appearance \nthat rigid adherence to ideology seems to be trumping the sound \njudgment of this Nation's senior military leaders.\n  The proponents of this latest attempt to deploy ballistic missile \ndefenses at any cost have entitled this bill the American Missile \nProtection Act. But I think it is important that we be clear as to what \nthis really legislation does. The only thing S. 1873 protects, is the \nopportunity for defense contractors to move far ahead of where we ought \nto be with regard to a commitment to develop and deploy national \nballistic missile defenses. As stated by the Secretary of Defense and \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in their letters opposing S. \n1873, deployment of national missile defenses at this time is \nunnecessary, premature and could end our arms control efforts.\n\n  S. 1873, in spite of my great admiration for its author and the \nmanager of this bill, is the wrong bill at the wrong time, and I ask my \ncolleagues, this morning to vote against cloture.\n  S. 1873 would commit the United States to deploy national missile \ndefenses based on a single criterion--technical feasibility.\n  Quoting from the bill, the United States should ``deploy as soon as \nis technologically possible an effective national missile defense \nsystem.''\n  In the eyes of the sponsors of this bill, the only standard that must \nbe met in deciding whether to deploy defenses is that they be \ntechnologically possible.\n  Mr. President, I cannot find a clear definition of effective defenses \nin S. 1873.\n  And yet, many of the same people who demand that important domestic \nprograms meet stringent standards before they can receive funding stay \nstrangely silent when it comes to establishing even the most minimal \nperformance requirements for ballistic missile defenses.\n  This irony is not lost on just this Senator. In fact, the proponents' \nattitude is cavalier even by the standards of defense programs. \nResearch by the Department of Defense shows that S. 1873 would make \nhistory. For the first time ever, we would be committing this nation to \ndeploy a weapons system before it had even been developed, let alone \nthoroughly tested.\n  We need look no further than today's Washington Post to see the folly \nof this approach.\n  In a story entitled, ``Antimissile Test Yields 5th Failure In a \nRow,'' it is pointed out that the THAAD system, a high priority theater \nanti-missile defense effort, failed yet again and is now 0 for 5 in \ntests.\n  Supporters of national defense may argue that the fifth consecutive \nfailure of a theater missile defense system is not relevant to a debate \non national missile defenses.\n  However, as underscored in the Post article, ``the repeated inability \nto demonstrate that THAAD's interceptors can hit incoming warheads has \nimplications beyond battlefield defense. The same hit-to-kill concept \nis at the core of the even more ambitious national antimissile \nsystem.''\n  Moreover, most experts believe that a rush to judgment on ballistic \nmissile defenses will not necessarily lead to the deployment of the \nmost effective system.\n  According to General John Shalikashvili, former Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff,\n\n     if the decision is made to deploy a national missile defense \n     system in the near term, then the system fielded would \n     provide a very limited capability. If deploying a system in \n     the near term can be avoided, the Defense Department can \n     continue to enhance the technology base and the commensurate \n     capability of the missile defense system that could be \n     fielded on a later deployment schedule.\n\n  Not a word in S. 1873, Mr. President, about the costs of this system. \nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that deployment of even a \nvery limited system could cost tens of billions of dollars.\n  Given that so much of the technology necessary remains unproven, \nhistory tells us the real cost could be much more. Despite the hefty \nprice tag and the technological uncertainty, the proponents of this \nbill essentially say, ``costs be damned, full speed ahead''.\n  Yet, when it comes to proven proposals to improve our nations' \nschools, increase the quality of health care, or enhance our \nenvironment, the first question out of the mouths of many of the \nproponents of S. 1873 is, ``how much does it cost?''\n  Not a sentence in this bill, Mr. President, about the need for this \ndefense system or the threats it is designed to counter. According to \nthe intelligence community, deployment of defenses is not justified by \nthe rogue nation ballistic missile threat.\n\n[[Page S4764]]\n\n  In his Annual Report to the President and Congress, Secretary Cohen \nstated that, with one possible exception, ``no country will develop or \notherwise acquire a ballistic missile in the next 15 years that could \nthreaten the United States.''\n  The only possible exception is North Korea, a country that is on the \nverge of collapsing upon itself. Even here, the intelligence community \nrightly says the probability of North Korea acquiring such a missile by \n2005 is, ``very low.''\n  Mr. President, S. 1873 says absolutely nothing about how a U.S. \ndeployment of missile defenses would affect existing and future arms \ncontrol treaties. It is clear from statements made by Russian President \nYeltsin and other top officials that if the United States unilaterally \nabrogates the ABM Treaty, the Russians will effectively end a decades-\nlong effort to reduce strategic nuclear weapons. They will back out of \nSTART I. They will not ratify START II. And they will not negotiate \nSTART III.\n  In other words, unilateral U.S. deployment of missile defenses could \nend the prospect for reducing Russia's nuclear arsenal from its current \nlevel of about 9,000 weapons down to as few as 2,000. This is much too \nsteep a price to pay for a course of action that is unproven, \nunaffordable, and unnecessary.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about the \nprocedure by which this bill is being brought to the floor.\n  All too frequently these past few months, we have seen bills taken \nfrom the Republican agenda and immediately scheduled for floor time \nunder parliamentary procedures that severely limit debate and the \nopportunity to offer amendments.\n  When Democrats try to bring up issues important to all Americans--\nreducing school class size and protecting patients from insurance \ncompany abuses--we are told there is no time or they resort to these \nsame parliamentary tactics to stifle our efforts.\n  The decision to bring up S. 1873 is only the latest manifestation of \nthis practice. Just one day after refusing to set a date to take up \npatient protection legislation, we find the Senate has time to vote on \na bill that should be known as ``Son of Star Wars.''\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to reflect on the advice of the \nSecretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and vote against \ncloture on S. 1873.\n  Let us think carefully and thoughtfully about its ramifications. Let \nus recognize the dangerous implications for arms control, for the \nfederal budget, and, because of the necessity to choose priorities \nwithin this budget, for what it means to the Defense Department itself. \nThis is the wrong bill at the wrong time, and I hope we will defeat \ncloture when the opportunity presents itself, in 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I ask that my time be taken from my leader time, and \nnot from the time accorded the debate on the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time remains on \neach side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi has 5 minutes and \nthe Democratic side has about 12 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the manager of the bill.\n  Mr. President, the world has been working in a responsible way for \nyears to try to halt the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction--\nnuclear, biological and chemical. India's decision both yesterday and \ntoday to detonate five underground nuclear explosions has blown a hole \nin the dyke of the world's nonproliferation efforts. The flood waters \nare now running. This tragic development should bring into sharper \nfocus both the threat that our nation, and indeed all nations of the \nworld, face from the spread of weapons of mass destruction; and the \nneed for defenses to protect us from that threat. The bill before us \noffers such protection.\n  Mr. President, on April 21, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted \nto favorably report to the Senate S. 1873, the American Missile \nProtection Act of 1998. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this \nlegislation. This bipartisan bill, whose principal sponsors are Senator \nCochran and Senator Inouye, currently has 50 cosponsors in the Senate. \nI regret to say that the vote in the Armed Services Committee was along \nparty lines.\n  The American Missile Protection Act which is before the Senate today \nis very simple. It states that, ``It is the policy of the United States \nto deploy as soon as is technologically possible a National Missile \nDefense system capable of defending the territory of the United States \nagainst limited ballistic missile attack (whether accidental, \nunauthorized or deliberate).''\n  This bill is a compromise--a step back from earlier Republican \nnational missile defense (NMD) efforts in that it does not specify a \ndate certain for deployment of an NMD system. As my colleagues will \nrecall, the National Missile Defense Act of 1997, introduced last \nJanuary by the Majority Leader, called for deployment of an NMD system \nby 2003. Many Republicans joined the Majority Leader in his effort last \nyear. Would we still like to see a system deployed by 2003? Of course \nwe would. But the intent of this year's legislation is to build a more \nbipartisan consensus for deploying a national missile defense system \ncapable of defending the United States.\n  I have long been a strong supporter of providing Americans here at \nhome, and our troops deployed overseas, with the most effective missile \ndefense systems possible. In my view, there is no greater obligation of \na government than to provide for the protection of its people. The \nPersian Gulf War should have made clear to all Americans our \nvulnerability to the proliferation of ballistic missiles around the \nworld, and the dire need to develop and deploy effective defenses as \nsoon as possible.\n  What are the objections to this simple, and seemingly obvious goal? \nThe arguments we have heard from Members on the other side of the aisle \nare mainly three-fold: (1) a threat does not currently exist--and may \nnot exist for the foreseeable future--that would justify the deployment \nof an NMD system; (2) we should not commit ourselves to the deployment \nof such a system when we do not know what that system would cost; and \n(3) we may be locking ourselves into a technologically inferior system \nby making a deployment decision today. I will respond to these \narguments in turn.\n  First and foremost, the threat. I respectfully disagree with my \nDemocrat colleagues. In my view, the threat exists today and is \ngrowing. Recent events in India are but the latest proof.\n  In my view, the biggest current threat we face is instability in \nRussia and the impact that instability could have on Russian command \nand control of the thousands of intercontinental ballistic missiles \ncapable of reaching this country. A recent segment on ABC's ``World \nNews with Peter Jennings,'' highlighted this problem. I quote one \nstatement: ``A crushing lack of funds means Russia's entire 30-year-old \nnuclear command and control system is becoming unreliable.''\n  I remind my colleagues that with this legislation we are not seeking \nto deploy a Star Wars-type umbrella over the U.S. which would protect \nus from a massive strike by the Russians. We are seeking protection \nfrom a very limited, unauthorized or accidental attack. That scenario, \nunfortunately, could happen today.\n  And what of threats beyond Russia? By the Administration's our \nadmission, the North Koreans will be able to deploy--in the near term--\na ballistic missile with a range capable of striking Alaska and Hawaii. \nAnd other rogue nations are clamoring to get this type of technology. \nAccording to a recent report by the Air Force, ``Ballistic missiles are \nalready in widespread use and will continue to increase in number and \nvariety. The employment of weapons of mass destruction on many \nballistic missiles vastly increases the significance of the threat.''\n  I believe we have proof enough today that a threat exists which \njustifies deploying an NMD system. But what if--for the sake of \nargument--we are wrong? What if a system is not needed for many more \nyears? I would rather err on the side of deploying defense\n\n[[Page S4765]]\n\nsooner than they might be needed, rather than being caught defenseless \nif nations move even faster than the Administration expects to develop \nthe capability to attack our shores.\n  Many of my Democrat colleagues are--quite properly--very concerned \nabout what an NMD system might cost. My reply to that is, what is the \ncost of not deploying a system? What if even one ballistic missile \nstrikes the United States? What is the cost in terms of loss of life \nand damage to our nation? That is a cost which must be factored into \nthis debate. That is a cost we should never have to pay.\n  Who would we answer to the American people in the aftermath of such \nan attack when they ask why their government failed to provide them \nwith any defenses? We know the threat exists--it will only grow in the \nyears ahead. It is time to stop debating, and time to deploy systems to \nprotect our people.\n  And finally, the issue of technology. The argument has been made that \nwe should put off a deployment decision until we have the best possible \ntechnology for an NMD system. Well, that is an argument that will \nresult in putting off a deployment decision indefinitely. There will \nalways be better technology down the road. That is true for all of our \nweapons systems. That should not be used as an excuse for not deploying \na system which is needed. Our focus instead should be on designing a \nsystem which can incorporate technological advances as they become \navailable.\n  Another point which we must keep in mind as we debate this \nlegislation is that we are not locking ourselves into a particular \narchitecture or a deployment decision that will then just go on ``auto-\npilot.'' We are making a broad policy statement that the U.S. should \ndeploy a National Missile Defense system as soon as possible. That is \nour goal. Subsequent Congresses will decide--through the normal \nauthorization and appropriation process--the details of the type of \nsystem to be deployed and the cost of that system. This bill is not the \nend of the process--it is the beginning.\n  And finally, there has been discussion about the impact of this bill \non arms control agreements with the Russians--particularly the 1972 ABM \nTreaty. Dire consequences have been predicted if we were to pass this \nbill which, according to one of our Committee Members, would ``violate \nthe ABM Treaty.'' I would just point out that a statement of policy \ndoes not--in and of itself--violate a treaty. Until actual deployment \nof a system were to take place--which would be years in the future--no \nviolation of a treaty would occur. In the meantime, the United States \nshould be talking to the Russians about modifying the ABM treaty to \ndeal with current realities.\n  We are no longer living in the world envisioned by the ABM Treaty--a \nworld with two superpowers with missiles targeted on each other. Russia \nis no longer the only threat we face. We are in a world where an \nincreasing number of nations are acquiring the means to strike others \nwith ballistic missiles. If the Russians would look around their \nborders they would realize that they have just as much, if not more, \nneed for effective missiles defenses as we do. Regardless, if the \nRussians do not agree to modifications of this 26-year old treaty, we \nshould not let this document stand in the way of protecting our people \nfrom attack.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in our effort to provide effective \ndefenses for our country.\n  Mr. President, in summary, the Nation owes a debt of gratitude to the \nSenator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, and the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. \nInouye, for, again, showing the leadership to bring America closer and \ncloser to a system which is absolutely essential for our defense.\n  When the tragic news unfolded about the resumption of testing by \nIndia, I think in the hearts of most Americans two thoughts came about: \nFirst, ``Well, that's far away, no threat to us;'' secondly, ``Well, we \nalready have a system which will protect us.''\n  Neither is true, and this tragedy brings into sharper focus the need \nfor the U.S. Senate to move forward on this issue. I hope that sharper \nfocus induces Senators to support moving this bill forward.\n  Another argument that is frequently brought up is, ``Well, what about \nRussia and the ABM Treaty?'' The ABM Treaty in 1972 is against a \nbackground of two superpowers who possessed arsenals. That is not the \ncase today. Unfortunately, as a consequence of proliferation, the \narsenals that we find in many countries, and with the news in India, \nthat could even expand now the number of countries. Why should not \nAmericans have their prayers answered: Just give us what is necessary \nto protect against a limited attack from a single or two or three \nmissiles as a consequence of terrorism, as a consequence of a \nmiscalculation, as a consequence of failure of equipment? To me, that \nis a very reasonable request, and that is the essence of this \nlegislation. I urge it be supported.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to my friend from \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, S. 1873 calls for deployment of a limited national \nmissile defense system as soon as is technologically possible.\n  Although a case can be made for near-term deployment of this type of \ncapability, I do not believe it is a wise policy to pursue a limited \nnational missile defense system absent any considerations of costs, \ncost-effectiveness, or treaty implications. In fact, if this \nlegislation were to become law in its current form and unilaterally \nbreach the ABM Treaty, the international condemnation India is \nreceiving for its nuclear testing during the last 48 hours could \nquickly shift to the United States.\n  There is no question that an accidental or unauthorized ICBM or SLBM \nlaunch by the Russians or PRC, however remote the possibility, would \nhave devastating consequences. Such a threat alone, it could be argued, \nmerits a limited national defense system. Indeed, there were extensive \ndebates in the late eighties in the Senate regarding ALPS, or \naccidental launch protection system, as proposed by Senator Nunn.\n  But even in the debate over ALPS, it was understood that we should \nonly go forward if it could be made affordable and cost-effective and \ndeployed within the constraints of the ABM Treaty or a variant of this \ntreaty, as agreed to by the Russians.\n  Admittedly, the threat situation has changed since the late 1980s. A \nnew ICBM threat, such as a North Korean capability, could present \nitself in less than 20 years--a relatively short timeframe for \ndeploying and refining a system as complex as a national missile \ndefense. Such threats would become even more ominous in the event \ntechnology were transferred in part or in whole to a rogue regime, \nwhich is unlikely but not impossible.\n\n  Having a viable national missile defense system would not only \nprovide a limited capability for meeting these threats but, far more \nimportantly, it could serve to deter a rogue regime from even expending \nscarce resources on developing a long-range delivery system.\n  And rogue regimes would not be the only nations deterred. One of the \nmost troubling strategic developments of the next century will be the \nrapid expansion of the PRC's strategic nuclear force through MIRVing--\nplacing multiple warheads on each of its ICBMs--thus multiplying its \nnuclear strike capability many times over. This is not a remote \npossibility. MIRV technology is over 20 years old, and press reports \nindicate that, in fact, the Chinese are testing a MIRV capability. \nFacing a limited U.S. missile defense system which could, if necessary, \nbe expanded to meet a potential Chinese threat, Beijing might choose to \nabandon any thought of pursuing this destabilizing course.\n  A limited national missile defense could also serve to deter a \nbreakout by signatories, including the United States, Russia, China, \nBritain, and France, to future arms limitation agreements, especially \nthose involving a very low number of offensive systems where \ntemptations could be high for rapidly rebuilding capabilities in a \ncrisis.\n  But we cannot simply dictate deployment of a national missile defense \nwithout consideration of costs and\n\n[[Page S4766]]\n\ntreaty implications. Despite decades of multibillion-dollar research \nand development and testing efforts, we have not yet demonstrated an \nability to effectively and consistently hit a bullet with a bullet in \neither our national or theater missile defense programs, as was \ndemonstrated even yesterday, even in controlled settings against \nrelatively easy threats.\n  The reality may be that we can get there only with exorbitant \nexpenditures that will siphon funding excessively from U.S. military \nprograms for other more pressing threats. S. 1873 makes no account of \ncosts and is, therefore, not, in my judgment, a prudent policy.\n  A limited capability could probably be achieved within the confines \nof the ABM Treaty or a slightly modified treaty. But to call for a \ndefense system without regard to the arms control consequences is very \nshortsighted.\n  If our rush to deploy a national missile defense system undermines \nRussian ratification of START II and, worse yet, pushes the Russians to \nabrogate START I, the gains of a national missile defense system will \nbe offset overwhelmingly by a restoration of a very costly and \ndestabilizing offensive nuclear arms race. This, again, supports the \ncondition that S. 1873 is simply not a prudent policy.\n  Legislation similar to S. 1873, but calling for a cost-effective and \ntreaty-compliant limited national missile defense system, would be a \nmuch more sensible and responsible approach.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 7 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. President, there are good ideas and bad ideas. There are timely \nideas and untimely ones. Whatever our views on a nation-wide ballistic \nmissile defense, S. 1873 is both bad and untimely.\n  I urge my colleagues--on both sides of the aisle--to look closely at \nthis bill and ask whether we should really be spending our time on it. \nOnce they consider its implications we can reject cloture and get back \nto real work.\n  What would it mean to make it U.S. policy ``to deploy as soon as is \ntechnologically possible an effective National Missile Defense system \ncapable of defending the territory of the United States against limited \nballistic missile attack (whether accidental, unauthorized, or \ndeliberate)''?\n  For starters, we would have to deploy a national missile defense even \nif broke the bank, the budget agreement, and the U.S. economy. And it \nmight do just that, especially if the bill is interpreted as requiring \ndefense of U.S. territories in addition to every square inch of the 50 \nstates.\n  This bill would also require deployment before we know the precise \nnature of the threat--indeed, before we are actually threatened by any \nstrategic missiles other than Russia's and China's, which have posed \nthat threat for years. That raises the distinct risk that we would \ndeploy the wrong defense for the real threats we may someday face.\n  Worse yet, we would spend the taxpayer's hard-earned money on the \nfirst technology, rather than the best technology. And the first \ntechnology may not stop missiles with penetration aids, which Russia \nand others already have.\n  In addition, by putting pressure on the Pentagon to deploy the first \nfeasible technology, this bill will very likely worsen what General \nWelch's panel recently called a ``rush to failure.'' Yesterday's fifth \nconsecutive test failure with one of our theater defense missiles is a \nreminder of how difficult it is to develop any middle defense. Opting \nto deploy the first system that looks feasible is simply not a \nprescription for success.\n  Worst of all, this bill does not require--or even permit--\nconsideration of negative consequences resulting from deployment.\n  Will the march to deployment destroy the Anti-Ballistic Missile \nTreaty? Too bad. That's precisely what some of our colleagues want.\n  Will the adoption of this objective torpedo implementation of START \nII and block any further reduction of strategic missiles or nuclear \nwarheads? Too bad, again. Some people find ``star wars'' an easier \nsolution than the hard, patient work of reducing great power armaments \nand stabilizing our forces.\n  Will renunciation of the ABM Treaty and the START process lead to a \ncollapse of the Non-Proliferation Treaty? That is a real risk. But once \nagain, too bad.\n  Do not focus on the Non-Proliferation Treaty's failings, and overlook \nits successes. What would the world be like if the countries that have \nstopped short of developing nuclear weapons were to give up on the \ncommitment of the nuclear powers to reduce their forces? Would we \nreally be safer if all those other countries were to go nuclear?\n  That is a real risk, if we march willy-nilly to deploy a national \nmissile defense. Remember: when Egypt developed a better defense \nagainst Israeli attack on its forces, it was able to mount an offensive \nattack in the Yom Kippur War. The same thing applies to a national \nmissile defense. We may see it as a defense. But the rest of the world \nwill see it as a second-strike defense that enables us to mount first-\nstrike nuclear attacks.\n  Some day, we may really need a nation-wide ballistic missile defense. \nThat is why the Defense Department is pursuing the 3+3 policy of \nfinding a technology that would permit deployment within three years of \ndetermining that there was a serious threat on the horizon.\n  Some of my colleagues truly believe that we can't wait for that, and \nI respect their views--although I respectfully believe that they are \nwrong. Others may be frustrated because they feel the President is \ntrying to steal their issue. ``Life is unfair,'' as another Democrat \nonce said.\n  But frustration and distrust do not make for good policy. And the \npolicy that this bill would establish is simply too much, too soon. \nLet's get behind 3+3--make it effective, rather than forcing the \nDefense Department into an even more unrealistic schedule.\n  Sensible policy on ballistic missile defense is perfectly feasible. \nBut S. 1873 isn't it. Let's stop wasting the Senate's time with it.\n  Mr. President, I am confused as the devil what my friends from \nMississippi, Virginia, and others are doing here. Again, there are good \nideas, there are bad ideas, there are timely ideas and untimely ideas. \nThis is a bad, untimely idea. I truly am confused.\n  No. 1, we don't have any system that works. No. 2, there is no clear \nanalysis of what the threat is that we are going to defend against. \nThat usually goes hand in hand. We say we are going to build a system \nand here is the threat.\n  My friend, the senior Senator from Virginia, says, ``Well, you know, \nthe threat may come from terrorist organizations or from specific rogue \ncountries and single-warhead systems.'' Fine, that is one kind of \nsystem. My friend, the junior Senator from Virginia, stands up and \npoints out, if we come up with a missile defense system for a single \nwarhead that is able to be dealt with, do you think the Chinese are not \ngoing to sit there and say, ``You know, by golly, we're not going to \nbuild any MIRV'd warheads, we're not going to do that''?\n  Right now they may not do that. It is clearly against their \ninterests.\n  We have this treaty with the Russians, the former Soviet Union, to do \naway with all multiple warhead missiles because we know they are so \npernicious. This will encourage the Chinese to move. No. 1, we don't \nhave an analysis of a threat. No. 2, my conservative friends, who are \nall budget-conscious guys, like we all are here, have no notion what \nthe cost will be. They are ready to sign on and say, ``Deploy. As soon \nas we find it, deploy it. If it breaks the budget deal, if it causes a \ndeficit, if it breaks the bank, deploy.'' No. 3, the idea that the ABM \nTreaty may or may not be impacted upon by this seems to be of no \nconsequence. And No. 4, my friend, the senior Senator from Virginia, \nand others stood up on the floor when we were dealing with NATO \nexpansion and said, ``Joe, Joe, Joe, the Russians, let's worry about \nhow the Russians are going to think about being isolated; let's worry \nabout how this could impact on Russia. Look, Joe, if you go ahead and \ndo this and expand, what's going to happen is that all arms control \nagreements are going to come to a screeching halt.''\n  Well, let me tell you something. You want to make sure they come to a\n\n[[Page S4767]]\n\nscreeching halt? Pass this, pass this beauty. This will be doing it \nreal well. Bang. All of a sudden, the Duma saying, ``Now look, we are \ngoing to commit to go to START II, which means we have no multiple \nwarhead weapons, which means we're only going to go to single warhead \nweapons, which means that, by the way, the U.S. Senate''--and they \nthink we are even smarter than we think we are--``the U.S. Senate just \nsaid, `Go ahead and deploy as soon as you have a feasible system.' ''\n  Now, what do you think those good old boys in the Duma are going to \ndo? They are going to say, ``You know, let's continue to destroy our \nmultiple warhead weapons. The only thing we know for sure, these guys \ncan't stop.''\n  Look, what is viewed as good for somebody is viewed as poison for \nother people on occasion. And let me point out to you, we are sitting \nhere thinking--and we mean it--that what we want to do is we are going \nto defend the American people. And we do. But you sit there on the \nother side of the ocean, the other side of the world, and say, ``These \nguys, these Americans, the only people, by the way, who ever did drop \nan atomic weapon, these guys are building a system that is going to \nrender them impervious to being hit by nuclear weapons. We think they \nare building that system for a second-strike capability. They can \naffirmatively strike us knowing they can't be struck back.''\n  Now, don't you think the guys that don't like us might think that? \nDon't you think that might cross their minds as reasonable planners? \nAnd what are we doing this for? What are we doing this for? We have no \ntechnology that works now. We are spending $3 billion a year, which I \nsupport, on theater and national missile defense research--$3 billion a \nyear. I am for it. We should not get behind the curve so there is a \nbreakout. But to deploy as soon as feasible? So I have only come to one \nconclusion here, Mr. President. This has to do with either trying to \nget rid of ABM, which is one of the reasons why some of my friends on \nthe right think it is a bad idea or, No. 2, the President stole the \nmarch on the missile defense from them and they are not going to let it \nhappen. This makes no sense.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the Senator from North Dakota want a minute at this \npoint? I yield a minute to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise as a strong supporter of national \nmissile defense. I have introduced legislation on this subject. I \nstrongly believe in it. Just as strongly, I oppose what is before us. I \noppose it because, No. 1, I believe it undermines congressional \nresponsibility. I believe there are common-sense criteria we need to \napply on any decision of what we deploy. We need treaty compatibility. \nThe ABM and START must not be jeopardized. We need affordability. A \nbalanced budget must be maintained. We should have maximum utilization \nof existing technology to prevent increased costs.\n  Mr. President, S. 1873 gives the Pentagon no guidance on all of these \nissues. In addition to that, our military leadership is telling us that \nS. 1873 might undermine our Nation's security.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 1 minute.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent for an additional minute for this \nside.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let us listen to our leadership, our \nmilitary leadership, General Shelton, the current Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff.\n  The effect NMD ``deployment would have on our arms control agreements \nand nuclear arms reductions * * * should be included in any bill on \nnational missile defense.''\n  General Shalikashvili, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs: \nEfforts that imply ``withdrawal in the ABM Treaty may jeopardize \nRussian ratification of START II and * * * could prompt Russia to \nwithdraw from START I. I am concerned that failure of either START \ninitiative will result in Russian retention of hundreds or even \nthousands more nuclear weapons, thereby increasing both costs and risks \nwe may face.''\n  Mr. President, I am in favor of NMD, national missile defense. I am \nopposed to this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 1 minute 30 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this is more of an ``NMC'' bill than an \nNMD. This is a ``Never Mind the Consequence'' bill.\n  General Shelton, our top military leader in the uniform of this \ncountry, has said he cannot support this bill for a number of reasons.\n  The question has been asked, ``How can anybody oppose this bill?'' A \nlot of people oppose this bill for a lot of reasons. But the people who \nsupport this bill ought to ask themselves, ``How is it that our top \nmilitary leadership oppose it?'' And General Shelton, for many reasons, \nsays he cannot support it. And one of the reasons is the one that \nSenator Conrad just read. And I want to repeat it. Any bill should \n``consider affordability [and] the impact a deployment would have on \narms control agreements and nuclear arms reductions.''\n  When you commit to deploy a system which will breach in almost dead \ncertainty a treaty between us and the Russians, and cause them to quit \ncutting the number of nuclear weapons and to start increasing again, we \nare jeopardizing the security of this Nation and contributing to the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons.\n  That is one of the big problems of this bill. That is why our top \nmilitary leadership do not support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that the letters of General \nShelton, General Shalikashvili and Secretary Cohen in opposition to \nthis bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   Chairman of the\n\n\n                                        Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 21, 1998.\n     Hon. Carl M. Levin,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Armed Services, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: Thank you for the opportunity to \n     comment on the American Missile Protection Act of 1998 (S. \n     1873). I agree that the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction (WMD) and their delivery systems poses a major \n     threat to our forces, allies, and other friendly nations. US \n     missile systems play a critical role in our strategy to deter \n     these threats, and the current National Missile Defense (NMD) \n     Deployment Readiness Program (3+3) is structured to provide a \n     defense against them when required.\n       The bill and the NMD program are consistent on many points; \n     however, the following differences make it difficult to \n     support enactment. First and most fundamental are the \n     conditions necessary for deployment. The bill would establish \n     a policy to deploy as soon as technology allows. The NMD \n     program, on the other hand, requires an emerging ballistic \n     missile threat as well as the achievement of a technological \n     capability for an effective defense before deployment of \n     missile defenses.\n       Second, the bill asserts that the United States has no \n     policy to deploy an NMD system. In fact, the NMD effort is \n     currently a robust research and development program that \n     provides the flexibility to deploy an initial capability \n     within 3 years of a deployment decision. This prudent hedge \n     ensures that the United States will be capable of meeting the \n     need for missile defenses with the latest technology when a \n     threat emerges.\n       Third, I disagree with the bill's contention that the US \n     ability to anticipate future ballistic missile threats is \n     questionable. It is possible, of course, that there could be \n     surprises, particularly were a rogue state to receive outside \n     assistance. However, given the substantial intelligence \n     resources being devoted to this issue, I am confident that we \n     will have the 3 years' warning on which our strategy is \n     based.\n       Fourth, the bill uses the phrase ``system capable of \n     defending the territory of the United States.'' The NMD \n     program calls for defense of only the 50 states. Expanding \n     performance coverage to include all US territories would have \n     considerable cost, design, and location implications.\n       Finally, the bill does not consider affordability or the \n     impact a deployment would have on arms control agreements and \n     nuclear arms reductions. Both points are addressed in the NMD \n     Deployment Readiness Program and should be included in any \n     bill on NMD.\n       Please be assured that I remain committed to those programs \n     that discourage hostile\n\n[[Page S4768]]\n\n     nations from the proliferation of WMD and the missiles that \n     deliver them. In that regard, I am confident that our current \n     NMD program provides a comprehensive policy to counter future \n     ballistic missile threats with the best technology when \n     deployment is determined necessary.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Henry H. Shelton,\n     Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   Chairman of the\n\n\n                                        Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 1996.\n     Hon. Sam Nunn,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on Armed Services,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nunn: In response to your recent letter on the \n     Defend America Act of 1996, I share Congressional concern \n     with regard to the proliferation of ballistic missiles and \n     the potential threat these missiles may present to the United \n     States and our allies. My staff, along with CINCs, Services \n     and the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO), is \n     actively reviewing proposed systems to ensure we are prepared \n     to field the most technologically capable systems available. \n     We also need to take into account the parallel initiatives \n     ongoing to reduce the ballistic missile threat.\n       In this regard, efforts which suggest changes to or \n     withdrawal from the ABM Treaty may jeopardize Russian \n     ratification of START II and, as articulated in the Soviet \n     Statement to the United States of 13 June 1991, could prompt \n     Russia to withdraw from START I. I am concerned that failure \n     of either START initiative will result in Russian retention \n     of hundreds or even thousands more nuclear weapons thereby \n     increasing both the costs and risks we may face.\n       We can reduce the possibility of facing these increased \n     cost and risks by planning an NMD system consistent with the \n     ABM treaty. The current National Missile Defense Deployment \n     Readiness Program (NDRP), which is consistent with the ABM \n     treaty, will help provide stability in our strategic \n     relationship with Russia as well as reducing future risks \n     from rogue countries.\n       In closing let me assure you, Senator Nunn, that I will use \n     my office to ensure a timely national missile defense \n     deployment decision is made when warranted. I have discussed \n     the above position with the Joint Chiefs and the appropriate \n     CINCs, and all are in agreement.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            John M. Shalikashvili,\n     Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 21, 1998.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing in response to your request \n     for the views of the Department of Defense on S. 1873, the \n     American Missile Protection Act of 1998.\n       The Department of Defense is committed to ensuring that we \n     properly protect the American people and America's national \n     security interests. This requires that we have a carefully \n     balanced defense program that ensures that we are able to \n     meet threats to our people and vital interest wherever and \n     whenever they arise. A key element of our defense program is \n     our National Missile Defense (NMD) program, which as you know \n     was restructured under Secretary Perry and with the support \n     of Congress as a ``3+3'' deployment readiness program. Under \n     this approach, by 2000 the United States is to be in a \n     position to make a deployment decision if warranted by the \n     threat, and if a decision to deploy were made at that time \n     the initial NMD system would be deployed by 2003. If in 2000 \n     the threat assessment does not warrant a deployment decision, \n     improvements in NMD system component technology will \n     continue, while an ability is maintained to deploy a system \n     within three years of a decision.\n       The Quadrennial Defense Review reaffirmed this approach, \n     although it also determined that the ``3+3'' program was \n     inadequately funded to meet its objectives. Accordingly, I \n     directed that an additional $2.3 billion be programmed for \n     NMD over the Future Years Defense Plan. It must be \n     emphasized, though, that even with this additional funding, \n     NMD remains a high risk program because the compressed \n     schedule necessitates a high degree of concurrency.\n       I share with Congress a commitment to ensuring the American \n     people receive protection from missile threats how and when \n     they need it. S. 1873, however, would alter the ``3+3'' \n     strategy so as to eliminate taking into account the nature of \n     the threat when making a deployment decision. This could lead \n     to the deployment of an inferior system less capable of \n     defending the American people if and when a threat emerges. \n     Because of this, I am compelled to oppose the adoption of the \n     bill.\n       Please be assured, however, that I will continue to work \n     closely with the Senate and House of Representatives to \n     ensure that our NMD program and all of our defense programs \n     are designed and carried out in a manner that provides the \n     best possible defense of our people and interests.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Bill Cohen.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, there are two criticisms of this bill \nthat I have heard during the debate from the opponents. The \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan says that the bill should include \nthe words ``treaty compliant'' and that it is therefore vulnerable to \ncriticism and ought to be rejected. The distinguished Democratic leader \nsays the bill uses the phrase ``effective national missile defense \nsystem.'' He says ``effective'' is not defined in the bill.\n  Well, my suggestion is, if amendments ought to be offered to this \nbill we should vote for cloture so that we can get to the bill and \namendments will be in order. Criticizing the bill because we are not \nconsidering amendments at this time is begging the question. The \nquestion is, should the Senate turn to the consideration of the \nAmerican Missile Protection Act? We are suggesting yes. But the \nDemocrats objected.\n  It is like when President Clinton, 2 years ago with the authorization \nbill before the Congress, held the bill up, held it up arguing over \nmissile defense because there was a provision in it that suggested we \nought to have a national missile defense, we ought to develop and \ndeploy. They changed the words finally to ``develop for deployment,'' \nand then that was taken out of the bill in conference.\n  The point is this administration is taking a wait-and-see attitude, \nwait until there is a threat. The reality is the threat exists now. We \nneed to debate this issue. We need to debate this bill. The Democrat \nleadership are opposing that. We hope the Senate will vote cloture. Let \nus proceed to the consideration of the American Missile Protection Act. \nIf Senators have amendments, suggestions, that is when they will be in \norder. They cannot be considered now until we invoke cloture. I hope \nthe Senate will vote to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to \nconsider the bill.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there are 10 minutes \nequally divided on each side.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 1244, The \nReligious Liberty and Charitable Donation Protection Act, which I \nintroduced in October of last year.\n  When I held hearings on this bill before my subcommittee, I learned \nthat churches and charities around the country are experiencing a spate \nof lawsuits by bankruptcy trustees trying to undo tithes or charitable \ndonations. Under provisions of the Bankruptcy Code originally designed \nto fight fraudulent transfers of assets or money on the eve of \nbankruptcy, bankruptcy trustees have begun to sue churches when one of \ntheir parishioners declares bankruptcy, charging that tithes are fraud.\n  Of course, this puts the fiscal health of many churches at serious \nrisk. Most churches and charities don't have big bank accounts. Having \nto pay back money that has been received and already spent is a real \nhardship for churches which often live on a shoe-string budget. S. 1244 \nwill protect against that.\n  Protecting churches and charities from baseless bankruptcy lawsuits \nwill protect key players in the delivery of services to the poor. What \ndo churches do with tithes? What do charities do with contributions?\n  They feed the poor with soup kitchens. They collect used clothing and \nhelp provide shelter for the homeless. And they do it with a minimal \namount of Government assistance. In this day and age, where Congress is \nseeking to trim the Federal Government to its appropriately limited \nrole, we must protect the important work of churches and charities. Mr. \nPresident, S. 1244 is a giant step in that direction.\n  This bill doesn't amend Section 548(A)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code. \nThis means that any transfer of assets on the eve of bankruptcy which \nis intended to hinder, delay or defraud anyone is still prohibited. \nOnly genuine charitable contributions and tithes are protected by S. \n1244. Accordingly, a transfer of assets which looks like a tithe or a \ncharitable donation, but which is actually fraud, can still be set \naside. For example, if someone who is about to declare bankruptcy gives \naway all of his assets in donations of less than 15 percent of his \nincome, that would be strong evidence of real fraud and real fraud \ncan't be tolerated.\n  Mr. President, my legislation also permits debtors in chapter 13 \nrepayment plans to tithe during the course of their repayment plan. \nUnder current law, people who declare bankruptcy under chapter 13 must \nshow that they are using all of their disposable income to repay their \ncreditors. The term disposable income has been interpreted by the \ncourts to allow debtors to have a reasonable entertainment budget \nduring their repayment period. But these\n\n[[Page S4770]]\n\nsame courts won't let people tithe. So, a debtor could budget money for \nmovies or meals at restaurants, but they couldn't use that same money \nto tithe to their church. This is a direct and outrageous assault on \nreligious freedom. And I think it's quite clearly contrary to Congress' \nintent in enacting chapter 13. I doubt anyone would have supported the \nidea that debtors could pay money  to a gambling casino for \nentertainment but could not give the same money to a church as a tithe.\n\n  Mr. President, S. 1244 is necessary at this time because the Supreme \nCourt struck down the Religious Freedom Restoration Act as \nunconstitutional last summer. A badly-divided panel of the Eighth \nCircuit Court of Appeals has recently ruled that RFRA protects tithes, \neven after the Supreme Court case. But that decision is being appealed \nto the Supreme Court. No matter what the Court does, we need to pass \nthis bill now, and to subject churches to uncertainty and harassment by \nbankruptcy trustees.\n  Mr. President, I think it's important to remember that my bill \nprotects donations to churches as well as other types of nonprofit \ncharities. I did this because many well-respected constitutional \nscholars believe that protecting only religiously-motivated donations \nfrom the reach of the Bankruptcy Code would violate the establishment \nclause of the first amendment.\n  Now a concern was recently raised that S. 1244 doesn't protect \nunincorporated churches. That just isn't so. Professor Douglas Laycock, \nperhaps the leading scholar on religious freedom, has written to me on \nthis topic and has concluded that unincorporated churches would in fact \nbe protected. I ask unanimous consent that his letter be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See \nexhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to close on this note. When \nI chaired a hearing on tithing and bankruptcy before my subcommittee \nlate last year, I heard from the pastor of Crystal Free Evangelical \nChurch. This church is the one fighting right now in the Eighth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals to keep the bankruptcy court out of its church \ncoffers. Pastor Goold testified in a very compelling way about the \npractical difficulties his church has faced because of the Bankruptcy \nCode. As Pastor Goold put it, when there's a conflict between the \nbankruptcy laws and the laws of God, we should change the bankruptcy \nlaws because God's laws aren't going to change.\n  Whether someone believes in tithing or not, it's clear that many \nAmericans feel that tithing is an act of worship, required by divine \nlaw. It's completely unacceptable to have the bankruptcy code undo an \nact of worship.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                    University of Texas at Austin,\n\n\n                                                School of Law,\n\n                                          Austin, TX, May 6, 1998.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: The question has arisen whether S. \n     1244 and H.R. 2604 would protect unincorporated churches. The \n     answer is yes; unincorporated churches would be protected.\n       These bills protect organizations defined in Sec. 170(c)(2) \n     of the Internal Revenue Code, which includes any \n     ``corporation, trust, or community chest, fund, or \n     foundation'' organized and operated exclusively for \n     charitable, religious, or other listed purposes. The Internal \n     Revenue Code defines ``corporation'' to include an \n     ``association.'' 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7701(a)(3). An unincorporated \n     association may also be a ``fund.''\n       The language of Sec. 170(c)(2) dates to shortly after World \n     War I. Related sections drafted more recently use the word \n     ``organization,'' which more obviously includes \n     unincorporated associations. See, e.g., Sec. 170b and \n     Sec. Sec. 502-511. The implementing regulations under \n     Sec. 170 and Sec. 501(c)(3) also used the word \n     ``organization.'' 26 C.F.R. Sec. Sec. 1.170 and 1.501. \n     ``Organization'' does not appear to be a defined term. But \n     Treasury Regulations define ``articles of organization'' in \n     inclusive terms: ``The term articles of organization or \n     articles includes the trust instrument, the corporate \n     charter, the articles of association, or any other written \n     instrument by which an organization is created.'' 26 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 1.501(c)(3)(b)(2) (emphasis added) ``Articles of \n     association'' clearly seems designed to include \n     unincorporated associations.\n       The clearest statement from the Internal Revenue Service \n     appears to be Revenue Procedure 82-2 (attached), which sets \n     out certain rules for different categories of tax exempt \n     organizations. Section 3.04 provides a rule for \n     ``Unincorporated Nonprofit Associations.'' This Procedure \n     treats the question as utterly settled and noncontroversial.\n       Tax scholars agree that Sec. 170 includes unincorporated \n     associations. The conclusion appears to be so universally \n     accepted that there has been no litigation and no need to \n     elaborate the explanation. The leading treatise on tax-exempt \n     organizations states: ``An unincorporated association or \n     trust can qualify under this provision, presumably as a fund \n     or foundation or perhaps, as noted, as a corporation.'' Bruce \n     R. Hopkins, The Law of Tax-Exempt Organizations Sec. 4.1 at \n     52 (7th ed. 1997).\n       Borris Bittker of Yale and Lawrence Lokken of NYU says: \n     ``Since the term corporation includes associations and fund \n     or foundation as used in IRC Sec. 501(c)(3) is construed to \n     include trusts, the technical form in which a charitable \n     organization is clothed rarely results in disqualification.'' \n     Boris I. Bittker & Lawrence Lokken, 4 Federal Taxation of \n     Income, Estates and Gifts para.100.1.2 at 100-6 (2d ed. \n     1989).\n       Closely related provisions of the Code expressly cover \n     churches. I.R.C. Sec. 170(b)(1) states special rules for a \n     subset of organizations defined in Sec. 170(c), including ``a \n     church, or a convention or association of churches.'' I.R.C. \n     Sec. 508(c)(1) provides that ``churches, their integrated \n     auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of churches'' do \n     not have to apply for tax exemption. These provisions plainly \n     contemplate that churches are covered; they also prevent the \n     accumulation of IRS decisions granting tax exempt status to \n     unincorporated churches. These churches are simply presumed \n     to be exempt.\n       There are tens of thousands of unincorporated churches in \n     America. I am not aware that any of these churches has ever \n     had difficulty with tax exemption or tax deductibility of \n     contributions because of their unincorporated status. I work \n     with many church lawyers and religious leaders, and none of \n     them has ever mentioned such a problem. There are no reported \n     cases indicating litigation over such a problem. If \n     unincorporated churches were having this problem, Congress \n     would have heard demands for constituent help or corrective \n     legislation.\n       The fact is that legitimate unincorporated churches that \n     otherwise qualify for tax deductibility under Sec. 170 and \n     for tax exemption under Sec. 501(c)(3) are not rendered \n     ineligible by their failure to incorporate. There is so \n     little doubt about that that neither Congress, the IRS, nor \n     the courts has ever had to expressly elaborate on the rule \n     that everyone knows. This is a question that can be safely \n     dealt with in legislative history affirming Congress's \n     understanding that unincorporated associations are included \n     in Sec. 170(c)(2) and Congress's intention that they be \n     protected by these bills.\n       I consulted informally with Deirdre Halloran, the expert on \n     tax exempt organizations at the United States Catholic \n     Conference, and with tax professors here and elsewhere, who \n     confirmed these conclusions. Ms. Halloran would be happy to \n     respond to inquiries from your office if you need a second \n     opinion.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  Douglas Laycock.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I compliment the distinguished Senator from Iowa and the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois for their work on this bill.\n  This is called the Religious Liberty and Charitable Donations Act of \n1998, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote for its passage.\n  S. 1244 will help spell out the safe harbors for tithe-payers or \nothers who contribute to charitable organizations and then find \nthemselves in bankruptcy. It will work, together with the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act in this area, to relieve burdens on often \nstrained organizations that provide important services to our society. \nIt will relieve an untenable burden on the religious rights of tithe-\npayers throughout America.\n  Mr. President, the issue of the status of tithes paid to churches by \nreligiously motivated Americans who find themselves in bankruptcy \nproceedings has vexed tithe-payers and our courts for a number of years \nnow. Vigilant, and some might say over-zealous, bankruptcy trustees \nhave tried to recover tithes paid to churches as fraudulent conveyances \nunder the bankruptcy code. Hundreds, if not thousands, of such claims \nfor recovery against churches have been filed over the last few years. \nThis has imperiled many churches, which operate on the offerings they \nreceive as they come in. By the time a bankruptcy claim is filed, the \nmoney has been spent feeding the poor or otherwise serving the needs of \nthe congregation. Many churches find it very difficult to make up money \nthat has already been spent, and when they can, it weakens their \nability to do the charitable and spiritual work that is part of the \ngrand tradition of religious charity in America.\n\n[[Page S4771]]\n\n  Not only are the churches themselves imperiled, but many believers \nare told by the government that they can no longer pay tithes once they \nhave been in bankruptcy, even if a believing debtor wishes to forgo \nallowable entertainment expenses to pay the tithing they believe God \nrequires of them. This is an unsupportable interposition of Uncle Sam \nand the bankruptcy system between believing Americans and God.\n  I believe we fixed the problem in 1993, when we passed the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act (``RFRA''), which gave greater protections to \nreligious activities across the board than the courts were affording at \nthat time. An early bankruptcy case under that law, however, and the \nposition the Clinton Justice Department took in that case, risked \nundermining those protections. Under pressure from me and others in \nCongress, the Justice Department reversed itself on direct orders from \nthe President. And, luckily, the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals applied \nRFRA`s stronger protections to the case. When that decision was \nappealed to the Supreme Court, however, it was vacated and remanded by \nthe Supreme Court for further proceedings in light of the Court's \ndecision in City of Boerne v. Flores,--U.S.--,117 S. Ct. 2157 (1997), \nin which it held that RFRA was unconstitutional as applied to the \nstates. Upon the review of the Young case, I filed an amicus brief in \nthe 8th Circuit, arguing with others that Boerne had no effect on \nquestions of federal law such as bankruptcy, and so RFRA was \nconstitutional and should apply in the bankruptcy context. I am pleased \nto report that the case of Christians v. Crystal Evangelical Free \nChurch, 1998 WL 166642 (8th Cir. (Minn.)), decided last month, held \nRFRA to be constitutional for federal law purposes and protective of \ntithes in bankruptcy proceedings.\n   The uncertainty caused by Boerne accelerated the challenging of \ntithes as fraudulent conveyances, and in turn spurred our efforts to \nclarify the law. I am glad that RFRA will continue to be of service in \nthis area, but I am also pleased that we will have targeted legislation \nto clear up any remaining confusion without undue confusion during \nfurther litigation. S. 1244 will help spell out the safe harbors or \ntithe payers or others who contribute to charitable organizations and \nthen find themselves in bankruptcy. It will relieve burdens on often-\nstrained organizations that provide important services in our society, \nand relieve an untenable burden on the religious rights of tithe payers \nacross America.\n  Let me thank all of those who worked on this legislation, especially \nSenator Grassley and Senator Durbin, who are leaders on bankruptcy \nissues on the Judiciary Committee, and, in the case of at least Senator \nGrassley and I believe Senator Durbin, are strong supporters of the \nreligious rights of our people. I thank both of them for the work in \nthis area. We have worked to make this legislation useful and \nefficacious. So I urge all of our colleagues to vote for its passage.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield to the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the \nReligious Liberty and Charitable Donation Protection Act of 1998. It is \nan honor to work with my good friend from Iowa on this important piece \nof legislation, and I thank him for his leadership on this issue.\n\n  In an important 1970 Supreme Court case upholding tax exemptions for \nchurches, Chief Justice Burger spoke of the Government's relationship \nwith religion as being a relationship of ``benevolent neutrality''. It \nseems more and more that the Government's ``benevolent neutrality'' is \nbecoming harder to discern, often being replaced with what appears to \nbe ``outright hostility''.\n  A good example of this is found in Federal bankruptcy law. In the \n1995 case of ``In re Tessier,'' a couple filed for bankruptcy under \nChapter 13. Out of their net monthly income of $1,610, they proposed to \ncontinue making contributions to their church in the amount of $100 per \nmonth. This couple had deeply-held religious convictions about donating \nto the church as part of the exercise of their religious faith. They \nproposed spending only $200 per month on food, and nothing on \nentertainment, recreation, health insurance, life insurance, cable \ntelevision, telephone, or even electrical utility service. \nNevertheless, the Bankruptcy Court ruled that during the 5 year \nduration of their Chapter 13 plan, this couple could not make the \nproposed contributions to their church. This was in spite of the fact \nthat the Court would probably have allowed them to spend that sum of \nmoney on entertainment or recreational expenses.\n  The matter of pre-bankruptcy contributions to a church or charity is \nalso a matter of much concern. Several courts have actually interpreted \nthe bankruptcy law to require churches to refund donations made to them \nin the year prior to a debtor filing bankruptcy. In making such \nrulings, the courts hold that donations to the church are ``fraudulent \nconveyances''--that is, by giving the money to the church without \n(according to the courts) receiving something economically valuable in \nreturn, they are defrauding their creditors. In reality, there is no \nfraud involved. And of course you can imagine the potential burden on \nsmall churches that may be just getting by financially--churches that \nhave done nothing wrong--to find that they are required to repay a \nyear's worth of contributions received from a faithful contributor.\n  The Grassley-Sessions bill is a commonsense bill that would clarify \nthe Bankruptcy law to ensure that our courts will no longer make the \nsort of rulings that I have described.\n  Under our bill, contributions of up to 15% of a person's income, or a \nhigher amount that is consistent with an individual's past practice of \ngiving, will not be considered fraudulent when made during the year \nprior to filing bankruptcy. Consequently, innocent churches and \ncharities would not have to repay such contributions.\n  Secondly, our bill will allow debtors under Chapter 13 repayment \nplans to make charitable contributions of up to 15% of their income. If \nbankruptcy law allows for spending on recreational expenses while under \na Chapter 13 repayment plan, it should also allow an individual to \ntithe to their church or make reasonable charitable contributions.\n  Mr. President, this is an important bill which will help to restore \nthe Government to its rightful position of benevolent neutrality toward \nreligion. It will provide necessary legislative guidance in an area of \nbankruptcy law that has gotten off track. I urge my colleagues to join \nwith me in support of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I am honored to support this legislation. Senator \nGrassley has done an excellent job in identifying an unfair component \nof the Bankruptcy Act. If an individual pays money to a nightclub, a \ncasino, or to any other recreational activity whatsoever, that person \nwho received the money does not have to give it back to the bankruptcy \ncourt. If they had given money to a charitable enterprise or a church, \nthey could be required to give it back. And in chapter 13 where an \nindividual pays out their debts on a regular basis, the courts have \ndenied them the right to give money to charitable institutions as part \nof their regular payments while at the same time allowing them \nsubstantial amounts of money for recreational expenditures. We think \nthat is unfair. We think this bill is a sound way to correct that \nproblem.\n  I am honored to work with Senator Grassley and support him in this \neffort.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to stand in support of \nthis legislation. Senator Grassley and I have worked on it, but I want \nto give him the lion's share of the credit because this was his notion, \nhis concept, and he has developed it into a very good piece of \nlegislation.\n  We work closely together on these bankruptcy issues, and for those \nwho are interested in bankruptcy stay tuned; there is more to follow. \nBut I think you will find this bill noncontroversial and certainly one \neveryone should be able to support.\n  The bottom line here is whether or not you are dealing with a \nfraudulent conveyance. Someone in anticipation of bankruptcy may give \naway money and it is said by the court that you cannot do that; if you \nare going to give money away for nothing, then we are\n\n[[Page S4772]]\n\ngoing to come back later on in the bankruptcy court and recover it. But \nSenator Grassley has pointed out, I think appropriately, the situation \nwhere people give money to a charity or a church, and he says that \nshould be considered in a different category. And I agree. As he has \nmentioned in the opening statement, there is a limitation in the law of \n15 percent of your annual income that can be given in this fashion. So \nwe don't anticipate any type of abuse in this area.\n  I thank Senator Grassley. It is a pleasure to serve with him and work \nwith him. We have more to follow on the bankruptcy issue, but I am \nanxious to encourage my Democratic colleagues today to join with us in \nvoting for this legislation.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am prompted by something the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee said which leads me to put an inquiry to him and to \nSenator Grassley.\n  There are a number of bankruptcy districts in the country that are \nfacing very serious problems in handling their caseload. I have been in \nfrequent communication with the subcommittee about this, and obviously \nmy district is one of them. It has consistently now, for 4 or 5 years, \nranked at the very top of case overload of all bankruptcy districts in \nthe United States. Every study that has been made has recommended \nadditional bankruptcy judges, and I note for a fact that the existing \nbankruptcy judges in my district are severely overworked. This is \ndenying economic justice to both creditors and debtors. It is a matter \nwhich needs to be addressed. It is a pressing crisis.\n  Now, the House sent over to us some time ago legislation providing \nfor some additional judges based on comprehensive studies undertaken by \nthe Administrative Office of the Courts and by others. This session is \nmoving along. If we don't get some relief, we are going to continue to \nhave this extraordinary situation which exists in quite a number of \ndistricts across the country in terms of reducing their backlog. It is \na very severe problem in a number of districts.\n  I am prompted by Senator Durbin's reference, and Senator Grassley's \nassent to it, as I understood it, there is more to follow. So I just \nput the inquiry whether this is one of the matters to follow. I would \ncertainly hope so.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I might say in response to my friend, \nthe Senator from Maryland, I agree with him completely. We now know \nthat the caseload in bankruptcy courts has been growing every single \nyear. It really taxes the system, and if not in this legislation, in \nthe following bill I hope we will provide the resources to make sure \nthe bankruptcy courts can respond.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator \nGrassley's bill, S. 1244, which exempts individual tithes to churches \nfrom bankruptcy proceedings. The exemption is up to 15 percent of \nincome to prevent abuse.\n  This problem was brought to my attention by the Crystal Evangelical \nFree Church in Minnesota, which prompted my cosponsor of this important \nlegislation. The Church was sued and required to repay tithes given to \nit by individuals who had declared bankruptcy. Churches depend on \ntithes for their income to operate effectively. They should not be \nliable for debt repayment of their parishioners.\n  This legislation is needed to protect churches from this kind of \nabuse. It is the right thing to do. I commend the Senator from Iowa for \nhis effective leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday's USA Today headline: ``Viagra \nheightens insurance hopes for comfort care.'' The first paragraph says:\n\n       While health insurers try to decide whether to pay for the \n     impotence drug Viagra, a poll shows half of Americans think \n     men should pay for it themselves.\n\n  Mr. President, I will bet those half are women. Women have really \nbeen treated unfairly in this. Senator Olympia Snowe and I introduced \nlegislation last May, the Equity in Prescription and Contraception \nCoverage Act, which in effect said that health care providers that \nprovide prescription drugs should also provide contraceptives.\n  We have waited a year. We have not been able to even get a hearing on \nthis. The reason I am here today is to speak for American women who \nhave been treated so unfairly by male-dominated legislatures for the \nlast many decades.\n  Women pay about 70 percent more for their health care than do men, \nmostly related to reproductive problems. We have a situation where we \nhave 3.6 million unintended pregnancies in this country every year. And \n45 percent of them wind up in abortions. We find these insurance \ncompanies, these health care providers, will pay for a tubal ligation, \nthey will pay for abortions, they will pay for a vasectomy, but they \nwill not provide money for the pill.\n  An average pregnancy, unintended pregnancy, in this country costs an \naverage of about $1,700. I say, why can't\n\n[[Page S4773]]\n\nwe talk about something other than what helps men? Viagra is in all the \nnewspapers, trying to make a decision as to whether or not insurance \ncompanies should pay for this. Why don't we talk about why insurance \ncompanies shouldn't pay for contraceptives, health care providers \nshouldn't pay for contraceptives? It seems that would be a step in the \nright direction. Over half of the insurance companies, health care \nproviders, do not cover this.\n  Our legislation, that of the senior Senator from Maine and me, would \nrequire insurers, HMOs, and employee health benefit plans that offer \nprescription drug benefits to cover contraceptive drugs approved by the \nFDA. This is long overdue.\n  I am just telling everyone here that if we do not have the benefit of \nsome hearings on this--the senior Senator from Maine and I have written \nletters, and we have asked people, and we cannot get the benefit of a \nhearing. This should not be. It would seem to me we should have a \nhearing with the Labor and Human Resources Committee.\n  I have had the benefit of speaking to the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania, who has been very concerned about issues like this in the \npast. And at last resort, we will go to the Appropriations Committee \nand have a hearing there. We should not have it there, but at last \nresort we will have it there. I do not think it is appropriate that we \nhave to legislate on appropriations bills, but as a member of the \nAppropriations Committee, on this, I am going to offer an amendment on \nthe appropriate bill if we do not get some action by the proper \nauthorizing committee. This is simply unfair--unfair--what is going on.\n\n  The same newspaper yesterday, in a different article, said:\n\n       Health insurers that cover the new impotence drug Viagra \n     but don't pay for female contraception are guilty of ``gender \n     bias,'' says the American College of Obstetricians and \n     Gynecologists today.\n       ``Pregnancy is a medical condition, just like impotence. \n     And the cost benefit of preventing pregnancy is much greater \n     than treating impotence,'' says ACOG spokeswoman Luella Klein \n     of Emory University.\n\n  Mr. President, it simply is unfair. Over this last decade, we have \nmoved forward a little bit with the help of the junior Senator from \nMaryland, Senator Mikulski. She and I have worked together. We now have \na program at the National Institutes of Health that deals with women's \nconditions.\n  But, Mr. President, over the years diseases that afflict women have \nbeen ignored. Interstitial cystitis--it is a disease that afflicts \n500,000 women in America, a very serious disease of the bladder--until \n8 years ago, there was not a penny spent on it for research. They said \nit was in a woman's head. They learned that is not the case. Now, as a \nresult of work done at the National Institutes of Health, they have a \ndrug that cures the effects of this on 40 percent of the women.\n  Multiple sclerosis, intercervical and ovarian cancer, and breast \ncancer, and lupus--these diseases, for research, are basically ignored \nbecause they are diseases basically related to women principally.\n  I am saying here, this is really unfair what is going on here. We are \nspending so much time with all kinds of jokes on all the talk radio \nprograms, all the TV programs, about Viagra. But it is not a joke that \nwe have over 3.6 million unintended pregnancies, with 44 percent ending \nin abortion, in this country. And a lot of them are caused simply--in \nfact, the majority of them--simply because women cannot afford things \nlike the pill.\n  We have to do something. Not only does it affect that, Mr. President, \nbut a reduction in unintended pregnancies will lead to a reduction in \ninfant mortality, low-birth-weight babies, and maternal morbidity. In \nfact, the National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality determined \nthat, ``Infant mortality could be reduced by [more than] 10 percent if \nall women not desiring pregnancy used contraception.''\n  So I think it is, again, unfair that tubal ligation, abortion, \nvasectomies, are covered and the pill, contraceptives, and \ncontraceptive devices are not covered. In my opinion, we need to move \nthis forward. We have the support of approximately 35 Senators in this \nbody. We need a hearing, and we need to have this legislation passed.\n  I express my appreciation to the Senator from New York for allowing \nme to go before him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/13/senate-section/article/S4772-3", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4773-S4774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NUCLEAR TESTING IN INDIA\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as the Senate will know, the Government \nof India has announced that two further underground nuclear tests \noccurred at 3:51, eastern daylight time, this morning. These follow the \nthree underground explosions announced on Monday.\n  Now, this might at first seem a reckless act on the part of the \nGovernment of India. But, sir, I would call attention to a statement in \nan Associated Press report which reads, ``The Government said its \ntesting was now complete and it was prepared to consider a ban on such \nnuclear testing.''\n  Sir, this could be a statement of transcendent importance. It would \nbe useful at this time, when tempers--and I use the word ``temper''--\nare rising in the West, to recall the outrage when France carried out a \nseries of underwater tests in the South Pacific in Mururoa Atoll on \nSeptember 5, 1995, to the indignation of many other nations, but \nthereupon signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty the following year. \nAnd, sir, it has not only signed that treaty, it has ratified it.\n  The United States was among the convening nations in 1996 that signed \nthe treaty, but this Senate has not ratified the treaty. The People's \nRepublic of China followed much the same course in completing a series \nof tests and then agreeing to the test ban treaty.\n\n  Just now the press is reporting all manner of administration \nofficials are distressed that the Central Intelligence Agency did not \nreport indications that these tests were about to take place and that \nsomehow we were taken off guard. But I repeat a comment I made to Tim \nWeiner of the New York Times yesterday that it might help if the \nAmerican foreign relations community would learn to read.\n  The BJP Party, the Bharatiya Janata Party--now in office for \nessentially the first time--leads the ruling coalition and has long \nbeen militantly asserting that India was going to be a nuclear power \nlike the other great powers of the world. It is the second most \npopulous nation. In the election platform--technically, a manifesto in \nthe Indian-English usage--issued before the last election, the BJP had \nthis to say: ``The BJP rejects the notion of nuclear apartheid and will \nactively oppose attempts to impose a hegemonistic nuclear regime. . . \nWe will not be dictated to by anybody in matters of security \nrequirements and in the exercise of the nuclear option.''\n  This is hugely important, as is indicated by the enormous ground \nswell of support in India itself in the aftermath of Monday's \nexplosion.\n  In the platform put together by the coalition that now governs in \nIndia, there is a statement, not quite as assertive, but not less so. \nThis is the National Agenda for Governance, issued 18 March 1998. It \nsays, ``To ensure the security, territorial integrity and unity of \nIndia we will take all necessary steps and exercise all available \noptions. Toward that end we will re-evaluate the nuclear policy and \nexercise the option to induct nuclear weapons.'' That is an Indian-\nEnglish term, ``induct,'' as in induction into the military. It means \nto bring them into an active place in the Nation's military arsenal.\n  Now, the President, who is in Germany, announced today that we would \nimpose the sanctions required under law, the Glenn amendment of 1994, \ndirected against non-declared nuclear nations that begin nuclear \ntesting. This is the law and the Indians knew it perfectly well, even \nif we have, perhaps, been insufficiently attentive to bringing to their \nminds the implications of the law. Chancellor Kohl--Germany being a \nlarge supplier of aid to India --was with President Clinton when this \nwas said. We should not underestimate the degree to which this might \njust arouse further resentment in India.\n  The law is there, but also the resentment is there. In this National \nAgenda for Governance that I just recited, there are a number of \nplatform ``planks,'' you might say principles. The second on economy \nreads: ``We will continue with the reform process to give a strong \nSwadeshi thrust to ensure that the national economy grows\n\n[[Page S4774]]\n\non the principle that India shall be built by Indians.'' Swadeshi is a \nturn of the century term of the independence movement meaning self-\nreliance, use indigenous materials, sweep imports out.\n  They are not going to be as intimidated by sanctions as we may \nsuppose. This is the first Hindu government in India in perhaps 800 \nyears. We tend to forget that. When we go to visit India, distinguished \npersons are taken to view the Taj Mahal, the Red Fort, the India Gate. \nAll those are monuments by conquerors --Islamic, then English. It is \nsomething we don't notice. They do. And after 50 years of Indian \nindependence, founded by a secular government which denied all those \nthings, there is now a Hindu government and its sensibilities need to \nbe attended to if only as a matter of common sense.\n  Do we want India in a system of nuclear arms control or don't we? I \nthink we do. I think we ought to encourage them and explore the \nimplications of the statement reported by the Associated Press. And \nwhile we are at it, it would do no great harm to ratify the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty ourselves.\n  I see my friend from Nebraska is on the floor. I look forward to a \ncomment he might make.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I want to ask the Senator a question. \nFirst of all, I don't think there is anybody in the Senate who has been \nmore consistently critical of the Central Intelligence Agency and has \nbeen more diligent in trying to change the way we classify documents. I \nfind both of them to be a bit connected to his comments.\n  One of the concerns I have in all this is that we look for a \nscapegoat. Now, one of the things that citizens need to understand is \nthat increasingly we are getting our intelligence through open sources. \nThat is good because when you get your information through open sources \nthere is a debate. Is what somebody said true or not true--and you \ndebate such things.\n  I quite agree with what the Senator said earlier that for us to be \ngoing at the CIA right now because they didn't report this is a little \nridiculous. All we have to do is read articles of John Burns over a \nhalf dozen months.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Of the New York Times.\n  Mr. KERREY. If we head in the direction of finding a scapegoat here \nwhat we will miss is an opportunity to debate what our policy ought to \nbe toward the largest democracy on Earth. In addition to the other \nthings that the Senator said about India, this is also the largest \ndemocracy. A billion people live in India. Not an easy country to \ngovern.\n  They have a Hindu nationalist party that campaigned on a platform, \nand that platform was that nuclear testing would resume. They were not \nsecretive about that. They did not operate in the shadows on that. They \nwere upfront and they followed through.\n  It seems to me we should blame ourselves for not paying attention to \nwhat is going on there and blame ourselves for not giving enough \nconsideration or concern about the direction of the largest democracy \non Earth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator his 10 minutes \nhas expired.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I ask for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. I am at the end of my question, Mr. President.\n  I just wanted, in addition to making the point that the distinguished \nSenator has been very critical of the CIA--and I think he is quite \nright in this particular instance to say though we may need some \nquestions answered, the biggest question is why didn't anybody in \neither the administration or in this Congress notice that the Hindu \nnationalist party had campaigned on a promise to make India a nuclear \npower. What does the distinguished Senator from New York think this \nCongress needs to do to make certain that we are paying attention in \nthe aftermath of these sanctions to what India is doing, to make \ncertain that, first, we don't miss an opportunity to get them to ratify \nthis treaty, and in addition, to get them to do a number of other \nthings that not only would be in their best interests, but to be in our \nbest interests, as well, since a third of the Earth's population lives \nbetween India and China in this very, very volatile region to which we \nobviously have not paid a sufficient amount of attention.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Well, I would say to my gallant, able friend that the \nIntelligence Committee could do worse than inviting some of the \nadministration officials who are so indignant that the CIA didn't tell \nthem what was going to happen up to say: have you read any Indian \nnewspaper recently? Do you happen to know what the largest democracy in \nthe world is and who they elected in the last election? Have you looked \ninto their party platforms.\n  Mr. KERREY. Personally, I think it would be a waste of money to \ndirect the CIA to read the New York Times and report to us what is \ncontained in there relevant to any part of the world, let alone in \nIndia.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I much agree. May I say to my friend that I was \nAmbassador to India on May 18, 1974, when the Indians exploded a \n``peaceful'' nuclear explosion, as they said, in India on the same \ntesting grounds used this time. It fell on me to call on then Prime \nMinister Gandhi to express our concerns. I have to say that Secretary \nKissinger was mild; he toned down the indignation that came from the \nDepartment of State in his draft statement. I did say to Mr. Gandhi on \nthat occasion, speaking for myself, without instructions, that India \nhad made a great mistake, that it was the No. 1 country in south Asia, \nthe hegemonic country in South Asia, Pakistan No. 3, if you like, then \nyou go down to the Maldives, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka; but in 25 years \ntime there would be a Mongol general in Islamabad with a nuclear \ncapacity, saying, I have got four bombs and I want the Punjab back and \nI want this region or that region, the Kashmir, or else I will drop \nthem on what was then Bombay, New Delhi, Madras and Calcutta.\n  Well, something like that is happening and we better see that it \ndoesn't go forward. So to explore the Indian offer here, suggesting the \noffer, seems to me, a matter of huge importance. We could see the end \nof the cold war, followed by a nuclear proliferation of a kind we never \nconceived. We can see China, North Korea, and Pakistan arming in \nnuclear modes against India and Russia and us looking at an \nArmageddonic future that we had felt was behind us.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I know the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania has come here for other reasons. He used to be chairman of \nthe Intelligence Committee. I know from listening to him that he has an \nactive interest in this issue as well. I have heard him comment many \ntimes. In fact, he asked the administration officials why they don't \nattempt to resolve the conflicts between India and Pakistan and India \nand China, and why do we not pay more attention to it. I suspect the \nSenator from Pennsylvania would rather not spend too much time \ncommenting on it, but by coincidence, we have another individual on the \nfloor who has an active interest in this issue.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the time from 1:45 p.m. to 2 o'clock be reserved for the \nSenator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/13/senate-section/article/S4773-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4774-S4776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from New York for \nhis comments about the problems with nuclear proliferation. I thank my \ncolleague from Nebraska for commenting about discussions that we have \nhad over the years about the issues of proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  I intend to speak directly to a subject that I had talked to the \nSenator from Nebraska about, and that is the need to have activism by \nthe President of the United States in trying to deal with nuclear \nproliferation on the subcontinent. In fact, Senator Hank Brown and I \nhad visited with Indian Prime Minister Rao in August of 1995 and also \nwith Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. I then wrote to the \nPresident on this precise subject. I\n\n[[Page S4775]]\n\nintend to discuss that at some length during the course of the remarks \nthat I am about to make.\n  I believe that the nuclear detonation in India makes it more \nimportant than ever that the United States move ahead with leadership \nto try to defuse the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and \nthat the Senate should act promptly to ratify the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty.\n  We have had, already, in the course of the last 24 hours, indications \nof a chain reaction. We have had a response from Pakistan that they may \nwell, too, test nuclear weapons. We have had a report from North Korea, \nwhich appears in this morning's press, that ``North Korean officials \nhave announced that they are suspending their efforts to carry out the \n1994 nuclear freeze agreement that was intended to dismantle North \nKorea's nuclear program. United States officials said the program was \nintended to produce weapons in North Korea.''\n  So we see what is happening on the international scene. There needs \nto be a very positive response by the United States to the likes of \nthese very, very threatening developments.\n  As I started to comment earlier, Mr. President, Senator Hank Brown \nand I had occasion to meet with both the Indian Prime Minister and the \nPakistani Prime Minister back on August 26 and 27 of 1995. It is \nsummarized best in a letter that I wrote to the President from \nDamascus, dated August 28, 1995, which reads as follows:\n\n       I think it important to call to your personal attention the \n     substance of meetings which Senator Hank Brown and I have had \n     in the last two days with Indian Prime Minister Rao and \n     Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.\n       Prime Minister Rao stated that he would be very interested \n     in negotiations which would lead to the elimination of any \n     nuclear weapons on his subcontinent within ten or fifteen \n     years including renouncing first use of such weapons. His \n     interest in such negotiations with Pakistan would cover \n     bilateral talks or a regional conference which would include \n     the United States, China and Russia in addition to India and \n     Pakistan.\n       When we mentioned this conversation to Prime Minister \n     Bhutto this morning, she expressed great interest in such \n     negotiations. When we told her of our conversation with Prime \n     Minister Rao, she asked if we could get him to put that in \n     writing.\n       When we asked Prime Minister Bhutto when she had last \n     talked to Prime Minister Rao, she said that she had no \n     conversations with him during her tenure as Prime Minister. \n     Prime Minister Bhutto did say that she had initiated a \n     contact through an intermediary but that was terminated when \n     a new controversy arose between Pakistan and India.\n       From our conversations with Prime Minister Rao and Prime \n     Minister Bhutto, it is my sense that both would be very \n     receptive to discussions initiated and brokered by the United \n     States as to nuclear weapons and also delivery missile \n     systems.\n       I am dictating this letter to you by telephone from \n     Damascus so that you will have it at the earliest moment. I \n     am also telefaxing a copy of this letter to Secretary of \n     State Warren Christopher.\n\n  When the news broke about the action by the government of India in \ndetonating the nuclear weapon, I wrote to the President yesterday as \nfollows:\n\n       With this letter, I am enclosing a copy of a letter I sent \n     to you on August 28, 1995, concerning the United States \n     brokering arrangements between India and Pakistan to make \n     their subcontinent nuclear free.\n       You may recall that I have discussed this issue with you on \n     several occasions after I sent you that letter. In light of \n     the news reports today that India has set off nuclear \n     devices, I again urge you to act to try to head off or \n     otherwise deal with the India-Pakistan nuclear arms race.\n       I continue to believe that an invitation from you to the \n     Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan to meet in the Oval \n     Office, after appropriate preparations, could ameliorate this \n     very serious problem.\n       I am taking the liberty of sending a copy of this letter to \n     Secretary Albright.\n       Sincerely.\n\n  When I discussed the meeting which Senator Brown and I had with both \nPrime Ministers in late 1995, the President said that was an item which \nhe would put on his agenda following the 1996 elections. Since those \nelections, I have had occasion again to talk to the President about \nthis subject, and he expressed concern as to what the response of the \nSenate would be and what would happen with respect to the concerns of \nChina. I expressed the opinion to President Clinton that I thought our \ncolleagues in the Senate would be very interested in moving ahead to \ntry to diffuse the obvious tension between India and Pakistan on \nnuclear weapons.\n  That is all prolog. What we have now is a testing of a nuclear device \nby India as a matter of national pride. And I think that is what it is.\n  The new Government of India did give adequate notice, although, here \nagain, I believe there might have been some sharp focus of attention by \nthe CIA. Perhaps it is necessary to talk to the White House even about \ncolumns which appear in the New York Times, or some formal way to warn \nof this threat in a more precise and focused manner, although I quite \nagree with what the Senator from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey, said--that \nit was obvious what the Government of India had intended to do.\n  But as I say, that is prolog. Now I think there is an urgent \nnecessity for leadership from the President to try to diffuse this \nsituation. At the same time, Mr. President, I think there is an urgent \nneed that the Senate of the United States proceed to the consideration \nand ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The essence of \nthat treaty provides that it is an obligation not to carry out any \nnuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion. That \ntreaty has been considered by a number of countries, has been ratified \nby many countries, but it is still awaiting action by the United \nStates.\n  The Senate Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on International \nSecurity, Proliferation and Federal Services held a hearing on this \nsubject on October 27, of last year and March 18, of this year, and the \nSenate Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development held \na similar hearing on October 29 of last year. But as yet, there has \nbeen no action by the Foreign Relations Committee. It seems to me \nimperative that the matter be brought to the Senate floor as early as \npossible and whatever hearings are deemed necessary be held so that the \nSenate may consider this matter.\n  There are some considerations as to objections to the treaty as to \nwhether we can know in a comprehensive way the adequacy of our nuclear \nweapons. But it seems to me that whatever the arguments may be, they \nought to be aired in a hearing process before the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and on the floor of this Senate and then brought for a vote \nby the U.S. Senate.\n  This is a matter of life and death. When we talk about nuclear \nweapons, we are talking about the force and the power which can destroy \ncivilization as we know it. During the tenure that I had as chairman of \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee, I took a look at the governmental \nstructure in the United States on weapons of mass destruction, saw that \nsome 96 separate agencies had operations, and, in conjunction with the \nthen-Director John Deutch, inserted the provision to establish the \ncommission to consider the governmental structure of the United States \nin dealing with weapons of mass destruction. That commission is now in \noperation. John Deutch is the chairman and I serve as vice chairman.\n\n  But it is certainly necessary that matters of this magnitude receive \nearly attention at all levels of the government, including the \nPresident and the U.S. Senate. Where there is concern in the Senate on \nthe subject of testing to know the capabilities of our weapons, it \nshould be noted that article X of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty \ndoes provide for the right to withdraw if the Government decides that \nextraordinary events relating to the subject matter of this treaty \nwould jeopardize the supreme interests, referring to the supreme \ninterests of any nation. President Clinton has stated that he would \nconsider withdrawing if we came to that kind of a situation.\n  President Clinton signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on \nSeptember 24, 1996. Now we are more than a year and a half later \nwithout any real significant action having been taken by the U.S. \nSenate.\n  The 149 states have signed the treaty, and 13 have ratified it as of \nApril of 1998. There is obviously a problem with what is going to \nhappen with Iraq, Iran, or other countries which seek to develop \nnuclear weapons. There is obviously a problem with other nations which \nhave nuclear weapons. But the ban on nuclear testing would certainly be \na significant step forward in diffusing the situation and in acting to \ntry to have comprehensive arms control on this very, very important \nsubject.\n\n[[Page S4776]]\n\n  I urge the President to take action, to use his good offices with \nsufficient preparation, as noted in my letter to him of yesterday, for \na meeting in the Oval Office. Very few foreign leaders decline meetings \nin the Oval Office. That should be of the highest priority on the \nPresident's agenda, and similarly on the Senate agenda. Consideration \nand ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ought to be a \nvery high priority on the Senate's agenda.\n  Mr. President, in the absence of any other Senator on the floor, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have again sought recognition to \ncomment on the issue relating to the conditions which have been set by \nthe U.S. Government on a further meeting with Israeli Prime Minister \nNetanyahu and the difference of opinion of what is adequate to handle \nthe security interests of the State of Israel. It is my view that it \nwas inappropriate and counterproductive for the U.S. Government to \ndeliver what I consider to be an ultimatum to Prime Minister Netanyahu \nthat he accept the further redeployment of Israeli forces as a \nprecondition to come to Washington to meet with the President on last \nMonday, May 11.\n  Secretary of State Albright briefed a number of Senators yesterday in \na room, S. 407, where we have secret discussions, and at that time the \nSecretary of State said that she had not delivered an ultimatum but \ninstead had stated conditions which would have to be met before the \nUnited States would continue to carry forward with the peace process on \nthe current track.\n  I responded to the Secretary of State that I thought it wasn't even a \ndifference of semantics to say that a condition on further discussions \ndid not constitute an ultimatum, that in fact it was clearly an \nultimatum in those discussions.\n  If the diplomacy is carried out in a quiet way, so be it. But when \ndiplomacy is carried out publicly and where the Prime Minister of \nanother country is put in the position where the Prime Minister has to \nback down, it seems to me totally counterproductive and unlikely to \nproduce a result where there will be agreement or compliance even if \nPrime Minister Netanyahu had wanted to do that.\n  When it comes to the question of the security interests of Israel, I \ndo not believe that anybody can second-guess the security interests of \nIsrael except the Israelis and their Government. The view from the \nPotomac is a lot different than the view from the Jordan River as it \nhas been said on many, many occasions. And Israel has been fighting \nmore than 100 million Arabs for more than 50 years. They have won quite \na number of wars, but they only have to lose one war before it is all \nover.\n  Secretary of Defense William Cohen appeared today before the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee, and I asked the Secretary of Defense \nwhether he or anybody in his department had carried out an analysis as \nto the adequacy of security for Israel if Israel agreed to the proposal \nof the administration. I commented in the course of that question that \nI would not think, even if the United States had made that kind of a \ndetermination, it would be binding and might not even be relevant as to \nwhat Israel thought was necessary for its own security. Secretary of \nDefense Cohen said that no such analysis had been made on his part. But \nit would seem to me that as an indispensable prerequisite for the U.S. \nGovernment to take a position that Israel ought to have certain \nwithdrawal at least there ought to be a professional determination that \nthe withdrawal would be consistent with Israel's security interests. \nBut as I say, the Secretary of Defense had not undertaken that kind of \nan analysis.\n  I submit that the issue of Israel's security is something that has to \nbe judged by the Government of Israel. There is no doubt about the \nfriendship and support of President Clinton's administration for \nIsrael. I do not question that for a minute. But where you have the \nnegotiations at a very, very critical point and public statements are \nmade as a precondition which is realistically viewed an ultimatum, pure \nand simple, that is totally wholly inappropriate. It is my hope that \nthese peace negotiations can be put back on track. I know that the \nSecretary of State is going to be meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu \nlater today. The Appropriations Committee has a meeting scheduled with \nPrime Minister Netanyahu tomorrow. I hope we can find our way through \nthese negotiations and put the peace negotiations back on track.\n  I think it is a very difficult matter because while the \nadministration is pressing Israel for a certain level of withdrawal, \nthere are many items which are not being taken care of by the \nPalestinian authority.\n  Last year, Prime Minister Netanyahu had said that Arafat had given a \ngreen light to certain terrorist activities by the Palestinian \nAuthority. And when Secretary of State Albright was before the Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee, I asked the question as to whether there had \nbeen, in fact, a green light given by Chairman Arafat, as charged by \nPrime Minister Netanyahu. Secretary of State Albright made the \nstatement that it wasn't a green light, but there wasn't a red light \neither.\n  I think it is mandatory that the Palestinian Authority give such a \nred light. They cannot be guarantors, but a red light and their maximum \neffort to stop terrorism is required. Under the provisions of an \namendment introduced by Senator Shelby and myself, that kind of a \nmaximum effort against terrorism is a precondition for getting any aid \nfrom the United States.\n  So, these matters are obviously delicate. They require a lot of \ndiplomatic tact. It is my hope that the current stalemate can be \nsurmounted, but I think it can be surmounted only if there is a \nrecognition, as former Secretary of State Warren Christopher had, that \nsecurity is a matter for the discretion of Israel--it is Israel's \nsecurity--and that no ultimatum be issued, or at least no precondition \nbe issued, before the Prime Minister of Israel can proceed to have a \nmeeting or negotiations with the United States.\n  In the absence of any other Senator on the floor seeking recognition, \nI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/13/senate-section/article/S4776-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4776-S4777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NATIONAL URBAN LEAGUES ENDORSES FAIR MINIMUM WAGE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, President Clinton and Democrats in \nCongress strongly support a fair increase in the minimum wage. The \neconomy is in a period of record growth. The stock markets are at an \nall time high. Unemployment continues to fall to its lowest level in a \nquarter century. Yet, too many workers on the bottom rungs of the \neconomic ladder are not receiving their fare share of this prosperity.\n  Most Americans recognize that the minimum wage is not yet a living \nwage. According to an April NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll, 79 percent of \nthose questioned support an increase.\n  Time and again, opponents state that increases in the minimum wage \nare harmful to the economy, and especially harmful to minority \ncommunities. But such statements have no basis in fact, as the current \nevidence makes clear.\n  In his recent ``To Be Equal'' column published in over 300 African-\nAmerican newspapers across the country, Hugh Price, President of the \nNational Urban League, strongly endorses the increase in the minimum \nwage that many of us have proposed, from its current level of $5.15 an \nhour to $5.65 an hour on January 1, 1999 and to $6.15 an hour on \nJanuary 1, 2000. The National Urban League has played a prominent role \nin the civil rights community for over 80 years. Its 114 affiliates in \n34 states and the District of Columbia are at the forefront of the \nbattle for economic and social justice for all Americans.\n\n[[Page S4777]]\n\n  Raising the minimum wage is a central part of the civil rights agenda \nto improve the economic condition of the working poor. I am proud that \nour legislation has the strong support of this renowned organization, \nand I ask unanimous consent that Hugh Price's column be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the column was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                  A Decent Income for Low-Wage Workers\n\n                           (By Hugh B. Price)\n\n       With all the hurrahs over the astonishing current \n     performance of the American economy--the so-called Long \n     Boom--it's easy to forget that portion of the nation's \n     workforce which has hardly shared in the general prosperity: \n     the 12 million Americans who wages range from the current \n     minimum wage of $5.15 an hour up to $6.14 an hour.\n       That sum, earned by people who work in such low-skill \n     positions as fast-food worker and teacher's aide, adds up to \n     a paltry annual income indeed. The average American worker's \n     hourly wage is $12.64 an hour. But an individual working at \n     the minimum wage for 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, earns \n     only $10,712 annually--an income that is $2,600 below the \n     federal government's poverty line for a family of three.\n       That fact, coupled with recent cuts in welfare and Food \n     Stamps programs, has driven increasing numbers of the working \n     poor to emergency food banks and pantries: A 1996 U.S. \n     Conference of Mayors survey found that 38 percent of those \n     seeking emergency food aid hold jobs, up from 23 percent in \n     1994; and more and more private charities are saying they \n     can't meet the greater demand on their resources.\n       We must help Americans who work but often endure great \n     privation move closer to a decent, livable wage. We can do \n     that by supporting legislation in Congress raising the \n     minimum wage to a threshold of $6.15 an hour. Senator Ted \n     Kennedy (D.-Mass.) will try to bring the measure, which has \n     President Clinton's backing, before the Senate after Memorial \n     Day Congressional recess. Representative David Bonior (D.-\n     Mich.) will lead the effort for it in the House. The proposed \n     law would raise the minimum wage by 50 cents each year for \n     1999 and 2000.\n       We should raise the minimum wage because it's only fair: \n     hard work deserves just compensation at the bottom as well as \n     the top of the salary ladder.\n       We know from the experience of the 90-cents minimum-wage \n     hike President Clinton signed into law in 1996 that minimum-\n     wage increases benefit the people who need it most--\n     hardworking adults in low-income families. Based on federal \n     labor department statistics, the Economic Policy Institute, a \n     Washington think tank, found that nearly 60 percent of the \n     gains from that minimum wage hike has gone to workers in the \n     bottom 40 percent of the income ladder. Raising the minimum \n     wage by $1 will help insure that parents who work hard and \n     play by the rules, and who utilize the Earned Income Tax \n     Credit, can bring up their children out of poverty.\n       Contrary to a widespread view, federal statistics show that \n     most workers earning the minimum wage are adults, not \n     teenagers. Half of them work full time, and another third \n     work at least 20 hours a week. Sixty percent of those earning \n     the minimum wage are women; 15 percent are African-American, \n     and 14 percent are Hispanic.\n       Our recent experience has shown that raising the minimum \n     wage in an era of strong and balanced economic expansion \n     won't undermine job growth. The hike President Clinton signed \n     into law in August 1996 increased the wages of 10 million \n     workers. Since then, the economy has created new jobs at the \n     very rapid pace of 250,000 per month, inflation has declined \n     from 2.9 percent to 1.6 percent, and the unemployment rate \n     has fallen to 4.6 percent--its lowest level in nearly 25 \n     years.\n       Some have expressed concern that raising the minimum wage \n     will make it even harder than it routinely is for young black \n     males to find work. Of course, the unemployment rate of black \n     males 16 to 19 years of age remains dangerously high: for \n     1997 it was 36.5 percent. But the minimum wage itself is \n     hardly a significant cause of this decades-old problem, as \n     we've noted before. Keeping the wages of all low-income \n     workers at subsistence levels will likely only exacerbate the \n     employment problems of young black males--and of the \n     communities they live in.\n       Increasing the minimum wage now would restore its real \n     value to the level it last held in 1981, before the inflation \n     of the 1980s drove it down. We further recommend that \n     Congress index the minimum wage to inflation starting in the \n     year 2001 to prevent a further erosion of its value. Low-wage \n     workers should be treated no differently than other, higher-\n     income workers who annually receive at least cost-of-living \n     increases in their salaries. With our economy in such glowing \n     health, there could be no better time to raise the minimum \n     wage. As President Clinton urged in his State of the Union \n     Address: ``In an economy that honors opportunity, all \n     Americans must be able to reap the rewards of prosperity. \n     Because these times are good, we can afford to take one \n     simple, sensible step to help millions of workers struggling \n     to provide for their families: We should raise the minimum \n     wage.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/13/senate-section/article/S4776-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, as a long-time supporter of Israel and \nher security, and as a fierce advocate of the Middle East peace \nprocess, I commend President Clinton, Secretary Albright, Ambassador \nRoss, and Assistant Secretary Indyk for their ongoing efforts to \npreserve and even reinvigorate the stalled peace process. As a member \nof the Foreign Relations Committee, as a Jewish Senator, as someone who \nloves Israel, I have followed this latest round of negotiations \ncarefully. I care fiercely about what happens. And I thank the \nadministration for staying engaged and for making a commitment to a \npeace process that Prime Minister Rabin gave his life for. I will never \nforget my visit to Israel for his funeral service. It was so moving to \nhear his granddaughter speak about him. I really hope and pray that we \nwill have a peaceful resolution in the Middle East. I think it will be \nimportant for the Israeli children and the Palestinian children, and \nthe children of other Middle Eastern countries as well.\n  I have watched with growing concern, over the past several weeks, as \nsome critics of the administration's policy toward Israel here in the \nCongress have launched fierce partisan attacks on the policy. Speaker \nGingrich last week was even quoted as saying, in a press conference in \nwhich he criticized the administration's recent handling of the peace \nprocess, ``America's strong-arm tactics would send a clear signal to \nthe supporters of terrorism that their murderous actions are an \neffective tool in forcing concessions from Israel.''\n  Mr. President, I think that is a demagogic accusation leveled at the \nPresident. I believe that the administration is trying to do the right \nthing. I point out that public opinion polls show that the majority of \nthe people in our country believe that the administration is doing the \nright thing by continuing to put proposals out there, by trying to get \nthis peace process going.\n  The administration has presented no ultimatums. It cannot force \neither party to do what it has no intention of doing. But I think this \nis courageous on the part of the administration. Quite often I am \ncritical of this President, but I believe they are doing the right \nthing. The majority of the people\n\n[[Page S4778]]\n\nin the country believe so, and the majority of the American-Jewish \ncommunity, of which I am proud to be a member, also believe they are \ndoing the right thing.\n  President Netanyahu is meeting with Secretary Albright. It is my hope \nthat they will have fruitful discussions. I think it is terribly \nimportant that this happen.\n  Let me make three points by way of conclusion: First of all, the \nadministration, as I mentioned a moment ago, is not issuing threats. \nHowever, the Bush administration--and I don't mean this as a partisan \npoint, but the Bush administration in connection with policy on \nsettlements did threaten to cut off aid to Israel. There have been no \nconditions of this kind, putting aside whether the Bush administration \nwas right or wrong to do that.\n  I also remind colleagues that this peace process is critically \nimportant, that it is important that we bridge the gaps, that the \nUnited States be a neutral mediator, that we continue to be a third \nparty to which both parties can speak.\n  Finally, I will simply say that all of us ought to contemplate for a \nmoment what will happen if the administration does not press to \npreserve this process and if this peace process collapses. I think the \nalternative scenario, which I shudder to think about, would be an \nescalation of terrorist attacks, with Israel facing newly hostile Arab \nneighbors on all sides and increased pressure from the Arab street for \nviolent action against her. It is frightening to consider. I don't \nthink that stalemate or the status quo is acceptable--I believe it is \nunthinkable. I think it is terribly important the United States \ncontinues to show leadership in this process.\n  Mr. President, this recent crisis in the peace negotiations coincides \nwith Israel's celebration of her 50-year jubilee, an occasion of great \njoy for all of us who love Israel.\n  With the founding of modern Israel, the children of Abraham and \nSarah, survivors of over 2,000 years of persecution and exile, were \nhome at last and they were free at last. But the dream of Israel's \nfounder, David Ben-Gurion, and that of his allies was not simply to \nprovide a safe haven from centuries of Jewish suffering, it was also \nabout fulfilling Isaiah's prophecy of making Israel ``a light unto the \nnations,'' a powerful sign and symbol of justice and compassion to all \npeople of the world.\n  Although it is fitting to pause to celebrate what all the people of \nIsrael have accomplished over the last 50 years, we must also look \nforward to the tasks which face her in the next millennium, chief among \nthem the task of building a just, secure and lasting peace.\n  It is my deepest prayer that our children and grandchildren, 50 years \nfrom this year, will be able to say with gratitude that we were the \ngeneration which overcame ancient hatreds and enabled them to achieve a \njust and lasting peace which has by then embraced the entire region and \nall the peoples. That is a vision worthy of Israel's founder and of all \nof us who come after. It is a vision for which we should and we must be \nwilling to struggle, to fight for and for which all of us must take \nrisks.\n  I come to the floor to say that I do not believe there would be \nanything more important than to forge a just and lasting peace for the \nregion. This would truly be worthy of the dream of Israel's founder.\n  Mr. President, I speak out on the Middle East peace process, again, \nbecause I think there has been entirely too much personal attack and I \nbelieve it is terribly important that all of us who are committed to \nthe peace process not be silent.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Wellstone pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2074 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has approximately 2 minutes left.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. In the 2 minutes I have left, I am going to take \nadvantage of being on the floor of the Senate. After all, I always say \nto my family, you know, I get to speak on the floor of the Senate. That \nis a huge honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/13/senate-section/article/S4777-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PERSECUTION IN INDONESIA\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

We should not be \nsilent. And we should support these courageous students in Indonesia.

Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport S. 1260.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1260) to amend the Securities Act of 1933 and \n     the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to limit the conduct of \n     securities class actions under State law, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill, which had been reported \nfrom the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, with an \namendment to strike all after the enacting clause and inserting in lieu \nthereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Securities Litigation \n     Uniform Standards Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 \n     sought to prevent abuses in private securities fraud \n     lawsuits;\n       (2) since enactment of that legislation, considerable \n     evidence has been presented to Congress that a number of \n     securities class action lawsuits have shifted from Federal to \n     State courts;\n       (3) this shift has prevented that Act from fully achieving \n     its objectives;\n       (4) State securities regulation is of continuing \n     importance, together with Federal regulation of securities, \n     to protect investors and promote strong financial markets; \n     and\n       (5) in order to prevent certain State private securities \n     class action lawsuits alleging fraud from being used to \n     frustrate the objectives of the Private Securities Litigation \n     Reform Act of 1995, it is appropriate to enact national \n     standards for securities class action lawsuits involving \n     nationally traded securities, while preserving the \n     appropriate enforcement powers of State securities\n\n[[Page S4779]]\n\n     regulators and not changing the current treatment of \n     individual lawsuits.\n\n     SEC. 3.

APPLICABILITY.\n\n       The amendments made by this Act shall not affect or apply \n     to any action commenced before and pending on the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today we begin consideration of S. 1260, \nthe Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998.\n  The Banking Committee reported this bill on April 29 by an \noverwhelming vote of 14-4. This bill has strong bipartisan support. It \ncomes as no surprise to anybody who has followed the progress of this \nlegislation. This bill is the product of a great deal of hard work. It \nhas been refined through the incorporation of comments from many \nsources, including the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result \nof this process, this bill not only has been improved, but it actually \nenjoys the support of the Securities Exchange Commission and the White \nHouse.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to ask unanimous consent now that \nletters\n\n[[Page S4780]]\n\nfrom the SEC and the White House be printed in the Record as if read, \nwhich is something we generally do. I think it is so important that I \nam going to take the time to refer to both letters and read what has \nbeen said, so that my colleagues can hear, and those who are interested \nin this debate can follow.\n  This is a letter, dated March 24, from the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, addressed to me as Chairman of the Banking Committee; \nSenator Gramm, Chairman of the Subcommittee; and Senator Dodd, who is \nthe ranking member.\n  Let me read it:\n\n       Dear Chairman D'Amato, Chairman Gramm, and Senator Dodd:\n       You have requested our views on S. 1260, the Securities \n     Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1997, and amendments to \n     the legislation which you intend to offer when the bill is \n     marked up by the Banking Committee. This letter will present \n     the Commission's position on the bill and proposed \n     amendments.\n       The purpose of this bill is to help ensure that securities \n     fraud class actions involving certain securities traded on \n     national markets are governed by a single set of uniform \n     standards.''\n\n  I think that is important, Mr. President. We should understand that \nthose securities traded on national exchanges are governed by a uniform \nstandard. I think that makes ample sense.\n\n       While preserving the right of individual investors to bring \n     securities lawsuits wherever they choose. . .\n\n  So we should underscore that, as a premise, the SEC says, we are \ngoing to look for a single standard, but we will preserve the rights of \nindividuals to bring securities lawsuits wherever they choose.\n\n       . . . the bill generally provides that class actions can be \n     brought only in Federal Court where they will be governed by \n     federal law.\n       As you know, when the Commission testified before the \n     Securities Subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee in \n     October 1997, we identified several concerns about S. 1260. \n     In particular, we stated that a uniform standard for \n     securities fraud class actions that did not permit investors \n     to recover losses attributable to reckless misconduct would \n     jeopardize the integrity of the securities market. In light \n     of this profound concern, we were gratified by the language \n     in your letter of today agreeing to restate in S. 1260's \n     legislative history, and in the expected debate on the Senate \n     floor, that the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of \n     1995 did not, and was not intended to, alter the well-\n     recognized and critically important scienter standard.\n\n  So, Mr. President, we have a concern that was expressed as it existed \nin the 1995 law, and what the Securities and Exchange Commission said \nis, look, we want in the new proposal, as it relates to uniform \nstandards, to clearly identify that you did not do away with, but will \nrecognize the scienter standards. That has been accomplished. And I \nwill go back to that.\n  Our October 1997 testimony also pointed out that S. 1260 could be \ninterpreted to preempt certain state corporate governance claims, a \nconsequence that we believe was neither intended nor desirable. In \naddition, we expressed concern that S. 1260's definition of class \naction appeared to be unnecessarily broad. We are grateful for your \nresponsiveness to these concerns and believe that the amendments you \npropose to offer at the Banking Committee markup, as attached to your \nletter, will successfully resolve these issues.\n  So I think it is obvious that there has been considerable ongoing \ndialog and work between the Chairman of the Subcommittee, Senator Gramm \nof Texas, the ranking member, Senator Dodd, the Banking Committee staff \nand the SEC, to look and to deal with what is not only the proposals \nthat we put forth for the first time, but to deal with some of the \nimperfections and some of the unintended consequences that may have \nevolved as a result of the 1995 act.\n  The ongoing dialog between our staffs has been constructive. The \nresult of this dialogue, we believe, is an improved bill with \nlegislative history that makes clear, by reference to the legislative \ndebate in 1995, that Congress did not alter in any way the recklessness \nstandard when it enacted the Reform Act. This will help to diminish \nconfusion in the courts about the proper interpretation of that Act and \nadd important assurances that the uniform standards provided by S. 1260 \nwill contain this vital investor protection.\n  We support enactment of S. 1260 with these changes and with its \nimportant legislative history.\n  We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the legislation, and of \ncourse remain committed to working with the Committee as S. 1260 moves \nthrough the legislative process.\n  Sincerely, Arthur Levitt, Chairman; Isaac C. Hunt, Commissioner; \nLaura S. Unger, Commissioner.\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in \nthe Record so that it can be viewed in its entirety.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Dear Chairman D'Amato, Chairman Gramm, and Senator Dodd: \n     You have requested our views on S. 1260, the Securities \n     Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1997, and amendments to \n     the legislation which you intend to offer when the bill is \n     marked up by the Banking Committee.

Hunt, Jr.,\n       Commissioner.\n     Laura S. Unger,\n       Commissioner.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I took the time to go through this \nbecause I think it is important that we understand that this has not \nbeen the product of one staff or two staffs. This has not been the \nproduct of just the Banking Committee and those in industry who have \ncome to express their concern as to how it is that their class actions \nare being brought in a frivolous manner, using the State courts to get \naround what Congress debated and what Congress voted overwhelmingly to \nbring, which is a standard of conduct that will discourage a race to \nthe courthouse, simply to bring a suit and simply to extort moneys from \nthose who have deep pockets, because these suits can be long, they can \nbe frivolous, and they can be dragged out. The cost factor to the \npeople being sued is enormous--the time, the distraction, particularly \nto startup companies, and particularly those who want to let people \nknow what they are doing, but who felt restricted as a result of the \nsuits that were brought.\n  I am not going to bother going into the history and the comments that \nhave been made by many. But indeed\n\n[[Page S4781]]\n\nthere have been many, which clearly are a stain on the rightful \npractice of law to ensure the rights of those who have been aggrieved \nand would hold people responsible for actions that are not tortious, \nmalicious, malevolent, and indeed when there are no actions that should \nbe sustained under any court, but because of the cost involved would \nhave insurance carriers, accountants firms, securities firms, \nmanufacturers, and others, be held to a situation where they have to \nsettle. Who do they settle with? They settle with the moneys that come \nfrom the little guy--their stockholders. So while we say ``stockholder \nderivative actions,'' the people hurt are indeed the stockholders.\n  Mr. President, I mentioned two letters. Let me read a second letter.\n  The second letter is dated a month later to myself as Chairman of the \nBanking Committee, Senator Gramm as Chairman of the Subcommittee on \nSecurities, Senator Dodd as ranking Member of that Committee, from the \nWhite House, dated April 28, 1998.\n\n       Dear Chairman D'Amato, Chairman Gramm, and Senator Dodd: We \n     understand that you have had productive discussions with the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) about S. 1260, the \n     Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1997. The \n     Administration applauds the constructive approach that you \n     have taken to resolve the SEC's concerns.\n       We support the amendments to clarify that the bill will not \n     preempt certain corporate governance claims and to narrow the \n     definition of class action. More importantly, we are pleased \n     to see your commitment, by letter dated March 24, 1998, to \n     Chairman Levitt and members of the Commission, to restate in \n     S. 1260's legislative history, and in the expected debate on \n     the Senate floor, that the Private Securities Litigation \n     Reform Act of 1995 did not, and was not intended to, alter \n     the Scienter standard for securities fraud actions.\n       As you know, uncertainty about the impact of the Reform Act \n     on the scienter standard was one of the President's greatest \n     concerns. The legislative history and floor statements that \n     you have promised the SEC and will accompany S. 1260 should \n     reduce confusion in the courts about the proper \n     interpretation of the Reform Act. Since the uniform standards \n     provided by S. 1260 will provide that class actions generally \n     can be brought only in federal court, where they will be \n     governed by federal law, it is particularly important to the \n     President that you be clear that the federal law to be \n     applied includes recklessness as a basis for pleading and \n     liability in securities fraud class actions.\n       So long as the amendments designed to address the SEC's \n     concerns are added to the legislation and the appropriate \n     legislative history and floor statements on the subject of \n     legislative intent are included in the legislative record, \n     the Administration would support enactment of S. 1260.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bruce Lindsey,\n       Assistant to the President and Deputy Counsel.\n     Gene Sperling,\n       Assistant to the President for Economic Policy.\n\n  Mr. President, I make note that the SEC informed the Banking \nCommittee and the Subcommittee Chairman and ranking member on March 24. \nIt was fully a month thereafter, on April 28, that again the President \nreaffirmed his support for this action, and in so doing went out of his \nway to point out that we, indeed, will improve the present state of the \nlaw because of the colloquy that will take place and because of the \nmanner in which the law was written.\n  So here the President of the United States and the SEC and his \nCommissioner are saying you are improving upon the law as it stands \nnow, in addition--we will talk about that--to closing a loophole that \nhas been used by those who rush to the courts to bring suits because \nthey are looking to enrich themselves, not to protect the little guy or \nthe small investors. They are costing the little guy and small \ninvestors money. I think the broad-based support that this bill enjoys \nis a tribute to Senator Gramm. I want to say that for the record. He is \nhere. He worked hard. His staff has worked hard. They have been \nreasonable. The chief sponsors of this legislation, Senators Gramm and \nDodd have put together a tight bill intended to address a specific \nserious problem.\n  The problem to which I refer is a loophole that strike lawyers have \nfound in the 1995 Private Securities Litigation Reform Bill which was \nfashioned again on the most part by Senators Gramm, Dodd, and Domenici.\n  Mr. President, the 1995 Act was passed in the last Congress in \nresponse to a wave of harassment litigation that threatened the \nefficiency and the integrity of our national stock markets, as well as \nthe value of stock portfolios of individual investors. That is what is \nbeing hurt--the little guy, the small individual investor in whose \ncompanies they had a share in were diminished in value as a result of \nthese suits. This threat was particularly debilitating to the so-called \nhigh-tech companies who desperately needed access to our capital \nmarkets to raise the money needed for research, development, and \nproduction of cutting-edge technology. These companies, which have \nspearheaded our economy's resurgence, are particularly susceptible to \nstrike suits because of the volatility of the price of their stock. \nStrike lawyers thrive on stock price fluctuations regardless of whether \nthere is even a shred of evidence of fraud.\n  Mr. President, this is the crux of the matter: That ultimately the \ncost of strike suits are borne by shareholders, including ordinary \npeople saving for their children's education, or for their retirement. \nThe average American goes into the stock market for long-term \nappreciation--i.e., to earn solid rates of return. They do not buy a \nstock simply to be positioned for a class action when the stock's price \ndrops. It is those people, the ordinary investors, who foot the bill \nfor high-priced settlements of harassment litigation.\n  We are not talking about preventing legitimate litigation. Real \nplaintiffs with legitimate claims deserve their day in court. And we \npreserve that in this bill. But what we have seen in our Federal \ncourts, and what we are now seeing in our State courts is little more \nthan a judicially sanctioned shakedown that only benefits the lawyers. \nWe are talking about lawsuits in which we have nominal plaintiffs, and \nthe lawyers are the only real winners. One of these strike lawyers \ndrove this point home best, one of the biggest and one of the largest, \nwhen he bragged that he had ``the perfect practice''. Why did he say \nthat? He bragged about it. He said he has the ``perfect practice.'' \nThis is the fellow who has the largest, has brought more suits, \nhundreds of millions of dollars, who said he has ``the perfect \npractice'' because he has ``no clients.''\n  Isn't that incredible? He has no clients. He recovers hundreds of \nmillions of dollars. When it is recovered, who gets most of it? The \nlawyers do. The so-called clients get hurt because the company which \nthey have stock in loses value. It loses time. It pays millions of \ndollars. It has higher insurance costs, higher costs for auditing. The \nauditors have to charge more because they get sued. The insurance \ncompanies have to charge more for their premiums because they wind up \npaying more. Who do you think gets hurt? The little guy. Who benefits? \nThe fellow who says ``I have got the perfect practice.''\n  Now, let me say this to you. This is a very, very, very small part of \nthe law practice, is very specialized, relatively a handful of \nattorneys who have this, but let me tell you they hold hostage the \ncompanies of America, the private sector of America, as a result of \nwhat they can do by bringing these suits, suits that have no merit.\n  As I have previously mentioned, harassment lawyers found a loophole \nin which to ply their trade--the State court system. In the time since \nthe 1995 Act was passed, we have seen these class-action lawyers rush \nto State courthouses. One witness before the Securities Subcommittee \nsummarized this phenomenon well when he testified that the single fact \nis that State court class actions involving nationally traded \nsecurities were virtually unknown. In other words, prior to our 1995 \nAct, they just were not known. Now they are brought with some \nfrequency.\n  This is a national problem. Regardless of where class actions are \nbrought, they impact on the national stock markets. Money is moved away \nfrom job-creating, high-tech firms. Money is taken from shareholders in \nthe form of stock price decline as a result of litigation. And where \ndoes this money go? It goes into the pockets of a very select cadre of \nthese attorneys.\n  In addition, these lawsuits have a chilling, a chilling effect on one \nof the most important provisions in the 1995 Act and that is called the \nsafe harbor provision. Until this loophole is closed, no company can \nsafely risk issuing any\n\n[[Page S4782]]\n\nforecast, even though the market desperately wants it. So you cannot \nget a company to say: ``This is what we predict; this is what we see,'' \nbecause they are subject to litigation. To do so is to invite a class \naction and a high-dollar settlement.\n  If someone makes a prediction and he is off by a little bit, he is \nsued. If someone makes a prediction, he says: ``We think we are going \nto increase profits or sales by one-third,'' and he doesn't hit that \ntarget, he has a smaller than anticipated increase, that company is \ngoing to be sued. And so you cannot get the kind of advice that \ninvestors are looking for.\n  That is not what we want today. The bill's detractors are wrong. It \nwill not prevent shareholder derivative actions or individual lawsuits \nor lawsuits by school districts or municipalities or State securities \nregulator enforcement actions or lawsuits relating to ``microcap'' or \n``penny'' stock fraud. Those actions will still be permitted.\n  This is important legislation, and it is narrowly drawn to address a \nspecific and serious problem. Time is short. There are very few \nlegislative days remaining in the session, and I encourage my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle not only to support this bill and \nto support the sponsors of this bill, but also that we move forward in \na manner which can see that it is speedily enacted. Every day that we \ndelay occasions more of these suits which needlessly cost consumers and \nstockholders and the American public millions and millions of dollars.\n  Again, I commend the architects of this legislation, Senators Dodd, \nGramm, and Domenici, and I also, again, would point out that we have \nworked very closely with the Securities and Exchange Commission and \nwith the White House in coming to this point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I think it is important at the outset of \nthis debate to try to dispel three misconceptions that surround S. \n1260. The first is that class-action lawsuits alleging securities fraud \nhave migrated from Federal court to State court since 1995 and the \nenactment of the earlier legislation.\n  In fact, as I will describe in some detail shortly, every study \nindicates that the number of securities fraud class actions brought in \nState courts, while it increased in 1996, then declined in 1997. So the \nnumbers do not support that assertion.\n  The next misconception is that this bill would preempt only class-\naction lawsuits from being brought in State court. In fact, this bill \nlikely will deprive individual investors of their own opportunities to \nbring their actions in State courts separate and apart from class \nactions.\n  The final misperception about this bill, which is suggested, is that \nit enjoys widespread support. In reality, a broad coalition of State \nand local officials, senior citizen groups, labor unions, academics, \nand consumer groups oppose this bill. They oppose it because it goes \ntoo far. It will deprive defrauded investors of remedies.\n  Once again, we have this classic example of being able to sort of try \nto address a problem and, instead of narrowly dealing with the problem, \nswinging the pendulum well beyond the problem and taking the so-called \ncorrective legislation so far out that in and of itself it creates \nadditional problems.\n  Let me turn to the first misperception, the notion that securities \nfraud class actions are being brought in State court in order to avoid \nthe provisions of the Litigation Act of 1995.\n  It is correct that the number of such cases went up in 1996, the \nfirst year the Litigation Act was effective, but every available study \nshows that the number declined in 1997. For example, a study done by \nthe National Economic Research Associates, a consulting firm, found \nthat the number of securities class-action suits filed in State courts \nduring the first 10 months of 1996 increased to 79 from 48 filed during \nthe same period in 1995.\n  In an update released in the summer of 1997, however, NERA found that \nthe number of securities class actions filed in State courts during the \nfirst 4 months of 1997 declined to 19, down from 40 in the same period \nin 1996. So the number actually declined very significantly by more \nthan half the first 4 months of 1997.\n  These numbers are cited in a report that was prepared by the \nCongressional Research Service. In July 1997, Professors Joseph \nGrundfest and Michael Perino of Stanford University Law School \ntestified before the Securities Subcommittee, and in their testimony \nthey show that the number of issuers sued only in State class actions \ndeclined from 33 in 1996 to an annualized rate of 18 in 1997. A Price \nWaterhouse securities litigation study posted by that accounting firm \non its Internet site corroborated NERA's findings. Using data compiled \nby Securities Class Action Alert, based on the number of defendants \nsued, Price Waterhouse reported that the number of State court actions \nincreased from 52 in 1995 to 66 in 1996 but then declined to 44 in \n1997. That was lower than the number of such actions in 1991 or 1993.\n  The study went on to find that the total number of cases filed in \n1997 showed little or no change--little or no change--from the average \nnumber of lawsuits filed in the period 1991 through 1995.\n  Data provided to the committee by Price Waterhouse on February 20, \n1998, also demonstrated that State court filings declined in 1997. \nMeasured by the number of cases filed, the number of State securities \nclass actions declined from 71 in 1996 to 39 in 1997. So much for this \nassertion of a rising number of suits being brought in the State \ncourts. This really is a piece of legislation in search of a problem. \nAnd when you look at the facts, when you look at the numbers, the \nproblem is not there.\n  Now let me turn to the notion that this bill addresses only class-\naction lawsuits. I think most people understand a class-action lawsuit \nto refer to lawsuits brought by one person on behalf of himself and all \nother people similarly situated, an anonymous and potentially large \ngroup of people. For class actions to be certified in Federal court, \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require that the class be so \nnumerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. In Federal \ncourt, a judge normally must find that common questions of law and fact \npredominate over questions only affecting individual members.\n  Class actions are a tool that allow plaintiffs to share the cost of a \nlawsuit when it might not be economical for any one of them to bring an \naction. But, because they can be brought on behalf of potentially an \nenormous class, they also carry with them the possibility of being \nmisused to coerce defendants into settlement.\n  This is the sort of situation that is ordinarily described by the \nproponents of such legislation as requiring a legislative enactment. \nBut when you examine the legislation that comes in behind that \nassertion, you invariably find that the breadth of the legislation far \nexceeds this problem which they have identified, and which they \nconstantly use in the discussion and the debate as the example of what \nthey are trying to deal with. If we could limit the legislation to the \nexamples that are cited, we might really come close to obtaining a \nconsensus in this body about corrective measures. But the legislation \ngoes far beyond the examples that are ordinarily used as constituting \nthe basis for legislative enactment, and it is that expanded \napplication of the legislative language, not the specific examples that \nare generally used, which creates the problem.\n  This bill is another example of that. It addresses more than the type \nof class-action case which is ordinarily cited as constituting a \npotential abuse of the legal process. This bill contains a definition \nof class action broad enough to pick up individual investors against \ntheir will. The bill would amend the Federal Securities laws to include \na new definition of class action. It would include as class action any \ngroup of lawsuits in which damages are sought on behalf of more than 50 \npersons if those lawsuits are pending in the same court, involve common \nquestions of law or fact, and have been consolidated as a single action \nfor any purpose.\n  Even if the lawsuits are brought by separate lawyers without \ncoordination--in other words, you have 50 different investors who feel \nthey have been cheated and want to bring a lawsuit--there is no \ninterplay or interaction amongst them, even if the common questions do \nnot predominate--\n\n[[Page S4783]]\n\nwhich is a requirement in class-action suits, but weakened in this \nlegislation--those lawsuits, under this legislation, may qualify as a \nclass action and thus be preempted.\n  So if an individual investor chooses to bring his own lawsuit in \nState court, to bear the expenses of litigation himself, he can be \nforced into Federal court. He can be made to abide by the Federal Rules \nif 50 other investors make the same decision about bringing a lawsuit, \n50 other separate investors. Indeed, the bill provides an incentive for \ndefendants to collude with parties to ensure that the preemption \nthreshold is reached. Such a result goes well beyond ending abuses \nassociated with class-action lawsuits. It deprives individual investors \nof their remedies.\n  The definition of class action in the bill would preempt other types \nof lawsuits as well. It includes as a class action any lawsuit in which \ndamages are sought on behalf of more than 50 persons and common \nquestions of law or fact predominate. The bill specifies that the \npredomination inquiry be made without reference to issues of \nindividualized reliance on an alleged misstatement or omission. This \nwould ensure that the investor receives the worst of both worlds. While \nthe investor could not bring a class action under State law, because \neach investor must prove his or her reliance, they nonetheless \nconstitute a class action under the bill and their suit is preempted.\n  Finally, let me turn to the assertion that there is little or no \nopposition to this bill. In fact, the bill is opposed by State and \nlocal officials very vigorously, as a matter of fact. I note there that \nOrange County has just begun the first of its recoveries, in terms of \nbeing defrauded. Senior citizens groups, labor unions, consumer groups, \ncolumnists and editors, legal practitioners and academics have all \nweighed in on this debate. The headline of a column by Ben Stein in USA \nToday on April 28, summarizes this opposition: ``Investors, beware: \nLast door to fight fraud could close.''\n  ``Investors, beware: Last door to fight fraud could close.'' He wrote \nof this bill, the legislation before us:\n\n       State remedies would simply vanish, and anyone who wanted \n     to sue would have to go into Federal court where impossible \n     standards exist.\n\n  He warns:\n\n       This is serious business for the whole investing public.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this entire column be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From USA Today, Apr. 28, 1998]\n\n        Investors, Beware: Last Door To Fight Fraud Could Close\n\n                             (By Ben Stein)\n\n       If you come home from vacation and find that your house has \n     been broken into, you know who to call. You call the police \n     and then your insurance agent to make up the loss.\n       If someone misuses your credit card, you also know what to \n     do. You call MasterCard or Visa or whoever it is, and the \n     company takes the fraudulent charge off your card.\n       But what if you open the newspaper one day to find you have \n     been defrauded about the stocks and bonds you own? Who do you \n     call for help if management of a company in which you hold \n     stock has lied to the world about a product or its prospects, \n     induced you to buy stock, and then fled with your money?\n       You can file a report with the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission, but we all know how slowly even the best \n     bureaucracies work. You can go to your state securities \n     commission. They might be great people, but they also work \n     slowly--in general taking years or decades--and they often \n     are geared more to punishing the wrongdoer than to getting a \n     recovery for the victims.\n       Also, both the feds and state bureaucracies will be totally \n     overwhelmed and understaffed as a matter of course. You could \n     sue the fraudmeisters yourself, but that kind of suit costs a \n     fortune, literally millions of dollars, and that exceeds most \n     people's losses, not to mention their life savings.\n       So, who will possibly stand up for you and sue to get your \n     money back? The private class-action securities bar.\n       These people are not Matt Dillon or Wyatt Earp, but their \n     livelihood is wholly dependent upon getting results for \n     defrauded investors. They aggregate claims by all of the \n     cheated investors in a corporation and sue to get redress. \n     They almost never make any money unless they get a chunk for \n     the defrauded little guy. They are not angels, and they are \n     not saints. They do it for the money. But they get money when \n     you do, so they have to be persistent, aggressive and \n     ruthless against the cheaters.\n       The people who have done the fraud hate class-action \n     lawyers. So, even more, do accountants and insurance \n     companies. Accountants have often been involved in the fraud \n     or at least ignored it or missed it. They're still around \n     when the business management has gone, so they--the \n     accountants--often get sued successfully. Likewise, the \n     companies that insure accountants for malpractice totally \n     hate the class-action bar for the same reason.\n       In the 1980's, there was a national upheaval in fraud--junk \n     bonds, S high-tech fraud. There were some large federal \n     class-action suits under decades-old consumer protection laws \n     from New Deal days. Naturally, these upset the accountants, \n     the insurers and the high-tech firms. There were some large \n     recoveries.\n       No surprise, then, that the accountants, high-tech firms \n     and insurance companies did what any smart and government-\n     wise group of rich, unhappy people would do. They lobbied \n     Congress, giving immense contributions to representatives and \n     senators. And they got the federal law changed drastically so \n     that it became extremely hard to sue for securities fraud as \n     a class. There was a bar on suits against accountants except \n     in very rare cases, stringent limits on discovering evidence \n     of fraud, and an almost totally impossible level of pleading \n     about how much defendants had to have known.\n       When those who wanted to protect the small investor--and \n     there were such principled men and women in Congress--\n     complained, the friends of the accountants and fraud makers \n     said, ``Hey, maybe the federal law is a bit harsh, but no \n     problem. You can still sue in state court. You still have \n     state remedies.'' President Clinton vetoed the bill, but it \n     was passed, over his veto, by a Republican Congress that I \n     generally love but that sold out totally here. That was in \n     1995.\n       There has yet to be a single recovery for investors in a \n     suit brought under the 1995 law. Now it's 1998, and guess \n     what's happening: congress is racing toward passage of a law \n     proposed by Chris Dodd, senator for Hartford, Conn., \n     insurance capital of the world. The bill, which Congress is \n     to vote on before summer, would spring the trap opened in \n     1995: It would bar all state class-action securities cases.\n       The state remedies that were supposed to remain in place \n     would simply vanish, and anyone who wanted to sue would \n     have to go into federal court, where those same impossible \n     standards exist. The excuse of the accountants and high-\n     tech pooh-bahs is that there has been a huge upsurge in \n     state class-action cases since the 1995 law went into \n     effect. The uncontroverted fact, however, is that the \n     number of state court cases of class-action suits has \n     fallen--not risen--since 1995 in the nation and has fallen \n     in all but three states since 1995.\n       Of course, if you have money in Congress, you don't need no \n     stinking facts. And, the juggernaut of the accountants in \n     Congress is powerful, indeed. They have even managed to get \n     the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, \n     Arthur Levitt, to change his mind. Levitt in recent weeks was \n     saying that state remedies should stay in place until he saw \n     how the 1995 law worked out. He now endorses closing the \n     state courthouse door to small class-action litigants if some \n     changes in the standard of reckless misconduct required for \n     liability are altered slightly.\n       This is not abstruse stuff for law teachers. This is \n     serious business for the whole investing public. The goal of \n     the accountants and their pals in Hartford is to simply kill \n     the class-action bar. They're gambling that their \n     contributions, plus a general resentment against lawyers, \n     will do the trick. But if it does, next time you're \n     defrauded, you'll be plumb out of luck. You can call, but the \n     phone will just ring and ring and ring, and you'll be all \n     alone at 3 a.m., wondering how you can possibly have such a \n     bitter loss without anyone to help.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. A number of groups representing State and Government \nofficials, including the National League of Cities, the National \nAssociation of Counties, the Government Finance Officers Association, \nand the U.S. Conference of Mayors, oppose this bill, as do the National \nLeague of Cities National Association of Counties, Government Finance \nOfficers Association, and the U.S. Conference of Mayors. I ask \nunanimous consent that a May 11, 1998, letter from these and other \ngroups be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA), Municipal \n           Treasurers' Association (MTA), National Association of \n           Counties (NACo), National Association of County \n           Treasurers and Finance Officers (NACTFO), National \n           Association of State Retirement Administrators (NASRA), \n           National conference on Public Employee Retirement \n           Systems (NCPERS), National League of Cities (NLC), U.S. \n           Conference of Mayors (USCM),\n                                                     May 11, 1998.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Re: S. 1260, Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of \n           1998.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: The state and local government \n     organizations listed above\n\n[[Page S4784]]\n\n     write in opposition to S. 1260, the Securities Litigation \n     Uniform Standards Act of 1998, as reported by the Senate \n     Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, which we \n     understand will be considered by the full Senate this week. \n     We urge you to support amendments to the bill which would (1) \n     narrow the definition of class action to follow the Federal \n     Rules of Civil Procedure; (2) allow plaintiffs to carry state \n     statute of limitations laws with them in cases filed in state \n     court which are removed to federal court; and (3) provide an \n     exemption for classes comprised of state and local \n     governments. We also ask that you oppose this legislation if \n     the final version too closely resembles the current version \n     of S. 1260. Our most significant concerns are the following:\n       The consequences for public pension funds and state and \n     local governments which are unable to recover losses in state \n     courts will be significant. If defrauded state or local \n     pension funds are barred from recovering from corporate \n     wrongdoers in state court (having already had many remedies \n     foreclosed in federal court), the state or local government \n     and its taxpayers may be required to make up losses in the \n     fund. Not only would this jeopardize general revenue, leading \n     to a likely loss of jobs and services to the public, but it \n     could also severely damage a jurisdiction's credit rating. \n     This could result in a higher cost of borrowing in the debt \n     market to fund capital and operating expenses.\n       S. 1260 fails to reinstate liability for secondary \n     wrongdoers who aid and abet securities fraud. Despite two \n     opportunities to do so since the Supreme Court struck down \n     for private actions aiding and abetting liability for \n     wrongdoers who assist in perpetrating securities fraud, the \n     current version of S. 1260 does not reinstate such liability. \n     An amendment offered in the Banking Committee which would \n     have allowed defrauded investors to carry with their federal \n     claim the state law regarding aiding and abetting was \n     defeated.\n       S. 1260 fails to reinstate more a reasonable statute of \n     limitations for defrauded investors to file a claim. As in \n     the case of aiding and abetting, Congress has now had two \n     opportunities to reinstate a longer, more reasonable statute \n     of limitations for defrauded investors to bring suit. Many \n     frauds are not discovered within this shortened time period, \n     but the Banking Committee again missed an opportunity to make \n     wronged investors whole by defeating an amendment that would \n     have allowed defrauded investors to carry with them in \n     federal suits the state statute of limitations.\n       The definition of ``class action'' contained in S. 1260 is \n     overly broad. The definition of class action in S. 1260 would \n     allow single suits filed in the same or different state \n     courts to be rolled into a larger class action that was never \n     contemplated or desired by individual plaintiffs and have it \n     removed to federal court. Claims by the bill's proponents \n     that individual plaintiffs would still be able to bring suit \n     in federal court are belied by this provision.\n       There have been few state securities class actions filed \n     since the Private Securities Litigation Act (PSLRA) passed. \n     Despite the claims of the bill's proponents, tracking by the \n     Price Waterhouse accounting firm shows that only 44 \n     securities class actions were filed in state court for all of \n     1997, compared with 67 in 1994 and 52 in 1995. Most of these \n     cases were filed in California, indicating that, if there is \n     a problem in that state, it is one which should be dealt with \n     at the state level. Citizens of the other 49 states should \n     not be penalized as a result of a unique situation in a \n     single state.\n       The PSLRA was opposed by state and local governments \n     because the legislation did not strike an appropriate \n     balance, and this legislation extends that mistake to state \n     courts. As both issuers of debt and investors of public \n     funds, state and local governments seek to not only reduce \n     frivolous lawsuits but to protect state and local government \n     investors who are defrauded in securities transactions. The \n     full impact of that statute on investor rights and remedies \n     remains unsettled because even now many parts of the PSLRA \n     have not been fully litigated; however, this untested law \n     would now be extended to state courts.\n       The above organizations believe that states must be able to \n     protect state and local government funds and their taxpayers \n     and that S. 1260 inhibits these protections. We urge you to \n     oppose preemption efforts which interfere with the ability of \n     states to protect their public investors and to maintain \n     investor protections for both public investors and their \n     citizens.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Why are these public officials concerned about this \nbill? Why are these associations that represent public officials all \nacross our Nation concerned about this bill? Because these public \nofficials invest taxpayers' funds and public employees' pension funds \nin securities. And they fear they will be left without remedies if they \nare defrauded.\n  Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Mayor Harry Smith of \nGreenwood, MS, warned:\n\n       The most potent protection investors have is the private \n     right of action. To remove that protection could have grave \n     consequences. We oppose taking such a risk. We oppose \n     preemption of traditional State and local rights created to \n     protect our citizens and taxpayers. This bill is inconsistent \n     with Congress' renewed commitment to the preservation of \n     federalism, and reduces protections for our retirees, \n     employees, and taxpayers.\n\n  Over two dozen law professors, including such nationally recognized \nsecurities law experts as John Coffee, Jr., Joel Seligman and Marc \nSteinberg, expressed their opposition in a letter earlier this year. I \nask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 January 23, 1998.\n       Dear Senators and Members of Congress: We are professors of \n     securities regulation and corporate law at law schools \n     throughout the United States. Our teaching and scholarship \n     focus on the coexistent federal and state systems for the \n     regulation of securities, an extraordinary example of \n     cooperation between the public and private sectors that has \n     created for American businesses the largest capital market in \n     the world, and for investors one of the safest. As events \n     elsewhere in the world over the past few weeks so aptly \n     demonstrate, the stability and integrity of our capital \n     markets is one of our most important national \n     accomplishments.\n       We are very concerned about legislation now pending in \n     Congress that would preempt private rights of action for \n     securities fraud in class actions brought under the statutes \n     and common law of all fifty states.\\1\\ This sweeping federal \n     preemption of state law is being proposed less than one year \n     after the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 \n     preempted state ``merit review'' of most securities \n     offerings, and two years after the federal litigation system \n     itself was overhauled by the Private Securities Litigation \n     Reform Act of 1995 (the ``1995 Act''), which made it more \n     difficult for investors to recover for securities fraud in \n     federal court. Defendants in securities fraud suits now argue \n     that the 1995 Act contained a ``loophole'' because it did not \n     overturn Congress's decision in 1933 and 1934 to leave state \n     fraud remedies intact.\\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\2\\ Footnoes at end of letter\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Arthur Levitt, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission, however, has strongly urged Congress to wait \n     until more is known about the impact of the 1995 Act on \n     litigation in federal and state courts before considering \n     legislation preempting state rights of action.\\3\\ We also \n     believe that Congress should wait to ascertain the effects of \n     the 1995 Act, as well as the direction of state law, before \n     enacting any legislation that would undercut the longstanding \n     role that state law has had in protecting investors from \n     securities fraud. The complex relationship between federal \n     and state securities laws needs to be more fully understood \n     before investors are denied the protection of either body of \n     law.\n       We therefore urge you and your colleagues at this time not \n     to support S. 1260, HR 1689, or any other legislation that \n     would deny investors their right to sue for securities fraud \n     under state law.\n           Very truly yours,\n         Ian Ayres, Yale University; Stephen M.

These distinguished law professors stated:\n\n       We . . . believe that Congress should wait to ascertain the \n     effects of the 1995 Act, as well as the direction of state \n     law, before enacting any legislation that would undercut the \n     longstanding role that state law has had in protecting \n     investors from securities fraud.\n\n  These distinguished academics oppose any legislation that would deny\n\n[[Page S4785]]\n\ninvestors their right to sue for securities fraud under State law.\n  Similarly, the New York State Bar Association opposes this bill. A \nreport prepared by the Bar Association Section on Commercial and \nFederal Litigation concluded: ``The existing data does not establish a \nneed for the legislation,'' and, ``the proposed solution far exceeds \nany appropriate level of remedy for the perceived problem.''\n  Let me repeat that quote from the report prepared by the New York \nState Bar Association Section on Commercial and Federal Litigation:\n\n       The proposed solution far exceeds any appropriate level of \n     remedy for the perceived problem.\n\n  The opposition goes on. As additional examples, I cite a March 30, \n1998, editorial from the National Law Journal entitled ``What's the \nRush?'' This editorial concludes:\n\n       The Senate should pause before it neutralizes State laws \n     that still stand as a bulwark protecting investors against \n     flimflam artists.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this editorial from the \nNational Law Journal entitled ``What's the Rush?'' and concluding by \nsaying, ``The Senate should pause before it neutralizes State laws that \nstill stand as a bulwark protecting investors against flimflam \nartists,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the National Law Journal, Mar. 30, 1998]\n\n                            What's the Rush?\n\n       You would expect Congress to think long and hard before \n     passing laws that foreclose the right of potential litigants \n     to bring their complaints in the courts. But Capitol Hill is \n     moving swiftly on legislation that would block investor class \n     actions in the state courts, though principles of federalism \n     are in themselves reasons for Congress to proceed with \n     caution.\n       Bills to amend the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act \n     of 1995, which put strict limits on federal class actions, \n     have enormous support: The Senate bill, S. 1260, already has \n     30 sponsors, and a virtually identical bill in the House, \n     H.R. 1689, has 193 sponsors. The Senate Banking Committee is \n     expected to mark up the bill this month, and Senate Majority \n     Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has promised to bring the bill to \n     a floor vote before the Easter recess, which begins April 3.\n       The Senate should slow down--and take a careful look at the \n     evidence. Lobbyists for the high-technology companies that \n     have been pushing for pre-emption claim that plaintiffs' \n     lawyers such as San Diego's William S. Lerach, of New York's \n     Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach L.L.P., are making an \n     ``end run'' around the federal law by bringing their lawsuits \n     in state court. But data collected by Price Waterhouse Inc., \n     a key supporter of pre-emption, show a steep drop in the \n     number of suits brought in state court: In 1996, 71 class \n     actions were filed; in 1997, the number dropped to 39.\n       But this is more than a numbers story. The federal courts \n     have just begun to interpret the 1995 law, which passed after \n     rancorous debate in the House and Senate, and only after \n     Congress overrode a presidential veto. A ruling in one of the \n     first cases filed under the new law, a class action that Mr. \n     Lerach brought against Mountain View, Calif.'s Silicon \n     Graphics Inc., threatens to wipe out ``recklessness'' as a \n     sufficient standard of intent in securities fraud cases.\n       The Securities and Exchange Commission is supporting Mr. \n     Lerach's appeal of this ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court \n     of Appeals, but the court won't hear arguments until next \n     year. By then, Congress may have already blocked state court \n     suits, leaving plaintiffs in investor suits without a forum \n     to assert reckless conduct and, ergo, leaving corporate \n     wrongdoers free to behave irresponsibly.\n       Other protections available in state court would also be \n     lost. In 33 states, the statutes of limitation on filing suit \n     are longer than the one-year federal limit. Liability for \n     ``aiding and abetting'' a securities fraud--which was \n     eliminated in federal court actions by a 1994 U.S. Supreme \n     Court ruling--also exists in most states.\n       Before the Senate rushes to wipe out state fraud actions, \n     it should recall the words of Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., \n     who co-sponsored the 1995 act. Addressing criticisms that the \n     new law would allow financiers like Lincoln Savings & Loan's \n     Charles V. Keating to escape liability, Senator Domenici \n     pointed out that Mr. Keating had been sued under many \n     provisions of state law--``laws untouched'' by his proposed \n     reforms.\n       The Senate should pause before it neutralizes state laws \n     that still stand as a bulwark, protecting investors against \n     flimflam artists.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to point out also the \nopposition of the American Association of Retired Persons, the Consumer \nFederation of America, the AFL-CIO, the American Federation of State, \nCounty and Municipal Employees, and the United Mine Workers. I ask \nunanimous consent that letters from these groups expressing their \nopposition to this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      AFL-CIO,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 1998.\n       Dear Senator: Labor unions have an enormous stake in \n     protecting workers' hard-earned retirement savings from \n     securities fraud. Over $300 billion in union members' pension \n     assets are invested in the stock market. Thus, as \n     shareholders and investors, unions and employees count on the \n     protection of both state and federal laws and regulations to \n     protect their investments and to preserve the integrity of \n     the market. For this reason, the AFL-CIO urges you to oppose \n     S. 1260, the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act.\n       State laws can and do provide even greater protection for \n     small investors than is provided by the federal securities \n     laws. Until now, it has been up to each state to decide \n     whether and how to offer enhanced antifraud protections to \n     its citizens.\n       This well established, dual system of state and federal \n     protection is now threatened, however, S. 1260 preempts \n     investor-friendly state laws and substitutes the federal \n     Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA), which would \n     significantly limit the liability of fraud defendants.\n       In particular, the bill would hurt individual investors, \n     including workers and pensioners, by denying them the ability \n     to pursue effective redress through a class action. In \n     broadly held publicly traded companies, class action \n     litigation is the only economically feasible way in which \n     shareholders can bring security fraud claims. Generally, even \n     the largest institutional shareholders will not pursue a \n     valid claim individually, because their possible individual \n     benefit will not compensate for the costs incurred in \n     bringing such litigation. In light of the SEC's limited \n     resources, private class action litigation has always been \n     the primary means for both institutions and individual \n     shareholders to recoup losses from securities fraud and has \n     been a powerful deterrent to managerial impropriety.\n       Tampering with the state's antifraud authority would place \n     at risk the retirement savings of tens of millions of \n     Americans. Aside from the obvious flaws, the proposed \n     legislation also disturbs the state/federal balance by \n     removing an important state role in the antifraud field \n     without any sound justification. The AFL-CIO asks you to \n     oppose this bill.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Peggy Taylor,\n\n                                                         Director,\n     Department of Legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Consumer Federation\n\n\n                                                   of America,\n\n                                          Washington, May 7, 1998.\n       Dear Senator: It is our understanding that the Senate will \n     vote next week on S. 1260, ``The Securities Litigation \n     Uniform Standards Act of 1997.'' I am writing on behalf of \n     Consumer Federation of America to reiterate our strong \n     opposition to this anti-investor legislation and to urge you \n     to oppose it.\n       Our opposition is based on a simple principle: Congress \n     should not extend federal standards to securities fraud class \n     action lawsuits being brought in state court until we know \n     whether those federal standards are preventing meritorious \n     cases from being brought or reducing victims' recoveries. \n     Caution is particularly warranted in this case since both the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission and the state securities \n     regulators opposed the Private Securities Litigation Reform \n     Act on the grounds that it would tip the balance too far in \n     favor of fraud defendants.\n       The jury is still out on the PSLRA, since its major \n     provisions have yet to be defined in court and there has yet \n     to be a single recovery for investors under the 1995 law. It \n     would be nothing short of irresponsible, in our view, for \n     Congress to preempt state laws without first knowing the full \n     effects of the federal law on meritorious lawsuits.\n       Supporters have made much of the fact that Securities and \n     Exchange Commission Arthur Levitt now supports S. 1260, \n     having announced his change of heart at his confirmation \n     hearing in April. It is important to understand that nothing \n     in the few cosmetic changes negotiated by Chairman Levitt \n     alters the fundamentally anti-investor nature of this bill.\n       Furthermore, even as he made his unfortunate decision to \n     endorse the legislation, Chairman Levitt did not withdraw \n     earlier statements that the current federal law tilts the \n     balance too far in favor of securities fraud defendants. Nor \n     did he withdraw statements that this legislation is premature \n     based on the limited data now available. Most importantly, he \n     did not withdraw his assessment, expressed in October \n     testimony before the Senate Banking Committee ``. . . that \n     the bill would deprive investors of important protections, \n     such as aiding and abetting liability and longer statutes of \n     limitation, that are only available under state law'' and \n     that ``great care should be taken to safeguard the benefits \n     of our dual system of federal and state law, which has served \n     investors well for over 60 years.''\n\n[[Page S4786]]\n\n       During the Banking Committee's mark-up of the bill, \n     amendments were offered that would have allowed defrauded \n     investors to rely on longer statutes of limitations and \n     aiding and abetting liability where they were available in \n     state law and would have prevented state courts from \n     consolidating individual lawsuits brought against a common \n     defendant for the purposes of forcing the case into federal \n     court. While these amendments alone cannot alter the \n     fundamental flaws in this legislation, they would ameliorate \n     some of the bill's most onerous effects. CFA believes these \n     pro-investor changes are the minimum necessary to provide a \n     modicum of balance to the bill. Should similar amendments be \n     offered on the Senate floor, we urge you to support them.\n       As you consider this legislation, keep in mind that just \n     under half of all American households now invest in the stock \n     market directly or through mutual funds. Their primary reason \n     for investing is to provide a decent standard of living for \n     themselves in retirement. When the current bull market comes \n     to its inevitable end, and the frauds that have been \n     perpetrated under its cover are exposed, investors who find \n     their retirement savings decimated by fraud should not be \n     left without any means of recovering those losses.\n       Because it threatens to further restrict defrauded \n     investors' access to justice, CFA urges you to vote against \n     S. 1260.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n                                                    Barbara Roper,\n                                  Director of Investor Protection.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, much will be made during the debate on \nthis bill of the support it is asserted it enjoys from the Securities \nand Exchange Commission. But it seems to me that citing the support of \nthe SEC tells only part of the story--only part of the story.\n  First, SEC Commissioner Norman Johnson has written to express his \nopposition to the bill. His March 24, 1998, letter concludes:\n\n       I believe that much more conclusive evidence than currently \n     exists should be required before state courthouse doors are \n     closed to small investors through the preclusion of state \n     class actions for securities fraud.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have Commissioner Johnson's letter printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                                    Securities and\n\n\n                                          Exchange Commission,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 1998.\n     Hon. Alfonse M. D'Amato,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Securities, U.S. Senate, Senate \n         Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Securities, U.S. Senate, \n         Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman D'Amato, Chairman Gramm, and Senator Dodd: It \n     is with regret that I find myself unable to join in the views \n     expressed by my esteemed colleagues in their letter of \n     today's date. For that reason I feel compelled to write \n     separately to express my own differing views.\n       Consistent with the opinion the Commission and its staff \n     have repeatedly taken, I believe that there has been \n     inadequate time to determine the overall effects of the \n     Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and that \n     the proponents of further litigation reform have not \n     demonstrated the need for preemption of state remedies or \n     causes of action at this time.\n       In the last few years, we have experienced a sustained bull \n     market virtually unmatched at any time during this nation's \n     history. I therefore question the necessity of the \n     displacement of state law in favor of a single set of uniform \n     federal standards for securities class action litigation. The \n     Commission is the federal agency charged with protecting the \n     rights of investors. In my opinion, S. 1260, the Securities \n     Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1997, does not promote \n     investors' rights. I share in the views of 27 of this \n     country's most respected securities and corporate law \n     scholars who have urged you and your colleagues not to \n     support S. 1260 or any other legislation that would deny \n     investors their right to sue for securities fraud under state \n     law.\n       In addition, data amassed by the Commission's staff, \n     compiled in unbiased external studies, indicate that the \n     number of state securities class actions has declined during \n     the last year to pre-Reform Act levels. Indeed, a report by \n     the National Economic Research Associates concluded that the \n     number of state court filings in 1996 was ``transient.'' \n     Under these circumstances, S. 1260 seems premature at the \n     least.\n       This country has a distinguished history of concurrent \n     federal and state securities regulation that dates back well \n     over 60 years. Given that history, as well as the strong \n     federalism concerns that S. 1260 raises, I believe that much \n     more conclusive evidence than currently exists should be \n     required before state courthouse doors are closed to small \n     investors through the preclusion of state class actions for \n     securities fraud.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Norman S. Johnson,\n                                                     Commissioner.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Secondly, the SEC supports changes to the Federal \nantifraud standard to make it more protective of investors. In other \nwords, if the SEC is going to be cited, as the proponents of this \nlegislation have done, in support of their position, surely then they \nought to pay attention to the SEC position which has been asserted \nseeking changes in the Federal antifraud standard to make it more \nprotective. Let me give you a few examples.\n  The SEC supports a longer statute of limitations so that fraud \nartists do not escape liability by successfully concealing their \nfrauds. The SEC supports the restoration of liability for aiders and \nabetters of securities fraud so that those who give substantial \nassistance to fraud artists do not escape liability.\n  The SEC supports codification of liability--codification of \nliability--for reckless conduct to ensure that professionals, such as \naccountants and underwriters, carry out their responsibilities under \nthe Federal securities laws. In fact, Chairman Levitt reiterated his \nsupport for these provisions as recently as 6 weeks ago when he \nappeared before the Banking Committee for his renomination hearing. \nNonetheless, these provisions are nowhere to be found in this bill.\n  The supporters of this legislation argue the desirability of a \nuniform antifraud standard for securities traded on national securities \nexchanges, but they fail to address directly the question which we need \nto ask, whether the current Federal antifraud standard, as reflected by \nthe 1995 act, deserves to be the uniform standard. Is the current \nantifraud standard, which they are now going to use to bring cases up \nfrom the State courts and deny investors the remedies under the State \nsystems, is that standard adequate to protect investors?\n  I voted against the 1995 act because I was concerned that it did not \nestablish an appropriate standard. I was worried that it did not strike \nthe proper balance between deterring frivolous securities suits and \nprotecting investors who are victimized by securities fraud. None of us \nis in favor of frivolous securities suits, these so-called strike \nsuits. But at the same time, I, for one, at least, do not want to go so \nfar in trying to deal with that problem that I cease to protect \ninvestors who are victimized by securities fraud. There is a line in \nbetween, actually, I have asserted many times, I think, on which a \nconsensus can be reached, but the legislation that keeps coming forward \nalways overreaches--it overreaches--and therefore, I think, jeopardizes \nthe protections that are available to investors who are innocent \nvictims of securities frauds.\n  A number of securities law experts warn that the safe harbor for \nforward-looking statements enacted by that act could protect fraud. In \naddition, the proportionate liability provisions leave innocent victims \nsuffering a loss while shielding those who participate in securities \nfraud. Of course, the 1995 act omitted the statute of limitations in \naiding and abetting provisions recommended by the SEC, still \nrecommended by the SEC, and, of course, not included in this \nlegislation.\n  Since the reform act was enacted, another concern has developed. Some \ndistrict courts have relied on the legislative history of that act in \nconcluding that the act's pleading standards eliminated liability for \nreckless conduct. Imagine, eliminating liability for reckless conduct.\n  If that view prevails in the circuit courts, and if the Congress \npreempts, as this legislation proposes to do, causes of action under \nState laws, investors will be left with no remedies--I underscore that, \nwith no remedies--against those whose reckless conduct makes a \nsecurities fraud possible.\n  It is for these reasons that the associations and various \ncommentators I have cited are opposing this bill. They oppose this bill \nboth because of its overly broad reach--clearly because of its overly \nbroad reach--and because its sponsors fail to take this opportunity to \ncorrect the flaws of the earlier legislation. If the sponsors are going \nto eliminate recourse in the State courts, it becomes even more \nincumbent upon them to correct the Federal standard with respect to the \nshortcomings which\n\n[[Page S4787]]\n\nhave been identified in it and continue to be identified by the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. BRYAN. The question I have is with reference to the Senator's \nobservation about standard for reckless misconduct.\n  As I understand, we have actual knowledge, we can have simple or \nordinary negligence, we can have gross negligence, and then we can have \na standard of reckless conduct which is an utter disregard of the \nfacts. Is the Senator saying that the legislation that we are \nprocessing today does not clarify in the findings of this committee \nthat we want to reaffirm that reckless misconduct ought to be a cause \nof action for those who are defrauded by investors?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I say to my colleague, as I understand it, this is what \ntranspired. The 1995 act was being interpreted at the district court \nlevel, the Federal district court level--the legislative history of \nit--that the act's pleading standards eliminated liability for reckless \nconduct.\n  Now, the SEC has come to us and said we should codify a reckless \nconduct right of action into the Federal standard. The legislation \nbefore us does not have such a codification.\n  Now, there is language in the report, but we do not have a \ncodification. So you have the problem about the legislative history for \nthe 1998 act. And it is not quite clear to me how it will supplant the \nlegislative history for the 1995 act. A codification would do that but \nthat is not in this bill.\n  Mr. BRYAN. We are talking about, if I understand, conduct that is \nmore egregious even than gross negligence. We are talking about an \nutter disregard of the facts and the consequences that flow from that?\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is right. If you want to talk about where you put \nthe balance, how in the world would you drive the balance so far over \nthat an investor who was the victim of reckless conduct would not have \na remedy? It just defies any equitable striking of the balances with \nrespect to, quote, ``frivolous'' lawsuits on the one hand, and investor \nprotection on the other.\n  Mr. BRYAN. So if I understand the Senator's position, if S. 1260 is \npassed, we preempt State class actions so that small investors would \nnot have the advantage of a longer statute of limitations that a number \nof States--I believe 33 out of the 50--provide to investors suing at \nthe State level class actions.\n  We would deprive the small investor of his or her opportunity to go \nagainst the accomplices, the lawyers, the accountants, and others who \nconspired with the primary perpetrator of fraud. That protection is \ntaken away. And we also eliminate the ability to move and to obtain a \njoint and several liability judgment against those offenders. They are \nall things which I understand currently exist to the benefit of small \ninvestors as class actions at the State level in most States, if I am \nnot mistaken.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is correct. Currently, what happened is we \nset a Federal standard in the 1995 act in the Federal courts. That \nstill left to an investor the option of going into a State court to \nseek remedy.\n  Now the proponents of this bill said, ``Well, everyone who is going \ninto Federal court bringing the so-called frivolous suits are now going \nto migrate into the State courts.'' The numbers show that has not \nhappened. You have a little increase in 1996. The numbers came back \ndown in 1997. The projected numbers are down. So you do not have that \nflood of litigation into the State courts, and yet investors had \navailable to them State court remedies.\n  Well, now what they are going to do is they are going to preempt the \nability to bring the action in the State courts. Well, then, the \nproponents will say, ``Well, we are just preempting it for these class \nactions. If you are an individual investor and you want to hire your \nlawyer, you will still be able to go into State court.'' But they \ndefine a class action in this bill in such a way, so broadly that it \nwill sweep up individual investors who are really not part of a class-\naction suit.\n  Those individual investors will then discover--I mean, what is going \nto happen here, my prediction on this is that what is going to come \nbefore the Congress down the road, if this legislation passes, is small \ninvestors showing up in the Congress and saying, ``This happened to me. \nAnd now I discover, because of the legislation which you all enacted, I \ncan't get any remedy. And this isn't right.'' And Members are going to \nbe looking at that, and they are going to say it is not right.\n  That is why we are urging Members to pause and take a careful look at \nthis before they put it into law. You can have a situation in which an \nindividual investor goes in under State law within the statute of \nlimitations. Often you do not discover these things. They are \nconcealed. That is what fraud is all about. So he is within the statute \nof limitations. Other investors do the same thing.\n  So let us say it is New York or California or Illinois, and a whole \nwide group of people have been defrauded by some fraud artist. Well, if \n50 of them come in and bring some kind of suit against this artist, \nthey can be swept up into a class action, removed into the Federal \ncourt. They will go over to the Federal court, and then they say to \nthem, ``Well, our statute of limitations is shorter than your State \nstatute of limitations under which you filed this action,'' which was \ntimely filed in the State court.\n  They acted on their rights within the time limitation of the State \ncourt. They had no idea they were going to get swept up the way this \nbill permits. And so all of a sudden they are over in Federal court, \nand they say to them ``It's too bad. The statute of limitations has \nrun. And you don't have an action. You don't have a cause of action.'' \nYou are shut out of the courthouse.\n  Now, where is the fairness in that? I defy anyone to show me the \nfairness in that process.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Is the Senator also suggesting that a remedy available at \nthe State court level against an accomplice, whether it be a lawyer or \nan accountant, that would be available to the investor under State law, \nif removed under the process of the Federal court, which the Senator \nhas just described, would preclude that small investor from a recovery \nagainst an accomplice who had participated in the fraud that resulted \nin the investor's loss?\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is exactly on point. That is exactly what \nwould happen, which would be exactly what would be permitted to take \nplace under this legislation.\n  When the 1995 bill was passed, people said, ``Well, we are defining \nthis Federal standard. People can still go into the State court, the \nindividual investor, and get a remedy.''\n  Now they come along and they say, ``Well, we're going to preempt the \nState courts in quote, `class actions,''' but then they define class \nactions so broadly that it will sweep up individual investors. It can \nsweep up people who are not bringing what we traditionally recognize \nand know as a class action.\n  So it is once again an example of overreaching, as this mayor \nindicated from Greenwood, MS, that removing these protections would \nhave grave consequences. This thing goes beyond anything that is \nrequired to deal with--the New York State Bar Association quote, I \nthink, is the best on this very point when they said, ``The proposed \nsolution far exceeds any appropriate level of remedy for the perceived \nproblem.''\n  I am saying to the opponents, look, let us examine what you assert as \nthe problem. And we will hear examples of a problem that will be cited. \nMost of those examples, I am sure I would think something needs to be \ndone about them. But the solution, the proposed solution here will far \nexceed the examples. What is going to happen is eventually--and that is \nwhy I think these people are opposing this legislation I have cited.\n  I think Senators need to be cautious. This, in effect, is an \ninvestor's beware legislation--investors beware. I think in the future \nwe are going to be petitioned or importuned in the Congress to correct \nthis overreaching because innocent people will have been denied their \nremedy against fraud artists who have cheated them out of their life \nsavings.\n  Let me just note that we are at a time of record high in our Nation's\n\n[[Page S4788]]\n\nstock market. The current bull market is the longest in history. Stocks \nare trading at a price-earnings ratio that exceed even those reported \nin the 1920s. The level of participation in the stock market by \nAmerica's families is also at a record level, both directly through \nownership of stocks and indirectly through pension funds and mutual \nfunds. History suggests that at some point the bull market will end, \nand history also suggests that when that occurs is when securities \nfraud will be exposed. You don't get that much exposure in a rising \nmarket.\n\n  Should this bill be enacted, at that time many investors will find \ntheir State court remedies eliminated. In too many cases investors will \nbe left without any effective remedies at all. Such a result can only \nharm innocent investors, undermine public confidence in the securities \nmarket, and ultimately raise the cost of capital for deserving American \nbusinesses.\n  I urge my colleagues to think long and hard about this legislation, \nto be very careful about it. It far exceeds what needs to be done in \nterms of addressing any perceived problem. I think we need to be \nextremely sensitive to it.\n  I expect a number of amendments to be offered to this bill as we \nproceed with its consideration. I look forward to discussing those at \nthe appropriate time as we seek to correct what I think are some of the \nmore obvious and egregious flaws in this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, let me begin by thanking my chairman of \nthe committee, Senator D'Amato, and Senator Gramm with whom I authored \nthis particular proposal.\n  Senator Domenici has been very involved in this issue, going back a \nnumber of years when the issue first arose, trying to deal with this \nsinister practice going on of strike lawsuits and predator law firms. I \nwill share briefly some news out this morning as to how the law firms \nthat we are trying to deal with operate, where the issue of fraudulent \nbehavior is hardly their motivation; it has to do with simple stock \nfluctuation. Some Internet activity today will highlight that in \ncategorical terms, as early as about 4 or 5 hours ago. This is a \npervasive problem that needs to be addressed.\n  We passed this bill out of our committee 14-4 on a strong bipartisan \nvote. The bill is endorsed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, \nsupported by this administration, the Clinton administration. We will \nbe happy to entertain the amendments as they are offered that come up \nthat were raised in committee. We had hearings on this matter--not a \nlengthy markup, but an extensive markup--with an opportunity to vote a \nlot of the issues.\n  I will pick up on some of the concluding comments and remarks of my \ntwo colleagues from Maryland and Nevada with regard to the recklessness \nstandard. We received a letter of endorsement and support from the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, signed by Chairman Arthur Levitt, \nIsaac Hunt, and Laura Unger, March 24. This letter, I believe, has been \nintroduced in the Record by Chairman D'Amato, but I am, at this \njuncture, going to highlight two paragraphs of this letter because they \ngo right to the heart of what was raised a few moments ago when it \ncomes to the recklessness standard. I will address this more directly \nin my remarks. Let me quote two paragraphs in this letter.\n\n       As you know, when the Commission testified before the \n     Securities Subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee in \n     October 1997, we identified several concerns about S. 1260. \n     In particular, we stated that a uniform standard for \n     securities fraud class actions that did not permit investors \n     to cover losses attributable to reckless misconduct would \n     jeopardize the integrity of the securities markets. In light \n     of this profound concern, we are gratified by the language in \n     your letter of today agreeing to restate in S. 1260's \n     legislative history, and in the expected debate on the Senate \n     floor, that the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of \n     1995 did not, and was not intended to, alter the well-\n     recognized and critically important scienter standard.\n\n  Jumping down another paragraph,\n\n       The ongoing dialog between our staffs has \n     been constructive. The result of this dialog, we believe, \n     is an improved bill with legislative history that makes \n     clear, by reference to the legislative debate in 1995, \n     that Congress did not alter in any way the recklessness \n     standard when it enacted the Reform Act.\n\n  Then it goes on to complete the paragraph.\n  I don't know if anything can be more clear in this letter. Certainly \nthe intent, stated in committee, stated on the floor previously, stated \nin this letter, and we stated again here on the floor today as to what \nthe intentions were of those of us who crafted this legislation when it \ncomes to ``recklessness.''\n  Now I agree. I mentioned earlier, some courts, a few district courts, \nhave read otherwise. That happens. But we will try to make it clear \nthat was aberrational behavior, erroneous behavior, in my view, rather \nthan what we intended.\n  I see my colleague from New York is rising.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. If the Senator will yield for a question, is it not \ntrue, if we were to set aside this legislation and not go forward, \nthere might be a question and that, indeed, what both the White House \nand the SEC are saying, as a result of our coming forward, we may be \neliminating that question, that ambiguity, by moving forward in the way \nthat we proposed in this legislation?\n  Mr. DODD. I think the chairman of committee raises an excellent \npoint, that in fact our legislative history included with S. 1260, the \ndebate we have had, makes it quite clear what the intent of the \ncommittee was in 1995, what the intent of the committee in this \nlegislation is today.\n  In the absence of that, I think you might have courts ruling \notherwise, even though we may have not drawn that conclusion in the \nearlier legislation.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I will make my comments, and then I will be glad to yield \nfor a debate, but I want to finish my opening statement.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would the Senator have any objection to codifying this \nstandard?\n  Mr. DODD. I will do that in my remarks.\n  There is a very difficult problem codifying the standard on \nrecklessness. Congress has wrestled with this over the years. We were \nnot the first committee to try. We thought leaving the standard as it \nhas been in the courts, making sure we are not trying to make any \nchange to that standard here, any way other than what has been an \naccepted standard, was a better way to proceed, based on the advice we \nreceived.\n  We certainly did not change that standard, as has been the \nsuggestion, either with this act or the act of 1995 despite the fact \nthat some courts may have read it otherwise. I can't preclude a court \nfrom misinterpreting the decisions of a Congress.\n  But the recklessness standard has been a good standard over the years \nand ought not to be tampered with, in my opinion.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Will the Senator yield? I don't want to interrupt his \npresentation. I am always happy to wait, but we are talking of the \nreckless standard.\n  If I might inquire of the Senator, the SEC, as I understand it, has \nsent over a definition of ``reckless.'' If that could be included in \nthe findings of fact as opposed to the report language, I think it \nwould strengthen what we all seek to do, and that is to retain the \nreckless standard, which I know is the objective of the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  As the Senator knows far better than I, report language is fairly \nthin gruel compared to the findings of fact which are included or other \nissues which the sponsors of the legislation--I wonder if the Senator \nwould consider including that definition.\n  Mr. DODD. The problem has been, as you start trying to codify, we--I \nwill take a look at what the Senator has. I haven't seen it.\n  The suggestion has been made--what I was trying to respond to, prior \nto rising here, was that the suggestion was made that somehow this \npiece of legislation and '95 Act had undone the standard of \nrecklessness that had been used.\n\n  We made it quite clear--at least I thought we did--in 1995 that we \nwere not altering the standard. Certainly the SEC believes that was \nwhat we intend. This legislative history and this debate on today's \nbill makes it clear it\n\n[[Page S4789]]\n\nwas not the intent. What I objected to was the suggestion that somehow \nwe had changed the scienter standard. We had not done that. And the \nletter from the three members of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, I think, reinforces the point--not whether or not you add \nsomething in the statement of facts or whether or not you have it in \nthe legislative history where I believe it is most appropriate--about \naddressing the underlying concern and issue. And that is whether or not \nthis legislation in any way, or the 1995 Reform Act in any way, tried \nto fool around with the standard of recklessness. We didn't then, and \nwe aren't now.\n  So what I am saying here today, what the chairman of the committee \nhas said, and others, this is raising a red herring. It doesn't exist. \nIt is difficult enough to debate where there is a legitimate \ndisagreement, and there will be amendments offered where clearly there \nare provisions in the bill which my colleagues, including my \ndistinguished friend from Nevada, disagree with. It is a fundamental \ndifference here. Recklessness, as a matter of this legislation, is not \na problem. It is trying to raise an issue that really does not exist. \nThat is the reason I felt I should address that issue prior to making \nmy general comments and statements about what I think is a valuable \npiece of legislation.\n  Now, Madam President, let me, if I may, proceed here. It has been \nsaid, in the sense that we get the pendulum swings and the proposals \nare offered, in a sense, this is a very narrow bill. It is not designed \nto be all-encompassing and all-sweeping, yet it is being received by \ncertain quarters as if it were a wide, sweeping piece of legislation. \nIt is dealing with an underlying problem that still exists. The facts \nbear out the necessity of us trying to move with nationally traded \nsecurities on the national exchanges to see to it that we can set some \nstandards here so we don't continue to end up with a proliferation of \nlawsuits chasing forums all over this country to satisfy a trial bar at \nthe expense of jobs, investors in these companies out there. That is \nwhat has been happening. That is what we try to address with this bill.\n\n  At the beginning of the debate today on S. 1260, the securities \nlitigation reform standards, marks, in a sense, an anniversary, Madam \nPresident. It was almost 3 years ago that we took the floor of this \nbody, many of my colleagues, in support of the Private Securities \nLitigation Reform Act of 1995. That bill, overwhelmingly enacted into \nlaw by Congress, was designed to curb abuses in the field of private \nsecurities class action lawsuits.\n  Let me pause, if I can, to note just how important the private \nlitigation system has been in maintaining integrity of our capital \nmarkets. It is highly questionable whether our markets would be as \ndeep, as liquid, as strong, or as transparent were it not for our \nsystem of maintaining private rights of action against those who commit \nfraud. America's markets are the envy of the world because of the \ntremendous confidence that American and foreign investors have in the \nregulatory system that supports those markets.\n  But it is precisely because of the vital importance of the private \nlitigation system that the depths to which it had sunk by 1995 had \nbecome so damaging. The system was no longer an avenue for aggrieved \ninvestors to seek justice and restitution, but it had become, instead, \na pathway for a few enterprising attorneys to manipulate its procedures \nfor their own considerable profit, to the detriment of legitimate \ncompanies and investors all across our Nation.\n  If we needed a reminder about how abusive that system had become, we \nreceived yet another example of it last week, with the conclusion of \none of the last lawsuits filed under that old system. This litigation \nagainst a Massachusetts biotech company called Biogen, lasted more than \n3 years, cost that company, in direct litigation expenses alone, more \nthan $3 million.\n  But even more than the direct costs, the lawsuit enacted an untold \nloss on the company because of the time and resources devoted by its \ntop management and their scientists to defending themselves.\n  The conclusion to this litigation on May 6 came in swift contrast to \nthe lengthy and expensive lawsuit itself, as reported by Reuters:\n\n       A Federal jury has ruled as baseless a class-action \n     shareholder lawsuit accusing Biogen, Inc. and its chairman of \n     misleading investors . . . The 10-member jury took less than \n     three hours to reach their verdict. . . .\n\n  So this week's debate marks not only the opening of Congress' effort \nto establish strong national standards of liability for nationally-\ntraded securities, but also allows us to mark the close of an era in \nsecurities litigation that perversely offered more comfort to those \nfiling abusive and frivolous lawsuits than it offered to redress to \nthose who had been legitimately defrauded.\n  But the very success of the 1995 reform act in shutting down avenues \nof abuse on the Federal level has created a new home for such kinds of \nlitigation in State courts.\n  Throughout 1996, the first year of the reform act, reports were \ncoming to Congress that there was a dramatic increase in the number of \ncases filed in State courts. Prior to enactment of the '95 reform act, \nit was extremely unusual, extremely unusual, for a securities fraud \nclass action case to be brought in a State court anywhere in this \ncountry.\n  But by the end of 1996, it had become clear from both the number of \ncases filed in State court, and the nature of those claims, that a \nsignificant shift was underfoot, as some attorneys sought to evade the \nprovisions of the reform act that made it more difficult to coerce a \nsettlement, which was what was going on.\n  John Olson, the noted securities law expert, testified in February \nbefore the subcommittee on securities that:\n\n       In the years 1992 through 1994, only six issuers of \n     publicly traded securities were sued for fraud in State court \n     class actions. In contrast, at least 77 publicly traded \n     issuers were sued in State court class actions between \n     January 1, 1996, and June 30, 1997. Indeed, the increase \n     in State court filings may even be greater than indicated \n     by these dramatic statistics. Obtaining an accurate count \n     of State court class actions is extraordinarily difficult, \n     because there is no central repository of such data and \n     plaintiffs are under no obligation to provide notice of \n     the filing of such suits.\n\n  In April, 1997, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff reported \nto the Congress, and the President found that:\n\n       Many of the State cases are filed parallel to a Federal \n     court case in an apparent attempt to avoid some of the \n     procedures imposed by the reform act, particularly the stay \n     of discovery pending a motion to dismiss. This may be the \n     most significant development in securities litigation post-\n     reform act.\n\n  Even though the number of State class actions filed in 1997 was down \nfrom the high of 1996, it was still 50 percent higher than the average \nnumber filed in the 5 years prior to the reform act, and it represented \na significant jump in the number of parallel cases filed.\n  So there was a significant increase. It did drop in 1997. But if you \nare going to use the bar of when the reform act was passed, it was \nstill substantially higher. It was a rare occasion indeed when people \nran to State courts. We didn't think we would need this bill. We \nhonestly thought that dealing with this problem at the Federal level \nwould work. That is where the cases were brought. Why are we here \ntoday? We are here because these enterprising attorneys, as the \nchairman of the committee pointed out--many without clients, by the \nway--discovered that if they ran into a State court here, they could \navoid the legislation that we adopted and passed so overwhelmingly here \nin 1995. But there are other reasons as well. It isn't just an increase \nin the caseload. That would not, in my view, necessarily warrant moving \ntoday. There are other issues.\n  This change in the number and nature of the cases filed has had two \nmeasurable, negative impacts that I think our colleagues ought to take \nvery good note of.\n  First, for those companies hit with potentially frivolous or abusive \nState court class actions, all of the cost and expense that the '95 \nreform act sought to prevent are once again incurred. So, in effect, we \ndid nothing. Today, all of that cost and discovery, and so forth, \nbefore a motion to dismiss could be filed--today you have to go do it \nall over again. It is as if the `95 act were never passed. That is what \nhappened here.\n  Some might question whether a State class action can carry with it \nthe same type of incentives to settle even\n\n[[Page S4790]]\n\nfrivolous lawsuits that existed on the Federal level prior to 1995.\n  Allow me to provide one example of how this is so. Adobe Systems, \nInc. wrote to the Banking Committee on April 23, 1998, this year, about \nits experience with State class action lawsuits.\n  One of the key components of the 1995 reform act was to allow judges \nto rule on a motion to dismiss prior to the commencement of the \ndiscovery process. This is not precedent-setting procedure. That is \nnormally, in many cases, how you deal with it, a motion to dismiss \ncoming up early. Under the old system, Adobe had won a motion for \nsummary dismissal, but only after months of discovery by the plaintiffs \nthat cost the company more than $2 million in legal expenses and untold \ntime and energy by officials to produce the tens of thousands of \ndocuments and numerous depositions.\n  With the 1995 act in place, those kinds of expenses are far less \nlikely to occur at the Federal level.\n  But in an ongoing securities class action suit filed in California \nstate court since 1995, Adobe has had to spend more than $1 million in \nlegal expenses and has had to produce more than 44,000 pages of \ndocuments, all before the state judge is even able to entertain a \nmotion for summary dismissal.\n  In fact, in an April 23rd, letter to Chairman D'Amato, Colleen \nPouliot, Adobe's General Counsel, noted that:\n\n       There are a number of California judicial decisions which \n     permit a plaintiff to obtain discovery for the very purpose \n     of amending a complaint to cure its legal insufficiencies.\n\n  This one example makes clear that while Adobe, which has the \nresources for a costly and lengthy legal battle, might fight a \nmeritless suit, these costs provide a powerful incentive for most \ncompanies without that kind of wherewithal to settle these suits rather \nthan incur such expenses.\n  The second clear impact of the migration of class action suits to \nstate court is that it has caused companies to continue to avoid using \nthe safe harbor for forward looking statements that was a critical \ncomponent of the `95 reform act.\n  In this increasingly competitive market, investors are demanding more \nand more information from company officials about where it thinks that \nthe company is going, and what is likely to happen.\n  In fact, today we have more investors in our markets than ever \nbefore. People want more information. The safe harbor provisions which \nwe crafted were designed to encourage companies to step forward and to \ntell us where they were going. Clearly, there can be some who decide it \nwould be deceitful. In no way do we try to protect anybody who is lying \nor cheating in the process. We are trying to encourage companies to \ntell us more about where they are going so those investors can make \ngood decisions. But what has happened as a result of this rush to State \ncourts is that the very companies that said they need the safe harbor \nprovisions are not writing the safe harbor provisions because they know \nthey don't have the same protection in State court, which is where \nthese cases are running.\n  So after all the encouragement of the 1995 act to have the safe \nharbor, companies haven't been putting it in. So investors out there \ntrying to make decisions of where to put their hard-earned dollars \ndon't have the benefit of that safe harbor language, which may give \nthem a better idea in which companies to make those investments.\n  The California Public Employees Pension System, one of the biggest \ninstitutional investors in the Nation stated that ``forward-looking \nstatements provide extremely valuable and relevant information to \ninvestors.''\n  SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt also noted the importance of such \ninformation in the marketplace in 1995:\n\n       Our capital markets are built on the foundation of full and \n     fair disclosure. . . . The more investors know and understand \n     management's future plans and views, the sounder the \n     valuation is of the company's securities and the more \n     efficient the capital allocation process.\n\n  In recent years, the Securities and Exchange Commission, in \nrecognition of this fact, sought to find ways to encourage companies to \nput such forward-looking statements into the marketplace. Congress too \nsought to encourage this and this effort ultimately culminated in the \ncreation of a statutory safe harbor, so that companies need not fear a \nlawsuit if they did not meet their good-faith projections about future \nperformance.\n  Unfortunately, the simple fact is that the fear of State court \nlitigation is preventing companies from effectively using the safe \nharbor.\n  Again, the SEC's April 1997 study found that ``companies have been \nreluctant to provide significantly more forward looking disclosure than \nthey had prior to enactment of the safe harbor.'' (p. 24); the report \nwent on to cite the fear of State court litigation as one of the \nprincipal reasons for this failure.\n  Stanford Law School lecturer Michael Perino stated the case very well \nin a forthcoming law review article:\n\n       If one or more states do not have similar safe harbors, \n     then issuers face potential state court lawsuits and \n     liability for actions that do not violate federal standards. \n     . . . for disclosures that are . . . released to market \n     participants nationwide, the state with the most plaintiff-\n     favorable rules for forward looking disclosures, rather than \n     the Federal Government, is likely to set the standard to \n     which corporations will conform.\n\n  If the migration of cases to state court were just a temporary \nphenomenon, then perhaps it would be appropriate for Congress to tell \nthese companies and their millions of investors to simply grin and bear \nit, that it will all be over soon.\n  But the SEC report contains the warning that this is no temporary \ntrend: ``If state law provides advantages to plaintiffs in a particular \ncase, it is reasonable to expect that plaintiffs' counsel will file \nsuit in state court.'' The plain English translation of that is that \nany plaintiffs' lawyer worth his salt is going to file in state court \nif he feels it advantageous for his case; since most state courts do \nnot provide the stay of discovery or a safe harbor, we're confronted \nwith a likelihood of continued state court class actions.\n  While the frustration of the objectives of the 1995 Reform Act \nprovide compelling reasons for congressional action, it is equally \nimportant to consider whether the proposition of creating a national \nstandard of liability for nationally-traded securities makes sense in \nit's own right.\n  I certainly believe it does.\n  In 1996, Congress passed the ``National Securities Markets \nImprovement Act'' which established a precedent of national treatment \nfor securities that are nationally-traded.\n  In that act, Congress clearly and explicitly recognized that our \nsecurities markets were national in scope and that requiring that the \nsecurities that trade on those national markets comply with 52 separate \njurisdictional requirements both afforded little extra protection to \ninvestors and imposed unnecessarily steep costs on raising capital.\n  Last July, then-Securities Commissioner Steven Wallman submitted \ntestimony to the Securities Subcommittee in which he said:\n\n       Disparate, and shifting, state litigation procedures may \n     expose issuers to the potential for significant liability \n     that cannot be easily evaluated in advance, or assessed when \n     a statement is made. At a time when we are increasingly \n     experiencing and encouraging national and international \n     securities offerings and listing, and expending great effort \n     to rationalize and streamline our securities markets, this \n     fragmentation of investor remedies potentially imposes costs \n     that outweigh the benefits. Rather than permit or foster \n     fragmentation of our national system of securities \n     litigation, we should give due consideration to the \n     benefits flowing to investors from a uniform national \n     approach.\n\n  That is what we are trying to do with this bill.\n  At that same hearing, Keith Paul Bishop, then-California's top state \nsecurities regulator testified along the same lines that:\n\n       California believes in the federal system and the primary \n     role of the states within that system. However, California \n     does not believe that federal standards are improper when \n     dealing with truly national markets. California businesses, \n     their stockholders and their employees are all hurt by \n     inordinate burdens on national markets. Our businesses must \n     compete in a world market and they will be disadvantaged if \n     they must continue to contend with 51 or more litigation \n     standards.\n\n  SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, at his reconfirmation hearing before the \nBanking Committee on March 26, 1998, said that the legislation we are \ndebating today:\n\n       Addresses an issue that . . . deals with a certain level of \n     irrationality. That to have to two separate standards is not \n     unlike if you\n\n[[Page S4791]]\n\n     had, in the state of Virginia, two speed limits, one for 60 \n     miles an hour and one for 40 miles an hour. I think the havoc \n     that would create with drivers is not dissimilar from the \n     kind of disruption created by two separate standards [of \n     litigation] and I have long felt that in some areas a single \n     standard is desirable.\n\nwhich is all we are trying to do here with this bill, to set one speed \nlimit, if you will, on a national debate on trading securities and on \nmarkets. That is all, one speed limit, not two, to live up to the fact \nof what we tried to do with the 1995 bill.\n  The message from all of these sources is clear and unequivocal: A \nuniform, national standard of litigation is both sensible and \nappropriate.\n  The legislation under consideration today accomplishes that goal in \nthe narrowest, most balanced way possible.\n  Before I discuss what the legislation will do, let me point out a few \nthings that it won't do:\n  It will not affect the ability of any state agency to bring any kind \nof enforcement action against any player in the securities markets;\n  It will not affect the ability of any individual, or even a small \ngroup of individuals, to bring a suit in state court against any \nsecurity, nationally traded or not;\n  It will not affect any suit, class action or otherwise, against penny \nstocks or any stock that is not traded on a national exchange.\n  It will not affect any suits based upon corporate disclosure to \nexisting shareholders required by state fiduciary duty laws;\n  And it will not alter the national scienter requirement to prevent \nshareholders from bringing suits against issuers or others who act \nrecklessly.\n  There has been a lot of talk about this last point, so let me address \nit head-on.\n  It is true that in 1995, Congress wrestled with the idea of trying to \nestablish a uniform definition of recklessness; but ultimately, the \n1995 Private Securities Litigation Reform Act was silent on the \nquestion of recklessness. While the act requires that plaintiffs plead \n``Facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with \nthe requisite state of mind . . .''\n  The act at no point attempts to define that state of mind. Congress \nleft that to courts to apply, just as they had been applying their \ndefinition of state of mind prior to 1995.\n  Unfortunately, a minority of district courts have tried to read into \nsome of the legislative history of the reform act an intent to do away \nwith recklessness as an actionable standard.\n  I believe that these decisions are erroneous and cannot be supported \nby either the black letter of the statute nor by any meaningful \nexamination of the legislative history.\n  There are several definitions of recklessness that operate in our \ncourts today, and some of them are looser than others. But I agree with \nthose who believe that reckless behavior is an extreme departure from \nthe standards of ordinary care; a departure that is so blatant that the \ndanger it presents to investors is either known to the defendant or is \nso obvious that he or she must have been aware of it.\n\n  The notion that Congress would condone such behavior by closing off \nprivate lawsuits against those who fall within that definition is just \nludicrous.\n  And if, by some process of mischance and misunderstanding, investors \nlost their ability to bring suits based on that kind of scienter \nstandard, I would be the first, though certainly not the last, Senator \nto introduce legislation to restore that standard.\n  As I mentioned a moment ago, Mr. President, S.1260 is a moderate, \nbalanced and common sense approach to establishing a uniform national \nstandard of litigation that will end the practice of meritless class \naction suits being brought in state court.\n  This legislation keeps a very tight definition of class action and \napplies it's standards only to those securities that have been \npreviously defined in law as trading on a national exchange.\n  That is why the Securities and Exchange Commission has stated that \n``We support enactment of S. 1260;'' That is why the Clinton \nadministration has also indicated it's support for the legislation.\n  In the final analysis, it is both the millions of Americans who have \ninvested their hard-earned dollars in these nationally-traded companies \nand the men and women who will hold the new jobs that will be created \nas a result of newly available resources, whom we hope will be the real \nbeneficiaries of the action that we take here today.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to join the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, dozens of our colleagues, the Clinton administration, \ndozens of governors, state legislators and state securities regulators \nin supporting passage of the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards \nAct of 1998.\n  Madam President, I see my colleague.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York controls the time. \nThere are 10 minutes 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I wonder if I might ask my friend and colleague. I know \nwe are going to have some extended debate with some of the amendments. \nSenator Gramm, who has worked with the Senator from Connecticut, would \nlike to be heard, and Senator Feingold has been waiting. He has an \namendment that I believe is a very substantive amendment, and is one \nthat might take hours to debate. But I believe we can dispose of it in \na relatively short period of time if we were to permit the Senator to \nproceed.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I didn't realize how much time had already gone on. My \ncolleague from Texas is chairman of the Securities Subcommittee and the \nprincipal author of the bill, of which I am proud to be a cosponsor.\n  While he is in the Chamber, let me commend and congratulate my \ncolleague from Texas on this issue. This is a strong bipartisan bill, \n14 to 4, coming out of this committee. It took a long time to go \nthrough all of this. We have had extensive hearings on it. We have \nlistened to an awful lot of people. This is a good piece of \nlegislation. It is needed out there, if we are going to in this day and \nage, with so many people wanting to get into this market, get more \ninformation to them, having a single standard here. Jobs and investors \nare affected when you have a handful of attorneys out there deciding \nthey are going to act in a way that really brings great danger to our \nmarkets. And so I urge adoption of the legislation.\n  I yield the floor at this point.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, I yield up to 3 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Texas and ask unanimous consent that Senator Feingold from \nWisconsin be recognized thereafter for the purposes of introducing an \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Reserving my right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I certainly do not want in any way to interfere with the \npresentation of the amendment of the Senator from Wisconsin, but we are \nin a time limit where we have an hour on each side and I want to make \nsure that I do not lose my----\n  Mr. D'AMATO. It was never the Senator's intent nor would this impinge \non the Senator's time. It was an effort to accommodate one of our \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I am happy to do that. Can we include one proviso in the \nproposed unanimous consent that after the Senator from Texas is allowed \nthe time as requested by my friend, the distinguished chairman, and \nafter the Senator from Wisconsin is recognized for purposes of an \namendment, will the Senator from Nevada then be next recognized, if \nthat would be agreeable?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I often find myself having to speak at \nlength in the Chamber when I do not have the votes. On this bill, I am \nin the happy position that we have the votes. We are going to win. We \nare going to defeat all of the amendments, because we have a good bill, \nand we have a very broad base of support. So I have often found that \nwhen you have the votes, it is best not to speak at length.\n  However, as the author of the legislation, I wanted to say just a \ncouple of things. First, I thank Chairman D'Amato for his leadership. I \nwant people to know that without his principal leadership on this bill, \nwe would not be here. He was instrumental in helping\n\n[[Page S4792]]\n\nus pull the coalition together. He set a time schedule on bringing the \nbill before the full committee, and I thank him for his leadership.\n  I believe this legislation will benefit the country. I think we will \ncreate jobs, growth, and opportunity from enactment of the bill, and I \nthink that Chairman D'Amato is due a lion's share of the credit.\n  I thank Senator Dodd. I don't think anybody in the Senate has a \nbetter, more cooperative ranking member than I do as chairman of the \nSecurities Subcommittee. I thank Senator Dodd for his leadership.\n  The bottom line on this bill is that in 1995 we sought to act to deal \nwith the problem of economic piracy through the courts. We had found \nourselves in a position where lawsuits were being filed against \ncompanies if their stock price went up, if their stock price went down, \nif their stock price did not change. New, emerging companies were the \nspecial targets of these lawsuits. These are the companies that had \ngreat technical ideas but did not have a whole bevy of lawyers on their \npayroll, and they were finding themselves basically being extorted, as \npeople filed lawsuits that often were just boilerplate documents. These \nsuits were so boilerplate that at times the name of the company being \nsued was confused in the documents filed in the court.\n\n  And so we stepped in to try to do something about it, and we passed a \nbill called the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, Public Law \n104-67. That legislation basically did five things. No. 1, it said that \nyou had to have a client; that you could not have a lawyer who filed a \nbunch of motions representing nobody in reality and just collecting a \nwhole bunch of money. The legislation said that there had to be genuine \nclients, and the client that stood the most to gain could be the lead \nclient and had the privilege to choose the lawyer, and the lawyer had \nto be accountable to the people who were filing the lawsuit.\n  You all heard the statement that our chairman quoted, about the \nbragging of the lead lawyer in this area.\n  Are my 3 minutes up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 3 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I request an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. So we required that you have real people filing a real \nlawsuit. We also required that if you are going to file a lawsuit, you \nhave to say specifically what the company did wrong. We further \nestablished a procedure whereby you did not have to go through this \nlengthy and expensive discovery process while the court was considering \nwhether there was even enough merit in the case to proceed further with \nit. We also eliminated the ability to go after the people that had deep \npockets, even though they had no real, substantive liability. Finally, \nwhere it was clear that the lawsuit was frivolous, we gave the judge \nthe responsibility to require that the people who filed the lawsuit \npaid the legal expenses of those who found themselves pulled into \ncourt.\n  It was a good bill, and it is beginning to have an impact. Our \nproblem is that in trying to circumvent it, the same people filing the \nsame lawsuits started to move into State court. So we have written a \nbill that tries to set uniform national standards. It applies only to \nclass-action suits. It applies only to stocks that are traded \nnationally.\n  It is eminently reasonable. It is clearly within the purview of the \ninterstate commerce clause of the Constitution. This is a bill that \nneeds to be passed. I thank everybody who has been involved in it for \ntheir leadership.\n  We will have a series of amendments. We voted on every one of them in \ncommittee. Every one of these amendments is aimed at killing the bill \nby undercutting the basic premise of the bill, which is when you are \ndealing with nationally traded securities, you need national standards. \nSo I hope our colleagues will join us in the process of defeating these \namendments and approving the bill.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair. I thank the manager, the Senator \nfrom New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2394\n\n(Purpose: To amend certain Federal civil rights statutes to prevent the \n   involuntary application of arbitration to claims that arise from \nunlawful employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, \n      national origin, age, or disability, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. At this point I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2394.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

Madam President, I rise today to offer an amendment, \nwhich is actually a bill I have worked on for some time, the Civil \nRights Procedures Protection Act, S. 63, a measure cosponsored by \nSenators Kennedy, Leahy, and Torricelli.\n  What this legislation does is address the rapidly growing and \ntroubling practice of employers conditioning employment or professional \nadvancement upon their employees' willingness to submit claims of \ndiscrimination or harassment to arbitration, mandatory arbitration, \nrather than still having the right to pursue their claims in the \ncourts. In other words, in too many cases employers are forcing their \nemployees to ex ante agree to submit their civil rights claims to \nmandatory binding arbitration irrespective of what other remedies may \nexist under the laws of this Nation.\n  So to address this growing trend of mandatory binding arbitration, \nthis measure, the Civil Rights Procedures Protection Act, amends seven \ncivil rights statutes to guarantee that a civil rights plaintiff can \nstill seek the protection of the U.S. courts. The measure ensures that \nan employer cannot use his or her superior bargaining power to coerce \nher or his employees to, in effect, capitulate to an agreement which \ndiminishes their civil rights protection.\n  To be specific, this legislation affects civil rights claims brought \nunder title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, section 505 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans With Disabilities Act, \nsection 1977 of the revised statutes, the Equal Pay Act, the Family and \nMedical Leave Act, and the Federal Arbitration Act. In the context of \nthe Federal Arbitration Act, the protections in this legislation are \nextended to claims of unlawful discrimination arising under State or \nlocal law, and other Federal laws that prohibit job discrimination.\n\n  Madam President, I want to be clear, because it is important that we \npromote voluntary arbitration in this country, that this is in no way \nintended to hinder or discourage or bar the use of arbitration on \nconciliation or mediation or any other form of alternative dispute \nresolution short of litigation resolving those claims. I think it is \ntremendous that we try to encourage people to voluntarily avoid \nlitigation.\n  I have long been a strong proponent of voluntary forms of alternative \ndispute resolution. The key, however, is that, in those cases that I \ncan support alternative dispute resolution, it is truly voluntary. That \nis not what we are talking about here. What is happening here is that \nthese agreements to go to arbitration are mandatory, they are imposed \nupon working men and women, and they are required prior to employment \nor prior to a promotion.\n  Mandatory binding arbitration allows employers to tell all current \nand prospective employees, in effect, if you want to work for us, you \nwill have to check your rights as a working American citizen at the \ndoor. Indeed, these requirements have been referred to recently as \nfront-door contracts; that is, employers require that employees \nsurrender certain rights right up front in order to get in the front \ndoor. Working men and women all across the country are faced with a \nvery dubious choice, then, of either accepting these mandatory \nlimitations of their right to redress in the face of discrimination or \nharassment, or being placed at risk of losing an employment opportunity \nor professional advancement.\n  As a nation that values work and deplores discrimination, I don't \nthink we can allow this situation to continue. The way I like to \ndescribe it is, what this expects a person to do is to sign an \nagreement that they will not go to court even before they feel the \nsting of discrimination. They have to sign this deal before they even \nsit down to their desk and do their first work for an employer.\n  So, in conclusion, allow me to stress that this practice of mandatory \nbinding arbitration should be stopped now. If people believe they are \nbeing discriminated against or sexually harassed, they should continue \nto retain all avenues of redress provided for by the laws of this \nNation. This amendment will help restore integrity and balance in \nrelations between hard-working employees and their employers. But I \nthink more important, this amendment will ensure that the civil rights \nlaws this Congress passes will continue to protect all Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, I commend the Senator from Wisconsin \nfor coming forth with this proposal. It is an amendment that he has \nbeen working on, for quite a period of time. As a matter of fact, it \nhas been referred to the Judiciary Committee.\n  Having said that, I think at the very least it should have, and \nrequires, a thorough hearing. It is important, and it is important we \nunderstand the nuances. It is important that we get the case-by-case \ndocumentation as relates to those people who have suffered as a result \nof this area of the law. It is an area of great concern in terms of \nwhether or not a person has to sign an agreement--and they do now--\nprior to employment, that they give away or they agree that all matters \nwill be settled by way of arbitration.\n  Maybe it should not be ``all matters.'' Maybe there are certain \nmatters that no one should ever be required to forfeit. I think we \nshould look at that, because I think there are some very real \nquestions. If there is a question of sexual harassment, do you mean to \ntell me that a person in that case should have to give up his or her \nright to bring a claim and that it will be settled in camera, behind \nthe scenes, by way of arbitration? And there may be other areas where, \nindeed, the arbitration procedure should be the methodology of \nresolving a dispute.\n\n  But I believe the Senator is correct, that there are some areas that \nreally call into question whether or not a person must sign this \nagreement, otherwise he or she doesn't get the job. They just never get \nthe job. They never get the promotion. So what do you think they are \ngoing to do? Of course they are going to sign. So this is serious.\n  I believe we have an obligation to have a thorough, thoughtful \nanalysis, and, indeed, the Judiciary Committee may want to look at \ncertain aspects. But I believe since, indeed, the financial services \ncommunity, the banking community, the securities community has to deal \nwith this day in and day out, the proper jurisdiction does lie before \nthe Banking Committee.\n  With that in mind, I have indicated to the Senator that, before we \nleave, during the month of July or prior, it will be my intent to hold \nat least a full hearing, where witnesses to both sides, including the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission--which I understand is studying this \nmatter very carefully--will appear so we could have the benefit of \ntheir review, of their testimony,\n\n[[Page S4794]]\n\nof people who have written and people who have been involved in this, \nthose who have been aggrieved as well as those who can testify to the \nmerits of certain aspects of having arbitration in some limited cases.\n  But I must say for the record, I believe the Senator has touched on \nsomething that is very important and I would not like to move to table \nat this time. I think it would be unfair to the importance of this \nlegislation.\n  With that in view, I have indicated to the Senator that I will call \nthese hearings, so we can fully explore this and then bring it to this \nfloor as legislation that has had the benefit of the totality of the \ninput from the SEC, from our staffs, after listening and hearing and \ngetting the kind of in-depth review that I know that not only I feel \nshould take place, but that most of the members of my committee would \nsupport.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from New York who, \nI think, has given a very sympathetic listen to what we are trying to \naccomplish here. This issue, in fact, emanates in large part originally \nfrom his State and from some of the practices in his State that are now \nbecoming nationwide.\n  I think he has shown here, in his comments, already a keen \nunderstanding of what is involved here. Even though this issue has not \nbeen presented formally to his committee, he clearly understands that \nwhat is being requested of some of these individuals is simply \nunreasonable in light of American traditions of protection from \ndiscrimination and sexual harassment.\n  So, even though I think this bill is a very appropriate vehicle to \noffer this amendment, I am grateful the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee has agreed to hold a hearing in which he will be personally \ninvolved, in which I will have the opportunity to testify, prior to the \nend of July, on this bill.\n  I look forward to being able to participate in helping to select some \nof the witnesses. I agree with the Senator very strongly that there are \npeople on both sides, as well as those in the middle such as the SEC, \nwho are seriously looking at this. This would be a useful hearing to \nmove this issue along. I happen to be a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee as well, so I certainly regard this as an appropriate forum \nas well. But I think this committee, in light of the fact these \nagreements started in securities firms, is a place where a hearing \nwould be appropriate.\n  I also understand the Senator does not expect in any way I would be \nprevented from offering this to other bills at any point.\n  But, in light of all that and his assurances--which have always been \nextremely secure whenever I have dealt with him in the past, for the \nlast 5\\1/2\\ years--in light of all that, I look forward to the hearing, \nI look forward to working with him. I hope that he can support this \nlegislation after he has had a chance to review it.\n  Given all that, at this point, Madam President, I withdraw the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 2394) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank my colleague and tell him that we look forward \nto working together in a cooperative way in helping to craft a package \nthat will address the true abuses yet maintain the importance of \narbitration where it is deemed appropriate, because I think in certain \ncases it is absolutely appropriate and I think in others it is \nabsolutely indefensible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNevada is recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Just to be clear, in terms of the status, the 22 minutes that are \nreserved to the Senators in opposition is not affected by the colloquy \nbetween my two friends from New York and Wisconsin?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Madam President, this legislation that we are debating \ntoday, as I have said on previous occasions, is somewhat arcane and \nesoteric. It is not the sort of thing where, for people who are at home \nwatching this debate, it causes them to move to the edge of their \nchairs and to hang on every word.\n  It is, however, terribly important for the tens of millions of small \ninvestors who, in recent years, have invested in the future of America, \nand for their confidence in the market system that we have created, \nbecause they are the small investors, they are the ones who will be \nimpacted by this legislation. The large investors, the large \ninstitutions, will still have options that heretofore the small \ninvestors have had but the small investors will be deprived of as a \nresult of this legislation. So it is the view of the Senator from \nNevada that this legislation plunges a dagger into the heart of every \nsmall investor in America.\n  What we are talking about is not whether a case can be brought in \nState court or Federal court. We are talking about a system, which \ncurrently exists, that allows a private small investor to be part of a \nclass action, and other small investors who have been defrauded as a \nresult of the misconduct of others, to come together and file an action \nin State court and to avail themselves of statutes of limitations that \nare longer than are available to those of us who file in Federal court \nto provide, for joint and several liability, the ability to recover \nfrom accomplices--particularly important if the primary offender has \nbankrupted himself or herself or itself or has taken leave--and to \navail himself or herself of triple damages under RICO.\n  So this has a very practical impact. Actions that would be available \nto small investors at the State court level will no longer--no longer--\nbe available to those small investors, as a practical matter. So we \ncontinue a process which alarmed my good friend, the distinguished \nranking member of this committee, the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland, that began with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act \nof 1995 and, in our view, simply goes too far.\n  Those of us who express strong reservations about this bill find no \ncomfort with those who are filing strike suits, those who are involved \nin litigiousness for the sake of litigiousness. I believe it would be \npossible to craft a narrow provision that addresses the ostensible \nconcerns that have been raised and yet not deprive small investors in \nthis country of their rights under the law.\n  The system for private enforcement of remedies has existed now for \nmore than six decades. It is a dual system involving the State courts \nand the Federal courts. It has worked exceptionally well. The SEC has \nrepeatedly testified as to the importance of private rights of actions \nas being absolutely essential to augment their own enforcement efforts. \nIndeed, they have said they have not the ability nor the resources to \ndeal with the vast panoply of investor fraud, and they view the private \ncause of action as essential.\n  Indeed, States were the first to enact these protections against \nfraud in the early 1900s, and when, in the mid-1930s, the statutes that \nessentially provided the framework for Federal securities regulation \nwere put in place, it was expressly intended to supplement, not to \nsupersede, to complement, not to wipe out, and the language of this \nlegislation today specifically preempts the State cause of action for \nclass actions. These State remedies are vitally important, and States \nhave responded in a number of different ways by providing protections. \nI am going to talk about three primarily.\n  The statute of limitations. Why is that important? Those who \nperpetrate fraud on small investors don't do so openly and nakedly; \nthey try to conceal it to protect that activity. So the unfortunate \ndecision of the court in the Lampf decision, which limits at the \nFederal level the right of an investor who has been defrauded 1 year \nfrom the point of discovery of the fraud, 3 years even though the \ninvestor never becomes aware of that fraud, is viewed by the Securities \nCommission as unreasonable because it takes them, with all of their \nresources, a minimum of 3\\1/2\\ years.\n  The statute of limitation is not just an arcane debate about how long \none should have, it is the ability of a small investor who has been \ndefrauded without his knowledge and, never having learned of it within \nthe 3-year period of time, is now precluded. Thirty-three States in \nthis country, including my own in Nevada, provide for a longer statute \nof limitation. Some provide 2\n\n[[Page S4795]]\n\nyears from the time of discovery of fraud, or 5 or 6 or even 10 years, \nand some provide no bar at all.\n\n  In the vast majority of States in America, small investors filing \nclass actions who do not discover the fraud until after 3 years are \ncurrently, under existing law, protected in at least 33 States. This \nlegislation cuts off that right, and even though we all agree or, as \nthe lawyers say, stipulate to the merit of the claim, it is barred--\nbarred--by the 3 years even though the small investor never became \naware of the fraud. That is what we are talking about.\n  Forty-nine of the 50 States provide liability for the accomplices--\nthose who conspired with the primary perpetrator of the fraud, whether \nthey be lawyers, whether they be accountants, whether they be other \ninvestment advisers--to provide a cause of action--49 out of 50. \nUnfortunately, at the Federal level, there is no remedy for plaintiffs \nagainst aiders and abetters. So that means that if the primary \noffender, the perpetrator, becomes bankrupt, leaves the country, or is \notherwise unable to respond in damages, historically at the State court \nlevel, the class-action plaintiffs could recover against those who \nconspired and aided in that fraud.\n  The action that we take with S. 1260 deprives small investors filing \nclass actions from this recovery. So now, if we pass this legislation, \nthey are precluded from moving against those who conspired and actively \nparticipated in the fraud.\n  Moreover, States, as a matter of providing protection to their own \ncitizens, have provided in a number of jurisdictions for joint and \nseveral liability. That means if five or six are guilty of the fraud \nand only one has the ability to respond in damages, States have made \nthe determination that as between the innocent investor, utterly \nblameless, that the innocent investor ought to be satisfied against the \nperpetrator of that fraud, even though there may have been several \ninvolved. That is wiped out.\n  We have, in effect, a piece of legislation before us that \ndramatically limits the right of a small investor to pursue a class \naction in State court and to avail himself or herself of a whole host \nof remedies which States have provided on their own.\n  I must say, the irony of this course of action by a Republican \nCongress that has proclaimed its devotion to State rights and has raged \nagainst preemption by a Congress at the Federal level of essentially \nState rights does not go unnoticed by this Senator.\n  Why are class actions important? Again, it is pretty esoteric. Think \nfor a moment. Tens of millions of small investors who may have been \nvictimized by a fraud don't have the ability to hire a lawyer on their \nown to fight against entrenched special interests who have the ability \nto provide legal defenses and delays and delays. That is practically no \nremedy at all. It is only by binding together with other investors, \nsmall investors who are similarly situated, as the law says, that those \ncosts can be spread and a recovery can be possible.\n  When we say, as proponents of this legislation, ``Well, the small \ninvestor can still file in State court,'' that is true, but it is a \nhollow and transparent remedy because, as a practical matter, small \ninvestors simply do not have the ability to pay for the lawyer's fees \nand the costs that are involved in processing these kind of cases.\n  That was the situation that 23,000 senior citizens who joined in a \nclass action against Charlie Keating and Lincoln Savings and Loan found \nthemselves in a few years ago. It was a class action, and they were \nultimately able to recover 65 cents on the dollar of their losses.\n  Had those plaintiffs been involved today with a shorter cause of \naction at the Federal level, with the cause of action unavailable at \nthe State level for class actions, those plaintiffs would have not been \nable to recover that kind of money. The examples of these kinds of \ngroups are not just small individuals, but they include school \ndistricts, municipalities, special improvement districts, pension funds \nat the State and municipal level. All of these are going to be affected \nby this legislation. As a practical matter, a class action provides the \nonly realistic hope of recovery.\n\n  As I pointed out, the SEC, with all its resources, says it takes them \nup to 3 years to compile the data to bring these securities fraud \nsuits. So in effect, what we are doing now is we are providing for two \nclasses of investors: Those who have been defrauded who are people of \nmeans, of wealth, so they can hire their own lawyers, they can still \nfile at the State court level and take advantage of the longer statute \nof limitations, can take advantage of the provisions that provide \nliability against accomplices, can take advantage against the joint and \nseveral liability protections available at the State level. But if you \nare a small investor--and that is what most of those who are defrauded \nare, small investors--that remedy is no longer available to you.\n  So the question arises: Why are we doing this? What is the problem? \nWell, frankly, to the great credit of our regulatory framework, we have \nthe safest and the most efficient securities markets in the world.\n  In 1990, there were 158 IPOs, totaling $4.6 billion. In 1997, 7 years \nlater, there were 619 IPOs, totaling $39 billion. The stock market has \nrecently set record highs. The Dow is over 9,000. And individuals \nconfident in these markets are pouring in $40 billion a month in mutual \nfunds. In 1980, 1 in every 18 households in America invested in the \nstock market. Less than 20 years later, it is more than one in three. \nThat is a great tribute to the security and safety of this market.\n  Why are we reducing the investor protections at a time when the stock \nmarket is surging and consumer confidence is growing?\n  Investor confidence is crucial, and it is threatened by increasing \nfraud. I believe it was President Kennedy who made the observation, \nthat, ``A rising tide''--referring to the economy--``raises all \nboats.'' And I think that is true. But it is equally true it also hides \nthe shoals.\n  Newsweek, in its October 6, 1997, edition: ``Scam Scuttling: The Bull \nMarket is Drawing Con Artists. SEC Chairman Levitt summarized, ``In a \nmarket like this, parasites crowd in to feast on the bull's success.''\n  Business Week, December 15: ``Ripoff! Secret World of Chop Stocks--\nAnd How Small Investors--[and that is what we are talking about] Are \nGetting Fleeced.'' The article focuses on small-cap equities \nmanipulated to enrich promotors and defraud thousands of small \ninvestors--a $10 billion-a-year business that regulators and law \nenforcement have barely dented.\n  The New York Times of November 26 of last year: ``Lessons of Boesky \nand Milken Go Unheeded in Fraud Case.'' In one case, 1,600 investors \nwere swindled out of $95 million.\n  Yet Federal and State enforcement resources are shrinking as these \nfraudulent schemes are perpetrated upon the innocent small investors.\n  Now is not the time, I would respectfully argue, to in effect rip \nfrom the investor his or her opportunity to recover that which has been \nlost as a result of being victimized by fraud. Our securities markets \nrun on trust, Madam President--on trust--not money. There will be much \nless trust, I fear, if this legislation occurs.\n  Look what has happened in countries around the world: ``Albania tries \nto regain control [of the Ponzi scheme].'' That can't happen in America \nwith the system that we have created. ``Shanghai Stock Market Cited for \nScandal.'' ``10,000 Stampede as Russian Stock [Market] Collapses.'' \n``Scandal Besets Chinese Markets.''\n\n  My point being that we have devised a system to protect investors. \nAnd I fear, by reason of overly broad legislation, we are depriving \nsmall investors of the very opportunity to recover that which has \nprovided the confidence in the market that has encouraged such a \nmassive investment by small investors.\n  Why? We are led to believe there is a massive influx of cases that \nmust be preempted because everybody is going to the State court to \nbypass the provisions of the 1995 law.\n  Price Waterhouse, in January of 1998, made a report, an evaluation. \nForty-four State cases--44--were filed in all of 1997, a one-third \ndecrease since 1996--I want to emphasize that, a decrease--when 66 were \nfiled, and less than in the 3 years before the 1995 legislation. A \nfollowup Price Waterhouse study, in February, tells us 39 cases were \nfiled.\n\n[[Page S4796]]\n\n  My point being, whether it is 39 or 44, I would not argue that with \nmy colleagues, but that is, out of 15 million cases, civil cases--not \ncriminal, not traffic, not domestic relations--we are talking about 44 \ncases or 39 cases out of 15 million filed. That is a very, very small \nnumber. And although there are some problems, as has been pointed out \nby the proponents, none of the problems justifies the sweeping \nemasculation of investor protections that this legislation provides \nfor.\n  Now, what are the problems specifically in the act itself?\n  If one believes that uniform standards are an essential public policy \nin the country--and, I must say, I have not been persuaded--then I \nthink we would agree that a uniform standard that provides strong \ninvestor protections ought to be a part of that uniform standard.\n  Unfortunately, what we have done, in each and every case, is opted \nfor the lowest common denominator of protection. If the statute of \nlimitations is longer at the State level, we have preempted it and \nlimited the statute of limitations. If the State provides for liability \nagainst those who are accomplices, we take that cause of action away \nfrom the small investor. If the State allows for joint and several \nrecovery against each and every one of those involved in the fraud, we \ntake that away from the small investor.\n  So it is my view that this is part of an ongoing process in which we \nhave, in my judgment, left the small investor high and dry in many \ncases if this legislation passes.\n  I must say that when you look at the trend line following the 1995 \nlegislative enactments, you can see that pattern unfold. The Lampf \ndecision, which shocked the SEC and others, limited the statute of \nlimitations to 1 year from the time of discovery of the fraud to 3 \nyears. The SEC recognized that that is an unreasonable period of time. \nAnd those who argued several years ago for comprehensive reforms said, \n``Look, we'll address the statute of limitations at that point.'' We \ntried, Madam President, in 1995 to address the statute of limitations, \nbut we were rebuffed. Now this legislation takes the longer statute of \nlimitations, available in 33 out of 50 States, away from those small \ninvestors.\n  The Supreme Court, in the Central Bank case, held that there is no \nability to hold accomplices liable. We tried to provide for aider and \nabetter coverage. The SEC strongly supports that. We were told that \nwhen we redid the Federal securities laws that that would be included. \nMy colleague from Maryland and I tried, and we were rebuffed in that \neffort.\n  Joint and several liability, eliminated in the 1995 act. Civil RICO, \neliminated. Discovery provisions, limited. In 1996, we made a \ndetermination to divide some of the regulatory responsibility between \nState and Federal authorities.\n  In 1998, we are here with S. 1260, which I think is the coup de grace \nin terms of small investor protection. So I must say that I am greatly \ndisturbed by this threat. I believe that small investors ultimately \nwill pay the price.\n\n  It is often said that those of us who oppose this legislation must be \nworking for those nefarious trial lawyers. Let's take a look at the \ngroups who support the position that the senior Senator from Maryland \nand I take. The American Association of Retired Persons. When I attend \none of their meetings, I haven't seen a single retired lawyer in \nattendance. The AFL-CIO, the American Federation of State County and \nMunicipal Workers, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, and \nmany, many others, as you can see, particularly those involved with the \nState retirement associations, including the Public Employees \nRetirement System, the League of Cities, the National Association of \nCounties and Municipal Treasuries.\n  Let me read a paragraph from a letter that the able Senator from \nMaryland introduced, coming from the Government Finance Officers \nAssociation, the Municipal Treasurers'Association, National Association \nof Counties, National Association of County Treasurers, National \nAssociation of State Retirement Administrators, National Conference on \nPublic Employee Retirement System, National League of Cities, U.S. \nConference of Mayors. They raise many of the same objections that I \nhave outlined today, as has my colleague from Maryland.\n  Here is their comment:\n\n       The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act was opposed by \n     state and local governments because the legislation did not \n     strike an appropriate balance, and this legislation extends \n     that mistake to state courts. As both users of debt and \n     investors of public funds, state and local governments seek \n     to not only reduce frivolous lawsuits but to protect state \n     and local government investors who are defrauded in \n     securities transactions. . . .\n       The above organizations believe that States must be able to \n     protect State and local government funds.\n\n  We are talking about taxpayer dollars. We are not talking about \nlitigious plaintiffs. We are talking about pension funds, municipal \nState funds in which those entities have been defrauded and now will be \nprovided much less protection to recover tax dollars--dollars belonging \nto each and every citizen who is a part of that group.\n  Let me address one final point here as we conclude this discussion. \nOne of the concerns that has been expressed is that there is no \nadequate assurance that liability will continue to exist against those \nwho are reckless in their conduct. Now, that is a standard more \negregious than simple negligence, more egregious than gross negligence. \nWe are talking about conduct that is reckless in nature.\n  Prior to 1995, when the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act was \nenacted, 11 of 13 circuits in this country had addressed the issue and \nhad concluded that there was a cause of action for those who are guilty \nof reckless misconduct. The 1995 legislation, because it talked about a \nspecific pleading standard, has created some confusion. Following the \n1995 enactment, several district courts have concluded that no longer \nis there liability for reckless misconduct.\n  Now, the proponents of this legislation say that they do not intend \nthat as a consequence. And I accept their representation. However, we \nhave tried to get into this bill a provision crafted by the SEC \ndefining ``reckless'' to make it absolutely sure that ``reckless'' is \nprotected. Their response? If the courts strike down ``reckless'' we \nwill remedy it.\n  I never impugn anyone's good faith, but I am a product of the \nexperience that I have had in this legislation. We were told back in \nthe 1990s that we would address the statute of limitation problem when \nwe looked at comprehensive legislation to correct that. It did not \noccur. We were told after the Central Bank case that we will address \nthe problem in which aiders and accomplices are no longer liable under \nthe law. We were rejected in that effort. So I must say I find my \ncomfort level not very high if the courts intend that. It seems to me \nif we are in earnest in wanting to protect that ``reckless'' standard, \nit is terribly important we use a definition which the SEC has \nprovided. Let's make it part of this legislation.\n  I am not unmindful of the fact that this bill is a train that is \nleaving the station. It will pass and it will be signed into law. But \nit would be a tragic mistake not to make absolutely sure that \n``reckless'' is included. I believe a fair reading of the 1995 \nlegislation should not give rise to an inference that ``reckless'' has \nsomehow been changed. I don't believe that was the intent. The authors \nof this legislation say it is not true, but even when we try to get it \nmoved into the findings of the legislation, we get resistance, so I \nhave concern.\n  Let me conclude by saying this is a piece of legislation which is a \nsolution in search of a problem, overly broad and dangerous to millions \nof small investors in America.\n  I yield the floor and reserve whatever time remains.\n  (Mr. FAIRCLOTH assumed the chair.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to lend my support to S. \n1260, the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act. This \nlegislation, introduced by Senator Gramm and Senator Dodd, is essential \nto my state of California, providing needed uniform national standards \nin securities fraud class actions.\n  In 1995, with my support, Congress successfully passed the Securities \nLitigation Reform Act. The 1995 Act provided relief to American \ncompanies hit with frivolous, or nuisance, lawsuits.\n\n[[Page S4797]]\n\n Specifically, the legislation adopted federal provisions to discourage \nnuisance securities lawsuits and increase the level of information \nprovided for investors.\n  This is very important to my state of California, where hundreds of \nburdensome lawsuits are filed each and every year. More than 60% of all \nCalifornia high tech firms have been sued at least once. Apple \nComputers executives stated they expect to be sued every two years. \nThese lawsuits levy a heavy cost on businesses who have to pay for \nexpensive legal battles, draining company resources which might \notherwise be spent on growing and improving the health of the company. \nSecurities litigation, as several high tech executives have described, \nis truly ``an uncontrolled tax on innovation.''\n  The high-tech industry has been central to the successful economic \nrecovery in California. As thousands of workers in the aerospace \nindustry lost their jobs, and as the recession of the '90s stalled the \neconomy, it was California's entrepreneurial spirit, the investment in \nnew ideas, research and new technology which resulted in a rebounding \neconomy.\n  In California, there are over 20,000 established high-tech companies. \nWith roughly 670,000 workers, California ranks 1st in the nation in \nhigh-tech employment. To put it in another way, for every 1,000 workers \nin my state, 62 are high-tech. That is significant when one considers \nthat as the 7th largest economy in the world, California supports \nalmost every kind of industry and business known to commerce.\n  Start-up companies in the high-tech and biotech industries are most \ndirectly affected by securities lawsuits. These high-tech and biotech \ncompanies dedicate a large percentage of company funds for research and \ndevelopment. The average high tech firm invests between 16-20% of \ncompany revenues in research, with biotech firms often as high as 60%. \nThis level of investment is integral to their business success. \nHowever, with the burden of frivolous lawsuits, California companies \nare not able to use their resource on developing innovative \ntechnologies and new products for the market place.\n  The 1995 Securities Litigation Reform moved in the right direction. \nHowever, the 1995 legislation did not address recent actions by \nplaintiffs to file frivolous cases in state courts. Since the passage \nof the 1995 legislation, suits traditionally filed in federal courts \nare now being placed in state courts. The current law does not protect \ncompanies from this threat.\n  The bill, which I have been pleased to support, will protect \ncompanies from this side-door tactic. The Securities Litigation Uniform \nStandards Act of 1997 establishes uniform national standards in \nsecurities fraud class action suits. It would permit a defendant, \nwhether a company or individual, who is sued in state court to proceed \ninto federal court. This legislation would in effect require that every \nlarge securities class action be brought into federal court.\n  The creation of effective national standards will make it easier to \nprotect companies from so-called nuisance shareholder lawsuits. \nSpecifically, the legislation would provide for the shifting of \nsecurities lawsuits filed in a state court into the more appropriate \nfederal court, a process called ``removal.'' The removal authority \nwould only apply for class action suits involving nationally-traded \nsecurities, such as the New York Stock Exchange. Without removal \nauthority, these companies, whose securities are traded throughout the \nfifty states, could face liability under federal securities laws in \nfifty state courts. This widespread liability would undermine the \nreforms enacted in the 1995 Securities Litigation Reform Act.\n  Further, this legislation would prevent ``forum shopping,'' a method \nfor nuisance lawsuits to be initiated in the most sympathetic state \njurisdiction. This is a very real concern for California. According to \na recent study by former Securities and Exchange Commissioner Joseph A. \nGrundfest, approximately 26% of litigation activity has moved from \nfederal to state court since the passage of the 1995 law. The study \nelaborates:\n\n       This increase in state court litigation is likely the \n     result of a `substitution effect' whereby plaintiffs' counsel \n     file state court complaints when the underlying fact appear \n     not to be sufficient to satisfy new, more stringent federal \n     pleading requirements.\n\n  California is the home to one-third of the nation's biotechnology \ncompanies and medical device companies. These firms have been the \nsource of tremendous growth. Yet these high tech firms are the very \nones who face one of every four strike suits and who have had to pay \nhundreds of millions of dollars in settlements. National standards will \naddress this problem effectively and fairly.\n  By establishing a uniform system for the movement of cases from state \nto federal court, Congress can limit abusive lawsuits that inhibit \neconomic and job growth. The Securities Litigation Uniform Standards \nAct of 1997 will offer important protection for American companies from \nnuisance lawsuits.\n  I appreciate the efforts of the Banking Committee and the sponsors, \nSenator Gramm and Senator Dodd, for their work on this issue and \nencourage my fellow Senate colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to S. 1260, \nthe Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act. This bill seeks to \nprevent states from protecting their own citizens from unscrupulous \nactions by a small minority in the securities industry. We must allow \nstates to protect their own investors, and this further intrusion into \nstates rights is unwarranted by the evidence.\n  Preempting state remedies now--and requiring fraud victims to seek \nrelief solely under the federal standards promulgated in 1995--could \nleave investors with severely limited ability to protect themselves \nagainst fraud. We should permit the 1995 Private Securities Litigation \nReform Act to be interpreted by the courts before we embark on this \neffort to anticipate future problems with the PSLRA that have not yet \narisen. Several federal district courts have issued rulings on the 1995 \nlaw that are so restrictive that they threaten almost all private \nenforcement of securities law--including holding that reckless \nwrongdoers are no longer liable to their victims under the PSLRA.\n  The SEC has warned in briefs filed in these cases that such a result \nwould essentially end private enforcement of the federal securities \nlaws. By eliminating state remedies for fraud before knowing whether \nthe courts will finally interpret the PSLRA in a way that provides \nvictims with a viable means to recover their losses, S. 1260 risks not \nonly harming innocent investors but undermining public confidence in \nour securities markets.\n  There is no need for any federal action inasmuch as there have been \nfew state securities class actions filed since the PSLRA passed, and \nmost have been in one state. Preemption proponents cite an imaginary \n``explosion'' of state suits filed to ``circumvent'' the PSLRA in the \ntwo years since its enactment. But the mere handful of state securities \nclass actions filed in 1997--only 44 nationwide--represents a one-third \ndecrease since 1996 and is less than in the three years before the \nPSLRA was passed. It also is an infinitesimally small percentage of the \nroughly 15 million civil cases filed in state courts each year. No \nstate other than California has had more than seven securities class \nactions filed in the two years since enactment of the PSLRA. Given \nthese small numbers, there is no reason why states should not be left \nfree to decide how best to protect their own citizens from fraud.\n  State laws against securities fraud are part of a dual enforcement \nsystem that has served the country exceptionally well since the \nDepression. States enacted protections against financial schemes in the \nearly 1900s. Congress passed federal securities laws in 1933 and 1934 \nto complement--not replace--state laws and to stop abuses that caused \nthe 1929 crash. Many states have chosen to provide more expansive \ninvestor protections than federal law currently provides--through \naccountability for aiders and abettors, realistic time limits for \nfiling a fraud claim, and the ability to recover fully from \nprofessionals who help perpetrate frauds (like lawyers and accountants) \nwhen the main wrongdoer is bankrupt, in jail, or has fled the country. \nFor example, according to the SEC, 49 of the 50 states provide \nliability for aiders and abettors now unavailable under federal law and \n33 states provide longer statutes of limitations for securities fraud \nactions than current federal law. S. 1260 would\n\n[[Page S4798]]\n\ntake away these important state remedies.\n  This effort has been underway virtually since the PSLRA passed. It is \nnot based on the new realities created by the PSLRA, but rather to \neliminate another form of protection for investors. The SEC has \nrepeatedly expressed concern that federal legislation to preempt state \nlaws is premature. In an April 1997 letter to the President forwarding \na lengthy SEC report on the operation of the PSLRA, Chairman Arthur \nLevitt stated, ``The Commission endorses the ultimate conclusion of \nthis report: it is too early to assess with great confidence many \nimportant effects of the [PSLRA] and therefore, on this basis, it is \npremature to propose legislative changes. . . The one-year time frame \nhas not allowed for sufficient practical experience with the Reform \nAct's provisions, or for many court decisions (particularly appellate \ncourt decisions) interpreting those provisions.'' The SEC reiterated \nthis view in October 1997 testimony before both the House and Senate \nand has specifically criticized the pending preemption legislation, \nstating that it ``would deprive investors of important protections.'' \nSEC Commissioner Norman Johnson, a Republican, has been especially \ncritical: ``Given the possible adverse affect on investor confidence, \nas well as the long history of effective and concurrent federal and \nstate securities regulation, and the strong federalism concerns raised \nby preemption . . . extreme caution should be exercised before state \ncourthouse doors are closed to small investors through the preclusion \nof state class actions for securities fraud.'' While three of the five \nSEC Commissioners no longer oppose S. 1260, there has been no change in \nany of the underlying facts that led to the SEC's earlier report and \ntestimony. Commissioner Johnson continues to oppose S. 1260.\n  With more and more Americans participating in the stock market boom, \nit is more imperative that we maintain these investor protections, not \nweaken them. According to a front-page article in the November 30, \n1997, New York Times, ``Investment Fraud Is Soaring Along with the \nStock Market.'' This was only one in a long line of recent articles \nreporting on widespread fraud in the financial markets--a fact \nacknowledged by federal and state enforcement officials nationwide. The \nNational White Collar Crime Center reports that corporate financial \ncrime costs $565 billion annually, nearly 12 times the amount of street \ncrime. The New York Attorney General has reported that investor \ncomplaints have risen 40% per year in the past two years; the U.S. \nAttorney in New York City has stated that she has witnessed an \n``explosion'' of securities fraud; and the mob has now infiltrated Wall \nStreet. Yet, federal and state enforcement resources are shrinking. As \nSEC Chairman Levitt observed in December 1997: ``In a market like this, \nparasites crowd in to feast on the bull's success.'' In light of all \nthis, Congress should strengthen, not weaken, existing deterrents.\n  This premption of state law is opposed by a broad coalition, \nincluding the American Association of Retired Persons; American \nFederation of State County and Municipal Workers; Consumer Federation \nof America; Consumers Union; Gray Panthers; Government Finance Officers \nAssociation; Municipal Treasurers' Association; National League of \nCities; National Association of Counties; National Association of \nCounty Treasurers and Finance Officers and many, many others.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this \nunnecessary and unwarranted federal intrusion into what should \nappropriately be state law.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, S. 1260, the Securities Litigation Uniform \nStandards Act of 1998, is intended to create a uniform national \nstandard for securities fraud class actions involving nationally-traded \nsecurities. In advocating enactment of uniform national standards for \nsuch actions, I firmly believe that the national standards must be fair \nones that adequately protect investors. I hope that Senator D'Amato, \none of the architects of the Banking Committee's substitute, would \nengage in a colloquy with me on this point?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. DODD. At a hearing on S. 1260 last October, the Securities and \nExchange Commission (SEC) voiced concern over some recent federal \ndistrict court decisions on the state of mind--or scienter--requirement \nfor pleading fraud was adopted in the Private Securities Litigation \nReform Act of 1995 ('95 Reform Act or PSLRA). According to the SEC, \nsome federal district courts have concluded that the '96 Reform Act \nadopted a pleading standard that was more rigorous than the Second \nCourt's, which, at the time of enactment of the PSLRA, had the toughest \npleading standards in the nation. Some of these courts have also \nsuggested that the 95 Reform Act changed not only the pleading standard \nbut also the standard for proving the scienter requirement. At the time \nwe enacted the PSLRA, every federal court of appeals in the nation--ten \nin number--concluded that the scienter requirement could be met by \nproof of recklessness.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I am sympathetic to the SEC's concerns. In acting now to \nestablish uniform national standards, it is important that we make \nclear our understanding of the standards created by the '95 Reform Act \nbecause those are the standards that will apply if S. 1260 is enacted \ninto law. My clear intent in 1995, and my understanding today, is that \nthe PSLRA did not in any way alter the scienter standard in federal \nsecurities fraud lawsuits. The '95 Reform Act requires plaintiffs, and \nI quote, ``to the state with particularity facts giving rise to a \nstrong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of \nmind.'' The '95 Reform Act makes no attempt to alter or define that \nstate of mind. In addition, it was my intent in 1995, and it is my \nunderstanding today, that the '95 Reform Act adopted the pleading \nstandard applied in the Second Circuit.\n  Mr. DODD. I agree with the comments of my colleague from New York. I \ntoo, did not intend for the PSLRA to alter the state of mind \nrequirement in securities fraud lawsuits or to adopt a pleading \nstandard more stringent than that of the Second Circuit. In fact, I \nspecifically stated during the legislative debates preceding and \nfollowing the President's veto that the '95 Reform Act adopted the \nSecond Circuit's pleading standard. This continues to be my \nunderstanding and intent today. Ensuring that the scienter standard \nincludes reckless misconduct is critical to investor protection. \nCreating a higher scienter standard would lessen the incentives for \nissuers of securities to conduct a full inquiry into potentially \ntroublesome areas and could therefore damage the disclosure process \nthat has made our markets a model for other nations. The U.S. \nsecurities markets are the envy of the world precisely because \ninvestors at home and abroad have enormous confidence in the way our \nmarkets operate. Altering the scienter standard in the way envisioned \nby some of these district court decisions could be very damaging to \nthat confidence.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. My friend from Connecticut is correct. The federal \nsecurities laws must include a scienter requirement that adequately \nprotects investors. I was surprised and dismayed to learn that some \ndistrict court decisions had not followed the clear language of the '95 \nReform Act, which is the basis upon which the uniform national standard \nin today's legislation will be created.\n  Mr. DODD. It appears that these district courts have misread the \nlanguage of the '95 Reform Act's ``Statement of Managers.'' As I made \nclear in the legislative debate following the President's veto, \nhowever, the disputed language in the Statement of Managers was simply \nmeant to explain that the Conference Committee omitted the Specter \namendment because that amendment did not adequately reflect existing \nSecond Circuit caselaw on the pleading standard. I can only hope that \nwhen the issue reaches the federal courts of appeals, these courts will \nundertake a more thorough review of the legislative history and correct \nthese decisions. While I trust that the courts will ultimately honor \nCongress' clear intent, should the Supreme Court eventually find that \nrecklessness no longer suffices to meet the scienter standard, it is my \nintent to introduce legislation that would explicitly restore \nrecklessness as the pleading and liability standard for federal \nsecurities fraud lawsuits. I imagine that I would not be alone in this \nendeavor, and I ask my good friend from New York whether he would join \nme in introducing such legislation?\n\n[[Page S4799]]\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I say to the Senator from Connecticut that I would be \npleased to work with him to introduce such legislation under those \ncircumstances. I agree that investors must be allowed a means to \nrecover losses caused by reckless misconduct. Should the court deprive \ninvestors of this important protection, such legislation would be in \norder.\n  Mr. DODD. I want to thank the Senator from New York, the Chairman of \nthe Banking Committee, for his leadership on this bill and for engaging \nin this colloquy with me. In proceeding to create uniform national \nstandards while some issues concerning the '95 Reform Act are still \nbeing decided by the courts, we must act based on what we intended and \nunderstand the '95 Reform Act to mean. As a sponsor of both the Senate \nbill that became the '95 Reform Act and the bill, S. 1260, that we are \ndebating today, I am glad that we have had this opportunity to clarify \nhow the PSLRA's pleading standards will function as the uniform \nnational standards to be created in S. 1260, the Securities Litigation \nUniform Standards Act of 1998.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in 1995, we passed the Private Securities \nLitigation Reform Act or PSLRA, as it became known. Our intent was to \nprevent abusive filings by a group of trial attorneys who were using a \nloophole in our laws. These lawsuits were often entirely without merit \nand really amounted to strong-arm efforts to get money out of small \nstart-up companies. Our legislation was aimed at putting an end to \nthese strike suits and to a large extent it has succeeded.\n  Many of these companies could take the capital they were expending on \nlitigation and settlement costs and invest in research in development. \nThey could provide greater returns to their shareholders. They could \ncreate more jobs.\n  Unfortunately, the small group of attorneys who were involved in this \nloophole found another way to get their frivolous strike suits heard in \ncourt. They shifted their efforts to state courts.\n  The SEC has noted this development saying that this ``apparent shift \nto state court may be the most significant development in securities \nlitigation'' since the '95 legislation was enacted. Before the '95 Act, \nfew, if any, securities class actions were filed in state court. Since \nit's enactment, the number of state claims has exploded.\n  A study by Price Waterhouse found that the average number of state \ncourt securities class actions filed in 1996 grew 355 percent over the \n1991-1995 average. In 1997, filings were 150 percent greater than the \n1991-1995 average. While the number of state court filings dropped \nslightly in 1997 compared to 1996 it is believed this is due to a \nstrategic desire by plaintiffs' lawyers to undercut the underlying \nlegislation.\n  According to Stanford Law School official Michael Perino:\n\n       It is possible that plaintiffs' attorneys may simply have \n     strategically chosen not to pursue a significant number of \n     state cases in order to decrease the apparent necessity for \n     Congress to pass a federal preemption statute. Past \n     experience * * * indicates that plaintiffs respond \n     strategically to legislative initiatives that might alter the \n     costs and benefits of securities litigation.\n\n  The State court litigation is a loophole around the PSLRA. This is \nundermining the bipartisan efforts we made in passing the PSLRA to give \ncompanies the ability to disclose more information to investors without \nthe fear of being sued. But the threat of being sued in 50 states \nchills the disclosure of company information to investors.\n  People are understandably reluctant to make disclosures under the \nFederal law's ``safe harbor'' provision when their statements can be \nused against them in state court. According to the SEC, fear of state \ncourt liability for forward looking statements was inhibiting the use \nof the PSLRA's safe harbor.\n  The time to act on this is now. Delay undermines one of the main \npolicy goals of the PSLRA--greater information flow to investors. \nDelays will cause a proliferation of litigation in state courts. Delay \nforces all parties to spend millions of dollars arguing about matters \nthat uniform standards legislation can put to rest.\n  As time goes on, states will reach different legislative and judicial \nresults--this just furthers the confusion. As President Clinton wrote \nlast year, ``the proliferation of multiple and inconsistent standards \ncould undermine national law.''\n  We need to prevent this confusion by putting a stop to this end run \naround Congress. A patchwork system of securities laws undermines \nAmerica's capital markets. Capital formation is inhibited by \noverlapping the duplicative legal rules governing securities \nlitigation. Uniform standards legislation ensures that purchasers and \nsellers of nationally traded securities have similar remedies in \nsecurities lawsuits regardless of their state of residence.\n  It is time to close this loophole and put an end to this high priced \nextortion that seems to be benefitting only a few trial attorneys.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few brief words \nof support for the bill we are now considering, the Securities \nLitigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998. I was an original co-sponsor \nof this important legislation. Through its passage, we in Congress can \ncontinue to send the strong message to the nation's securities markets \nand the country's investors that we first articulated in 1995 with the \nenactment of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act: we will not \nlet frivolous lawsuits disrupt our nation's securities markets, devalue \nour citizens' investments or cut off the free flow of information we \nall need to make reasoned and well-informed investment decisions.\n  I was a proud supporter of the 1995 Act, which restored some \nrationality and common sense to the laws regulating federal securities \nlitigation. That bill set specific standards for federal private class \nactions alleging securities fraud, so that those deserving of \ncompensation received it, while those seeking only to profit from the \nfiling of an abusive suit did not. Unfortunately, in the wake of that \nAct, some enterprising plaintiffs' attorneys have turned to State \ncourts to file abusive suits. Through these State court actions, \nplaintiffs' attorneys have effectively circumvented the reforms the \n1995 Act put in place, reforms we in Congress overwhelmingly embraced \nin the 1995 Act.\n  Were the regulation of nationally traded securities a matter of \npurely local concern, I might agree with those who see nothing wrong \nwith this phenomenon--who argue that each State should be free to set \nfor itself the laws governing actions in its courts. But we clearly are \nnot dealing here with something of only local concern. To the contrary, \nthe securities governed by this bill--and it is important to emphasize \nthis point--are by definition trading on national exchanges. As we all \nknow, securities traded on national exchanges are bought and sold by \ninvestors in every State, and those investors rely on information \ndistributed on a national basis. It simply makes no sense to open those \nwho make statements about national securities on a national basis to \nclass actions brought under 50 separate State regulatory regimes--not \nif we want efficient and well-functioning securities markets, that is. \nIn short, not only is a uniform standard appropriate in this case; it \nprovides perhaps the quintessential example of something that should be \nsubject to one set of standards nationwide.\n  For this reason, it is not surprising that this bill has the support, \nnot only of a significant portion of the Congress, but also of both the \nSEC and the Administration. As someone involved for many years in \nefforts to reform our nation's litigation system, I can say with \nconfidence that the fact that both the SEC and the Administration \nsupport this bill speaks volumes to the merits of this bill.\n  Let me close, Mr. President, by thanking the principal sponsors of \nthis bill, particularly Senators Dodd, D'Amato, Gramm and Domenici. \nThey have worked hard to accommodate all legitimate concerns raised \nabout this bill, working particularly closely with both the SEC and the \nAdministration, and making significant changes to the bill as it moved \nto the floor. I join with them in urging my colleagues to pass this \nimportant legislation today.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose S. 1260, the \n``Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1997.''\n  Mr. President, we are considering legislation that would risk \nimperiling the financial security of those individuals most susceptible \nto fraud. The American Association of Retired Persons opposes this \nlegislation based on\n\n[[Page S4800]]\n\nthe bill's anti-investment character and the heightened dependence of \nsenior citizens on investment. I find it very odd that in a time when \nthe stock market is doing so well that some of my colleagues are \nconsidering exposing Social Security to the vagaries of the booms and \nbusts of Wall Street, we are preventing the states from protecting \ntheir citizens from securities fraud. In a time when more Americans are \nrelying on investments for financial security--especially retirees--we \nare rolling back protections.\n  Many states, my own included, have laws which provide for increased \npenalties for fraud perpetrated against Seniors and the disabled--the \nMinnesota statute mentions securities specifically--and Congress has \nalways given the states great leeway in protecting their consumers. In \nMinnesota, there is an additional civil penalty of $10,000 for each \nviolation where deceptive trade practices, false advertising, or \nconsumer fraud are perpetrated against elderly and disabled persons.\n  Not only are seniors and the disabled at great risk for fraud, they \nare increasingly becoming investors and they are least able to recoup \nthe income lost. It is devastating for anyone to lose their life \nsavings through a lie, to have their pension wiped out, but for \nAmericans on a fixed income--it will destroy them, Mr. President.\n  I cannot support this legislation. It is bad for investors, it is \nterrible for seniors and the disabled, and it addresses a problem which \ndoes not exist at the expense of consumers.\n  I urge its rejection.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, as a supporter of the Private Securities \nLitigation Reform Act of 1995 I am pleased to support S. 1260, the \nSecurities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998.\n  The bill will create a uniform standard for securities class action \nlawsuits against corporations listed on the three largest national \nexchanges.\n  Class action suits are frequently the only financially feasible means \nfor small investors to recover damages.\n  Yet, such lawsuits have also been subject to abuse, draining \nresources from corporations while inadequately representing the \ninterests of investor plaintiffs.\n  Mr. President, in 1995, I voted to curtail such abusive litigation. \nIt was obvious then that some class action suits were being filed after \na precipitous drop in the value of a corporation's stock, without \nciting specific evidence of fraud.\n  These lawsuits inflict substantial costs upon corporations, harming \nthe business and its shareholders. Unfortunately, since passage of \nfederal procedures protecting corporations from such suits there has \nbeen some attempt by class action plaintiffs to circumvent these \nsafeguards by filing similar lawsuits in state courts.\n  Mr. President, this Act will preempt this circumvention, creating a \nnational standard for class action suits involving nationally traded \nsecurities. I favor this legislation because it recognizes the national \nnature of our securities markets, provides for more efficient capital \nformation, and protects investors.\n  However, Mr. President, it is essential to recognize that preemption \nmarks a significant change concerning the obligations of Congress.\n  When federal legislation was enacted to combat securities fraud in \n1933 and 1934, federal law augmented existing state statutes. States \nwere free to provide greater protections from fraud to their citizens, \nand many have.\n  The Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission has testified \nconcerning the traditional system by which securities have been \nregulated: through both public and private lawsuits in both state and \nfederal courts.\n  Many of my colleagues voted for the 1995 legislation knowing that if \nfederal standards failed to provide adequate investor protections, \nstate suits would provide a necessary backup.\n  With passage of this legislation, my colleagues and I have now \naccepted full and sole responsibility to ensure that fraud standards \nallow victimized investors to recoup lost funds.\n  Only a meaningful right of action against those that defraud \nguarantees investor confidence in our national markets.\n  A uniform national standard concerning fraud provides no benefit to \nmarkets if issuers can, with impunity, fail to ensure that consumers \nreceive truthful, complete information on which to base investment \ndecisions.\n  Specifically, my support rests on the presumption that the liability \nstandard was not altered by either the 1995 Act or this legislation.\n  I strongly endorse the Report which accompanies this legislation, \nwhich states clearly that nothing in the 1995 legislation changed \neither the scienter standard or the previous pleading standards \nassociated with the most stringent rules, those of the Second Circuit.\n  The reason such standards were not changed in 1995 is that they are \nessential to providing adequate investor protection from fraud.\n  I have been deeply troubled by the ruling of several federal district \ncourts which, ignoring the clear legislative history of the 1995 Act, \nhave either changed the requirements of scienter in a fraud case or \nhave invalidated the proper pleading standard for a 10b-5 action.\n  Mr. President, let me be clear: nothing in the act addressed the \nscienter standard: which has quite rightly been held by every Circuit \nto rule on the issue to include recklessness.\n  With regard to proper pleadings: the PSLRA requires plaintiffs to \nplead specific facts ``giving rise to a strong inference'' that the \ndefendants acted with the required state of mind. Prior to the 1995 \nlegislation, some circuit courts allowed scienter to be averred \ngenerally. However, the PSLRA's heightened standard was specifically \nlinked to the most stringent pleading standard at the time, that of the \nSecond Circuit. That standard allows a plaintiff to establish a case by \neither pleading motive and opportunity or recklessness.\n  Mr. President, I believe that SEC Chairman Levitt, who has a lifetime \nof experience as both an investor and regulator of markets, has been \nthe most articulate concerning the need for a recklessness standard \nconcerning the scienter requirement.\n  In October 21, 1997 testimony before the Subcommittee on Finance and \nHazardous Materials of the House's Committee on Commerce, Chairman \nLevitt said:\n\n       In my judgment, eliminating recklessness from the \n     securities anti-fraud laws would be tantamount to eliminating \n     manslaughter from the criminal laws. It would be like saying \n     you have to prove intentional murder or the defendants gets \n     off scot free. . . . If we were to lose the reckless \n     standard, in my judgement, we would leave substantial numbers \n     of the investing public naked to attacks by fraudsters and \n     schemers.\n\n  In testimony before the Banking Subcommittee Chair by Senator Gramm, \non October 29, 1997, Chairman Levitt further articulated his position \nregarding the impact a loss of recklessness would have. He said:\n\n       A uniform federal standard that did not include \n     recklessness as a basis for liability would jeopardize the \n     integrity of the securities markets, and would deal a \n     crippling blow to defrauded investors with meritorious \n     claims. A higher scienter standard would lessen the \n     incentives for corporations to conduct a full inquiry into \n     potentially troublesome or embarrassing areas, and thus would \n     threaten the disclosure process that has made our markets a \n     model for nations around the world.\n\n  I think the danger that a loss of recklessness posses to our citizens \nand our markets is clear.\n  Mr. President, equally important is a pleading standard that allows \nvictimized investors to recover their losses. The reason for allowing a \nplaintiff to establish scienter through a pleading of motive and \nopportunity or recklessness is clear. As one New York Federal District \nCourt has stated, ``a plaintiff realistically cannot be expected to \nplead a defendant's actual state of mind.''\n  Since the 1995 Act allows for a stay of discovery pending a \ndefendant's motion to dismiss, requiring a plaintiff to establish \nactual knowledge of fraud or an intent to defraud in a complaint raises \nthe bar far higher than most legitimately defrauded investors can meet.\n  The SEC has been clear on this point and it has been well recognized \nby the supporters of both the 1995 and 1998 Acts that neither changed \nthe preexisting standards.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the Chairman of the Committee and \nthe Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, a prime sponsor of this \nlegislation, have today articulated their belief that including \nreckless behavior in the definition of fraud is essential to the \nprotection of our markets. I join them in\n\n[[Page S4801]]\n\ntheir pledge to sponsor legislation should such protections be \nthreatened.\n  As a result, the legislative history of both bills well establishes \nthat the scienter standard, as well as the pleading standard of the \nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals, remains totally intact. Therefore, it \nis now clear that federal district court rulings that have held \notherwise are clearly in error.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan analysis, preformed for me by the staff of the SEC, of cases \nadjudicated under the 1995 Act.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               U.S. Securities and\n\n\n                                          Exchange Commission,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 20, 1998.\n     Ted Long,\n     Legislative Counsel, Offices of Senator Jack Reed, Hart \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Long: The attached responds to your request for \n     staff technical assistance with respect to S. 1260, the \n     ``Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1997.''

Supp. \n     205, 208 (S.D.N.Y. 1997).\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, as this legislation makes clear, those \nrulings that reject the reckless standard, or the Second Circuit's \npleading standard are clearly wrong and a threat to the security of our \nmarkets.\n  Mr. President, with assurances that proper protections for investors \nwill remain in place, I am pleased to support the 1998 Act, thus moving \ntoward an efficient, national uniform standard for securities class \naction lawsuits.\n  I trust that higher courts will adhere to current principles of \nlegislative history and case law to rule that the pleading and scienter \nstandards continue to protect investors and that we will remain true to \nour commitment and fix any error.\n  Additionally, as expressed in votes during the mark-up of this \nlegislation, I am concerned that the definition of class action, as \ncurrently included in the bill, is too broad.\n  Specifically, by defining a class as those whose claims have been \nconsolidated by a state court judge, the bill infringes upon the rights \nof individual investors to bring suit; a situation sponsors have sought \nto avoid. I hope that this issue can be resolved today on the floor.\n  Finally, I have appreciated the expert analysis that the Chair, \nCommissioners, and staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission have \nprovided on this issue. I thank them for their assistance.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to support the Securities \nLitigation Uniform Standards Act. I supported the 1995 Private \nSecurities Litigation Reform Act for three reasons: to stop the bounty \nhunters, to put the person who had lost the most money in charge of \nclass action suits, and to penalize people who commit fraud.\n  I have been very disturbed and disappointed to hear from many \nMaryland biotechnology and high technology companies that the 1995 \nreforms are being circumvented and, that in some respects, nothing has \nchanged.\n  Why has nothing changed even though we enacted those important \nreforms? Because some have refused to accept the law of the land. \nRather than abide by congressional efforts to protect small companies \nthat create jobs and help to maintain our robust economy, a small group \nof specialized lawyers have simply shifted their filings to state \ncourts.\n  Enacting this uniform standards legislation would close this loophole \nand enable Congress to finish the job of eliminating abusive securities \nlitigation that hampers and harms our economic future\n  Uniform standards would only involve class action suits with at least \n50 plaintiffs involving nationally traded securities. These claims were \nrarely filed in state courts until federal reform became law in \nDecember 1995.\n  This exposure of national companies and their shareholders to \nlawsuits by 50 different sets of rules amounts to a balkanization of \nsecurities law that boosts legal fees, distracts companies from \ncreating jobs, and erodes the value of shareholder investments.\n  I have heard from Maryland CPAs, venture capitalists, and Maryland \ncompanies along the I-270 High-Tech Highway that these uniform \nstandards are needed.\n  I believe that much of our economic future is in new and developing \nindustries such as high technology and bio-technology. New, high-tech \njobs are created only when companies generate capital to allow them to \nmove into new fields. Without a balanced and uniform legal system free \nof loopholes, these companies must spend too much on frivolous \nlitigation and not enough on investments to generate jobs.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is about perfecting the important \nreforms we passed in 1995 to protect our emerging industries as they \nstrive to innovate and create jobs. Promoting job creation is one of my \neconomic principles, and I am pleased to support this legislation \ntoday.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about S. 1260, the \nSecurities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998. I am pleased that \nthis bill\n\n[[Page S4802]]\n\nis being acted upon today. Enactment of this bill will implement the \nunderlying purpose of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of \n1995 by establishing uniform standards governing private securities \nlitigation.\n  The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provided a \n``safe harbor'' for forward-looking statements in order to encourage \ncompanies to make voluntary disclosures regarding future business \ndevelopments. This objective was important to provide an environment in \nwhich companies could provide more information to potential investors \nwithout undue risk of litigation.\n  Since passage of the 1995 Act, however, actions are often filed in \nstate courts in order to circumvent these very protections. The \nresulting threat of frivolous lawsuits and liability under state law \ndiscourages corporate disclosure of forward-looking information to \ninvestors, eroding investor protection and jeopardizing the capital \nmarkets that are so important to the productivity of the fast-growing \nsectors of our economy.\n  Uniform liability standards eliminate this threat and the drag on our \neconomy which it causes. The enactment of this bill will, I believe, be \na great impetus for new businesses, especially those in the rapidly \ngrowing high-tech and bio-tech fields of our economy. This bill thereby \ncreates a business atmosphere that encourages, rather than inhibits \neconomic growth.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting passage of S. 1260, \nthe Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1968.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 1260, the \nSecurities Litigation Uniform Standards Act, which is necessary to \npreserve the intent of the Public Securities Litigation Reform Act of \n1995. This bipartisan legislation is narrowly drafted to correct an \nunexpected consequence of the Public Securities Litigation Reform Act \nand is supported by the White House and the Securities and Exchange \nCommission (SEC).\n  Following enactment of the 1995 Act, it became apparent that trial \nlawyers were up to their old tricks by circumventing the intent of the \nlaw by bringing frivolous class action law suits in state courts, \nrather than in Federal court. Although brought in a different forum, \nthis action yields the same result--namely raising the cost to \ninvestors, workers, and customers. As a member of the conference \ncommittee on the 1995 Act, I can assure you that this is not the intent \nof Congress.\n  As its name implies, S. 1260 preserves the 1995 Act by establishing \nuniform standards governing private class actions involving nationally \ntraded securities. This bill does not interfere with the ability to \nbring criminal suits in state courts or for individuals to seek relief \nin state courts. Rather, this Act simply requires that class action \nlawsuits against nationally traded securities be filed in Federal \ncourt.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and hope that it \nwill be approved expeditiously so as to preserve the intent of the 1995 \nAct.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senators Dodd and \nGramm for their work in bringing this legislation before us today. I \nsupport this effort to reestablish the reasonable limitations the \nCongress established in 1995 with respect to class action lawsuits \nalleging the commission of securities fraud in connection with the \npurchase or sale of a covered security. This was a warranted and \nimportant step, and the efforts to effectively nullify it by bringing \nsuch suits in state courts must be halted, which this legislation does \nby requiring all class action suits of this type be brought in federal \ncourts.\n  While fraudulent actions by a company's management can destroy an \nindividual investor's retirement nest egg, a frivolous suit filed \nagainst a start-up high-technology company can stop that business dead \nin its tracks. We need to protect the rights and interests of both \nshareholders and entrepreneurs. Although no law can do that perfectly, \nI believe this legislation will bring us as close as possible to the \ncorrect balance.\n  The high technology sector has played an important part in the \neconomic development of Massachusetts and the nation. This sector, \nwhich has been the most frequent target of securities strike suits, is \ncritical to our future economic growth and the creation of highly \nskilled, family-wage jobs. Frivolous strike suits have had a chilling \neffect on start-up high-technology, biotechnology, and other growth \nbusinesses.\n  After the growth of frivolous strike suits during the first part of \nthis decade, passage of the Securities Litigation Reform Act in 1995 \nwas successful to a large degree in limiting strike suits in federal \ncourt. But litigants are too often circumvented its impediments to \nfrivolous lawsuits by bringing actions in state court, reinvigorating \nthe threat to emerging companies.\n  The Securities Litigation Reform Act's limits on discovery fishing \nexpeditions, until a court rules on the merits of a case, does not \napply in state court, and plaintiffs have begun to file state lawsuits \nin order to gain access to important company information--too often \nthis has permitted ``fishing expeditions'' into corporate files to try \nto find evidence of fraud. Actions such as these frustrate the intent \nof the reform law. Moving these cases to federal court should eliminate \nthese meritless ``fishing expeditions.''\n  Strike suits in state courts also have had a chilling effect on the \nnumber of companies which have released forward-looking statements on \nearnings. Companies fear that if the information on earnings that they \nrelease proves to be inaccurate, they will be held liable in state \ncourt. The lack of accurate, forward-looking information on companies \nmakes it more difficult for investors to make informed judgments about \ntheir future. Reducing suits to those that can meet federal court \nstandards should give these companies the confidence to release \nvoluntarily their future earnings estimates, which should increase the \nefficiency of capital and reduce future stock volatility in our \nmarkets.\n  Finally, the Securities Litigation Reform Act included important \nprovisions which restrict the use of ``professional plaintiffs,'' \neliminate bounty payments, limit attorneys' fees, assure class action \nlawsuit members receive notice of settlement terms, and restrict secret \nagreements under seal. None of these protections is available for class \naction suits brought in state courts.\n  Moving all class action securities lawsuits to federal court should \nlead to the creation of a more favorable, stable climate for businesses \nwhile preserving important remedial means for shareholders with \nlegitimate complaints about inappropriate corporate activities. \nInvestors should gain better information about the marketplace. A \ndiminished threat of abusive strike suits will strengthen the ability \nof businesses to provide investors with more information.\n  I believe this helps to restore the balance we seek on behalf of all \nAmericans, both those who are investors and those who are entrepreneurs \nand managers. I will support its passage and complement those who have \nbrought it to passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Maryland has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO.

Mr. President, Senator Cleland has been here for some \ntime on the floor. I know he wishes to speak to the bill, and in the \ncourse of those remarks would be speaking to this amendment, so I yield \nthe floor. I hope that Senator Cleland will be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Georgia.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my reservations \nabout the merits of S. 1260.\n  I served as Georgia's Secretary of State and Commissioner of \nSecurities for many years. I was responsible for administering \nGeorgia's securities laws and providing investor protection for Georgia \nresidents.\n  We are all aware that the securities markets are an integral part of \nour nation's economy and that we have experienced tremendous growth in \nthese markets. Nearly half of all American households now invest in the \nstock market either directly or through mutual funds. These are not \njust rich people trying to become richer. These are primarily middle \nclass Americans seeking to fund their children's education, to save up \nfor a down payment on a home, and to provide a decent standard of \nliving for themselves in retirement. In 1990, only 17.8 percent of all \nAmericans invested in equities but that figure has grown dramatically, \nand one in three households now own securities.\n  Unfortunately, these successes have led to a tremendous increase in \nfraud and abuse. Recently, top securities watchdogs in the United \nStates have warned that the explosion in the stock market has led to a \nsharp rise in securities sales fraud and stock price manipulation. \nSeveral studies have shown that many Americans lack the financial \nsophistication to protect themselves from fraud. At a town meeting in \nLos Angeles, SEC Chairman Levitt cautioned that investors are ``more \nvulnerable than ever to fraud.'' This concern has been echoed by others \nwho point to a disturbing rise in the level of securities fraud and \nthere are many allegations that organized crime is seeking a foothold \nin certain sectors of the securities marketplace.\n  It is unclear whether there is any means for defrauded investors to \nrecover stolen money under federal law following the passage of the \n1995 PSLRA, which severely limits the rights of defrauded investors. \nPreemption of state remedies under S. 1260 could lead investors with no \nability to protect themselves against fraud. Several federal district \ncourts have issued rulings on the 1995 law that are so restrictive that \nthey threaten almost all private enforcement--including holding that \nreckless wrongdoers are no longer liable to their victims under the \nPSLRA. I strongly disagree with this interpretation because Congress, \nwhen it crafted the PSLRA, it did not intend to eliminate recklessness \nas a standard of liability. On the contrary, it is my understanding \nthat the PSLRA did not, in any way, alter the scienter standard in \nfederal securities fraud suits.\n  Let us be clear about who suffers in the cases of securities fraud--\nit is retirees living on fixed incomes, young families struggling to \nmake ends meet and save for their children's education, teachers, and \nfactory workers. Each day, devastating cases are brought to the \nattention of securities regulators and law enforcement officers. \nIndeed, financial fraud is a serious and growing problem. No discussion \nabout securities litigation reform is complete without serious \nconsideration of the potential impact on small investors across the \ncountry. The elimination of state remedies against fraud could be \ncatastrophic for millions of Americans. The fundamental purpose of \nsecurities law is to protect investors, something that S. 1260 does not \nadequately address. In fact, S. 1260 is designed merely to protect big \nbusiness.\n  The confidence in our securities markets results, in part, because of \nthe cooperative enforcement system that has served the United States \nexceptionally well since the Depression. Substantive securities \nregulation in this country began at the state level. In 1911, the State \nof Kansas enacted the nation's first Blue Sky Law. Other states quickly \nadopted their own version of such legislation. Congress passed federal \nsecurities laws in 1933 and 1934 to complement--not replace--state laws \nand to stop abuses that caused the 1929 crash.\n  Many states have chosen to provide more expansive investor \nprotections than federal law currently provides--through accountability \nfor aiders and abettors, realistic time limits for filing a fraud \nclaim, and the ability of investors to recover fully from professionals \nwho help perpetrate frauds when the primary wrongdoer is bankrupt, in \njail, or has fled the country.\n  In the late 1980s as Secretary of State, I conducted a series of \npublic hearings to focus on securities fraud taking place in Georgia. \nThis led me to recommend a number of changes to strengthen Georgia's \nsecurities laws. These changes established significant disclosure \nrequirements for those dealers offering and selling certain stocks \nwithin or from the state of Georgia. These recommendations were \nunanimously enacted as amendments to the Georgia Securities Act, and \ngave my staff more tools to effectively deal with securities fraud. The \nGeorgia legislature also installed securities fraud as a predicate \noffense for purposes of liability under the RICO statute. I am pleased \nto report that the efforts of the Georgia General Assembly are the rule \nrather than the exception. According to the SEC, 49 of the 50 states \nprovide liability for aiders and abettors now unavailable under federal \nlaw, and 33 states provide longer statutes of limitations for \nsecurities fraud actions than current federal law. Mr. President, S. \n1260 would undermine these important state remedies.\n  Simply put, S. 1260 is an affront to the efforts of state governments \nacross the country to locally protect their public investors from \nfraudulent securities transactions. For example, this bill reinforces \nthe unduly short statute of limitations in federal law. In effect, \nfederal law rewards those perpetrators of fraud who successfully \nconceal the fraud for more than three years. A majority of states have \nstatutes of limitations that are longer than the federal statute. As \ncurrently written, S. 1260 would preempt those state laws. Furthermore, \nthe definition of ``class action'' contained in this bill is overly \nbroad. I have been informed that the definition of ``class action'' in \nS. 1260 would allow single suits filed in the same or different state \ncourts to be rolled into a larger federal class action, and this was \nnever contemplated or desired by individual plaintiffs.\n\n  Another cause for concern is that under S. 1260, defrauded state and \nlocal pension funds are barred from recovering from corporate \nwrongdoers in state court. Since many remedies have already been \nforeclosed in federal court, the state or local government and its \ntaxpayers may be required to make up losses in the pension fund \nresulting from fraudulent securities transactions. If state and local \ngovernments are creatures of state law, shouldn't they be entitled to \npursue state remedies?\n  State and local government representatives are unequivocal in their \nopposition to S. 1260. The National League of Cities, the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, the Government Finance Officers Association, and \nthe National Association of State Retirement Administrators all reject \nthe bill in its current form.\n  Mr. President, I am not convinced that the federal preemption of \nstate\n\n[[Page S4804]]\n\nanti-fraud protections is a necessary step. Preemption supporters \nemphasize an ``explosion'' of state suits filed to circumvent the PSLRA \nin the two years since its enactment. Yet the number of state \nsecurities class actions filed in 1997--only 44 nationwide--represents \na 33 percent decrease since 1996 and is lower than the number filed in \nany of the three years before the PSLRA was passed. In addition, most \nof the state court cases have been filed in California. No state other \nthan California has had more than seven securities class actions filed \nin the two years since the enactment of the PSLRA. Mr. President, if a \nproblem exists, then it should be addressed in Sacramento, not \nWashington, and I understand that California has already established a \nlegislative commission to study its laws and make changes if necessary. \nOther states should be free to decide how to protect their own citizens \nfrom fraud.\n  Mr. President, I support the right of investors to seek legal \nremedies against those persons selling fraudulent securities. I have \nsupported an investor's right to seek redress through mediation, \narbitration, and civil litigation. While I worked to streamline the \nregulatory process in Georgia, I opposed amendments to federal \nregulations that would have impaired the ability of a state to protect \nits investors. Here in the Senate, my focus remains the same. For this \nreason, I oppose S. 1260.\n  Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I believe that my colleague, the Senator \nfrom Maryland, is going to speak to this amendment. This amendment \nwould indeed promote forum shopping for those lawyers to look for the \nState that had the longest statute of limitations.\n  I point out the Lampf decision, which will be referred to. After that \ndecision, in a sample of actions brought in the State courts, 43 of \nthem were filed within the 4-year period of time--43 out of a total of \n44. So we do not believe this amendment will do anything other than to \npromote forum shopping for the longest period of time, and that it \nreally counteracts the Supreme Court's decision, which has not worked a \nhardship on plaintiffs who have a legitimate suit or seek to bring it.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this amendment, as the Senator from New \nYork has indicated, goes to the question of the statute of limitations, \nand it seeks to preserve the State statutes of limitations.\n  Let me quickly review the history. In the Lampf case, which my \ncolleague referred to, the Supreme Court significantly shortened the \nperiod of time in which investors may bring securities fraud actions. \nOn a 5 to 4 vote--in other words, in a very closely divided Court--the \nSupreme Court held that the applicable statute of limitations is 1 year \nafter the plaintiff knew of a violation, and in no event more than 3 \nyears after the violation occurred. In other words, once the violation \noccurs, if the plaintiff never finds out about it and 3 years pass, you \ncan't do anything about it, even though, of course, one of the \nhallmarks of securities fraud is concealment and deception specifically \ndesigned to keep them from finding it out.\n  The other aspect was 1 year after the plaintiff knew of the \nviolation. Now, this is shorter--this statute of limitations --than \nthose that exist in private securities actions in the law in 33 of the \n50 States, as my distinguished colleague illustrated earlier with his \nmap.\n  Testifying before the Banking Committee in 1991, SEC Chairman Richard \nBreeden stated:\n\n       The timeframe set forth in the Court's decision is \n     unrealistically short and will do undue damage to the ability \n     of private litigants to sue.\n\n  Chairman Breeden went on to point out that many cases come to light \nonly after the original distribution of securities. The Lampf cases \ncould well mean that, by the time investors discover they have a case, \nthey are already barred from the courthouse. The FDIC and the State \nsecurities regulators joined the SEC in 1991 in favor of overturning \nthe Lampf decision. In fact, Chairman Levitt testified before the \nSecurities Subcommittee of our committee in April of 1995:\n\n       Extending the statute of limitations is warranted because \n     many securities frauds are inherently complex and the law \n     should not reward the perpetrator of a fraud who successfully \n     conceals its existence for more than 3 years.\n\n  Chairman Levitt reaffirmed his support for a longer statute of \nlimitations before the committee as recently as March 25, 1998. I \ncontinue to believe that this time period in the Federal legislation \ndoes not allow individual investors adequate time to discover and \npursue violations of securities law, but we raised that issue before \nand that issue was decided.\n  So this amendment isn't trying to change the time period for \nsecurities fraud actions brought in Federal court. This amendment seeks \nto fix a related problem that will be created by this bill. Because of \nthe overly broad definition of a class action, this bill creates a \nflaw; namely, that the Federal statute of limitations will now apply in \nan unfair manner to State cases. Cases that were timely filed under \nState statute of limitations may now be removed to Federal court and \nthen dismissed under the shorter Federal statute of limitations.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Maryland yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Is the Senator indicating that an investor who files in a \nState court in a timely fashion after having consulted with legal \ncounsel that said, yes, this is a timely action--and we shall assume \nfor the sake of the discussion meritorious--can have his action, in \neffect, dismissed by having it removed to the Federal court and the \nshorter statute of limitations of 1 to 3 years as is required under \nFederal law?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Exactly.\n  Mr. BRYAN. It will wipe them out.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Investors who file in a timely fashion under State law \nmay find their lawsuits dismissed because, contrary to their intention, \nand in many instances unbeknownst to them that this would happen, they \nfind themselves lifted out of a State court, put into the Federal \ncourt, and at that point the shorter statutes of limitations apply. So \ntheir suit is dismissed for failure to meet a shorter time requirement \nthat they couldn't have known was going to be applied to them.\n  This problem is created in part because of the broad definition of \nwhat is a class action that is in this legislation. So you could have \nan individual investor who finds himself classified as part of a group, \nalthough he was not part a group. He filed it on his own. He had his \nown lawyer, and he wasn't in collusion with anybody else in doing this. \nOr you could have 50 identified investors--say, school districts, or \nwater and sewer districts--that get defrauded. If there are more than \n50, they can be lifted out of the State court and put into the Federal \ncourt. When they went into the State court, they met the statute of \nlimitations. But when they get lifted out of the State court and put in \nthe Federal court, they then have to comply with this shorter statute \nof limitations, and they find themselves dismissed for failure to meet \nthe shorter time requirement.\n  Mr. BRYAN. So the perpetrator of the fraud, if I understand what the \nSenator from Maryland is saying, has the ability to wipe out the small \ninvestor by removing the cause of action to the Federal court, even \nthough that case was filed timely under State law and even though the \nsmall investor says, Look, I want to have this action continued at the \nState level. So the Senator is saying, if I understand the Senator from \nMaryland correctly, that the power to wipe out this cause of action, to \nwipe out any possibility for relief, are now providing that to the \nperpetrator of the fraud?\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is correct.\n  Mr. BRYAN. The perpetrator of the fraud is allowed to do that under \nthis?\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is right. What this amendment does, very simply, \nis it provides that when the investors are removed from the State court \nto the Federal court, they can bring their State statute of limitations \nwith them. If they filed in the State court, and\n\n[[Page S4805]]\n\nthey complied with the statute of limitations, they ought not to find \nthemselves taken into Federal court and then being told they do not \ncomply with the shorter statute of limitations and they are out of the \ncourthouse when they, in fact, complied at the State level with the \nState statute of limitations.\n\n  This is to deal with this unfairness whereby an investor can file a \ntimely suit under State rules and without advance warning later be \ndismissed under a different set of rules. Anyone who wished to bring \nthe suit in the Federal court would have to abide by the 1- and 3-year \nlimitation of Lampf. But this is clearly unfair to an investor who is \nacting in a reasonable manner.\n  This amendment is supported by a broad coalition of government \nofficials and consumer groups. The National League of Cities, the \nNational Association of Counties, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and \nothers have written to express their support for an amendment to allow \nplaintiffs to carry State statute of limitations with them in cases \nfiled in State court which are removed to Federal court. The Consumer \nFederation of America has joined as well.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. It is an effort to \ndeal with what, I think, is a very specific and definable flaw in this \nlegislation. I don't think investors going into a State court, timely \nunder State law--and I refer back to the comments of Chairman Breeden \nand others about the complexities of these cases, the difficulty of \ndiscovering the fraud, the difficulty of bringing the suit once the \nfraud is discovered--that they then ought to find themselves foreclosed \naltogether from any equitable relief simply by removal to the Federal \ncourt and the application of the shorter statute of limitations.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The \npurpose of this amendment is, obviously, to thwart the underlying \nrationale for the legislation.\n  My colleagues have already pointed out that there are 50 \njurisdictions with different statutes of limitations in them. My \ncolleague from Nevada has worked long and hard on the issue of trying \nto extend the statute of limitations at the Federal level, which is an \neffort that I applaud and support. After the Lampf decision, I thought \nit is worthwhile. I don't disagree with him on that. I disagree with my \ncolleague from Maryland. That is not the issue.\n  The issue, of course, is not whether or not there is a statute of \nlimitations at the Federal level but whether or not you are going to \nallow 50 different individuals to apply State statute of limitations on \nnationally traded securities accounts on national markets. The purpose \nof this bill is a uniform standard for which nationally traded \nsecurities are traded on national markets.\n  If you are going to allow 50 different jurisdictions to apply 50 \ndifferent statutes of limitations, you have just destroyed the very \npurpose of the legislation. Vote against the bill if you want. But you \ncan't very well vote for this amendment and then vote for the bill. It \ndoesn't make any sense at all.\n  Of course, this idea that this has been a great disadvantage, let me \nshare some hard facts with my colleagues about what has happened, \nbecause in order to make this amendment a Federal limit, you have to \nhave information backing it, supporting it, underlying it, which \nindicates there is a problem here.\n  The evidence since 1991, when the Lampf decision was rendered, \nclearly refutes the contention that State courts are necessarily a \nsafety net for meritorious claims. The evidence of that would lead one \nto the opposite conclusion. The statute of limitations was shortened, \nas my colleague from Nevada and the Senator from Maryland pointed out, \nby a Supreme Court decision in 1991. That was 4 years, between 1991 and \n1995, before we passed the 1995 litigation reform bill.\n  So it is kind of an interesting 4 years to look at. You have the \nLampf decision in 1991. We passed in 1995 the litigation reform bill. \nWhat happened between 1991 and 1995? There is almost no evidence, none, \nthat plaintiffs brought securities fraud cases in class actions against \nnationally traded securities in State courts during 1991 and 1995--no \nevidence of it at all. That would be the time you might do it because \nthere the law said, of course, you could go into State courts and use \nthe State statute of limitations. If you want to take advantage of it, \nthat period of time would certainly be an indication of what was going \non.\n  There is evidence that many of the suits brought in State courts \nsince the 1995 act are well within the 1 to 3 years. Again, let me \nemphasize that I don't have any difficulty with the notion of having a \nlonger period. I agree with my colleague on that.\n  But he knows and I know we have been through that. We haven't been \nsuccessful in extending it. Now, maybe someday we can. Maybe we can \nconvince others. But that is a different debate--an important debate \nbut a different debate. The debate here raised by this amendment is, do \nwe allow the 50 different jurisdictions, 33 States which do better, 17 \nwhich do worse--by the way, in 17 States you would be disadvantaged \nbetween what the Federal law provides and what the State courts do. So \nyou get a mixed bag on this.\n  But since 1995, most of the actions that have been brought in the \nstatute of limitations were brought well within the 1 year of the \ndiscovery or 3 years of when the fraud was committed, which is what the \nLampf decision allowed and provided for. In fact, it is worthwhile to \nnote that in some of these cases the suggestion somehow that the \nstatute of limitations is a problem is ludicrous on its face. Three \nsuits were filed against Intel Corporation within 48 hours of an \nadverse earnings announcement--48 hours; three lawsuits were filed \nwithin 48 hours. One in 3 years. It is ridiculous; these lawsuits are \nbeing filed almost momentarily in many cases.\n  We have a second case of the EMC corporation. A case was filed within \n20 hours of an adverse announcement. The notion somehow that this a \ngreat effort to discover fraud in these cases--the notion somehow that \nthose of us in support of this bill in any way want to discourage \ninvestors from bringing legitimate lawsuits as plaintiffs is totally \nwrong.\n  And part of what we rest our case on, Mr. President--let me share \nwith my colleagues what you could find on your Internet this morning, \nnot a year ago or 5 years ago or 6 months ago. It is entitled ``Stock \nDisasters.'' ``Stock Disasters'' it is called. That might suggest we \nhave had some real fraud going on--``Stock Disasters.'' You hit on your \nlittle mouse here, and you hit on ``Top Stock Losers of the Day.'' \nBoom, this page pops up. You have to get this one, and then you get \nthis one.\n  What does it show you? It lists stock fluctuations, stocks that lost \nmoney, stocks that gained money. That is all.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Let me ask the Senator, does the underlying legislation \nin any way limit the Securities and Exchange Commission from bringing \nany action to recover for disgorgement where there is fraud?\n  Mr. DODD. None whatsoever.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. There is no statute of limitations?\n  Mr. DODD. Absolutely none.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. So the SEC can bring these actions but the strike \nlawyers can't wait indefinitely and pick a forum. That is what the \nSenator is saying. But certainly the SEC can still bring these actions \nat any time that it discovers fraud.\n  Mr. DODD. My colleague from New York is absolutely correct. The point \nwe have been trying to make here is that if you go here --and ``Stock \nDisasters'' is the title of this, Mr. President--and then you switch on \n``Stock Disasters''--and the stocks decline in a couple cases, some \nstocks going up--there is no allegation here of fraud or mismanagement, \nmerely stock fluctuations.\n  Stock disasters? That is not a disaster. It is 10:52 this morning. \nThat is how these suits are filed. It is ludicrous to somehow suggest \nwe are talking about deep fraud in these cases. All we are trying to do \nis slow this down so that legitimate plaintiffs can bring lawsuits, and \nalso legitimate investors particularly--and a lot of these companies, \nby the way, I point out, Mr. President, a lot of these companies, if \nyou look at the losers as of 10:52 this morning, are your small high-\ntech firms.\n\n[[Page S4806]]\n\nThat is the future of our economy, by the way. That is the knowledge-\nbased economy of our country for the 21st century. Let some predator \nlaw firm go out there because they get a slight stock fluctuation and \nbring a lawsuit against them, having to spend millions of dollars to \ndefend the company, you lose the company. Who benefits from that? I \ntell you who does. The law firm. That is who does. That is all this is \nabout, the bottom line. That is all this is about.\n\n  So we talk here about the statute of limitations. Again, I am all for \nextending it. I think there is a case to be made on that. But to say \nhere with nationally traded securities on national markets, these \nexchanges, that you are going to have to go through 50 different \njurisdictions is to defeat the very purpose of what we are trying to do \nhere. And that is, with nationally traded securities and national \nexchanges, we ought to have a uniform standard. I would have it be a \nbit longer, but that is not the issue before us. What is before us is \nwhether or not we are going to have one standard here so that we can \ntry to have some predictability and a little fairness in this process.\n  Certainly what we have seen, of course, is a rush to the courthouse, \nand that is why I think this amendment is unnecessary. And if its \nadoption were to occur, it would destroy the very purpose which has \nbrought us here at this point in our debate.\n  For those reasons, Mr. President, I urge rejection of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment to \npreserve the state statute of limitations for cases removed to Federal \ncourt under this legislation.\n\n  I intend to vote for this bill. But in doing so, I think it important \nto be straightforward about what S. 1260 does. This is a bill that \npreempts state law. Specifically, it preempts securities antifraud \nstatutes for certain types of class action cases.\n  I generally oppose preemption, as I think it overlooks the \nconsiderable wisdom that exists at the local level. Not without some \nmeasure of discomfort, I am nonetheless inclined to vote for this bill, \nbecause I find considerable merit to the contention that large class-\naction cases against companies whose securities are sold in the \nnational marketplace may well belong in the Federal courts. Otherwise, \nCongress' ability to regulate our national securities markets in an era \nof international investing is arguably impeded.\n  I feel strongly, however, that if we are going to preempt state law \nand impose a single federal standard, it must be a fair one, and that \nis not the case with the federal statute of limitations. Under federal \nlaw, a securities fraud suit must be brought within one year of when \nthe fraud was or should have been discovered, but in no instance after \nmore than three years have elapsed.\n  I served for five years as the head of the Maine department that \nregulates financial institutions, and I can tell you from personal \nexperience that a three-year limitations period is too short. The \nreality is that, even with due diligence, some frauds are not \ndiscovered within that time frame. Indeed, the very object of a fraud \nis to deceive the other party to the transaction for as long as \npossible.\n  The limited partnership cases of the last decade illustrate my point. \nThe victims of those frauds were largely elderly, largely trusting, and \nlargely lacking in financial sophistication. It is no wonder that in \nmany of those instances, they did not, and even within reasonable care, \ncould not have, discovered the fraud within three years of its \ncommission.\n  It is not just my opinion that the Federal limitations period is \ninadequate. The Securities and Exchange Commission has taken the \nposition that the period is too short.\n  This is an instance in which the Maine Legislature has shown more \nwisdom than the Federal Government. Under the law of my state, the \nlimitation period is two years from the date the fraud was, or with \nreasonable care, should have been discovered, with no outside limit. \nThat gives innocent investors the opportunity to obtain redress for \nfraud as long as they act with reasonable diligence.\n  I can understand the argument for a single, Federal standard in this \narea, but I cannot accept preempting a state standard that is far more \nconsistent with reality. While the best remedy would be to change the \nFederal limitations period for all securities fraud cases, that issue \nis not before us today. Thus, we should take the next best step, which \nis to preserve the state statutes for cases that are removed to Federal \ncourt under this legislation.\n  What this amendment will not do is harm high-tech companies. What it \nwill do--maybe not this year or next, but at some point--is to protect \ninnocent, unsuspecting investors, who are victimized by a securities \nscam that could not reasonably have been discovered within three years. \nThus, I urge my colleagues not to wait until we have such victims, but \nto stop the problem before it occurs by supporting this amendment.\n  I thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Maine for her, I \nthink, most illuminating statement in terms of the problem that we face \nwith the shorter statute of limitations. She is absolutely correct. Her \nState--and my own--apparently, if I understood the distinguished \nSenator, has a 1- and 5-year statute; 5 years is the outside. That is \nwhat we have in Nevada as well.\n  The testimony beyond refutation is that a 3-year statute is simply \ntoo short. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which has all of the \nresources available to the Federal Government, much more so than any \nindividual investor, tells us that on average it takes more than 3 \nyears to do the investigation, to bring the cause of action. Certainly \nthe small investor is seriously disadvantaged here, so I thank her for \nher comment and her leadership.\n  Let me just make a couple of comments. I know we have talked about \nthis in the context of the debate on the bill, but the unfairness of \nthis legislation to the small consumer can best be described: Heads the \nperpetrator of the fraud wins; tails the small investor loses. This is \na ``no win'' proposition for the small investor.\n  The thrust of this legislation is to say that the traditional class \naction lawsuit should no longer be available at the State court level. \nAnd, by ``traditional class actions'' we mean individual plaintiffs who \nare bound together by a common lawyer who files on behalf of a lot of \npeople who have been victimized by the identical fraud. That is really \nwhat a class action traditionally has been.\n  Our friends on the other side say there have been some abuses. I \nacknowledge that there may have been some abuses there. I would be \nwilling to work with them in dealing with the abuses. But here is the \ningenious and unfair part of this. The proponents say, ``The individual \nhas a right to file an action at the State court level, would have all \nthe rights currently available under State law--the longer statute of \nlimitations, the accomplice liability, the joint and several, the RICO \nprovisions.'' OK, that sounds somewhat fair, although as we have \npointed out, most small investors simply don't have the resources to \nbring such a case. But let's suppose that your teachers' pension fund, \nor what we have in Nevada, the public employee retirement system--\nsuppose they bring an action at the State level: One plaintiff, one \nlawyer, and, lo and behold, they have discovered 4 years after the fact \nof fraud that the public employee retirement system fund has been \nripped off by a monstrous fraud. They file suit in State court.\n  Surely you would think it would be possible for that one plaintiff to \npursue a remedy under State law. But here is how the bill is crafted. \nWithout the permission or consent of that public employee retirement \nsystem, if there are 49 other plaintiffs who file against the \nperpetrator of the fraud, then involuntarily, without the permission of \nthe public employee retirement system, they can be forcibly removed \nfrom the State court and those rights that exist under State law are \neffectively divested from them. So in the hypothetical that I cite, a \nmonstrous fraud,\n\n[[Page S4807]]\n\nwhich may have cost the public employee retirement system literally \nmillions and millions of dollars, discovered sometime after 3 years for \nthe first time and filed timely under the law--it would be possible for \nthe perpetrator of the fraud to actually get other plaintiffs to file \nto build up a number of 50, thereby removing the case from State \njurisdiction. And once it gets to the Federal court, lo and behold, \nwhat happens: the hammer falls because at the Federal level, because of \nthe Lampf decision, the statute of limitations is 3 years, the outside \nbar.\n\n  So here you can have literally tens of thousands of public employees \nor teacher retirement funds or an Orange County type of investment in \nwhich you may have a million or more taxpayers who are unable to \nrecover simply because the perpetrator of the fraud is allowed to \nremove the single case from State court jurisdiction. What is the \nfairness of that?\n  The able and distinguished chairman of the committee says the SEC can \nbring the action. That is true. But we have been told on many, many \noccasions that the SEC simply does not have the resources; that both \nthe current chairman and previous chairman, in the time I served with \nthe distinguished chairman of the committee and my colleague and good \nfriend from Connecticut, have repeatedly told us that the SEC simply \ndoes not have the resources to pursue all of the fraud out there, and \ntherefore the private cause of action is an absolutely essential and \ncritical part of the regulatory structure, the structure that has \ncreated the safest and most efficient market in the world.\n  Why are we making these changes? Because we are told that we must \nworship at the shrine of uniformity, that there is a rush to the \ncourthouse door; 44 cases out of 15 million is a rush to the courthouse \ndoor? Many, many States have had no cause of action filed at all, at \nall. I think in my own State of Nevada there has been one. A rush? I \nmust say, I do not think that makes the argument.\n  If uniformity is an end to itself, isn't it a fairly persuasive \nargument to say 49 of the 50 States have laws that hold aiders and \nabettors liable? These are the accomplices, these are the lawyers, the \naccountants, the investment advisers who participated with the primary \nindividual involved in the fraud to create the loss to the innocent \ninvestor--49 out of 50 States say those people ought to be liable, too. \nThey are not, under the 1995 legislation. So if uniformity is to be the \nstandard by which this debate is to be judged, what is wrong with that \nuniformity?\n  What we have here, and I regret to say this, it is a systematic \nattempt to close the courtroom door to innocent investors, small \ninvestors in this particular instance that we are debating here. We are \ntalking about an institutional investor who could be taken \ninvoluntarily to the Federal court. I don't understand the public \npolicy argument that says that is somehow meritorious. I concede that \nmaybe you could argue preemption if you develop a broader statute of \nlimitations at the Federal level to protect them. Maybe that is a \npossibility. Maybe we could reach a compromise there. Then maybe you \ncould argue preemption.\n  But the proponents of this measure--with due respect to my colleague \nfrom Connecticut, he does support a longer statute of limitation--but \nthe primary thrust of getting this legislation, the folks who have \nopposed and resist this, have resisted the longer statute of \nlimitations. So, in effect, we take two weapons away from the small \ninvestor: The right at the Federal level to a longer statute of \nlimitations--Lampf took that weapon away from the small investor--and \nnow we are going to go one step further and take it away from that \nsmall investor who is filing at the State level, not as part of a class \naction but as an individual. And I must say I think the unfairness of \nthat is --all of this is being done in the name of, whether it is 39 \ncases or 44 cases out of 15 million, filed annually.\n  I come from a part of the country where we understand what ``rush'' \nis. The gold rush. There was an exodus of people coming out West. But \n44 people? I wouldn't call that a gold rush. That would be a trickle.\n  So I must say, this is a terribly, terribly important investor \nprotection. My colleague from Maryland and I, we know how to count the \nvotes. We know this legislation is going to pass. But even if you are \nfor this legislation, please, please, I implore you to consider what \nyou do to the small investor who is filing in State court. He or she \ngets involuntarily wiped out by the perpetrator of fraud by removing \nthat case to the Federal court system where the shorter statute of \nlimitations prevails.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I understand that the leadership doesn't \nintend to have votes much beyond 6 o'clock or thereabouts, and I \nsuggest to my colleague that we set aside this amendment and do the \nnext amendment, which I will send to the desk, which actually is \ninterrelated in concept with this amendment, and that we have a vote on \nthe two amendments beginning about 5:40.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, we cannot confirm that it is the \nintention of the leadership on both sides to curtail votes as of any \nspecific time. However, it would seem to me to be appropriate, \nnotwithstanding that, to move to support the Senator's request that we \nstack the two amendments with a vote starting at 5:40 for the first \none, and thereafter undertake a vote on the second one. Then, of \ncourse, if the leadership has decided no further votes, we can put that \nmatter over.\n  We are looking to shop that right now. I believe that will be the \ncase, but we are waiting for final confirmation. If the Senator wishes \nto make his request on the basis that we will proceed to our first vote \nat 5:40 on the pending amendment and that thereafter, immediately after \nthat vote, take up the second amendment and seek a vote on that, I will \ncertainly join in that request.\n  Mr. SARBANES. For ordering votes, we should not have any second \ndegree.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Just to sketch it out, it was my assumption then in the \nmorning we will have one other amendment to offer. We will do that \namendment and then final passage is my expectation.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That is my expectation, and I will make that \nrecommendation to the leader. Subject to the concurrence of the \nleaders, I imagine we then will have debate, hopefully limited to, \nlet's say, an hour equally divided on the third amendment, and then go \nto final passage. How much time does the Senator want in between the \nthird vote and final passage?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Of course, we have used up all the debate time. What \nshould we have, 10 minutes on each side before final passage, or 30 \nminutes equally divided before final passage?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. We can work that out and make that request later, but I \ncertainly will not be opposed to 30 minutes equally divided before \nfinal passage.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \ncurrent amendment, and I will send an amendment to the desk, and that \nno second-degree amendments be in order to either, and that the vote \nbegin on the amendment to be set aside at 5:40, to be followed by a \nvote on the amendment which will be sent to the desk.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, before that amendment is set aside, I ask \nfor the yeas and nays and indicate that I will move to table at the \nappropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Is there a sufficient second on \nthe request for the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I withdraw the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's request is withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2396\n\n(Purpose: To make amendments with respect to the definition of a class \n                    action, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the pending \namendment is set aside.\n\n[[Page S4808]]\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. I apologize to the Chair. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe pending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Sarbanes], for himself, Mr. \n     Bryan and Mr. Johnson, proposes an amendment numbered 2396.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES.

Mr. President, this amendment interrelates with the \nother amendment that has been set aside on which a vote will occur \nlater.\n  The sponsors of this bill say their goal is to wipe out frivolous \nclass-action lawsuits alleging securities fraud. What are class-action \nlawsuits? They are lawsuits brought by a single person, not just on his \nown behalf, but on behalf of other persons similarly situated. In other \nwords, one person can bring a lawsuit on behalf of an anonymous and \npotentially enormous group of people.\n  Why do we allow someone to bring such a lawsuit? Because in many \nsituations, it is the only economical way people can pursue remedies. \nIf a large number of people have each suffered a relatively small loss, \nit may not be economical for any one of them to pay the costs of a \nlawsuit. There are many examples of class-action suits by investors who \nhave been defrauded. It is a tool that allows individuals to share the \ncost of a lawsuit when they are injured.\n  Because they can be brought on behalf of a potentially enormous \nclass, on occasion they can be misused to coerce defendants into \nsettlement. This is the abuse about which the sponsors of the \nlegislation complain. They argue that companies are coerced by flimsy \nsecurities fraud class-action suits, that it is cheaper for the company \nto settle rather than to fight them, and that these class actions are \nbeing misused.\n  I share the view that frivolous securities fraud class-action suits \nshould not be tolerated, either in Federal court or in State court, and \nlawyers who file worthless suits hoping to extort a settlement should \nnot be able to pursue that practice. But this bill reaches beyond the \nfrivolous class action.\n  Here is the problem. The definition of class action in this bill is \ntoo broad.\n  It will prevent investors from bringing individual actions solely on \ntheir own behalf in State court. Since they were enacted over 60 years \nago, the Federal securities laws have preserved the right of individual \ninvestors to bring securities fraud suits under State law. This system \nhas worked well. State remedies offer important protections to \ninvestors where Federal remedies fall short.\n  But the definition that is contained in this bill for ``class \naction'' is too broad. The bill has a three-pronged definition of \n``class action.'' And these prongs permit individual investors to be \nbrought into Federal court against their will. The bill includes, as a \nclass action, any group of lawsuits in which damages are sought on \nbehalf of more than 50 persons, even if the suits are brought by \nseparate lawyers without coordination.\n  So to tie it into the previous amendment, what happens is an investor \ngoes into State court, in a timely fashion, he files an individual \nsuit, and if 50 others do the same thing, they can be removed to \nFederal court as, quote, a ``class action,'' although it is not a class \naction as a class action is ordinarily considered or ordinarily \ndefined. They lift them out of the State court and put them into the \nFederal court, and they are shut out because of the statute of \nlimitations.\n  Individual investors ought not to have to lose their remedies under \nState law in order to deal with the problem of frivolous class actions. \nAnd so the amendment that is offered narrows the bill's definition of \n``class action'' to a suit brought on behalf of unnamed parties \nsimilarly situated. We do not use this ``50 investor'' definition which \nmeans unwary people are going to be trapped and lose their remedy.\n  Now a broad coalition of State and local government associations have \nwritten to us supporting this amendment--the National Association of \nState Retirement Administrators as well. Here is what they have to say \nabout the definition of ``class action'' in the bill.\n\n       The definition of ``class action'' contained in S. 1260 is \n     overly broad. The definition of ``class action'' in S. 1260 \n     would allow single suits filed in the same or different \n     courts to be rolled into a larger class action that was never \n     contemplated or desired by individual plaintiffs and have it \n     removed to Federal court. Claims by the bill's proponents \n     that individual plaintiffs would still be able to bring suit \n     in Federal court are belied by this provision.\n\n  If we can narrow the definition of ``class action'' to a proper class \naction, and then that is taken into Federal court, then the statute of \nlimitations will apply, if that prevails.\n  On the other hand, if you are going to have a definition of ``class \naction'' that is so broad that individual investors can be covered, \nthey ought not be subjected to the risk of losing their suit altogether \nbecause it is removed in a Federal court and they are bound by a \nstatute of limitations that they had no idea was going to come into \nplay in their instance.\n  So, Mr. President, I very strongly urge this amendment. I think it \ncorrects a very important weakness in this legislation. We can narrow \nthe definition of who is covered by the class action so we no longer \nhave to worry about the individual investor being shut out unfairly. I \nthink we ought to significantly improve this legislation and narrow it \nso it applies to what it is asserted it is meant to apply to, and does \nnot apply to individual investors who I think need to have their \nremedies preserved in the State courts.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let me tell you basically what this \namendment would do. This amendment would have the unintended effect--\nand I cannot believe that my colleague would want for that to happen--\nof opening up the whole question of the class-action suits being able \nto be moved to State courts. It would effectively allow lawyers to \ncircumvent the purpose, the very purpose of this bill since so-called \n``huge'' mass actions could still be brought in the State court.\n\n  So what we have is the problem of high-growth companies, small high-\ngrowth companies that traditional class actions may be brought against \nby the strike lawyers; namely, they are expensive and timely to defend, \nand the plaintiffs are often forced to settle, regardless of the \nmerits, to avoid excessive litigation costs. That is exactly what we \nare trying to deal with. There should be a uniform standard, and there \nshould be a uniform procedure. And that is why we moved these \nnationally traded securities.\n  Senator Dodd spoke to this, the nationally traded securities going to \na Federal forum. This amendment changes the predominance requirements \nin the bill's class action definition. This effectively would gut the \nbill by encouraging State actions which would not qualify as a class \naction contained in the act. As a result, these\n\n[[Page S4809]]\n\nclass actions would not be able to be removed to the Federal court. And \nso you have mass action lawyers representing a large number of \nplaintiffs on an individual basis in either a single action or a group \naction.\n  The ``class action'' definition in the bill was worked out with the \nSEC. We have worked that out, and it is comprehensive enough to close \nthe loophole. But it also provides State courts with guidance. It says \n``up to 50 people.'' That is the bright line. When you get over 50 \npeople, OK, that is the class action. And so this bill does not prevent \nindividual investors from pursuing State court remedies, nor will it \nprevent a small group of investors from pooling their resources to \npursue a claim under State law, but it will stop the strike action \nsuits, the forum shopping that we have attempted to limit, because we \nhave seen that dramatic increase.\n  I think Senator Dodd, when he pointed out what the record was, I \nthink it was a handful, what, five or six cases in a period of years, \nin all of the years, ballooning up to 40-plus in 1 year. What was that?\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague would yield.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. Our colleagues have made much of this notion that there has \nnot been this great degree of activity. Try, if you will, to just keep \nthese numbers in mind. These are the actions filed in State court for \nfraud in class actions against publicly traded companies.\n  In 1992, there were four cases filed all across the country. In 1993, \nthere was one case filed all across the country. In 1994, there was one \ncase filed all across the country. I do not have numbers for 1995. But \nthey are four, one, and one.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Six cases.\n  Mr. DODD. Then in 1996--we passed a law in 1995--59 cases were filed \nin State court; and in 1997, 1998, the number did drop down to about \n38. But you compare that--they want to talk about how the number fell \noff to 38 from 59. What they do not want to mention to you is, in 1994 \nand 1993 and 1992 you had a total of six cases; in 1993 and 1994, one \ncase--one case. And then it jumps, as we see in these other examples of \nwhere it moves to.\n  So I say to my colleague and the chairman of the committee, this is \nquite clear. And if they wanted to get to statute of limitations \nproblems, why didn't they file more of those cases in that period?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I think my colleague, by answering the \nquestion, points out quite clearly--it was my impression heretofore \nthat he had mentioned a number of cases, but six cases in 3 years, \njumping to 10 times that, 59--slightly less than 10 times that in 1 \nyear--in 1 year--I think it proves the point. And that is why the \nnecessity of seeing to it that we have a uniform standard, that you \ncannot go forum shopping. And that is why this Senator, at the \nappropriate time, will move to table the pending amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this is a very complicated area of law. I \nknow our colleagues are going to come to the floor and want to know \nwhat this is all about.\n  In effect, this amendment would have the impact of creating even \nfurther uncertainty in the definition of a class action. It does not \nprovide more certainty; it is less certainty. I think it would upset \nthe very carefully crafted and very balanced definition worked out with \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  The reason it took us a little time to get this bill to our \ncolleagues was because we took so much time working with the SEC to try \nand define these areas. What our colleagues are offering is an \namendment that would disrupt the definition worked out with the SEC in \nthis area.\n  Clearly, with all due respect, the tremendous amount of expertise in \ncrafting it--I am not going to suggest to my colleagues that we have a \nperfect definition in the bill. But certainly this one is not perfect \neither. But if you are going to trust one or the other, it seems to me \nthe one worked out with the Securities and Exchange Commission, I urge \nmy colleagues, makes a lot more sense.\n  Neither of these definitions tracks word for word what is in rule 23. \nRule 23--trust me when I tell you this rule 23 goes on for pages, \npages. It is one of the more lengthy definitions of class actions that \nthere is. So, we are not tracking that word for word. We are trying to \npick up the essence of it. It is tremendously complicated.\n  We think this definition we have worked out with the Securities and \nExchange Commission provides the right kind of balance.\n  The bill originally had a limit of 25 plaintiffs, now raised to 50 \nfor a single lawsuit. This is by no means an exact science. I am the \nfirst to say that if we find shortly that number is not working as well \nas we would like, we would change it. Anybody who claims they have a \nword on high as to what is the perfect number here is deluding \nthemselves. It is a number we chose because we thought it made sense \nbased, again, on our discussions with the SEC.\n  With all due respect to the authors of this amendment, it does \nundercut what we have tried to achieve here. I want to emphasize to our \ncolleagues, you don't have to agree with every agency and what it \nsuggests and does. But on this definition worked out with the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, if you want some predictability and \nsome knowledge-based definition, the one we have in the bill is the way \nto go. To come up all of a sudden with a new one here that I don't \nthink enjoys the kind of expertise that we have been able to achieve \nthrough working with the SEC would be unfortunate and could create a \nlot more problems.\n  For those reasons, I urge the defeat of this amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I opposed the 1995 Securities Litigation \nAct for several reasons--including the precedent-setting changes to \nthis country's judicial system without the input of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  I support the Sarbanes amendment for similar reasons--relating both \nto procedure, and to substance.\n  In the past, bills that made changes to the rules that govern \ncitizen's access to State courts were referred to the Judiciary \nCommittee, to enable the committee with expertise to review and work on \nthe legislation.\n  While my colleagues on the Banking Committee had the opportunity to \nexamine the specific, substantive changes this bill would make to our \nNation's securities laws, it seems to me that we have once again \nskipped a very important step in the process.\n  The securities litigation bill we are considering on the floor today \npre-empts State court statutes of limitations in securities fraud \ncases--and yet again the Judiciary Committee was not given the \nopportunity to examine the issue.\n  In 1991, the Supreme Court significantly shortened the statute of \nlimitations for Federal securities fraud actions--to the shorter of 3 \nyears after the fraud occurs or 1 year after it is discovered.\n  Then-SEC Chairman Richard Breeden called the new time limit \n``unrealistically short.'' But, S. 1260 would compound the problem by \napplying the Federal time limit to State actions removed to Federal \ncourt--even though it is shorter than the time limit applicable to \nactions in 33 of the 50 States.\n  This bill would not only leave investors without State court remedies \nwhen brokers and dealers make fraudulent statements when selling \ncorporate stock--but it would also tell them that they need only \nconceal their fraud for 3 years before being absolved of responsibility \nin Federal court as well.\n  And the new time limit will apply even though the 1995 Securities \nLitigation Act raised the standard investors must meet to win a class \naction suit--you now have to prove a falsehood was made with clear \nintent to deceive.\n  That's incredibly tough to prove.\n  I will admit, some frivolous lawsuits are filed. And some lawyers do \nmake too much from a suit--leaving defrauded investors too little.\n  But, immunizing Wall Street professionals who can successfully hide \ntheir lies for 3 years is not the answer.\n  I support the Sarbanes amendment and urge my colleagues to do the \nsame. We should protect the small investor--not let white collar \ncriminals go unpunished.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I know my colleague from Nevada is going \nto speak to this issue, and I ask unanimous consent at 5:30 today the \nSenate proceed to a vote on or in relation to the Sarbanes amendment \n2395, to be\n\n[[Page S4810]]\n\nimmediately followed by a vote on or in relation to amendment 2396, the \nmatter we are now considering, with no amendments in order to the \namendments. I finally ask that the time until 5:30 be equally divided \nbetween the proponents and opponents. I have no intention of using any \nof the time, but that all the time be yielded to my colleague.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Reserving the right to object, and I do not object, \nsubsequent to that, then, I take it what the leadership would like to \ndo is try to finish, so we will offer a third amendment and debate \nthat. We hope the time will not be too long on that. Then we would be \nable to vote on that amendment and then on final passage.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from New York?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I don't want to prolong this debate unnecessarily. I \nrealize several of my colleagues have time constraints.\n  Let me say I think the Senator from Maryland has crafted an amendment \nthat is eminently fair. He is using the definition of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure. The notion that we get involved in describing what \nis a class action based upon an arbitrary number of individual \nplaintiffs--some of whom could be private citizens, some could be \npension funds, and could be State agencies--makes no sense to me.\n  So I believe, in trying to provide some sense of balance and \nfairness--so we do not get a situation where we have discussed \nthroughout a good part of the afternoon that an individual who files an \naction by himself or herself with his or her lawyer alone, no other \ncoplaintiffs involved, immediately after the discovery of a fraud, that \nwould be 3 to 3 years and 2 months after the fraud occurred--should be \nallowed to pursue that cause of action and not be involuntarily sucked \nup into Federal court because 49 other people may have filed similar \naction, and to give to the errant defendant, the perpetrator of the \nfraud, the ability to manipulate the process so that the perpetrator of \nthe fraud can file some phony plaintiff's actions, getting up to the \nthreshold of 50, and then have the case removed, the individual \nplaintiff, the individual pension fund, the individual retirement fund, \nthen having been effectively deprived of pursuing a cause of action \nthat may be meritorious without question.\n  I certainly urge my colleagues to thoughtfully reflect. This is the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure. They have been around since 1939. Why \nshould we craft some kind of a special rule as to what constitutes a \nclass action, the effect of which deprives individuals--not people \nfiling on behalf of a similarly situated class, but individuals--their \nopportunity to recover on a fraud perpetrated upon them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Very briefly, the essence of this comes down to this, \nbecause this is very complicated.\n  How does this work? It is a State court judge that has to make this \ndetermination as to whether or not these individual suits get \nconsolidated. It is not a Federal judge; it is a State court judge. \nObviously, a State court judge has broad discretion in making that \ndetermination. Even if he does do that, if an individual feels he does \nnot belong in that grouping--obviously, we are trying to avoid a case \nwhere there are 50 or more individual actions that effectively operate \nas a single action, which would thus gut the bill and the uniform way \nin which we are attempting to deal with litigation issues.\n  As I said, the decision to consolidate these individual actions must \nbe with a State court judge, and then if the individual feels as though \nthey really don't belong in that case, the State court judge has broad \ndiscretion to take that individual out.\n  There are a lot of protections here. This is not heavy handed at all. \nIt is a way to try and avoid exactly creating new loopholes where \nplaintiffs seek to consolidate individual cases and thus evade the \nprovisions of this legislation.\n  But that decision is the State court judges' decision and to their \nbroad discretion. And secondly, the individual has the opportunity to \ngo to that State court judge and make the case that they don't really \nbelong in that class action. That State court judge has the broad \ndiscretion of keeping that person out of that class.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I don't know if it is appropriate at this \ntime, if all time is yielded back, and I know at 5:30 we will vote.\n\n\n              Vote on Amendment No. 2395--Motion to Table\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, if it is appropriate now, I move to table \nthe Sarbanes amendment and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Bryan, Senator Johnson, and Senator Biden. I will be \nvery quick, because the manager has indicated he will accept this \namendment.\n  This amendment preserves the right of State and local governments and \ntheir pension plans to bring securities fraud suits under State law. \nThey have never been professional plaintiffs. They have never abused \nthe system. They have to go through an elaborate process to even bring \nsuit. They obviously are concerned with protecting the public and the \ntaxpayers, and it seems to me a reasonable exemption from the \nprovisions of this bill as it applies to these governmental units.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, we have no objection. As the Senator has \nindicated, these classes are comprised solely of States, counties, and \nother public entities. There is no record of such class-action suits \nbeing brought. I might add, local governments, for the most part, \nschool districts in particular, are typically precluded from investing \nin stocks, particularly in these stocks. We accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2397) was agreed to.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am aware of no further amendments, but \nI ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Oklahoma be recognized \nfor the purpose of propounding a unanimous-consent request, and that \nthe Senator from California--I think I have 2\\1/2\\ minutes left. I \nyield 1 minute to the Senator from California.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield? I believe a unanimous-consent \nagreement had room for me to offer an amendment at sometime, and I \nintend on doing that, although I will not ask for a rollcall vote. I \nwill be a very good boy if you listen for 5 minutes, and then I will \nwithdraw the amendment.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I have no objection. I ask that the Senator be \nrecognized to offer an amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2398\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the bill with respect to title 18, United States \n                                 Code)\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n  The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden] proposes an amendment numbered \n2398.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . FRAUD AS PREDICATE OFFENSE.\n\n       Section 1964(c) of title 18, United States Code, is amended \n     by striking ``, except'' and all that follows through \n     ``final''.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will be necessarily brief because I have \nover the years learned to count, and I do not believe I have the votes \nfor this amendment, but I want to make two relatively brief points.\n  First of all, in 1970, the Congress greatly assisted the fight \nagainst organized crime by adopting the Racketeering Influence and \nCorruption Organizations Act. We know it as RICO.\n  RICO included a private civil enforcement provision with enhanced \npenalties, including triple damages for racketeering behavior in \nfurtherance of a criminal enterprise engaged in certain, what they call \npredicate offenses, including murder, arson, bribery, wire fraud, \nbankruptcy fraud, and securities fraud--securities fraud.\n  At the request of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the \nindustry, though against the wishes of law enforcement and State \nregulators, in 1995, the Securities Litigation Act effectively \neliminated securities fraud as a grounds for private civil RICO \nproceedings. Many of us disagreed with carving out the securities fraud \nfor special status, Mr. President, and protection from application of \nthe civil RICO statute. In fact, my amendment was intended to preserve \nmany civil RICO securities fraud claims and was accepted last time by \nthe full Senate. Unfortunately, it was dropped in committee.\n  Last November, the Federal grand jury in Manhattan indicted 19 \nindividuals, including two reputed mob chieftains known as ``Rossi'' \nand ``Curly,'' for their role in the alleged plot to manipulate a \nthinly traded stock, so-called penny stocks, and for threatening \nbrokers to drive up the prices.\n  There is an article that was published that says ``The Mob on Wall \nStreet.'' I ask unanimous consent that an except from this article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the excerpt was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From Business Week, Dec. 16, 1996]\n\n                         The Mob on Wall Street\n\n                            (By Gary Weiss)\n\n       In the world of multimedia, Phoenix-based SC \n     International Inc. has carved out a small but significant \n     niche. SC's products have won raves in the trade press, but \n     working capital has not always been easy to come by. So in \n     December, 1995, the company brought in Sovereign Equity \n     Management Corp., a Boca Raton (Fla.) brokerage, to manage an \n     initial public offering. ``We thought they were a solid \n     second- or third-tier investment bank,'' says SC Chief \n     Executive James L. Copeland.\n       But there was much about Sovereign that was known to only a \n     very few. There were, for example, the early investors, \n     introduced by Sovereign, who had provided inventory financing \n     for SC Most shared the same post office box in the \n     Bahamas. ``I had absolutely no idea of who those people \n     were,'' says Copeland. He asked Sovereign. ``I was told, `Who \n     gives a s--. It's clean money.' '' The early investors cashed \n     out, at the offering price of $5, some 1,575 million shares \n     that they acquired at about $1.33 share--a gain of some $5.8 \n     million.\n       By mid-June, SC was trading at $8 or better. But for SC \n     shareholders who did not sell by then, the stock was an \n     unmitigated disaster. Sovereign, which had handled over 60% \n     of SC's trades early in the year, sharply reduced its \n     support of the stock. Without the backing of Sovereign and \n     its 75-odd brokers, SC's shares plummeted--to $2 in July, \n     $1 in September, and lately, pennies. The company's capital-\n     raising ability is in tatters. Laments Copeland: ``We're in \n     the crapper.''\n       A routine case of a hot stock that went frigid. Or was it? \n     Copeland didn't know it, but there was a man who kept a very \n     close\n\n[[Page S4812]]\n\n     eye on SC and is alleged by Wall Street sources to have \n     profited handsomely in the IPO--allegedly by being one of the \n     lucky few who sold shares through a Bahamian shell company. \n     His name is Philip Abramo, and he has been identified in \n     court documents as a ranking member, or capo, in the New \n     Jersey-based DeCavalcante organized crime family.\n       James Copeland didn't know it. Nobody at SC could have \n     dreamed it. But the almost unimaginable had come true: \n     Copeland had put his company in the hands of the Mob.\n       Today, the stock market is confronting a vexing problem \n     that, so far, the industry and regulators have seemed \n     reluctant to face--or even acknowledge. Call it what you \n     will: organized crime, the Mafia, wiseguys. They are the \n     stuff of tabloids and gangster movies. To most investors, \n     they would seem to have as much to do with Wall Street as the \n     other side of the moon.\n       But in the canyons of lower Manhattan, one can find members \n     of organized crime, their friends and associates. How large a \n     presence? No one--least of all regulators and law \n     enforcement--seems to know. The Street's ranking reputed \n     underworld chieftain, Abramo, is described by sources \n     familiar with his activities as controlling at least four \n     brokerages through front men and exerting influence upon \n     still more firms. Until recently Abramo had an office in the \n     heart of the financial district, around the corner from the \n     regional office of an organization that might just as well be \n     on Venus as far as the Mob is concerned--the National \n     Association of Securities Dealers, the self-regulatory \n     organization that oversees the small-stock business.\n       A three-month investigation by Business Week reveals that \n     substantial elements of the small-cap market have been turned \n     into a veritable Mob franchise, under the very noses of \n     regulators and law enforcement. And that is a daunting \n     prospect for every investor who buys small-cap stocks and \n     every small company whose stock trades on the NASDAQ market \n     and over the counter. For the Mob makes money in various \n     ways, ranging from exploiting IPOs to extortion to getting a \n     ``piece of the action'' from traders and brokerage firms. But \n     its chief means of livelihood is ripping off investors by the \n     time-tested method of driving share prices upward--and \n     dumping them on the public through aggressive cold-calling.\n       In its inquiry, Business Week reviewed a mountain of \n     documentation and interviewed traders, brokerage executives, \n     investors, regulators, law-enforcement officials, and \n     prosecutors. It also interviewed present and former \n     associates of the Wall Street Mob contingent. Virtually all \n     spoke on condition of anonymity, with several Street sources \n     fearing severe physical harm--even death--if their identities \n     became known. One, a former broker at a Mob-run brokerage, \n     says he discussed entering the federal Witness Protection \n     Program after hearing that his life might be in danger. A \n     short-seller in the Southwest, alarmed by threats, carries a \n     gun.\n       Among Business Week's findings:\n       The Mob has established a network of stock promoters, \n     securities dealers, and the all-important ``boiler rooms''--a \n     crucial part of Mob manipulation schemes--that sell stocks \n     nationwide through hard-sell cold-calling. The brokerages are \n     located mainly in the New York area and in Florida, with the \n     heart of their operations in the vicinity of lower Broad \n     Street in downtown Manhattan.\n       Four organized crime families as well as elements of the \n     Russian Mob directly own or control, through front men, \n     perhaps two dozen brokerage firms that make markets in \n     hundreds of stocks. Other securities dealers and traders are \n     believed to pay extortion money or ``tribute'' to the Mob as \n     just another cost of doing business on the Street.\n       Traders and brokers have been subjected in recent months to \n     increasing levels of violent ``persuasion'' and punishment--\n     threats and beatings. Among the firms that have been subject \n     to Mob intimidation, sources say, is the premier market maker \n     in NASDAQ stocks--Herzog, Heine, Gedule Inc.\n       Using offshore accounts in the Bahamas and elsewhere, the \n     Mob has engineered lucrative schemes involving low-priced \n     stock under Regulations S of the securities laws. Organized \n     crime members profit from the runup in such stocks and also \n     from short-selling the stocks on the way down. They also take \n     advantage of the very wide spreads between the bid and ask \n     prices of the stock issues controlled by their confederates.\n       The Mob's activities seem confined almost exclusively to \n     stocks traded in the over-the-counter ``bulletin board'' and \n     NASDAQ small-cap markets. By contrast, New York Stock \n     Exchange and American Stock Exchange issues and firms \n     apparently have been free of Mob exploitation.\n       Wall Street has become as lucrative for the Mob that it is \n     allegedly a major source of income for high-level members of \n     organized crime--few of whom have ever been publicly \n     identified as having ties to the Street. Abramo, who may well \n     be the most active reputed mobster on the Street, has \n     remained completely out of the public eye--even staying \n     active on the Street after his recent conviction for tax \n     evasion.\n       Mob-related activities on the Street are the subject of \n     inquiries by the FBI and the office of Manhattan District \n     Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau, which is described by one \n     source as having received numerous complaints concerning \n     mobsters on the Street. (Officials at both agencies and the \n     New York Police Dept. did not respond to repeated requests \n     for comment.)\n       Overall, the response of regulators and law enforcement to \n     Mob penetration of Wall Street has been mixed at best. Market \n     sources say complaints of Mob coercion have often been \n     ignored by law enforcement. Although an NASD spokesman says \n     the agency would vigorously pursue reports of Mob \n     infiltration, two top NASD officials told Business Week that \n     they have no knowledge of Mob penetration of member firms. \n     Asked to discuss such allegations, another high NASD official \n     declined, saying: ``I'd rather you not tell me about it.''\n       The Hanover, Sterling & Co. penny-stock firm, which left \n     12,000 investors in the lurch when it went out of business in \n     early 1995, is alleged by people close to the firm to have \n     been under the control of members of the Genovese organized \n     crime family. Sources say other Mob factions engaged in \n     aggressive short-selling of stocks brought public by Hanover.\n       Federal investigators are said to be probing extortion \n     attempts by Mob-linked short-sellers who had been associated \n     with the now-defunct Stratton Oakmont penny-stock firm.\n       Mob manipulation has affected the markets in a wide range \n     of stocks. Among those identified by Business Week are \n     Affinity Entertainment, Celebrity Entertainment, Beachport \n     Entertainment, Crystal Broadcasting, First Colonial Ventures, \n     Global Spill Management, Hollywood Productions, Innovative \n     Medical Services, International Nursing Services, Novatek \n     International, Osicom Technologies, ReClaim, SC, Solv-Ex, \n     and TJT. Officials of the companies deny any knowledge of Mob \n     involvement in the trading of their stocks, and there is no \n     evidence that company managements have been in league with \n     stock manipulators. These stocks were allegedly run up by \n     Mob-linked brokers, who sometimes used force or threats to \n     curtail short-selling in the stocks. When support by \n     allegedly Mob-linked brokerages ended, the stocks often \n     suffered precipitous declines--sometimes abetted, traders \n     say, by Mob-linked short-sellers. The stocks have generally \n     fared poorly (table, page 99).\n       Not all of the stocks were recent IPOs, and they were often \n     taken public by perfectly legitimate underwriters. \n     International Nursing, for example, went public at $23 in \n     1994 and was trading at $8 in early 1996 before falling back \n     to pennies. Short-sellers who attempted to sell the shares \n     earlier this year were warned off--in one instance by a Mob \n     member--market sources assert. International Nursing Chairman \n     John Yeros denies knowledge of manipulation of the stock.\n       What this all adds up to is a shocking tale of criminal \n     infiltration abetted by widespread fear and silence--and \n     official inaction. While firms and brokerage executives who \n     strive to keep far afield of the Mob often complain of NASD \n     inaction, rarely do such people feel strongly enough to share \n     their views with regulators or law enforcement. Instead, they \n     engage in self-defense. One major brokerage, which often \n     executes trades for small-cap market makers, keeps mammoth \n     intelligence files--to steer clear of Mob-run brokers. A \n     major accounting firm keeps an organized-crime expert on the \n     payroll. His duties include preventing his firm from doing \n     business with brokerages linked to organized crime and the \n     Russian Mob.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, they are not talking about legitimate \ntraders; they are talking about the mob's attempt to infiltrate Wall \nStreet. It seems to me for us to carve out of the original legislation \nan exemption from RICO predicate statutes securities fraud is a serious \nmistake. But it would also be a serious mistake for me to push this \nissue without the votes at this point, because I realize there is an \nattempt to bring this legislation to a close.\n  I think it is bad legislation generally. I think it is a serious \nmistake to have done this, but I also have been here long enough, as I \nsaid, to be able to know where the votes are.\n  I withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 2398) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom California be recognized for 1 minute and thereafter, the sponsor \nof the legislation who has not spoken today, Senator Domenici, who has \nbeen tied up in committee, has asked to be recognized for up to 5 \nminutes. Then I ask unanimous consent that we go to final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from California is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  The question before the Senate today is the following: How many \nsecurities litigation laws should there be relative to class-action \nlawsuits involving nationally traded securities?\n  I believe the answer is one. And I believed the answer was one when \nwe had\n\n[[Page S4813]]\n\nthis debate in 1995. And even though I advocated for a stronger law at \nthat time, I always thought there ought to be one law.\n  We, as policymakers, must establish a regulatory environment in which \ninvestors have sufficient rights and remedies while also ensuring that \nthe high-growth industries of our economy, many of which are located in \nmy home State of California, are provided the stability and the \ncertainty they need to expand, grow, and create jobs.\n  This bill does just that. It is narrowly crafted to address only the \nissue of class action lawsuits and nationally traded securities--I \nthink this is very important. It defines and limits class-action \nlawsuits. It applies only to nationally traded securities. It is a bill \nwhich I am proud to support.\n  Chairman Levitt, who I respect greatly, Chairman of the SEC, is \nsupportive of this legislation, and I think his words should carry a \ngreat deal of weight. We ought to give this law a chance to work in the \nFederal court and not see this law go to 50 different State courts. \nThis would be very disruptive and it doesn't make sense for nationally \ntraded securities.\n  If, after a time, we feel the law isn't good enough, isn't strong \nenough, isn't working as we had envisioned, we can revisit it and \naddress it as necessary. But I think today we ought to support this \nbill, as drafted, and assert there ought to be one law when it comes to \nclass action lawsuits involving nationally traded securities.\n  So, Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Chairman of the Banking \nCommittee and the ranking member on the Securities Subcommittee, \nSenator Dodd, in support of this bill. I yield the floor, and I yield \nthe time back to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will not use that amount of time.\n  I just want to say how pleased I am that today we are going to close \nthe loop and make sure that the small group of entrepreneurial \nplaintiff lawyers who were taking advantage of our securities laws are \nnow going to follow a uniform law in the States and in the Federal \ncourts.\n  It was in 1990 that Senator Sanford of North Carolina, who passed \naway just recently, and I introduced the first legislation on this \nissue. We did so because we found that a small group of plaintiff's \nlawyers were engaged in the business of finding meritless lawsuits to \nfile, but since they were class action lawsuits, they would have to get \nsettled. We found a trend across the country where they settled all \nthese cases rather than have jury trials. A small cadre of lawyers \nbecame rich, and, as far as we can find out, very few stockholders \nbenefited.\n  We passed the first bill to tighten up the rules in the Federal court \nsystem in 1995. It is the only bill where we overrode President \nClinton's veto. And tonight I think we will pass, by an even more \noverwhelming number, the culmination of this effort. The bill will keep \nplaintiffs' lawyers from picking State courts to do what we have \nprecluded them from doing in the Federal courts. This bill will stop \nthem from doing what we know they already are doing--they look for a \nsympathetic state forum where they can get these lawsuits filed.\n  This is legislation that helps the high-tech companies that get \nstarted in America. We have testimony that the Intel company--that \ngreat American company--had they faced one of these kinds of suits when \nthey were in their infancy, they are almost certain that they would not \nexist today. We do not know how many other companies now do not exist \nbecause they faced these kinds of lawsuits.\n  But essentially we are doing an exciting thing for growth, \nprosperity, and we are harming and hurting no one with legitimate \ncomplaints against corporations for fraud, misrepresentation, and \nmalfeasance.\n  As I said, I rise today in strong support of S. 1260, the \n``Securities Litigation Reform Uniform Standards Act of 1998'' and I \nwant to commend the Majority Leader for bringing this bill to the floor \nthis week. Few issues are more important to the high-tech community and \nthe efficient operation of our capital markets than securities fraud \nlawsuit reform.\n  I am pleased to serve as an original co-sponsor of this legislation \nwith Senators D'Amato, Dodd, and Gramm--a bill to provide one set of \nrules to govern securities fraud class actions.\n  As I said previously, this bill completes the work I began more than \n6 years ago with Senator Sanford of North Carolina. Back in the early \n1990's, Senator Sanford and I noticed that a small group of \nentrepreneurial plaintiffs' lawyers were taking advantage of our \nsecurities laws and the federal rules related to class action lawsuits \nto file frivolous and abusive claims against high-technology companies \nin Federal courts.\n  Often these lawsuits were based simply on the fact that a company's \nstock price had fallen, without any real evidence of fraud. Senator \nSanford and I realized a long time ago that stock price volatility--\ncommon in high tech stocks--simply is not stock fraud.\n  But, because it was so expensive and time consuming to fight these \nlawsuits, many companies settled even when they knew they had done \nnothing wrong. The money used to pay for these frivolous lawsuits could \nhave been used for research and development or to create new, high-\npaying jobs.\n  So, we introduced a bill to make some changes to the securities fraud \nclass action system. Of course, since we were up against the \nplaintiffs' lawyers, the bill didn't go anywhere for awhile.\n  After Senator Sanford left the Senate, the senior Senator from \nConnecticut, Senator Dodd, and I continued to work hard on this issue. \nIn 1995, with tremendous help from Chairman D'Amato and Senator Gramm, \nwe passed a law. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 \npassed Congress in an overwhelmingly bipartisan way--over President \nClinton's veto of the bill.\n  And since enactment of the Reform Act, we have seen great changes in \nthe conduct of plaintiffs' class action lawyers in federal court. \nBecause of more stringent pleading requirements, plaintiffs' lawyers no \nlonger ``race to the courthouse'' to be the first to file securities \nclass actions. Because of the new rules, we no longer have \n``professional plaintiffs''--investors who buy a few shares of stock \nand then serve as named plaintiffs in multiple securities class \nactions. Other rules make it difficult for plaintiffs' lawyers to file \nlawsuits to force companies into settlement rather than face the \nexpensive and time consuming ``fishing expedition'' discovery process.\n  Now, it looks like our new law has worked too well. Entrepreneurial \ntrial lawyers have begun filing similar claims in State court instead \nof federal court to avoid the new law's safeguards against frivolous \nand abusive lawsuits. Instead of one set of rules, we now have 51--one \nfor the Federal system and 50 different ones in the States.\n  According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, this migration \nof claims from Federal court to State court ``may be the most \nsignificant development in securities litigation'' since the passage of \nthe new law in 1995.\n  In fact, prior to passage of the new law in 1995, State courts rarely \nserved as the forum for securities fraud lawsuits. Now, more than 25 \npercent of all securities class actions are brought in State court. A \nrecent Price Waterhouse study found that the average number of State \ncourt class actions filed in 1996--the first year after the new law--\ngrew 335 percent over the 1991-1995 average. In 1997, State court \nfilings were 150 percent greater than the 1991-1995 average.\n  So, there has been an unprecedented increase in State securities \nfraud class actions. In fact, trial lawyers have testified to Congress \nthat they have an obligation to file securities fraud lawsuits in State \ncourt if it provides a more attractive forum for their clients. Imagine \nthat--plaintiffs' lawyers admit that they are attempting to avoid \nfederal law.\n\n  These State court lawsuits also have prevented high-tech companies \nfrom taking advantage of one of the most significant reforms in the \n1995 law--the safe harbor for predictive statements. Under the 1995 \nlaw, companies which make forward-looking statements are exempt from \nlawsuits based on those statements if they meet certain requirements. \nCompanies are reluctant to use the safe harbor and make predictive \nstatements because they fear that such statements could be used\n\n[[Page S4814]]\n\nagainst them in State court. This fear chills the free flow of \nimportant information to investors--certainly not a result we intended \nwhen we passed the new law.\n  So today, the Senate will vote to create one set of rules for \nsecurities fraud cases. One uniform set of rules is critical for our \nhigh-technology community and our capital markets.\n  Without this legislation, the productivity of the fastest growing \nsegment of our economy--high tech--will continue to be hamstrung by \nabusive, lawyer-driven lawsuits. Rather than spend their resources on \nR or creating new jobs, high-tech companies will continue to be \nforced to spend massive sums fending off frivolous lawsuits.\n  When I first worked on this issue, executives at Intel Corporation \ntold me that if they had been hit with a frivolous securities lawsuit \nearly in the company's history, they likely never would have invented \nthe microchip. We should not let that happen to the next generation of \nIntels.\n  This bill also is important to our markets. Our capital markets are \nthe envy of the world, and by definition are national in scope. \nInformation provided by companies to the markets is directed to \ninvestors across the United States and throughout the world.\n  Under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, Congress has the \nauthority to regulate in areas affecting ``interstate commerce.'' I \ncannot imagine a more classic example of what constitutes ``interstate \ncommerce'' than the purchase and sale of securities over a national \nexchange.\n  Not only does Congress have the authority to regulate in this area, \nit clearly is necessary and appropriate. Right now, in an environment \nwhere there are 50 different sets of rules, companies must take into \naccount the most onerous State liability rules and tailor their conduct \naccordingly. If the liability rules in one State make it easier for \nentrepreneurial lawyers to bring frivolous lawsuits, that affects \ncompanies and the information available to investors in all other \nStates. One uniform set of rules will eliminate that problem.\n  Mr. President, I again want to commend my colleagues for their work \non this important bill. I understand that this is a bi-partisan bill \nwhich has the support of the SEC and at least 40 Senators. I think by \nthe end of the day, many, many more Senators will join us in supporting \nthis bill. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I have one more unanimous consent. The \nSenator from Nevada has asked to speak for up to 3 minutes. I ask \nunanimous consent that he be given that and then we go to final \npassage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I thank the chairman for his courtesy.\n  Mr. President, this is a vote that I believe that my colleagues who \nsupport the measure--and I am not unmindful of how the votes lie--will \nlive to rue. At a time when investor fraud is mounting with billions \nand billions of dollars, we have a consistent, steady course of action \nwhere we are systematically depriving individual small investors from \nprotections.\n  This adds a further limitation to the statute of limitations. And 37 \nout of the 50 States provide a greater remedy. This provides a \nlimitation in terms of the ability of an investor to file an action \nagainst an accomplice. And 49 out of 50 States provide that remedy. We \ntake that away in this course of action.\n  Most States provide a remedy for joint and several liability so that \nan investor who is defrauded may recover the full amount of his or her \nloss from any one of the individual investors. If this legislation had \nbeen in place at the time of the Keating fraud, where Keating himself \nwas, in effect, judgment proof, there would have been no ability to \nrecover against the fraudulent activity of the accomplices--the \naccountants, the lawyers, and others.\n  That is why, contrary to the assertion by the proponents, this is not \na plaintiff's lawyer's argument that is being made in opposition to \nthis. There are some abuses, and we should confine ourselves to that. \nThat is why all of the governmental institutions who are charged with \ntheir public responsibility as stewards of investment funds, retirement \nfunds, municipalities, school districts, States, all have expressed \ntheir opposition to the legislation, because they recognize that the \ntaxpayer, himself or herself, is frequently defrauded by this course of \naction.\n  So this is a bad piece of legislation. And we continue on a slippery \nslope in eliminating basic investor protections. The small guys get \ndealt out of the game with this legislation. The victims, they can take \ncare of themselves. But for the millions and millions of small \ninvestors who have confidence in our markets, who are coming in--one \nout of every three in the country--they are the big losers in this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I want to commend the Senator from Nevada for a very \npowerful statement and for his very strong presentation of the \narguments. All I want to say to my colleague is, I am confident in \nmaking the prediction that events down the road, when the investors \ncome in, innocent people, and say, ``We didn't have a remedy,'' he will \nbe proven correct.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Senator from Maryland for his comments. He has \nstood tall, not only in this legislation but in the 1995 legislation on \nbehalf of small investors. That is what this matter is all about. There \nis no sympathy for plaintiff lawyers. That is not the argument, as the \nSenator from Maryland and I and others who oppose this legislation \nknow. We are talking about protecting small investors in America who, I \nbelieve, are left with fewer defenses as a result of this.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I will be very brief on this. And we have been through \nthis. The last time it was a 5-day debate. We ought to take some solace \nin the fact that we have done this in half a day. And let me commend my \ncolleagues, all of them, who have been involved in this and over some \nperiod of time.\n  But I say, Mr. President, this is a very sound piece of legislation \nthat can make a huge difference today. That investor that my colleague, \nthe distinguished Senator from Nevada, talks about, that is the \ninvestor that deposits their hard-earned money in the securities of \nstruggling businesses, high-tech companies that are the primary targets \nof these lawsuits. And it is these industries that represent the \nknowledge-based economy of our 21st century.\n  Too often we have seen predator lawyers out there go after them. What \nwe are trying to do with this bill is to tighten up the loophole, to \nmake it possible for these companies to grow while simultaneously--\nsimultaneously--seeing to it that investors can bring a rightful cause \nof action, as plaintiffs, where fraud has been committed.\n  This is going to make for a far sounder system for people in this \ncountry. And I predict to my colleagues that we will see economic \ngrowth in these firms and businesses, where they can avoid the kind of \ntremendous expenditures that have had to be laid out to fight frivolous \nlawsuits and end up as settlements, costing fortunes with, of course, \ncases being thrown out of court.\n  So I predict to my colleagues, this will be a vote they will be very \nproud of in the years ahead to avoid these frivolous lawsuits we have \nseen in the past. I urge passage of the legislation.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kohl be recognized \nfor a request, and then I will call for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Thank you, I say to Senator D'Amato.\n\n\n                 Change of Vote--Roll Call Vote No. 132\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, on rollcall vote No. 132, I voted no. It was \nmy intention to vote aye. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to change my vote. This will in no way change the outcome of \nthe vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S4815]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the committee \namendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Securities Litigation \n     Uniform Standards Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 \n     sought to prevent abuses in private securities fraud \n     lawsuits;\n       (2) since enactment of that legislation, considerable \n     evidence has been presented to Congress that a number of \n     securities class action lawsuits have shifted from Federal to \n     State courts;\n       (3) this shift has prevented that Act from fully achieving \n     its objectives;\n       (4) State securities regulation is of continuing \n     importance, together with Federal regulation of securities, \n     to protect investors and promote strong financial markets; \n     and\n       (5) in order to prevent certain State private securities \n     class action lawsuits alleging fraud from being used to \n     frustrate the objectives of the Private Securities Litigation \n     Reform Act of 1995, it is appropriate to enact national \n     standards for securities class action lawsuits involving \n     nationally traded securities, while preserving the \n     appropriate enforcement powers of State securities regulators \n     and not changing the current treatment of individual \n     lawsuits.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am trying to have an announcement for the \nMembers. But I need to check with a couple of people in just a moment. \nSo if the Senator from Iowa would like to proceed with statements, I \nwould like to maybe interrupt in a moment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while the leader is on the floor--if the \nSenator from Iowa will withhold for just a moment--I know the leader is \ntrying to get a schedule together. I just wanted to note, because there \nhas been some question over here on this side of the aisle, that on S. \n2037, the WIPO bill, or the digital new millennium copyright \nlegislation, there is absolutely no objection to going forward with it. \nI suggest that there will be unanimous support for it over here. I just \nwanted to advise the distinguished majority leader of that fact.\n  Mr. LOTT. I might respond to the fact that we do want to get that \nbill done. We have run into a possible technical problem that we are \ntrying to work out, as you well know.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I understand what the leader wants to do. I wanted to make \nsure that he understands this side of the aisle is ready and raring to \ngo.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the \nSenate has now passed the second of the four high-tech bills that we \nhad been working on and have worked to get agreements. And we have been \nsuccessful in that. It is our intent at the earliest opportunity to \nconsider and pass the WIPO bill, even though I understand there may be \na technical problem with the blue slip issue involving the House of \nRepresentatives. We are trying to check that out, and also the \nimmigration bill that the Senator from Michigan has been working on, \nand Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts.\n  It would be our intent to call up that immigration bill, if we do not \ndo it before noon on Monday, with the possibility of stacked votes on \nMonday afternoon about 5:30. I am not asking unanimous consent to that \neffect right now. I have discussed that with Senator Abraham, and \nSenator Kennedy. But I would need to check that with Senator Daschle \nand others.\n  But I want the Members to know that we need to complete action on \nthese high-tech bills. A lot of great work has been done. We have been \nable to pass two of them. We are very close to being able to get the \nother two done. Our intent is to stay with that until we get it \ncompleted.\n  The Senate will now begin the DOD authorization bill.\n  Having said all of that, there will be no further votes this evening, \nand the Senate will consider the DOD authorization bill throughout \nThursday's session of the Senate. I had hoped there would be opening \nstatements. But I understand we will just lay the bill down, and then \nwe will begin tomorrow.\n  But I want the Record to show that I was requested to have the \nremainder of the night for the DOD authorization bill so that we could \nget 2 or 3 hours on it. We are not going to be able to do that. But I \nam certainly prepared and willing, and wanted to do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/13/senate-section/article/S4816-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 2057\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I want to take a little time again today \nto talk about the perilous situation that we find in south Asia at this \npoint in time. Once again, in complete disregard of world opinion, in \ncomplete disregard of peace in the region, in complete disregard of the \nconcerns of its neighbors and its allies and friends, yesterday the \nnation of India once again detonated two more nuclear devices. That \nmakes five in 2 days.\n  What I hear around here, Mr. President, people are saying, what have \nthey done? Have they lost their senses? Have they lost all concept of \nreality? Have they gone berserk? Are they completely nutty now? Those \nare the kinds of things I hear around the Chamber and around the \nCapitol--people talking about India, and what has happened to them. I \ndo not believe that all Indians have gone berserk or that all Indians \nare crazy, but certainly something has happened with their Government \nto flaunt what they have done, to go ahead and not only set off three \nin 1 day, but two the next day, and also near the border of Pakistan. \nFor the life of me, I cannot understand what they can possibly be \nthinking of.\n\n  So, I am pleased that the President has announced that he will, in \naccordance with the law, invoke the full range of sanctions that are \nrequired under the Nuclear Policy Prevention Act of 1994. These are \ntough, and we want to make sure that the administration follows through \non them. We have to end all foreign assistance and loans to the Nation \nof India. We must terminate all military aid and weapons transfers. We \nmust oppose international foreign aid and financial assistance to the \nNation through the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. I \nunderstand many of our allies have decided to join in placing these \nsanctions on India. The law requires it, and we must place the full \nmeasure of the law on India in this regard.\n  Mr. President, I visited the south Asia region twice in the last year \nand a half. I understand the complexity of their internal politics and \ntheir international relations. But I must say this, that whatever \nproblems there may have been before have been multiplied a thousandfold \nby what India just did.\n  Again, I hope the nations in that region will exercise caution and \nrestraint in light of this. Right now, India has become the pariah of \nthe world community of nations, and rightfully so, for what it has \ndone. It should remain a pariah for a considerable amount of time, \nuntil it reverses its course, until it sits down with its neighbors to \nreach peaceful solutions in that area, until India is willing to sit \ndown with its neighbor, Pakistan, and solve once and for all the issue \nof Kashmir; until India is ready to sit down with its neighbor, \nPakistan, and secure their borders; until India is willing to disavow \nputting their nuclear arsenals within their military. Until that time, \nuntil these things are done, India will and should remain a pariah \namong the world community of nations.\n  Earlier today, our Secretary of Defense appeared before our \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Defense. We discussed these developments \nin south Asia and what they mean. Will there be a nuclear arms race now \nin the region? Will Pakistan follow suit and detonate a nuclear weapons \ntest in response to India? What about China? What is China going to do \nnow? How about Iran? Don't forget, they have a border also. What is \nIran going to do now that India has taken this step? So what are all \nthese nations going to do?\n  Secretary Cohen this morning, in open testimony, indicated that we \nmay see a chain reaction of events. I think that is an apt term, \nconsidering the physics of nuclear fission. Just as a nuclear explosion \nis an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction, so we may see uncontrolled \nevents now happen in that region. But, just like a nuclear chain \nreaction, there are things you can do to slow it down and stop it. Just \nas in a nuclear powerplant, to slow down the chain reaction, they stick \nin the graphite rods to slow down the reaction, so we need to insert \nsome graphite rods into the events that just happened in south Asia.\n  What I mean by that is that I believe that certain steps must be \ntaken to slow down these events. First of all, as I mentioned, we must \napply the full force and effect of law on the sanctions to India. \nSecond, I believe we must meet with Pakistan at the earliest possible \ntime to discuss our mutual security needs in that area of the world; to \ndiscuss them with Pakistan, who has been a friend and an ally going \nclear back to the establishment of Pakistan as a nation. When people \nwondered\n\n[[Page S4818]]\n\nwhat direction Pakistan would go, would they go to the Soviet Union or \nwould they tilt toward the United States, Pakistan declared at that \ntime they would go with the United States, they would follow the path \nof democracy and freedom and not with the Soviet Union.\n\n  Time and time and time again, Pakistan has come to our aid, our \nassistance, whether it was overflights over the Soviet Union for \npurposes of intelligence gathering, helping us in that terrible war in \nAfghanistan. There are still over a million refugees in the country of \nPakistan from that war that helped topple the Soviet Union. Every step \nof the way, Pakistan has been our friend and our ally. So I think we \nneed to meet with them at the earliest possible time to discuss our \nmutual security interests in that area.\n  Next, I hope President Clinton will, at the earliest possible time, \nindicate that he will not be visiting India this year. I know there has \nbeen a trip planned for the President to visit Pakistan and India this \nfall. I call upon the President to indicate now that, because of these \nevents, it would not be right and proper for him to visit India but \nthat it would be right and proper for him to visit Pakistan and perhaps \nother nations in that area such as Bangladesh. So, I call upon him to \ncall off that visit to India to send another strong signal.\n  And, third, in order to put these graphite rods back into this chain \nreaction and to slow it down, I believe we need to press ahead with the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty, or the CTBT, that would outlaw all \nnuclear weapons tests globally. So far, 149 nations have signed the \ntreaty. In fact, we thought we were going to get it all done in August \nof 1996, except one nation walked out and refused to sign it--India. \nAnd now we know why. Is it too late for a Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty? I don't believe so. In fact, I believe what has happened in \nIndia more than anything indicates that we have to act now in the U.S. \nSenate to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  We have not taken it up yet, and we should. We have signed it. It is \nnow sitting before the Senate. We ought to take it up because the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty will help put those graphite rods back in \nthat chain reaction, slowing down uncontrolled events in south Asia.\n  The CTBT will not by itself eliminate the possibility of \nproliferation, but it will make it extremely difficult for nuclear \nnations, such as India, to develop sophisticated weapons that could be \ndelivered by ballistic missiles.\n  Again, we have India, and they set off their underground explosions. \nBut, as we know, that is not the end of the line in terms of developing \nthe kind of weapons that can be delivered by ballistic missiles. If we \ndon't sign and if we don't urge other nations and India to sign the \nCTBT, this will not be the end of India's nuclear testing, believe me. \nThey are now going to have to refine their warheads. They are going to \nhave to have further testing so that they have the kind of warheads \nthey can deliver with missiles and perhaps aircraft. We have to stop \nthat from happening, and that is why we need the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty.\n  It would have been better if we had this in effect beforehand to stop \nwhat happened in India, but we didn't have it. We can't turn the clock \nback. We can't put the genie back in the bottle, but what we can do is \nwe can push ahead now.\n  Here is how I see it, Mr. President. We have to put the full force \nand effect of the law on India with all these sanctions, cut off all \naid, military assistance and cut off all World Bank loans and IMF. In \nfact, I think we ought to withdraw our ambassador, which the President \nhas done, and not send him back. Then I believe the U.S. Senate should \nratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and insist that India do so \nimmediately, before we ever lift any sanctions. In that way, India may \nhave a bomb, but they may not have something that they could deliver on \nthe head of a missile.\n  That is why I believe it is so important that we bring up the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty and ratify it in the Senate and stop this \nmadness, stop these uncontrolled events that may take place in south \nAsia unless we act right now.\n  In fact, I must say, I know the occupant of the chair has spoken on \nthis issue. I know he had a hearing on it today. Quite frankly, I am \nsomewhat shocked that more Senators are not out here talking about what \nhas happened in India in the last couple of days. I believe this is the \nbiggest single danger to world peace that we have faced perhaps in the \nlast 20 to 30 years, because uncontrolled events can start taking \nplace.\n  On the one hand, I believe we must come down with the full force and \neffect of the law on India. I believe the President should call off his \ntrip there this fall. I believe we need to meet with our friends in \nPakistan to discuss our mutual security needs in that area. On the \nother hand, we need to ratify a comprehensive test ban treaty and then \nsay to India, ``If you want to rejoin the community of nations, sign, \njoin, no more testing.'' Then we get other nations to sign it, and we \nwill have a comprehensive test ban treaty and will stop the \nuncontrolled events that may be unfolding in south Asia.\n  It is a perilous time. India cannot be excused from what it did. \nHopefully, the community of nations can put the proper pressure on \nIndia to come to its senses and join the rest of the world community in \nsaying, ``No; that they will never ever test nuclear weapons ever \nagain.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

These sections apply the rights and protections of \n     the Employee Polygraph Protection Act, the Worker Adjustment \n     and Retraining Notification Act, and the Uniformed Services \n     Employment and Reemployment Act, and prohibit retaliation and \n     reprisal for exercising rights under the CAA. The notice \n     invited public comment, and, on January 28, 1998, a \n     supplementary notice was published inviting further comment. \n     Having considered the comments received, the Executive \n     Director has decided to terminate the rulemaking and, \n     instead, to recommend that the Office's Board of Directors \n     prepare and submit to Congress legislative proposals to \n     resolve questions raised by the comments.\n       Availability of comments for public review.--Copies of \n     comments received by the Office with respect to the proposed \n     amendments are available for public review at the Law Library \n     Reading Room, Room LM-201, Law Library of Congress, James \n     Madison Memorial Building, Washington, D.C., Monday through \n     Friday, between the hours of 9:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.\n       For further information contact.--Executive Director, \n     Office of Compliance, Room LA 200, John Adams Building, 110 \n     Second Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20540-1999; telephone \n     (202) 724-9250 (voice), (202) 426-1912 (TTY). This Notice \n     will be made available in large print or braille or on \n     computer disk upon request to the Office of Compliance.\n\n\n                       supplementary information\n\n       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (``CAA''), 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1301 et seq., applies\n\n[[Page S4819]]\n\n     the rights and protections of eleven labor, employment, and \n     public access laws to the Legislative Branch. Sections 204-\n     206 of the CAA explicitly cover the General Accounting Office \n     (``GAO'') and the Library of Congress (``Library''). These \n     sections apply the rights and protections of the Employee \n     Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 (``EPPA''), the Worker \n     Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (``WARN Act''), \n     and section 2 of the Uniformed Services Employment and \n     Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (``USERRA'').\n       On October 1, 1997, the Executive Director of the Office of \n     Compliance (``Office'') published a Notice of Proposed \n     Rulemaking (``NPRM'') proposing to extend the Procedural \n     Rules of the Office to cover GAO and the Library and their \n     employees for purposes of proceedings involving alleged \n     violations of sections 204-206, as well as proceedings \n     involving alleged violations of section 207, which prohibits \n     intimidation and retaliation for exercising rights \n     under violations of section 207, which prohibits \n     intimidation and retaliation for exercising rights under \n     the CAA. 143 Cong. Rec. S10291 (daily ed. Oct. 1, 1997). \n     The Library submitted comments in opposition to adoption \n     of the proposed amendments and raising questions of \n     statutory construction. On January 28, 1998, the Executive \n     Director published a Supplementary Notice of Proposed \n     Rulemaking (``Supplementary NPRM'') requesting further \n     comment on the issues raised by the Library. 144 Cong. \n     Rec. S86 (daily ed. Jan. 28, 1998). Comments in response \n     to the Supplementary NPRM were submitted by GAO, the \n     Library, a union of Library employees, and a committee of \n     the House of Representatives.\n       The comments expressed divergent views as to the meaning of \n     the relevant statutory provisions. The CAA extends rights, \n     protections, and procedures only to certain defined \n     ``employing offices'' and ``covered employees.'' The \n     definitions of these terms in section 101 of the CAA, which \n     apply throughout the CAA generally, omit GAO and the Library \n     and their employees from coverage, but sections 204-206 of \n     the CAA expressly include GAO and the Library and their \n     employees within the definitions of ``employing office'' and \n     ``covered employee'' for purposes of those sections. Two \n     commenters argued that the provisions of sections 401-408, \n     which establish the administrative and judicial procedures \n     for remedying violations of sections 204-206, refer back to \n     the definitions in section 101 ``without linking to the very \n     limited coverage'' of the instrumentalities in sections 204-\n     206, and therefore do not cover GAO and the Library and their \n     employees. However, two other commenters argued to the \n     contrary. One stated that, because employees of the \n     instrumentalities were given the protections of sections 204-\n     206, ``the concomitant procedural rights'' of sections 401-\n     408 were also conferred on them; and the other commenter \n     argued that construing the CAA to grant rights but not \n     remedies would defeat the stated legislative purpose, ``since \n     a right without a remedy is often no right at all.'' The four \n     commenters also expressed divergent views about whether GAO \n     and the Library and their employees, who were not expressly \n     referenced by section 207, are nevertheless covered by the \n     prohibition in that section against retaliation and reprisal \n     for exercising applicable CAA rights.\n       Having considered that the comments received express such \n     opposing views of the statute, the Executive Director has \n     decided to terminate the rulemaking without adopting the \n     proposed amendments and, instead, to recommend that the \n     Office's Board of Directors prepare and submit to Congress \n     legislative proposals to resolve questions raised by the \n     comments.\n       In light of the statutory questions raised, it remains \n     uncertain whether employees of GAO and the Library have the \n     statutory right to use the administrative and judicial \n     procedures under the CAA, and whether GAO and the Library may \n     be charged as respondent or defendant under those procedures, \n     where violations of sections 204-207 of the CAA are alleged. \n     The Office will continue to accept any request for counseling \n     or mediation and any complaint filed by a GAO or Library \n     employee and/or alleging a violation by GAO or the Library. \n     Any objection to jurisdiction may be made to the hearing \n     officer or the Board under sections 405-406 or to the court \n     during proceedings under sections 407-408 of the CAA. \n     Furthermore, the Office will counsel any employee who \n     initiates such proceedings that a question has been raised as \n     to the Office's and the courts' jurisdiction under the CAA \n     and that the employee may wish to preserve rights under any \n     other available procedural avenues.\n       The Executive Director's decision announced here does not \n     affect the coverage of GAO and the Library and their \n     employees with respect to proceedings under section 215 of \n     the CAA (which applies the rights and protections of the \n     OSHAct) or ex parte communications. On February 12, 1998, the \n     Executive Director, with the approval of the Board, published \n     a Notice of Adoption of Amendments amending the Procedural \n     Rules to include such coverage. 144 Cong. Rec. S720 (daily \n     ed.

Mr. President, this morning, the Senate failed to \ninvoke cloture on S. 1873, the American Missile Protection Act of 1998. \nThe bill is simple and its purpose can be stated very easily by \nreciting Section 3 in its entirety. ``It is the policy of the United \nStates to deploy as soon as is technologically possible an effective \nNational Missile Defense system capable of defending the territory of \nthe United States against limited ballistic missile attack (whether \naccidental, unauthorized, or deliberate).''\n  Everyone knows that it is necessary to first vote to stop endless \ndebate on a bill when a filibuster has been threatened, then, after \ncloture, we can have limited debate followed by a vote on the bill \nitself. From this morning's vote, it can be seen that more than 40 \npercent of my colleagues feel that it should be the policy of the \nUnited States to keep our citizens exposed to the risks of a ballistic \nmissile attack.\n  Mr. President, I know that the Cold War is over. Unfortunately, \nalthough some would like to believe otherwise, this does not mean that \nwe are one happy world, where all countries are working in mutual \ncooperation. It is no time for the United States to let down its guard \nor to cease doing everything possible to maintain our national \nsecurity.\n  The nuclear testing in India this week should shake some sense into \nthose calling for the U.S. to disarm itself of our nuclear deterrent \ncapability, as if that would set an example to the rest of the world. \nWe cannot ``uninvent'' nuclear weapons everywhere in the world. \nTherefore, we must do the next best thing--prepare our best defense.\n  During the Cold War standoff with the Soviet Union, we operated under \na system known as MAD, for Mutually Assured Destruction. No country, \nback then, would attack us with a nuclear weapon because there was full \nrealization that it would face certain annihilation because we could \nand would retaliate in kind, and with greater strength. MAD was never a \ncompletely risk-free strategy, though. We had to rely on the hope that \nother governments would act responsibly and not put their citizens in \nthe path of a direct, retaliatory missile hit. This was the best we \ncould do back then. MAD has outlived its usefulness today because we \nhave the capability to protect ourselves better--we now have the \nability to develop defensive technologies that can give us a system \nthat will knock out a ballistic missile before it can land on one of \nour cities.\n  It should be clear to everyone that in today's more complicated world \nthe threat of a ballistic missile attack is not confined to a couple of \nsuperpowers; there is a greater risk than ever before of a launch \nagainst the U.S., either by accident or design, from any of a number of \nso-called ``rogue'' nations. And, with the additional risk that \nchemical or biological weapons can be launched using the same ballistic \nmissile technology as is used for nuclear weapons delivery, the threat \nis more widespread and we must defend against it.\n  Without National Missile Defense, there is a greater risk that an \nincident, even one involving chemical or biological weapons, could \nescalate into full scale nuclear war. If we must stick with a MAD \nstrategy, we will have to retaliate once we identify a ballistic \nmissile launch at the U.S. It would be much better to eliminate those \nmissiles with a defensive system, and then determine what most \nappropriate response, diplomatic or military, we would undertake.\n  Ignoring that National Missile Defense can keep us from an escalating \nnuclear war, critics of the American Missile Protection Act, through \ntwisted logic, say that if the U.S. builds a defensive capability, this \nwill drive the world closer to a nuclear war. Their argument goes \nsomething like this--if we can defend against a ballistic missile \nattack, there is nothing that will stop us from striking another \ncountry first because we no longer have to worry about retaliation. As \nincredible as it may sound, they say that a National Missile Defense is \nactually an act of aggression.\n  In order to buy into such an argument, however, you have to first \nassume that the United States has been standing by, waiting to take \nover the world with its nuclear defensive arsenal, but the Soviet bear \nkept us in our cage. You would have to believe that\n\n[[Page S4820]]\n\nAmericans have been so intent on spreading democracy around the world \nthat we would attack any country that would not adopt our free system \nof government and force democracy upon its peoples.\n  No, Mr. President, building a National Missile Defense is not an act \nof aggression that would free us up to launch an unprovoked attack on \nother countries. It is an act of common sense in a dangerous world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/13/senate-section/article/S4819-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a treaty \nand one nomination which was referred to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/13/senate-section/article/S4820-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT CONCERNING THE INDIAN NUCLEAR TESTS ON MAY 11, 1998--MESSAGE \n                       FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 125\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to section 102(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act, I am \nhereby reporting that, in accordance with that section, I have \ndetermined that India, a non-nuclear-weapon state, detonated a nuclear \nexplosive device on May 11, 1998.

This report is submitted pursuant to \nsection 204(c) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act \n(IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. 1703(c). This report covers events through March 31, \n1998. My last report, dated November 25, 1997, covered events through \nSeptember 30, 1997.\n  1. There have been no amendments to the Iranian Assets Control \nRegulations, 31 CFR Part 535 (the ``IACR''), since my last report.\n  2. The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal (the ``Tribunal''), \nestablished at The Hague pursuant to the Algiers Accords, continues to \nmake progress in arbitrating the claims before it. Since the period \ncovered in my last report, the Tribunal has rendered one award. This \nbrings the total number of awards rendered by the Tribunal to 585, the \nmajority of which have been in favor of U.S. claimants. As of March 31, \n1998, the value of awards to successful U.S. claimants paid from the \nSecurity Account held by the NV Settlement Bank was $2,480,897,381.53.\n  Since my last report, Iran has failed to replenish the Security \nAccount established by the Algiers Accords to ensure payment of awards \nto successful U.S. claimants. Thus, since November 5, 1992, the \nSecurity Account has continuously remained below the $500 million \nbalance required by the Algiers Accords. As of March 31, 1998, the \ntotal amount in the Security Account was $125,888,588.35, and the total \namount in the Interest Account was $21,716,836.85. Therefore, the \nUnited States continues to pursue Case No. A/28, filed in September \n1993, to require Iran to meet its obligation under the Algiers Accords \nto replenish the Security Account.\n  The United States also continues to pursue Case No. A/29 to require \nIran to meet its obligation of timely payment of its equal share of \nadvances for Tribunal expenses when directed to do so by the Tribunal. \nIran filed its Rejoinder in this case on February 9, 1998.\n  3. The Department of State continues to respond to claims brought \nagainst the United States by Iran, in coordination with concerned \ngovernment agencies.\n  On January 16, 1998, the United States filed a major submission in \nCase No. B/1, a case in which Iran seeks repayment for alleged wrongful \ncharges to Iran over the life of its Foreign Military Sales (FMS) \nprogram, including the costs of terminating the program. The January \nfiling primarily addressed Iran's allegation that its FMS Trust Fund \nshould have earned interest.\n  Under the February 22, 1996, settlement agreement related to the Iran \nAir case before the International Court of Justice and Iran's bank-\nrelated claims against the United States before the Tribunal (see \nreport of May 16, 1996), the Department of State has been processing \npayments. As of March 31, 1998, the Department of State has authorized \npayment to U.S. nationals totaling $13,901,776.86 for 49 claims against \nIranian banks. The Department of State has also authorized payments to \nsurviving family members of 220 Iranian victims of the aerial incident, \ntotaling $54,300,000.\n  During this reporting period, the full Tribunal held a hearing in \nCase No. A/11 from February 16 through 18. Case No. A/11 concerns \nIran's allegations that the United States violated its obligations \nunder Point IV of the Algiers Accords by failing to freeze and gather \ninformation about property and assets purportedly located in the United \nStates and belonging to the estate of the late Shah of Iran or his \nclose relatives.\n  4. U.S. nationals continue to pursue claims against Iran at the \nTribunal. Since my last report, the Tribunal has issued an award in one \nprivate claim. On March 5, 1998, Chamber One issued an award in George \nE. Davidson v. Iran, AWD No. 585-457-1, ordering Iran to pay the \nclaimant $227,556 plus interest for Iran's interference with the \nclaimant's property rights in three buildings in Tehran. The Tribunal \ndismissed the claimant's claims with regard to other property for lack \nof proof. The claimant received $20,000 in arbitration costs.\n  5. The situation reviewed above continues to implicate important \ndiplomatic, financial, and legal interests of the United States and its \nnationals and presents and unusual challenge to the national security \nand foreign policy of the United States. The Iranian Assets Control \nRegulations issued pursuant to Executive Order 12170 continue to play \nan important role in structuring our relationship with Iran and in \nenabling the United States to implement properly the Algiers Accords. I \nshall continue to exercise the powers at my disposal to deal with these \nproblems and will continue to report periodically to the Congress on \nsignificant developments.\n                                                  William J.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 52\n\n       Whereas, on the night of July 17, 1944, two transport \n     vessels loading ammunition at the Port Chicago naval base on \n     the Sacramento River in California were suddenly engulfed in \n     a gigantic explosion, the incredible blast of which wrecked \n     the naval base and heavily damaged the town of Port Chicago, \n     located 1.5 miles away; and\n       Whereas, everyone on the pier and aboard the two ships was \n     killed instantly--some 320 American naval personnel, 200 of \n     whom were Black enlisted men; and another 390 military and \n     civilian personnel were injured, including 226 Black enlisted \n     men; and\n       Whereas, the two ships and the large loading pier were \n     totally annihilated and an estimated $12,000,000 in property \n     damage was caused by the huge blast; and\n       Whereas, this single, stunning disaster accounted for \n     nearly one-fifth of all Black naval casualties during the \n     whole of World War II; and\n       Whereas, the specific cause of the explosion was never \n     officially established by a Court of Inquiry, in effect \n     clearing the officers-in-charge of any responsibility for the \n     disaster and insofar as any human cause was invoked, laid the \n     burden of blame on the shoulders of the Black enlisted men \n     who died in the explosion; and\n       Whereas, following the incident, many of the surviving \n     Black sailors were transferred to nearby Camp Shoemaker where \n     they remained until July 31, when two of the divisions were \n     transferred to naval barracks in Vallejo near Mare Island; \n     another division, which was also at Camp Shoemaker until July \n     31, returned to Port Chicago to help with the cleaning up and \n     rebuilding of the base; and\n       Whereas, many of these men were in a state of shock, \n     troubled by the vivid memory of the horrible explosion; \n     however, they were provided no psychiatric counseling or \n     medical screening, except for those who were obviously \n     physically injured; none of the men, even those who had been \n     hospitalized with injuries, was granted survivor leaves to \n     visit their families before being reassigned to regular \n     duties; and none of these survivors was called to testify at \n     the Court of Inquiry; and\n       Whereas, Captain Merrill T. Kline, Officer-in-Charge of \n     Port Chicago, issued a statement praising the African \n     American enlisted men and stating that ``the men displayed \n     creditable coolness and bravery under those emergency \n     conditions''; and\n       Whereas, after the disaster, white sailors were given 30 \n     days' leave to visit their families--according to survivors, \n     this was the standard for soldiers involved in a disaster--\n     while only African American sailors were ordered back to work \n     the next day to clean and remove human remains; and\n       Whereas, after the disaster, the preparation of Mare Island \n     for the arrival of African American sailors included moving \n     the barracks of white sailors away from the loading area in \n     order to be clear of the ships being loaded in case of \n     another explosion; and\n       Whereas, the survivors and new personnel who later were \n     ordered to return to loading ammunition expressed their \n     opposition, citing the possibility of another explosion; the \n     first confrontation occurred on August 9 when 328 men from \n     three divisions were ordered out to the loading pier; the \n     great majority of the men balked, and eventually 258 were \n     arrested and confined for three days on a large barge tiered \n     to the pier; and\n       Whereas, fifty of these men were selected as the ring-\n     leaders and charged with mutiny, and on October 24, 1944, \n     after only 80 minutes of a military court, all 50 men were \n     found guilty of mutiny--10 were sentenced to 15 years in \n     prison, 24 sentenced to 12 years, 11 sentenced to 10 years, \n     and five sentenced to eight years; and all were to be \n     dishonorably discharged from the Navy; and\n       Whereas, after a massive outcry the next year, in January \n     1946, 47 of the Port Chicago men were released from prison \n     and ``exiled'' for one year overseas before returning to \n     their families; and\n       Whereas, in a 1994 investigation, the United States Navy \n     stated that ``there is no doubt that racial prejudice was \n     responsible for the posting of only African American enlisted \n     personnel to loading divisions at Port Chicago''; and\n       Whereas, in the 1994 investigation, the United States Navy, \n     prompted by Members of Congress, admitted that the routine \n     assignment of only African American enlisted personnel to \n     manual labor was clearly motivated by race; now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the Assembly of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California respectfully memorializes the Congress and the \n     President of the United States to act to vindicate the \n     sailors unjustly blamed for, and the sailors convicted of \n     mutiny following, the Port Chicago disaster, and to rectify \n     any mistreatment by the military of those sailors; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, \n     and each Senator and Representative from California in the \n     Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-396.

As any new product matures, competitors using overseas labor \ncan frequently find a way to undercut our production prices. We \nmaintain our lead by constantly improving our products through \nencouragement of innovation.\n  The majority of new products require industrial research and \ndevelopment to reach the market stage. I want to encourage that \nresearch and development to create new products to ensure that our \nfactories stay busy and that our workforce stays fully employed at high \nsalaried jobs. I want more of our large multi-national companies to \nselect the United States as the location for their R R done here \ncreates American jobs. And frequently the benefits of R in one area \napply in another area; I want those spin-off benefits in this country, \ntoo.\n  The federal government has used the Research Tax Credit to encourage \ncompanies to perform research. But many studies document that the \npresent form of this Tax Credit is not providing as much stimulation to \nindustrial R as it could. Today, I introduce legislation to improve \nthe Research Tax Credit.\n  The single most important change I'm proposing in the Research Tax \nCredit is to make it permanent. The credit has never been permanent, \nsince Congress created it in 1981. Many studies point out that the \ntemporary nature of the Credit has prevented companies from building \ncareful research strategies. A recent study by Coopers and Lybrand \nclaimed a $41 billion stimulus for the economy by 2010, with $13 \nbillion added to the economy's productive capacity by 2010. Many of my \nSenate colleagues have endorsed legislation that includes this critical \naction, more than twenty at last count.\n  My legislative proposal goes further. The current Credit references a \ncompany's research intensity back to their level in the 1984-88 time \nperiod. That time period is too outdated to meet today's dynamic market \nconditions. Many companies now are operating in dramatically different \nmarkets, many with totally new product lines. My legislation allows a \ncompany to choose a four year period in the last ten years that best \nmatches their own needs. This allows companies to tailor and optimize \nresearch strategies to match current market conditions.\n  The current approach has a provision that severely restricts the \nability of many start-up companies to benefit from the full impact of \nthe Credit. Recent analysis shows that 5 out of 6 start-up companies \nreceive reduced benefits because of a provision that limits their \nallowable increase in research expenditures to half of their current \nexpenditures. I'm concerned when start-up companies aren't receiving \nfull benefit from this Credit. These are just the companies that tend \nto drive the innovative cycle in this country, they are the ones that \nfrequently bring out the newest leading-edge products. My legislation \nallows start up companies for their first ten years to take full credit \nfor their increases in research costs.\n  My legislation addresses several other shortcomings in the current \nCredit. Now there is a Basic Research Credit'' allowed, but rarely \nused. It is defined to include only research with ``no commercial \ninterest.'' Now, I don't know too many companies that want to support--\nmuch less admit to their stockholders that they are supporting--\nresearch with no commercial interest. The idea of this clause was to \nencourage support of long term research; the kind that benefits far \nmore than just the next product improvement. This is the kind of \nresearch that can enable a whole new product or service. We need to \nencourage this long term research. My legislation adds an incentive for \nthis type of research by including any research that is done for a \nconsortium of U.S. companies or any research that is destined for open \nliterature publication. These two additions will include a lot more \nlong term research that has future product applications. I've also \nallowed this credit to apply to research done in national labs, so \ncompanies can select the best source of research for any particular \nproject.\n  And finally my legislation recognizes the importance of encouraging \ncompanies to use research capabilities wherever they exist in the \ncountry, whether\n\n[[Page S4824]]\n\nin other businesses, universities, or national labs. The current credit \ndisallows 35% of all expenses invested in research performed under an \nexternal contract--my legislation allows all such expenses to apply \ntowards the Credit. This should encourage creation of partnerships, \nwhere different partners can leverage their individual strengths. These \npartnerships enable our companies to perform research more efficiently, \nthat can further strengthen our economy.\n  In summary, Mr. President, this proposed Bill significantly \nstrengthens incentives for private companies to undertake search that \nleads to new processes, new services, and new products. The result is \nstronger companies that are better positioned for global competition. \nThose stronger companies will hire more people at higher salaries with \nreal benefits to our national economy and workforce.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. Allard):\n  S. 2073. A bill to authorize appropriations for the National Center \nfor Missing and Exploited Children; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n         the national center for missing and exploited children\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children Authorization Act of 1998. \nThis bill recognizes the outstanding record of achievements of this \noutstanding organization and will enable NCMEC to provide even greater \nprotection of our Nation's children in the future.\n  As part of the Missing Children's Assistance Act, the Office of \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention has selected and given \ngrants to the Center for the last 14 years to operate a national \nresource center located in Arlington, Virginia and a national 24-hour \ntoll-free telephone line. The Center provides invaluable assistance and \ntraining to law enforcement around the country in cases of missing and \nexploited children. The Center's record is quite impressive, and its \nefforts have led directly to a significant increase in the percentage \nof missing children who are recovered safely.\n  In fiscal year 1998, the Center received an earmark of $6.9 million \nin the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State Appropriations \nconference report. In addition, the Center's Jimmy Ryce Training Center \nreceived 1.185M in this report.\n  This legislation directs OJJDP to make a grant to the Center and \nauthorizes appropriations up to $10 million in fiscal years 1999 \nthrough 2003. The authorization would, of course, be subject to \nappropriations. The bill thus continues and formalizes NCMEC's long \npartnership with the Justice Department and OJJDP.\n  NCMEC's exemplary record of performance and success, as demonstrated \nby the fact that NCMEC's recovery rate has climbed from 62% to 91%, \njustifies action by Congress to formally recognize it as the nation's \nofficial missing and exploited children's center, and to authorize a \nline-item appropriation. This bill will enable the Center to focus \ncompletely on its missions, without expending the annual effort to \nobtain authority and grants from OJJDP. It also will allow the Center \nto expand its longer-term arrangements with domestic and foreign law \nenforcement entities. By providing an authorization, the bill also will \nallow for better congressional oversight of the Center.\n  The record of the Center, described briefly below, demonstrates the \nappropriateness of this authorization.\n  For fourteen years the Center has served as the national resource \ncenter and clearinghouse mandated by the Missing Children's Assistance \nAct. The Center has worked in partnership with the Department of \nJustice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of \nTreasury, the State Department, and many other federal and state \nagencies in the effort to find missing children and prevent child \nvictimization.\n  The trust the federal government has placed in NCMEC, a private, non-\nprofit corporation, is evidenced by its unique access to the FBI's \nNational Crime Information Center, and the National Law Enforcement \nTelecommunications System (NLETS).\n  NCMEC has utilized the latest in technology, such as operating the \nNational Child Pornography Tipline, establishing its new Internet \nwebsite, www.missingkids.com, which is linked with hundreds of other \nwebsites to provide real-time images of breaking cases of missing \nchildren, and, beginning this year, establishing a new CyberTipline on \nchild exploitation.\n  NCMEC has established a national and increasingly worldwide network, \nlinking NCMEC online with each of the missing children clearinghouses \noperated by the 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. In \naddition, NCMEC works constantly with international law enforcement \nauthorities such as Scotland Yard in the United Kingdom, the Royal \nCanadian Mounted Police, INTERPOL headquarters in Lyon, France, and \nothers. This network enables NCMEC to transmit images and information \nregarding missing children to law enforcement across America and around \nthe world instantly. NCMEC also serves as the U.S. State Department's \nrepresentative at child abduction cases under the Hague Convention.\n  The record of NCMEC is demonstrated by the 1,203,974 calls received \nat its 24-hour toll-free hotline, 1(800)THE LOST, the 146,284 law \nenforcement, criminal/juvenile justice, and healthcare professionals \ntrained, the 15,491,344 free publications distributed, and, most \nimportantly, by its work on 59,481 cases of missing children, which has \nresulted in the recovery of 40,180 children.\n  NCMEC is a shining example of the type of public-private partnership \nthe Congress should encourage and recognize. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation, which would help improve the performance of \nthe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and thus the \nsafety of our Nation's children.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2073\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) For 14 years, the National Center for Missing and \n     Exploited Children (referred to in this section as the \n     ``Center'') has--\n       (A) served as the national resource center and \n     clearinghouse congressionally mandated under the provisions \n     of the Missing Children's Assistance Act of 1984; and\n       (B) worked in partnership with the Department of Justice, \n     the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of the \n     Treasury, the Department of State, and many other agencies in \n     the effort to find missing children and prevent child \n     victimization.\n       (2) Congress has given the Center, which is a private non-\n     profit corporation, unique powers and resources, such as \n     having access to the National Crime Information Center of the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the National Law \n     Enforcement Telecommunications System.\n       (3) Since 1987, the Center has operated the National Child \n     Pornography Tipline, in conjunction with the United States \n     Customs Service and the United States Postal Inspection \n     Service and, beginning this year, the Center established a \n     new CyberTipline on child exploitation, thus becoming ``the \n     911 for the Internet''.\n       (4) In light of statistics that time is of the essence in \n     cases of child abduction, the Director of the Federal Bureau \n     of Investigation in February of 1997 created a new NCIC child \n     abduction (``CA'') flag to provide the Center immediate \n     notification in the most serious cases, resulting in 642 \n     ``CA'' notifications to the Center and helping the Center to \n     have its highest recovery rate in history.\n       (5) The Center has established a national and increasingly \n     worldwide network, linking the Center online with each of the \n     missing children clearinghouses operated by the 50 States, \n     the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, as well as with \n     Scotland Yard in the United Kingdom, the Royal Canadian \n     Mounted Police, INTERPOL headquarters in Lyon, France, and \n     others, which has enabled the Center to transmit images and \n     information regarding missing children to law enforcement \n     across the United States and around the world instantly.\n       (6) From its inception in 1984 through March 31, 1998, the \n     Center has--\n       (A) handled 1,203,974 calls through its 24-hour toll-free \n     hotline (1-800-THE-LOST) and currently averages 700 calls per \n     day;\n       (B) trained 146,284 law enforcement, criminal and juvenile \n     justice, and healthcare professionals in child sexual \n     exploitation and missing child case detection, \n     identification, investigation, and prevention;\n       (C) disseminated 15,491,344 free publications to citizens \n     and professionals; and\n       (D) worked with law enforcement on the cases of 59,481 \n     missing children, resulting in the recovery of 40,180 \n     children.\n\n[[Page S4825]]\n\n       (7) The demand for the services of the Center is growing \n     dramatically, as evidenced by the fact that in 1997, the \n     Center handled 129,100 calls, an all-time record, and by the \n     fact that its new Internet website (www.missingkids.com) \n     receives 1,500,000 ``hits'' every day, and is linked with \n     hundreds of other websites to provide real-time images of \n     breaking cases of missing children, helping to cause such \n     results as a police officer in Puerto Rico searching the \n     Center's website and working with the Center to identify and \n     recover a child abducted as an infant from her home in San \n     Diego, California, 7 years earlier.\n       (8) In 1997, the Center provided policy training to 256 \n     police chiefs and sheriffs from 50 States and Guam at its new \n     Jimmy Ryce Law Enforcement Training Center.\n       (9) The programs of the Center have had a remarkable \n     impact, such as in the fight against infant abductions in \n     partnership with the healthcare industry, during which the \n     Center has performed 668 onsite hospital walk-throughs and \n     inspections, and trained 45,065 hospital administrators, \n     nurses, and security personnel, and thereby helped to reduce \n     infant abductions in the United States by 82 percent.\n       (10) The Center is now playing a leading role in \n     international child abduction cases, serving as a \n     representative of the Department of State at cases under The \n     Hague Convention, and successfully resolving the cases of 343 \n     international child abductions, and providing greater support \n     to parents in the United States.\n       (11) The Center is a model of public/private partnership, \n     raising private sector funds to match congressional \n     appropriations and receiving extensive private in-kind \n     support, including advanced technology provided by the \n     computer industry such as imaging technology used to age the \n     photographs of long-term missing children and to reconstruct \n     facial images of unidentified deceased children.\n       (12) The Center was 1 of only 10 of 300 major national \n     charities given an A+ grade in 1997 by the American Institute \n     of Philanthropy.\n       (13) In light of its impressive history, the Center has \n     been redesignated as the Nation's missing children \n     clearinghouse and resource center once every 3 years through \n     a competitive selection process conducted by the Office of \n     Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention of the Department \n     of Justice, and has received grants from that Office to \n     conduct the crucial purposes of the Center.\n       (14) An official congressional authorization will increase \n     the level of scrutiny and oversight by Congress and continue \n     the Center's long partnership with the Department of Justice \n     and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention \n     of the Department of Justice.\n       (15) The exemplary record of performance and success of the \n     Center, as exemplified by the fact that the Center's recovery \n     rate has climbed from 62 to 91 percent, justifies action by \n     Congress to formally recognize the National Center for \n     Missing and Exploited Children as the Nation's official \n     missing and exploited children's center, and to authorize a \n     line-item appropriation for the National Center for Missing \n     and Exploited Children in the Federal budget.\n\n     SEC. 2. NATIONAL CENTER FOR MISSING AND EXPLOITED CHILDREN.\n\n       (a) Grants.--The Administrator of the Office of Juvenile \n     Justice and Delinquency Prevention of the Department of \n     Justice shall annually make a grant to the National Center \n     for Missing and Exploited Children, which shall be used to--\n       (1) operate the official national resource center and \n     information clearinghouse for missing and exploited children;\n       (2) provide to State and local governments, public and \n     private nonprofit agencies, and individuals, information \n     regarding--\n       (A) free or low-cost legal, restaurant, lodging, and \n     transportation services that are available for the benefit of \n     missing and exploited children and their families; and\n       (B) the existence and nature of programs being carried out \n     by Federal agencies to assist missing and exploited children \n     and their families;\n       (3) coordinate public and private programs that locate, \n     recover, or reunite missing children with their families;\n       (4) disseminate, on a national basis, information relating \n     to innovative and model programs, services, and legislation \n     that benefit missing and exploited children;\n       (5) provide technical assistance and training to law \n     enforcement agencies, State, and local governments, elements \n     of the criminal justice system, public and private nonprofit \n     agencies, and individuals in the prevention, investigation, \n     prosecution, and treatment of cases involving missing and \n     exploited children; and\n       (6) provide assistance to families and law enforcement \n     agencies in locating and recovering missing and exploited \n     children, both nationally and internationally.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Administrator to carry out this \n     section, $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1999, 2000, \n     2001, 2002, and 2003.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 2074: A bill to guarantee for all Americans, quality, affordable, \nand comprehensive health care coverage; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                         healthy americans act\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Healthy Americans \nAct. Colleagues will be hearing more about it because there will be \namendments that I will offer on this subject here on the floor of the \nSenate; and with every bit of ability I have as a Senator, I will push \nthis piece of legislation here and talk about it in my State of \nMinnesota and around the country.\n  The Healthy Americans Act insures the uninsured; guarantees \naffordable, comprehensive insurance for all, and ensures quality health \ncare through its patient protection provisions.\n  Let me start out by providing some context, Mr. President. I have two \ncharts beside me to demonstrate my points. In 1987, we had about 32 \nmillion Americans who were uninsured. Today, as you can see from this \ngraph beside me, we are up to close to 45 million Americans who are \nuninsured. Mr. President, since we debated the subject of universal \nhealth care coverage several years ago, a debate both of us were very \ninvolved in, we have had about a million more people a year who have \nbeen dropped from coverage.\n  Assuming the same economic growth with no economic downturn, which is \na very rosy assumption, we will continue to see this same kind of a \nprofile where we will get up pretty close to 48 million Americans by \nthe year 2005 who will have no health insurance coverage.\n  So this is still a crisis for many Americans, and this is an issue \nthat walks into the living rooms of many families and stares them in \nthe face.\n  The second chart shows the actual percent of annual family income, on \naverage, that goes to premiums and out-of-pocket payments in the form \nof deductibles, copays or other amounts of money that people have to \nspend on health care. It is, I think, very important to look at this.\n  First, what you see is that at the bottom end of the income ladder, \nfamilies with annual incomes of $30,000 or less are spending an \ninordinate, and I would say unaffordable, percent of their income for \ntheir health care. If you look at families with incomes between $10,000 \nand $20,000, you can see they are spending on average 8 percent of \ntheir income on health care expenses. Then when you look at families \nwith incomes under $10,000, you can see that the average family is \npaying well over 20 percent of their annual income, and these are the \npeople who can least afford to make that kind of payment.\n  Next, you can see that for families with annual incomes of $30,000 or \nmore, the average amount of that income spent on premiums, deductibles \nand copays drops to below 5 percent on average--I would say a more \naffordable amount. But don't forget these are just averages. Many \nfamilies at every income level are spending more than 10 percent of \ntheir family income on health care, especially if someone in the family \nhas a serious illness. That is not affordable. That is not fair.\n  Now if we look back at the same chart we can see what would happen \nunder the Healthy Americans Act. All Americans would pay what they can \nafford--people should pay what they can afford--but it will be well \nwithin their means. For those hardest-pressed families, people would \npay no more than \\1/2\\ percent of their income. Those with higher \nincomes would pay no more than 3 or 5 percent; and no family, including \nthose with at the highest income levels, would pay above 7 percent of \ntheir annual income for health care.\n  So, Mr. President, as you can see, these two charts demonstrate the \nneed to provide coverage for the uninsured and to make health care \ncoverage affordable for all.\n  The Healthy Americans Act does just that. First of all, it covers the \nuninsured, which I think is the first and most important thing to do. \nIt builds, I say to my colleague from Indiana, on existing State \nprograms. This is universal coverage with maximum flexibility. In \naddition to covering the uninsured, many of them moderate-income and \nlow-income citizens, we are going to make sure that health care \ncoverage is affordable for all citizens.\n  In other words, we are going to have family protection. So, first, we \ncover the uninsured. Then we have family protection, and we say no \nfamily pays more than 7 percent of family income on health care, and it \ngoes from about\n\n[[Page S4826]]\n\n0.5 percent to 7 percent depending on income. We include Medicare \nrecipients as well. The income profile of elderly people is not that \nhigh and they need income protection, too.\n  So, again, first, we cover the uninsured, expanding existing \nprograms; second, we have protection for family income; third, we make \nsure there is a good package of benefits comparable to what we have \nhere in the Congress; fourth of all, we have strong consumer \nprotections, strong patient protections, something we have been talking \nabout every day; fifth of all, we expand coverage to include some \nneeded benefits that are long overdue.\n\n  In Minnesota, and around the country--it could very well be the case \nin Indiana, Mr. President--a lot of elderly people are paying well over \n30 percent of their monthly income just on prescription drug costs. We \ncover prescription drug costs and add that benefit to Medicare. We have \ngood, strong mental health parity, and substance abuse coverage as \nwell. And this is, I think, really important.\n  The way all of this comes together for the States is to have a \nmaximum amount of flexibility. And what we are essentially saying to \nStates is, ``Look, here is what we decided in the Senate. We are going \nto make sure the uninsured are covered. That is phase one. The second \nthing, we are going to make sure there is protection of family income. \nThe third thing is we are going to make sure there is a good package of \nbenefits, at least as good as what we have in the Congress. The fourth \nthing that we are going to do is make sure there is good, strong \npatient protection. If you agree to that, States, there will be Federal \nmoney that will go to you on a, roughly speaking, 70-30 matching basis. \nAnd you decide how you want to do it. In other words, the funds are \nthere for you to use if you agree to lay out a plan for universal, \naffordable, comprehensive health care and follow it over the next 4 \nyears. This is a good strategy for going into the next century; it is a \ngood strategy for reaching universal coverage in our country.'' We are \noffering the States a carrot; not a stick.\n  No State has to do it. There is maximum flexibility. I say to my \ncolleague from Indiana--we are friends even though we do not always \nagree on issues--we will not have this ideological debate about single \npayer or ``pay or play'' and all these other things that people do not \nunderstand. This piece of legislation, the Healthy Americans Act, \nleaves it up to the States.\n  This legislation says to Minnesota, let us expand. We are already \nabove 90 percent on the number insured in my State. Let us expand the \ncoverage for these people who still have no insurance. Let us have some \nprotection of family income, a very big issue for a lot of people who \nare covered but they are paying way more than they can afford, \nespecially when you include the deductibles and copays and the \npremiums.\n  What we are saying to Minnesota or Indiana or California or New York: \nLet us cover the uninsured. We can build on what you are already doing \nwith the State Children's Health Insurance Plan, by expanding it to \nadults and more children. Let us make sure there is family income \nprotection. Let us make sure there is patient protection and a good \npackage of benefits that is comprehensive. And you decide how you want \nto do it. You decide how you want to do it in Indiana. You decide how \nyou want to do it in Minnesota or California or New York or North \nCarolina or Florida or New Hampshire or Iowa--you name it. You decide \nhow you want to do it.\n  But the point is, if a State wants to participate--and I think most \nStates will be very interested in participating in this piece of \nlegislation--then there will be Federal grant money that will come on, \nroughly speaking, a 70-30 matching basis.\n  Mr. President, I would like to talk a little bit about the cost of \nthis, because I do not want to introduce a piece of legislation and \ntreat people in the United States of America as if they do not have \nintelligence. If we think something is important, then we invest in it. \nThis piece of legislation, as we have costed it out and done our \nactuarial estimates, goes like this: In the first year--we are just \ntrying to cover the uninsured--it will be $42 billion; year two, it \ngets up to $48 billion; year three, $62 billion; years four and five--\nwhen we include both coverage for the uninsured and now also providing \nthe family income protection, it gets up to $85 billion, and then, $98 \nbillion.\n\n  You would add an additional, roughly speaking, $26 billion to $39 \nbillion to that estimate in the last 2 years if you are going to cover \nMedicare recipients, making sure they do not pay more than 7 percent of \nannual income for health care coverage and making sure that \nprescription drug costs are covered. Now, I say to colleagues, the \nmaximum gets to be above $100 billion--we have estimated this to be \n$137 billion at the very end of this 5 year period.\n  How do we pay for this? I will tell you. We have hundreds of billions \nof dollars of what many of us have called corporate welfare, a variety \nof different deductions and tax breaks, many of which I do not believe \nare necessary. In addition, we have some military weaponry that I think \nthere is a very legitimate debate as to whether or not we need to be \nspending money on some of these items. And in addition, we take a look \nat some of the domestic programs that I think people can call into \nquestion as to whether or not they are essential.\n  But, Mr. President, my point is that we offset the expenditure. We \nare not talking about taxpayers paying any more money. But what we are \nsaying is that this is a worthwhile investment. We have a GDP of over \n$8 trillion, we have an economy at its peak performance, and we are \nbeing told that we cannot have universal health care coverage in the \nUnited States of America? We are being told that we cannot afford to \nmake sure that every man, woman, and child has decent coverage? That \nthere cannot be some protection of family income? That the uninsured \ncan't be insured? That elderly people aren't able to get the care they \nneed? That some patient protection for the people isn't possible? That \nis not acceptable. Of course it is possible. Of course we can do this. \nOf course we can do better as a nation. And that is what this piece of \nlegislation says, Mr. President.\n  I just say to colleagues again that I have been disappointed that we \nhave put this issue of universal coverage off the table. It should be \nput back on the table. I have had so many conversations with people in \nMinnesota, poignant conversations--it happens in other parts of the \ncountry, too--which are about health care. I will just give but one \nexample. I think I may have given it one time before on the floor. But, \nafter all, the legislation we introduce is all about people's lives. \nWhy else should we be here? It is all about, hopefully, improving \npeople's lives.\n  I will never forget a discussion with a woman whose husband I had met \na year earlier. When I met him a year earlier, he was in bad shape. He \nis a young man, maybe 40 at most, a railroad worker struggling with \ncancer. And then I met her a year later out at a farm gathering, and \nshe came up to me and she said, ``I want you to come over and meet my \nhusband again, Senator'' or ``Paul.'' ``He's a real fighter. The doctor \nsaid he only had 3 months to live, but it's a year later and he's still \nstruggling. He's now in a wheelchair.'' And so we talked.\n  Then she took me aside, and she said, ``Every day is a living hell. \nEvery day I'm battling with these companies to find out what they're \ngoing to cover.''\n  I do not think any American with a loved one who is struggling with \nan illness or a sickness should have to worry about whether or not \nthere is going to be decent coverage. I think that is unacceptable. I \nthink we can do better in America. I think it is time again to talk \nabout humane, affordable, dignified health care for every man, woman, \nand child. That is what this Healthy Americans Act does.\n  I love ideas. I am really interested in policy. I am proud of the \npeople who have helped me on this legislation: Dr. John Gilman in my \noffice; Rick Brown, who is with the UCLA School of Public Health; \nDoctors Nicole Lurie and Steve Miles from Minnesota.\n  I like the fact that the Healthy Americans Act is a decentralized \nplan. I like that. I like the fact that it is simple. I like the fact \nthat it gives States a lot of leeway, so different States can try \ndifferent approaches, and we can see what works best.\n  But we do have here, colleagues, a commitment as a nation to make \nsure\n\n[[Page S4827]]\n\nthose people who are uninsured have health insurance, to make sure \nfamilies do not go broke and are able to afford health insurance, to \nmake sure it is a package of benefits as good as what we have. \nShouldn't the people we represent have as good health care coverage as \nMembers of the Congress have, and shouldn't they be guaranteed strong \npatient protections?\n  I think this is, in my not so humble opinion, an excellent piece of \nlegislation. I think it is going to take a real battle to get it \npassed. But I will bring amendments out on the floor. I will do \neverything I can as a U.S. Senator to bring this to people in the \ncountry. I am absolutely convinced that this is one of the most \nimportant things we can do as a Senate to respond to a very real issue \nthat affects the lives of so many people we represent.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT (for himself and Mr. McConnell)\n  S. 2075. A bill to provide for expedited review of executive \nprivilege claims and to improve efficiency of independent counsel \ninvestigations; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                    executive privilege legislation\n\n  S. 2076. A bill to provide reporting requirements for the assertion \nof executive privilege, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                the executive accountability act of 1998\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today in order to introduce two \nbills designed to address the abuse and misuse of executive privilege \nby the President, the Executive Accountability Act of 1998 and a \ncompanion bill designed to expedite appeals of executive privilege \nclaims asserted in independent counsel investigations. I want to thank \nSenator McConnell who has joined me as a co-sponsor of both these \nmeasures.\n  Executive privilege is just that--a privilege extended to the \nPresident, and the President alone, to be invoked in those rare \ncircumstances in which the President must keep discussions about \nofficial acts secret from the courts, Congress and the American people \nin order to protect national security.\n  This President has abused this privilege. He has used it as a \ndelaying tactic to try to shield the details of unofficial acts having \nnothing to do with national security, but everything to do with Mr. \nClinton's personal legal problems. As I detailed in a letter to my \ncolleagues back in March, the President's current claim of executive \nprivilege is legally baseless. I would ask that that letter be included \nin the record.\n  Part and parcel of the President's abuse of executive privilege is \nhis unwillingness to acknowledge the mere fact that he has asserted the \nprivilege. Indeed, the President's lawyers recently have attacked the \nIndependent Counsel's office for acknowledging the Court's entirely \npredictable rejection of the President's assertion of executive \nprivilege. Apparently, the President wants to be able to assert the \nprivilege and have a court rule on it, all without the knowledge of \nCongress or the American people.\n  This is an affront to Congress and the public. Congress has a vital \ninterest in the development of the law of executive privilege. Until \nthis Administration, grand jury investigations into presidential \ncommunications were rare. Congressional oversight hearings, by \ncontrast, are commonplace. But Congress will have to live with whatever \nrules the courts develop concerning the scope of executive privilege. \nWithout notice that the President is raising these claims, Congress \ncannot protect its interests by filing amicus briefs.\n\n  The President's covert assertion of executive privilege is of concern \nnot just to Congress but to every citizen. Although a limited executive \nprivilege is necessary to protect national security, the privilege is \ncontrary to the public's right to know. As a consequence, asserting the \nprivilege has historically come with a political cost. President \nClinton has tried to enjoy the benefits of the privilege while avoiding \nthese costs. We should ensure that if a President takes the \nextraordinary step of asserting executive privilege that he not be able \nto keep that action from the American people.\n  The Executive Accountability Act of 1998 addresses the problem of the \ncovert use of executive privilege through the simple expedient of \nrequiring full disclosure. If the President decides to invoke the \nprivilege in court, both the President and the presiding judge must \ndisclose that fact to Congress. If the court rules on a claim of \nexecutive privilege, the court must inform Congress. If the President \ndecides to appeal an adverse ruling on a claim of executive privilege, \nhe must also disclose that fact to Congress. If the Attorney General \nprovides a written opinion concerning the validity of the privilege, \nthat too should be shared with the Congress. Finally, the Act confirms \nthat any Member of Congress has the capacity to file an amicus brief in \nany judicial proceeding in which the President asserts executive \nprivilege. The legislation also builds in protections to ensure that \nnone of these disclosures endangers national security.\n  I am also introducing a companion bill to address the President's \nmisuse of executive privilege as a delaying tactic to try to run out \nthe clock on the Independent Counsel's investigation. The bill would \nprovide for expedited review of such claims and for a direct appeal to \nthe Supreme Court. Hopefully, this provision will remove the temptation \nto use executive privilege claims as delaying tactics, and will force \nthe President to think twice before asserting a spurious claim of \nprivilege.\n  When properly confined to official acts affecting national security, \nexecutive privilege serves an important function. But when abused as a \ndelaying tactic or to protect unofficial acts, the privilege in its \ndistorted form becomes an unacceptable impediment to the public's right \nto know. These two bills impose accountability requirements on the \nexecutive to ensure that the privilege is used in an appropriate way. \nMr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2075\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AMENDMENT TO TITLE 28.\n\n       Section 594 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(m) Judicial Review of Executive Privilege Claims.--\n       ``(1) Expedited consideration.--It shall be the duty of a \n     district court of the United States and the Supreme Court of \n     the United States to advance on the docket and to expedite to \n     the maximum extent practicable the disposition of any claim \n     asserting executive privilege in any investigation authorized \n     pursuant to this chapter.\n       ``(2) Appeal to supreme court.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, any order of a district court of the United \n     States disposing of a claim asserting executive privilege in \n     any investigation authorized pursuant to this chapter shall \n     be reviewable by appeal directly to the Supreme Court of the \n     United States. Any such appeal shall be taken by a notice of \n     appeal filed within 10 calendar days after such order is \n     entered and the jurisdictional statement shall be filed \n     within 30 calendar days after such order is entered.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Grand jury investigations into Presidential \n     communications have been, to date, extraordinary and rare \n     occurrences, and hopefully, will remain that way. \n     Congressional oversight hearings, by contrast, are \n     commonplace.\n       (2) If judicial decisions permit presidential aides to \n     withhold crucial information from a grand jury investigating \n     criminal misconduct, congressional inquiries will be stymied \n     by similar claims of executive privilege.\n       (3) For these reasons, the proper scope of executive \n     privilege is of concern to every\n\n[[Page S4828]]\n\n     Member of Congress, and every Member of Congress has an \n     interest in being notified of assertions of executive \n     privilege by the President and in having the opportunity to \n     file amicus briefs in appropriate cases.\n       (4) In the context of the current litigation before Judge \n     Norma Holloway Johnson, the President failed to acknowledge \n     publicly that he asserted executive privilege to shield \n     information from the grand jury.\n       (5) Indeed, lawyers for the President have protested that \n     the outcome of Judge Johnson's order rejecting the \n     President's claim of executive privilege became public.\n       (6) As a consequence, Members of Congress have not had a \n     proper basis to decide whether to file amicus briefs \n     apprising the court of the unique interests and views of \n     Congress with respect to executive privilege.\n\n     SEC. 3. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Initial Report.--Whenever the President asserts \n     executive privilege in a judicial action or proceeding, the \n     President shall promptly report to Congress and provide an \n     explanation of the reasons for such assertion in such detail \n     as is consistent with national security.\n       (b) Report by Presiding Judge of Assertion.--Whenever, in a \n     judicial action or proceeding, the President asserts \n     executive privilege, it shall be the duty of the presiding \n     judicial officer in that action or proceeding promptly to \n     report the assertion to Congress.\n       (c) Report by Presiding Judge of Disposition.--Whenever in \n     a judicial action or proceeding, the President asserts \n     executive privilege, it shall be the duty of the presiding \n     judicial officer in that action or proceeding promptly to \n     report to Congress any order or ruling disposing of that \n     claim and provide an explanation of the reasons for such \n     disposition in such detail as is consistent with national \n     security.\n       (d) Amicus Briefs.--Any Member of either House of Congress \n     shall have the right to file an amicus brief, regarding an \n     assertion of executive privilege by the President, in any \n     judicial action or proceeding in which that assertion is \n     made.\n       (e) Report Concerning Decision To Appeal.--Whenever the \n     President decides to appeal an adverse disposition of a claim \n     of executive privilege or to file a petition for certiorari \n     in response to such adverse disposition, the President shall \n     promptly report the decision to Congress.\n       (f) Additional Requirement.--Whenever the President asserts \n     executive privilege in any forum, the President shall forward \n     to Congress any written legal opinion regarding the \n     lawfulness of the assertion redacted as is consistent with \n     national security.\n       (g) Report to Congress.--For purposes of this Act, \n     providing notice or a report to the Senate Majority and \n     Minority Leaders and the Speaker of the House and House \n     Minority Leader shall constitute notice to Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Colleague: The newspapers and talk shows have been \n     filled for the past few weeks with discussion of executive \n     privilege. First, there were reports of the President's \n     decision to invoke the privilege to prevent several of his \n     aides from testifying before the grand jury. Now it has been \n     reported that the President has argued that his executive \n     privilege extends to discussions between presidential aides \n     and the First Lady. Many commentators appear to assume that \n     executive privilege applies to these communications and have \n     focused on the prudence of the President's decision to invoke \n     the privilege in light of the parallels to Watergate. I will \n     leave that question for the pundits. The more pressing \n     question for the Congress is whether executive privilege has \n     any application at all to this situation.\n       Grand jury investigations into Presidential communications \n     are extraordinary and rare occurrences, and hopefully, will \n     remain that way. Congressional oversight hearings, by \n     contrast, are commonplace. If the President's aides are \n     permitted to withhold crucial information from a grand jury \n     investigating criminal misconduct, we can rest assured that \n     congressional inquiries will be stymied by similar claims of \n     executive privilege. For this reason, the proper scope of \n     executive privilege is of concern to every member of \n     Congress.\n       As Chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee, I have \n     inquired into the law of executive privilege as developed by \n     the courts. Although for years the body of caselaw did not \n     extend much beyond Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in the \n     criminal trial of Aaron Burr, a number of decisions in the \n     last quarter century have clarified the relatively modest \n     scope of executive privilege. A number of critical principles \n     emerge from these cases.\n       Executive privilege extends only to communications made in \n     relation to official responsibilities. The privilege does not \n     cover unofficial acts. ``[The privilege is] limited to \n     communications in performance of [a President's] \n     responsibilities of his office and made in the process of \n     shaping policies and making decisions.'' Nixon v. \n     Administrator of the GSA, 433 U.S. 425, 449 (1977); see also \n     United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 715 (1974).\n       Even if executive privilege applies to a communication, it \n     generally does not prevent disclosure to a grand jury. ``The \n     generalized assertion of privilege must yield to the \n     demonstrated, specific need for evidence in a pending \n     criminal trial.'' United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 713 \n     (1974).\n       The sole exception is for communications concerning \n     national security. The Court in United States v. Nixon \n     indicated that the scope of any absolute executive privilege \n     would be limited to ``military or diplomatic secrets.'' 418 \n     U.S. at 710. Outside this context, even a valid claim of \n     executive privilege cannot keep presidential communications \n     from the grand jury as long as the conversations are \n     ``preliminarily shown to have some bearing on the pending \n     criminal cases.'' Id. at 713.\n       I hope you find this summary helpful. For my part, these \n     well-established principles lead me to believe that the \n     President is on tenuous legal ground in asserting executive \n     privilege. In order for his claim to prevail, he first would \n     have to show that the discussions he had with aides \n     concerning how to respond to allegations of sexual misconduct \n     in his private life qualify as official government acts. I \n     sincerely doubt he could make such a showing, especially in \n     light of his asserted ability to compartmentalize his private \n     life from the affairs of state.\n       However, even if he made such a showing, the President \n     would still need either to demonstrate that the \n     communications concerned ``military or diplomatic secrets,'' \n     or to convince a court that the information is neither \n     necessary nor relevant to the grand jury's investigation. The \n     President seems unlikely to prevail on either issue. Although \n     there is some dispute as to the exact nature of the \n     demonstration of relevance or need that the prosecutor must \n     make, even the most demanding opinion on the subject states \n     that the prosecution ``will be able easily to explain'' why \n     it should have access to privileged presidential \n     communications when the President and his close aids are the \n     subject of the criminal investigation. See In re Sealed Case, \n     121 F.3d 729, 755 (D.C. Cir. 1997).\n       In the end, it seems quite likely that the President's \n     claim of executive privilege will share the fate of this \n     administration's other novel theories of privilege, which \n     caused delay, but ultimately were rejected by the courts. \n     First, the President asserted a novel immunity from civil \n     suit that, in his view, extended even to cases of private \n     misconduct occurring before he took the presidential oath of \n     office. The Supreme Court rejected that claim 9-0. See \n     Clinton v. Jones, 117 S. Ct. 1636 (1997). Then the \n     administration asserted a novel theory of government \n     attorney-client privilege, which would treat taxpayer-\n     financed government attorneys just like private attorneys for \n     purposes of the attorney-client privilege. The Eighth Circuit \n     Court of Appeals rejected that argument, concluding that \n     allowing the White House ``to use its in-house attorneys as a \n     shield against the production of information relevant to a \n     federal criminal investigation would represent a gross misuse \n     of public assets.'' In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum, \n     112 F.3d 910, 921 (8th Cir. 1997). The Supreme Court declined \n     to review that decision. See 117 S. Ct. 2482 (1997). Now we \n     have novel claims of executive privilege, a privilege \n     extending to communications with the First Lady, and a secret \n     service privilege.\n       The President's current claim of executive privilege \n     appears to be foreclosed by well-established limits on the \n     privilege and calculated more for delay than anything else. \n     However, we are not privy to all the information that is at \n     the President's disposal. Future developments may strengthen \n     or weaken the President's assertion of privilege or make it \n     clear that the assertion implicates issues that have not yet \n     reached the Supreme Court, such as whether the privilege \n     applies to anyone other than the President.\n       In the event such novel issues arise, the Constitution \n     Subcommittee may hold hearings in an effort to clarify the \n     proper scope of executive privilege. I continue to believe \n     that the Senate has a critical responsibility to ensure that \n     the doctrine of executive privilege does not become distorted \n     in a manner that will interfere with congressional oversight \n     long after the current scandals subside.\n           Sincerely,\n     John Ashcroft,\n       Chairman, U.S. Senate Judiciary, Subcommittee on the \n     Constitution, Federalism and Property Rights.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FORD (for himself, Mr. Bond, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 2077. A bill to maximize the national security of the United \nStates and minimize the cost by providing for increased use of the \ncapabilities of the National Guard and other reserve components of the \nUnited States; to improve the readiness of the reserve components; to \nensure that adequate resources are provided for the reserve components; \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n      the national guard and reserve components equity act of 1998\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Bond, co-chairman of \nthe Senate National Guard Caucus, Senators Dorgan and Leahy, I am \nintroducing today the National Guard and Reserve Components Equity Act \nof 1998.\n  Over the past few years, we've had to expend a huge amount of energy \nfending off attacks to the Guard. Worse,\n\n[[Page S4829]]\n\nthe whole time we're dusting ourselves off and assessing the damage, \nour opponents deny they've ever laid a finger on us.\n  It reminds me of the boxer who, at the insistence of his trainer, \ntook on the current champ. After the first round, he came back to his \ncorner with a busted lip, and his trainer patted him on the back and \nsaid, ``You're doing great,'' then shoved him back out when the second \nbell sounded. After the second round, he staggered back to his corner \nwith a black eye and a busted cheek, and his trainer said, ``You're \ndoing great, he hasn't laid a hand on you.'' And the boxer replied, \n``Well you'd better keep an eye on the referee, `cause someone is \nbeating' the heck out of me.''\n  Year after year, the Guard has come back to its corner, bruised and \nbattered by the budget process, only to hear Pentagon officials insist \nthey haven't laid a hand on them.\n  I think we all agree that as we enter the 21st Century, the common \ngoal of the U.S. military should be to create and maintain a seamless \nTotal Force that provides our military leaders with the necessary \nflexibility and strength to address whatever conflicts that might \narise.\n  The 1997 QDR should have been the vehicle to achieve that goal. \nUnfortunately, it fell far short. One analyst described the QDR as \n``another banal defense of the status quo.''\n  There are close to a half million men and women in the National \nGuard, accounting for about 20 percent of this nation's Armed Forces. \nBecause of their dual federal-state mission, National Guardsmen and \nwomen are on hand to serve in both the international arena and in our \nown backyards. Perhaps more than any other soldier, members of the \nGuard embody our forefathers' vision of the citizen-soldier.\n  That's because the citizen-soldiers of the National Guard find their \nroots not only in the history of this country, but equally important, \nin the communities of this country.\n  The Army National Guard alone provides more than 55 percent of the \nground combat forces, 45 percent of the combat support forces, and 25 \npercent of the Army's combat support units--all while using only two \npercent of the Department of Defense budget.\n  But if you look at the QDR process, you would think the Guard has \noutlived its usefulness--that their cost-effectiveness, their \nflexibility, their readiness are all figments of this Senator's \nimagination.\n  This contentious relationship got even hotter last spring when \nleaders of the National Guard expressed outrage at never being given \nthe opportunity to present their case before the QDR and over the \nArmy's failure to be up-front about how deeply they wanted to cut the \nArmy Guard.\n  The outrage was well placed. The Washington Times was right on target \nwhen they wrote back in June that\n\n       The Guard has a greater relevance today than during the \n     Cold War--exactly the kind of relevance the Founding Fathers \n     envisioned when they elected to place the preponderance of \n     the nation's military strength in the state militias.\n\n  They understand that with its ``dual use system,'' the Guard is the \nwave of the future, not a relic of the past.\n  While many of us felt blind-sided by the QDR, the fact is it was just \none more instance where the Pentagon refuses to give the Guard the \nstatus it deserves.\n  I don't believe making the Chief of the National Guard a four star \ngeneral and a member of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council will \nsolve all of the Guard's problems, but I do believe it would help to \nchange the dynamics of this dysfunctional relationship, and better \nensure the Guard's needs are met when the Defense budget is being \nwritten, rather than through Congressional intervention.\n  As many of you probably recall, last year Senator Stevens offered an \namendment to the Defense Authorization bill to make this change. It was \napproved by the Senate, but later dropped in Conference Committee. \nInstead, Conferees agreed to having a Two-Star General from the Guard \nand one from the Reserves--a position the Guard already has.\n  Since then, I've been working with Senator Bond--my co-chairman of \nthe Senate National Guard Caucus to come up with new legislation \nreinforcing the important role of both the Guard and the Reserves.\n  The bill would direct the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to \nCongress regarding the force structure necessary for the Army National \nGuard and Army Reserve to meet future national security threats. The \nbill would freeze the end strength of the Army National Guard and the \nArmy Reserve at the level Congress approved for Fiscal Year 1998, until \nSeptember 30, 2000. This freeze will provide Congress a chance to \nreview the force structure report submitted by the Secretary of \nDefense.\n  The bill also requires the Secretary of Defense to develop a master \nplan for the modernization of the National Guard And Reserve Components \nto ensure compatibility of equipment with our active forces. Under this \nlegislation, the Secretary must also submit a master plan to Congress \non meeting the military construction needs of the National Guard and \nReserve Components.\n  This legislation builds on Senator Stevens's amendment to last year's \nDefense Authorization. It elevates the Chief of the National Guard \nBureau to the Grade of General (4-star) and elevates the Senior \nRepresentatives of the Reserves one Grade. These are just some \nprovisions of the bill. My Guard Caucus Co-Chairman, Senator Bond, \nsomeone who has been deeply committed to improving the readiness of the \nGuard, will be outlining other provisions of the bill.\n  Mr President, the Reserve Components are the only contact a majority \nof Americans have with the military. When they see a neighbor, a \nchild's teacher, or their family doctor representing the U.S. in the \ninternational arena or on hand when natural disasters strike, they have \na direct link to the military.\n  That bond has remained strong for well over 200 years. And despite \nresistance from the Pentagon, I believe Congress has no intention of \nseeing that bond damaged through insufficient funds or lack of \nresources--from operations and maintenance to pay and allowances to \ncontinued equipment modernization and military construction. This is \nwhy the National Guard and Reserve Components Equity Act of 1998 needs \nto become law.\n  Muhammad Ali used to say that not only could he knock'em out, but he \ncould pick the round. Opponents to the Guard and Reserves should be on \nnotice--no matter how much they try and bob and weave, this is the \nround they're going to go down.\n  Before closing, I'd like to take just a moment to say how much I've \nenjoyed working with Senator Bond on National Guard issues over the \nlast ten years.

Mr. President, I am proud to join with my colleague and co-\nchair of the Senate National Guard Caucus, Senator Ford to introduce a \nbill today to bolster the recognition of the National Guard and reserve \ncomponents by the Department of Defense. The bill entitled the National \nGuard and Reserve Components Equity Act of 1998.\n  Since the Senate National Guard Caucus was established in 1987, \nSenator Ford and I and the sixty five other members have worked \ntirelessly to insure the adequate resourcing of the National Guard and \nreserves. This year will be Senator Ford's final year as Caucus co-\nchair. I will sorely miss his advise and counsel. The legislation we \nlay before you this day is testimony to his commitment to improving the \nquality of life standards for our nations active, Guard and reserve \ncomponent service members. He and I have worked to include major \nquality of life and resourcing issues highlighted by reserve and \nNational Guard Associations.\n  This bill seeks to provide overdue recognition and benefits to the \nnation's reservists and Guard personnel and their families. For too \nlong, the nation's reservists and National Guardsmen and women have \nbeen the recipients of less than a full commitment by the Department of \nDefense. The bill we have introduced will stir some controversy I am \nsure, but these men and women deserve our support. As we ask more and \nmore of our reserve and Guard we owe it to the people who we ask to go \ninto harm's way, to provide them with equality in pay, equality in \nfielded equipments and equality in training. We owe it to their \nfamilies to provide them with equal access to commissaries and space \navailable travel. We owe it to them to continue reservist eligibility \nfor VA home loans and repeal Montgomery Bill limitations for Selected \nReservists. We need to do all this and more. We must also recognize the \nsacrifices made by reservist and Guard employers. This bill addresses \neach of these issues. We must remove any semblance of second class \nstatus from the shoulders of these professional and dedicated \nindividuals.\n  Reserve and Guard components are being called upon to integrate \nthemselves into the tactical operations of the nation's defense plans, \nin order to do this effectively, the systems used by the components \nmust be compatible. That is not the case today. In many instances, \nradios and data transfer equipments are incompatible. For instance many \nartillery units operate independently because they are unable to \ncoordinate their operations. I could hardly believe it, but many \nfighter aircraft units suffer the same fate, and you can imagine that \nthe theater commanders don't care to have independent fighter units \ninvolved in heavily coordinated and multi-national operations. \nDigitization, situational awareness data link upgrades and avionics \nmodernization of reserve and Guard units is imperative. This bill \ndirects the Secretary of Defense to develop a master plan for the \nmodernization of these components.\n  The bill also addresses the use of Guard and reserve component \npersonnel in response to an emergency involving a weapon of mass \ndestruction; to include their integration with efforts of the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency.\n  Family issues are addressed, as well. As I mentioned earlier, there \nare provisions for demonstration program for unlimited use of military \ncommissionaries by reserve component members, and for the development \nof rules governing Space Available Travel for reservists and their \nfamilies.\n  I urge my colleagues to review this bill, sign on and help us to \nprovide these and other long overdue measures to bring equity in \nindividual recognition and resource allocation to these vital \ncomponents of our national security.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Roberts, Mr. \n        Kerrey, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Hagel, and Mr. Allard):\n  S. 2078. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor Farm and Ranch Risk Management Accounts, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   farm and ranch risk management act\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Farm and \nRanch Risk Management Act of 1998. This bill gives farmers another tool \nto manage the risk of price and income fluctuations inherent in \nagriculture. It does this by encouraging farmers to save some of their \nincome during good years and allowing the funds to supplement income \nduring bad years. This new tool will more fully equip family farmers to \ndeal with the vagaries of the marketplace.\n  Farming is a unique sector of the American economy. Although \nagriculture represents one-sixth of our Gross Domestic Product, it \nconsists of hundreds of thousands of farmers across the nation. Many of \nwhom operate small, family farms. These farms often support entire \nfamilies, and even several generations of a family. And they work hard \nevery day and produce the food consumed by the rest of the country, and \naround the world as well.\n  Yet farming remains one of the most perilous ways to make a living. \nThe income of a farm family depends, in large part, on factors outside \nits control. Weather is one of those factors. For instance, I have \nheard on the Senate\n\n[[Page S4834]]\n\nfloor recently that the income of North Dakota farmers dropped 98% last \nyear because of flooding. Weather can totally wipe out a farmer. And, \nat best, weather can cause farmers' income to fluctuate wildly.\n  Another factor is the uncertainty of international markets. Iowa \nfarmers now export 40% of all they produce. But what happens when \nEuropean countries impose trade barriers on beef, pork and genetically-\nmodified feed grain, as examples. And what happens when Asian \ngovernments devalue their currencies. Exports fall and farm income \ndeclines. Through no fault of the farmer, but because of decisions made \nin foreign countries.\n  Mr. President, the 1996 farm bill took planting decisions out of the \nhands of government bureaucrats and put them back into the hands of \nfarmers. Farmers now have the ability to plant according to the demands \nof the market. The farmers I talk to are pleased with this change in \nphilosophy. They would rather make their own decisions and rely on the \nmarket for their income, instead of the government.\n  But the sometimes volatile nature of commodity markets can make it \ndifficult for family farmers to survive even a normal business cycle. \nWhen prices are high, farmers often pay so much of their income in \ntaxes that they are unable to save anything. When prices drop again, \nfarmers can be faced with liquidity problems. This bill allows farmers \nto manage their income, to smooth out the highs and lows of the \ncommodity markets.\n  In that way, this bill is complementary with the philosophy of the \nnew farm program. Business decisions are left in the hands of farmers, \nnot bureaucrats at the Department of Agriculture, and not elected \nofficials. The farmer decides whether to defer his income for later \nyears. The farmer decides when to withdraw funds to supplement his \noperation.\n  Mr. President, I will take just a moment to explain how the bill \nworks. Eligible farmers are allowed to make contributions to tax-\ndeferred accounts, also known as FARRM accounts. The contributions are \ntax-deductible and limited to 20% of the farmer's taxable income for \nthe year. The contributions are invested in cash or other interest-\nbearing obligations. The interest is taxed during the year it is \nearned.\n  The funds can stay in the account for up to five years. Upon \nwithdrawal, the funds are taxed as regular income. If the funds are not \nwithdrawn after five years, they are taxed as income and subject to an \nadditional 10% penalty.\n  Essentially, the farmer is given a five-year window to manage his \nmoney in a way that is best for his own operation. The farmer can \ncontribute to the account in good years and withdraw from the account \nwhen his income is low.\n  This bill helps the farmer help himself. It is not a new government \nsubsidy for agriculture. It will not create a new bureaucracy \npurporting to help farmers. The bill simply provides farmers with a \nfighting chance to survive the down times and an opportunity to succeed \nwhen prices eventually increase.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for supporting this \nbill, especially Senator Baucus, the lead Democratic cosponsor. I look \nforward to working with him on the Finance Committee to ensure passage \nof this important effort for our farmers.\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n

Mr. President, particularly in light of the \n1996 Farm Bill, it is important that the federal government focus its \nattention on the factors that will increase U.S. agriculture's \ncompetitiveness in a deregulated farm economy. This includes improving \nefficiency in the transportation system, keeping international markets \nactive and growing, advancing research, and facilitating use of market \noriented risk management tools.\n  Yesterday the Senate approved the Conference Report to S. 1150, which \nprovides for two of those critical factors. First of all, it provides \nimportant funding for agriculture research programs. Though I am \ncritical of government funding of applied research that would otherwise \nbe financed by those who will directly benefit in the private sector, I \nview basic research as a responsibility of the federal government. It \nis through research--largely conducted by the land grant universities \nsupported by the federal government--that we experienced the ``green \nrevolution'' whereby the world learned to produce more food using fewer \nresources. Through research we have developed technologies that have \nincreased farm efficiency exponentially, transformed food processing, \nand enhanced human nutrition. Given the structure of the agriculture \nindustry, these advances never would have occurred if it had been up to \nindividual farmers or individual companies to conduct the necessary \nresearch.\n  Furthermore, the intensive use of farmland here in the U.S. means \nthat sensitive ecosystems around the world--which would have to be \nconverted to farmland were it not for the productive capacity of the \nMidwest--can be spared. Continuing to search for ways to increase the \nproductive capacity of America's farmers will help ensure that these \necosystems are not destroyed in order to provide for the food needs of \nthe world's growing population. So the advances achieved through \nresearch have not only improved our own economic position, they have \nalso benefitted the environment worldwide.\n  The bill also provides a stable funding mechanism for crop insurance, \nwhich has been subject to annual debates in recent years. This has been \nproblematic for farmers and insurance agents, who need to be able to \nplan ahead. With the more liberalized market conditions that the new \nFreedom to Farm Act provides, risk management is more important than \never for farmers. And, for many, crop insurance is the most viable \noption for managing risk. In fact, lenders often require that producers \nobtain crop insurance in order to qualify for operating loans.\n  All of the spending that is directed toward these programs is offset \nby savings from food stamp administration accounts and the limitation \nof Commodity Credit Corporation funding for computers. So, the \nincreased spending in this bill does not jeopardize the balanced budget \nagreement enacted last year.\n  It goes without saying that this bill is critical for a farm state \nlike Kansas. However, the benefits of agricultural research and a \nreliable mechanism to manage risk extend well beyond the state lines of \nfarm states--this country's production affords our consumers in rural \ncommunities and cities alike the cheapest, safest, and most abundant \nfood supply on earth. It is imperative that Congress continue the \ninvestment that makes this competitive advantage possible. I am glad \nthat the Senate finally approved the Conference Report, and hope that \nthe House will act soon to secure these benefits for rural \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/13/senate-section/article/S4837-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4837-S4839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CELEBRATION OF ISRAEL'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, during the last few days, both in Israel \nand around the world, Jews and millions of others have been celebrating \nthe 50th anniversary of the birth of Israel. A celebration of Israel is \na celebration of democracy, prosperity, faith and the fulfillment of \nthe dream of a Jewish homeland.\n  It was on May 14, 1948, that David Ben-Gurion announced Israel's \nbirth to the world. Fifty years later, Israel is a mature state--a \nsurvivor of wars, assassinations and painful regional conflicts. And \nIsrael has not only survived, it has prospered and thrived.\n  It has bloomed in the desert, taking root against seemingly \nimpossible odds.\n  But it does not surprise us, for we know that overcoming the \ninsurmountable is the story of the Jewish people. Examples of Israel's \nachievements abound: it is a world leader in developing agricultural \ntechniques for arid climates, and in harnessing the power of solar \nenergy.\n  Ben-Gurion believed that Israel could lead the world to a better \nfuture by marrying the ethical teachings of the ancients with the \ndiscoveries of modern science. ``It is only by the integration of the \ntwo,'' he wrote, ``that the blessings of both can flourish.''\n  Israel ranks among the most advanced economies in the world, and is a \nvigorous democracy in a region of largely authoritarian regimes. Voter \nturnout for Israel's 1996 elections were about 80 percent, a high \nturnout by any standard, and one that surpasses and challenges the \nUnited States, which had just 49 percent turnout that same year. And \nIsrael has successfully resettled Jewish immigrants from the former \nSoviet Republics and across the globe, including absorbing 680,000 \nimmigrants during a three year period. The culture of Israel is equally \nvibrant, as Israelis have drawn on their dramatic personal and national \nhistories to create invaluable contributions to the arts.\n  At 50, Israel has character, strength and dignity. Of course, like \nanyone who reaches 50, Israel is also experiencing something of a mid-\nlife crisis.\n  As Israelis take stock of their achievements at this important moment \nin their history, they find problems yet to be solved and many goals \nyet to be reached. Israel has not yet made peace with all of her \nneighbors, and difficult decisions about how to achieve peace, or \nwhether to continue to, at this point, seek peace at all, are causing \npainful rifts in Israeli society.\n  Personally, I look at Israel from many perspectives--as an American, \nas a Jew, as a United States Senator and as a member of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee.\n  As an American, I see Israel as a staunch ally and friend. As a Jew, \nI see a spiritual homeland, a place where all Jews have a claim, a \nright to belong. Israel is an oasis of faith for Jews in every corner \nof the world. As a United States Senator and member of the Senate's \nForeign Relations Committee, I take a deep interest in Israel and the \nMiddle East peace process.\n\n[[Page S4838]]\n\n  I first visited Israel when I was 19 years old. My father and mother \ntook me as a way to educate me about the importance of Israel, and the \ntrip had an enormously powerful impact on me. I returned two more \ntimes, in 1976 and 1977, while I was a student at Oxford University.\n  My strongest memory of that last trip was our visit to the Western \nWall, when I brushed up against a soldier carrying a machine gun under \nhis jacket. It was then that I felt for the first time, through the \ncold steel of a weapon, what it was like to exist in a society where \nthe threat of violence was a constant. At the time, I hoped upon my \nnext return to Israel that there would be peace in the region--never \nrealizing that we would find ourselves in the stalemate we are in today \nso many years later. For these 21 years since then, I was unable to \nreturn to Israel except for one time and one time only--and then only \nfor 10 hours--for the sad occasion of Yitzhak Rabin's funeral in \nNovember 1995.\n  I went as a very young man and returned much changed--I had become a \nSenator, a husband and a father--but was still awed by the powerful \npresence of faith and hope, violence and conflict that still \ncharacterize the Jewish state today.\n  In between these visits, I had the opportunity to study the evolving \nrelationship between Israel and the United States for a paper I did for \na history course at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. To research \nthis paper, I read all the comments of Members of Congress in the \nCongressional Record concerning Israel for the years 1948, 1956, 1967 \nand 1973, and analyzed how those comments reflected a changing \ndefinition of U.S. interests in the region from the birth of Israel, \nthrough the Suez Crisis, the Six Day War and the Yom Kippur War.\n  In 1948, most of the talk was about the need for a homeland for the \nJewish people, especially after the Holocaust. In 1956, that talk \nshifted to describing Israel as a blooming democracy; a small outpost \nof democratic values in the midst of a non-democratic region. In 1967, \nIsrael was the non-aggressive dove who triumphed in a hostile \nenvironment. By 1973, my predecessors had shifted to speaking of Israel \nin a very positive geopolitical and national security terms.\n  Today, I add my own remarks about Israel to the long chronicle of the \nAmerican-Israeli relationship in the Congressional Record to those of \nmy predecessors who came to speak in times of crisis and triumph for \nIsrael.\n  The U.S. has played a pivotal role in Israel's history, and our \nrelationship has been a strong one from the beginning. Within minutes \nof Ben-Gurion's announcement of the birth of Israel, President Harry \nTruman recognized the fledgling state. Prior to Israel's founding, \nbetween the end of the Second World War and May 14, 1948, official U.S. \nsupport for a Jewish state was largely grounded in the desire to help \nre-settle hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees, displaced people \nand survivors of the Holocaust.\n  From May 14, 1948, until today, America could always count on Israel \nas an island of democracy and stability in an area of the world not \naltogether familiar with either concept.\n  The presence of a secure and vital Israel, in and of itself, is in \nAmerica's interests.\n  For many years, those interests included containment of Soviet \nexpansion into the Middle East, securing access to the region's oil for \nthe industrialized nations of the West, promoting market economies and \ndemocratic institutions and safeguarding Israel's national security. As \nthe inter-relationship between Israel and the United States has \ndeveloped, matured and adapted to political and economic developments, \nso too has American policy. During the tenure of President Jimmy \nCarter, for example, America was very active in the Middle East peace \nprocess, culminating in the signing of the Camp David accords.\n  During the first Reagan term, the administration's priorities of \ncombating terrorism, promoting cooperative security and confronting \nSoviet expansion found common ground with the perspectives of Prime \nMinisters Begin and Shamir, and, in general, those closer relations \nsurvived the policy differences arising over the Lebanon war in 1982. \nTies between Israel and the United States grew stronger during \nPresident Reagan's second term, including the signing of several \nprecedent-setting strategic and cooperative defense agreements.\n  During the early Bush years, U.S.-Israel relations were marked again \nby tension caused by some policy disagreements, but tension eased in \n1990 when--amid Iraqi threats against Israel generated by the Persian \nGulf crisis--President Bush repeated the U.S. commitment to Israel's \nsecurity. Confidence in U.S. support was a primary factor in Israel's \ndecision not to retaliate against Iraq for its Scud missile attacks.\n  Of course, the first year of the Clinton administration saw the \nhistoric signing on the White House lawn of the Declaration of \nPrinciples establishing the goals and framework for peace talks. On \nSeptember 13, 1993, the world watched with hope and trepidation as \nPrime Minister Rabin and Yasser Arafat inaugurated a new era in the \nMiddle East. This would soon be followed by two other major peace \nagreements: the May 1994 Gaza-Jericho Agreement that provided for \nPalestinian control over the Gaza Strip and the environs of Jericho \nafter an Israeli withdrawal, and the September 1995 Interim Agreement \nthat set a timetable and an agenda for final status negotiations.\n  The Palestinians and Israelis have also agreed to other arrangements, \nsuch as the Israeli withdrawal from six Palestinian cities in December \n1995, and the Palestinian elections in January 1996.\n  As much as we hoped the historic moment on the White House lawn would \nbring an end to terrorism, bloodshed and occupation, we all knew just \nas well that the road to peace would not be that simple. Years of \nbitter experience also told us the road would not be that short.\n  But 1994 and 1995 were relatively good years. The peace process was \nprogressing, and, by late 1995, it seemed relations between Rabin and \nArafat were warming. Then, of course, as we can never forget, extremism \nstruck again with the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin by a Jewish \nradical. It is important to note that this was a terrorist attack like \nso many in the new Middle East, where extremism and violence of every \nstripe lashes out against any sign of peace and tolerance.\n  Today, this extremism and violence present perhaps the greatest and \nmost persistent threat to peace.\n  Just before he died, Rabin said, ``Peace is the future.'' We must \nremain faithful to the memory of Rabin and all those who had the \ncourage and the abiding discipline to put ancient hatreds aside and \nmade peace their priority, because Rabin had no illusions about the \ndifficulty of the peace process.\n  Someone who witnessed Rabin in a meeting on the peace process said to \nthe prime minister, ``I can see I'm talking to the converted.'' Rabin's \nreply was, ``You're talking to the committed, not the converted.'' It \nwas commitment that peace required of him and requires of all of us.\n  As we look forward to Israel's next 50 years, we must be able to look \nforward to a future that gives every Israeli, and every Jew, a peaceful \nhomeland. But the Palestinians are also clearly key to peace in the \nregion, and that is why it is so important to get the current \nnegotiations back on track.\n  Although our priorities and perceptions on the path to peace \nsometimes differ, America and Israel have, by and large, moved forward \ntogether, and I believe that partnership will continue. Earlier this \nmonth, in honor of this 50th anniversary, Congress unanimously passed a \nresolution which read, in part, ``The United States commends the people \nof Israel for their remarkable achievements in building a new state and \na pluralistic democratic society in the Middle East in the face of \nterrorism, hostility and belligerence by many of her neighbors.'' The \nresolution reaffirmed the bonds of friendship between Israel and the \nU.S., and extended best wishes for a peaceful, prosperous and \nsuccessful future.\n  The key to continued success and prosperity in Israel will be a \nlasting peace, and the United States clearly has an interest in taking \nan active role in the peace process, as it has done throughout the \nyears.\n  Helping facilitate the peace process is one facet of U.S. relations \nwith\n\n[[Page S4839]]\n\nIsrael, and another is foreign assistance. Since 1976, Israel has been \nthe largest recipient of U.S. foreign assistance. Over the past 10 \nyears, Israel has annually received about $3 billion in economic and \nmilitary grants, refugee settlement assistance, and other aid, from the \nUnited States.\n  Recently, we have seen a movement to gradually reduce that level of \naid, beginning with the declaration by Prime Minister Netanyahu that \nIsrael should reduce its dependence on the United States when he \naddressed a joint session of Congress two years ago. Negotiations have \nsince been conducted with the goal of reducing the overall level of \nAmerican assistance and to gradually phase out economic aid while \nincreasing military aid.\n  Specifically, the Clinton administration and the Congress are \ncurrently reviewing an Israeli proposal to reduce the $1.2 billion in \nU.S. economic assistance to Israel to zero over 10 years, and to \nincrease U.S. military aid to Israel from $1.8 billion to $2.4 billion \nper year. I am intrigued by this idea, and am glad to see Israel taking \nthe lead in this regard. Israel has recognized that in its 50-year \nhistory, it has made enormous strides in economic development and, as a \nresult, now boasts a relatively healthy economy. At the same time, \nIsrael recognizes--as I think we all do--that it still faces a \nsubstantial security threat, and so must maintain a robust military and \naccess to state-of-the-art weaponry.\n  The proposal to change our aid relationship reflects this reality. It \nis an Israeli plan, and as such reflects Israeli priorities, including \na desire to decrease its dependence on the United States, and boost its \nown self-sufficiency. I am concerned about potential unintended \nconsequences of hasty action by the Congress, and so, I, along with \nothers in this body are still considering our legislative response. But \nby and large I believe these are worthy goals that we should support, \njust as we have supported Israel in the past.\n  Ben-Gurion envisioned many achievements for Israel, including one I \nmentioned earlier, the idea of building a successful nation by marrying \nscientific advances with ancient Hebrew traditions. He believed that by \ndrawing on the strength, wisdom and skill of a nation of faith and \naccomplishment, Israel could build a lasting peace with its neighbors.\n  Israel deserves that peace at last.\n  Just over 100 years ago, the First Zionist Congress convened in \nBasel, Switzerland. Under the leadership of Theodore Herzl, the \nparticipants announced their desire to reestablish a Jewish homeland in \nthe historic land of Israel. Herzl once said that ``If you will it, it \nis not a dream.''\n  Israel is a testament to the will of a people who believed those \nwords and proved them true.\n  It would be 51 years until the dream expressed at the First Zionist \nCongress would become reality, until Holocaust survivors and other Jews \npersecuted around the world could have a homeland where they could seek \nrefuge and build a life. And 50 years after that founding, Israel has \ntaken root in the desert soil and it has thrived.\n  The United States has built an alliance and friendship with Israel \nthat has enriched American life and helped Israel thrive, and I hope \nthat partnership will continue for the next 50 years and beyond. But as \nIsraelis well know and all of us must recognize, the dream of those at \nthe First Zionist Congress and of other Jews for centuries, to have a \nhomeland, cannot be truly fulfilled until peace is attained.\n  Violence and conflict are a constant threat to the people of Israel, \nand to the Nation of Israel itself. As we celebrate the 50th \nanniversary of the birth of Israel, we have every right to wish for \nsomething more. Not just for a Jewish homeland, but a homeland at \npeace.\n  As Theodore Herzl said, ``If you will it, it is not a \ndream.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/13/senate-section/article/S4837-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO THE FLOYD COUNTY EMERGENCY AND RESCUE SQUAD: FORTY YEARS OF \n                 VOLUNTEER SERVICE IN EASTERN KENTUCKY\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nrecent anniversary of the Floyd County Emergency and Rescue Squad. \nForty years ago, this squad of volunteers was formed to help the people \nof Eastern Kentucky in times of emergency and disaster, and have been \ndoing so ever since.\n  The Floyd County Emergency and Rescue Squad was founded on April 27, \n1958, as a result of a tragic accident in Prestonsburg, Kentucky, in \nwhich a school bus plunged into the Big Sandy River, killing 26 \nstudents and the driver. As a result of this tragedy, dozens of \ncommunity members came together to form the Squad and the late Graham \nBurchett became the first Captain, a position he held for twenty years.\n  Since that time, over 300 community members have served on the \nSquad--doctors and lawyers, coal miners and factory workers--people \nfrom all walks of life have worked side-by-side in volunteer service to \ntheir community. The Squad operates without any public support. The \nmembers are all volunteers and all their equipment is paid for through \nprivate donations and grants.\n  The Squad currently maintains a roster of thirty active members and \ndozens of reserve members. The Squad is called on for auto extrication, \nwater rescue and drowning recovery, lost or missing persons, and \nassistance to coal mine rescue teams. In the last month alone, they \nhave assisted in the evacuation of flood victims, recovered a drowning \nvictim and have assisted on four auto accidents.\n  Despite the fact that the Squad must labor mightily for every dollar \nthey get, they have managed to secure ultra-modern equipment, and are \ncalled frequently to assist in recovery activities outside the county \nand even outside the state.\n  Mr. President, I hope all my colleagues will join me in offering our \ncongratulations to Captain Harry Adams, Co-Captain Richie Schoolcraft, \nTreasurer and Secretary Brian Sexton, First Lieutenant Derek Calhoun \nand Second Lieutenant Lee Schoolcraft and all the volunteers of the \nFloyd County Rescue Squad. They carry on the Squad's rich tradition of \nvolunteering their time and risking their lives to help the people of \ntheir community, and they are all worthy of our admiration and \nthanks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/13/senate-section/article/S4839-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4839-S4840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ANTI-SLAMMING AMENDMENTS ACT\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, yesterday, Senator McCain and \nSenator Hollings proposed a managers' amendment, Amendment No. 2389 to \nS. 1618, a bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934. The amendment \nsignificantly improves the protections for consumers against \n``slammers,'' persons who deliberately deceive consumers and change \ntheir long distance carrier without proper authorization. The manager's \namendment included two of my amendments which were cosponsored by \nSenator Durbin and Senator Glenn.\n  The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations held a hearing recently \non slamming. At this hearing, we became aware of the fact that slammers \nintentionally used names like Phone Company and Long Distance Services \nto deliberately deceive customers on their phone bills. Usually local \ntelephone companies or billing agents precede an itemized list of long \ndistance calls by printing the name of the long distance service \nprovider. When deceptive company names are used, customers are not \naware that their long distance service provider has been changed. My \nintention was to remedy this situation by requiring the billing \ncompanies to specify the long distance provider using a statement like, \n``Your provider for the following long distance service is------------\n'' . If that type of statement were made conspicuously and clearly \nstated on a consumer's phone bill before the itemized long distance \ncharges, consumers would know if their long distance carrier had been \nchanged.\n  Section 231 of the manager's amendment, entitled Obligations of \nTelephone Billing Agents, has language that differs from my proposed \namendment. The language in the Manager's amendment is language that was \nsuggested by the staff at the Federal Communications Commission.\n  I chose not to use the FCC language because my staff contacted \nseveral telephone companies and learned that if we used the FCC \nlanguage several problems could be created which may result in \npotential increased costs to consumers. GAO has advised my staff that \nsome of the requirments in the\n\n[[Page S4840]]\n\nprovision as passed simply can't be done.\n  Because of time constraints we were unable to resolve the language in \nthe provision. It is not our intention to increase consumers costs for \ntelephone services in order to alert them about ``slammers.'' If the \ncurrent bill increases costs, and we believe it could, we need to \nmodify this section so consumers are protected without having to pay \nfor that protection. I sincerely hope we can continue to work to \nimprove this section in the conference committee, if there is one, or \nbefore the bill is enacted into law, to make sure that we are not \ncreating a burden on telecommunications carriers which will be passed \non to consumers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/13/senate-section/article/S4839-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             COMMENDING THE CREDIT UNIONS FOR KIDS PROGRAM\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today in \nrecognition of the Credit Unions for Kids program, an effort which \nbegan in my state of Oregon but which has since spread to more than 35 \nstates across the nation and has served as an outstanding example of \ncommunity service.\n  The Credit Unions for Kids program represents credit union employees \nand members in Oregon and Southwest Washington who have volunteered \ntheir resources and time in raising $1.7 million to benefit the \nDoernbecher Children's Hospital Foundation. Last year, Oregon ranked \nfirst in the average dollars raised per credit union on a nationwide \nbasis.\n  This is a day for celebration, not only for this donation, but for \nthe generosity exhibited by a twelve-year fund-raising effort \nundertaken by the employees, families, and members of the credit unions \nin Oregon and Southwest Washington. This combined effort serves as an \nexample to the businesses, communities and corporations in the Pacific \nNorthwest and throughout the nation that anything is possible, even \nfulfilling the dream of a new children's hospital, one floor at a time.\n  For a moment, I would like to focus on the recipient of this \ndonation--the new Doernbecher Children's Hospital which replaces a very \nold and outdated facility on the campus of Oregon Health Sciences \nUniversity. This four-story, 250,000 square-foot facility houses 120 \nbeds, including the medical/surgical units, a pediatric intensive care \nunit, the Kenneth W. Ford Cancer Center and the Doernbecher Neonatal \nCare Center. The hospital also has a 16-bed floor dedicated to \ninpatient and outpatient cancer treatment.\n  Perhaps what is most impressive about this facility is the focus on \nthe need of the children and families whom it will serve. Designed by \nDoernbecher staff, parents and patients, the hospital has places for \nfamilies to gather together, facilities for families who wish to cook \ntheir own meals, and patient rooms that have extra beds so that parents \nmay stay with their children. There are separate playrooms, outdoor \nplay structures and a schoolroom. There are large and numerous windows \nwelcoming natural light. There is artwork of birds and frogs, \nsculptures, painting, and poems.\n  One particular poem, ``Naknuwisha'' which appears in the waiting room \nof the hospital and is a Sahaptin term among the Yakima, meaning ``to \ncare for something precious, particularly children who need our help'' \nwas written by Kim Stafford in 1996 and serves as a constant reminder \nto all who enter the hospital that this is a place for children, and a \nplace where healing and hope begin:\n\n     Naknuwisha\n     young friend,\n     be part of something old--\n     be home here in the great world\n     where rain wants to give you drink\n     where forest wants to be your house\n     where frogs say your name and your name\n     where wee birds carry your wishes far\n     and the sun reaches for your hand--\n     be home here\n     be healed\n     be well\n     be with us all\n     young friend.\n\n  Mr. President, this beautiful new hospital is the foundation of a \ncommitment made by the community, families, friends, physicians, and by \nbusinesses who have given the gift of time and resources to turn a \ndream into a reality. I am proud to recognize the Credit Unions of \nOregon and Washington, and to congratulate them on their contribution \nto this facility and this day of celebration of the opening of the \nCredit Unions for Kids floor of the Doernbecher Children's Hosptial.\n  Congratulations, and thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/13/senate-section/article/S4840-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4840-S4841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NAN S. HUTCHINSON SENIOR HALL OF FAME HONOREES\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am delighted to recognize and \ncongratulate a group of exemplary citizens upon their induction into \nthe 1998 Dr. Nan S. Hutchinson Senior Hall of Fame. These men and women \nhave each given a great gift to their communities--they have given of \nthemselves.\n  Arnold Abbott, 73, works everyday to fulfill his self-appointed \nmission to feed and help the homeless on the streets of Broward County. \nHe also organized a small, dedicated core of volunteers to assist him \nin finding clothes, counseling and living arrangements, and to reunite \nthe homeless with their family members.\n  Ruth Forbes, 76, began her work of community service in 1993 with the \nArea Agency on Aging's Advisory Council. In her time there, she has \nheld the positions of Legislative Chair, Vice Chair, and Chairperson. \nIn addition to improving the lives of those in her own age group, she \nalso aids disadvantaged children.\n  Arnold & Joann Lanner, 76 and 79, respectively, work with the ``I Am \nSomebody'' program at elementary schools. This program is aimed at \nincreasing students' self esteem. In addition, they have raised over \n$120,000 for the Hepburn Center, an intergenerational, community-based \norganization that provides after-school care and organizes activities \nfor the elderly.\n  Evelyn Jones Lewis, 70, began her volunteer work when she was \nappointed to serve on the Florida Advisory Council on Aging. Since \nthen, she has been active in urging Congress to pass legislation that \nwould improve the ever-changing nutritional and transportation needs of \nthe elderly.\n  Claire F. Mitchel, 76, is truly an asset to the elderly community \nbecause she promotes acceptance and celebration of the aging process. \nShe promotes these values in work with organizations like the Rape \nCrisis Center, Women in Distress and the Older Women's League.\n  Estella Mae Moriarty, 62, exemplifies the true meaning of altruism by \nembracing foster-care children of all ages who have been abandoned, \nabused or neglected. Realizing that children need a permanent home in \nthe developing stages of their lives, she co-founded the SOS Children's \nVillage, which provides care and comfort for children in distress.\n  Lily Ann Olfern, 68, is involved with a telephone service bank to \nbuild a public safety building. Thanks to her many hours on the phone, \nthe new facility will be opening in Davie next year. She also bags toys \nfor children on Christmas, feeds the homeless on Thanksgiving, and \nteaches senior citizens how to avoid various scam operations.\n  Reuben Sperber, 90, came to Florida to retire. However, he has worked \njust as hard during his twenty years in this community as while he was \nin the workforce. Over the years, Reuben has served in his temple, \ngiven of his time at the Margate General Hospital, and become one of \nthe most respected members of the Alzheimer's Family Center's Board of \nDirectors.\n  Jacob Statemann, 76, has dedicated his time to the Southeast Focal \nPoint Senior Center in Hollywood for over 10 years. At the Center he \nhas taught classes ranging from current events to foreign language, and \nhe has never hesitated to organize holiday events or assist other \nclasses that need help. He also leads a senior choral group at HUD \nhousing.\n  Ira Subin, 83, spends much of his time and efforts helping the Area \nAgency on Aging's Advisory Council plan social events and fundraisers. \nHis advocacy for the Seniors for Seniors Dollar Drive, along with \nmatching funds that the program has received from the state, has \nsubstantially increased the quality of services that the Area Agency on \nAging can provide.\n  Mr. President, all of these outstanding seniors have diligently and \nselflessly given of their time and energy to make Broward County a \nbetter place for all its residents. Florida is very fortunate to have \nthese inspiring senior citizens who give so much to our communities. I \ncongratulate them today\n\n[[Page S4841]]\n\nand wish for them many more productive and healthy years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/13/senate-section/article/S4840-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO DR. VINCE DAVIS: 27 YEARS AT THE PATTERSON SCHOOL OF \n                  DIPLOMACY AND INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ntremendous accomplishments of Dr. Vince Davis, who is retiring this \nspring after 27 years at the Patterson School of Diplomacy and \nInternational Commerce at the University of Kentucky in Lexington.\n  Since I was first elected to the United States Senate in 1984, Vince \nand I have had occasion to discuss important issues of the day in \nforeign affairs, as well as the underlying trends and currents that \nshape and guide world events looming just over the horizon. I have \nnever failed to find his views both penetrating and insightful, and \nhave always appreciated his counsel over the years.\n  But now, Vince has decided to pursue new interests after nearly three \ndecades of toiling in the academic vineyard, and so it's appropriate \nthat we bid him adieu with fondness and with gratitude.\n  Thinking back over the span of his career, I believe Vince Davis's \nmark on Kentucky and the world has been and always will be the enormous \nstore of labor and love he poured into the Patterson School of \nDiplomacy and International Commerce. It's clear to me that Vince's \ntireless and inspired stewardship of the program has fashioned the \nPatterson School into the glimmering jewel of excellence for which it \nis now justly famous. Vince has given his all to the School, and two \ngenerations of bright young students have been immeasurably enriched by \nhis exertions.\n  Mr. President, there is an old Irish proverb that says, ``The work \npraises the man.'' In that spirit, each time I think of the Patterson \nSchool, I will remember Vince Davis, for the Patterson School is his \nwork, and we all should praise that which he leaves as his legacy.\n  Mr. President, I also ask that an article from the Lexington Herald \nLeader of Sunday, April 19, 1998, be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n            Teacher Praised for Years at UK Diplomacy School\n\n                          (By Holly E. Stepp)\n\n       For years, the University of Kentucky's Patterson School of \n     Diplomacy and International Commerce has urged the state's \n     residents--from the business community to average Joes--to \n     think globally.\n       And one of the leaders behind that charge was retiring \n     professor and former director Vincent Davis.\n       Last night, Davis, the Patterson Chair professor, was \n     honored for his dedication to that mission during a black-tie \n     dinner at Lexington's Wyndham Garden Hotel. More than 200 \n     alumni and friends of the 39-year-old-school came out to \n     celebrate Davis' commitment to the program.\n       His retirement becomes effective at the end of this \n     semester.\n       ``With Vince's retirement, not just the Patterson School, \n     but the University of Kentucky, loses one of their academic \n     giants of the past half century,'' said current director John \n     D. Stempel.\n       Davis, 67, was the school's second director for 22 years \n     after an active and reserve career in the U.S. Navy. He \n     receives much of the credit for building the school's \n     prestige as a world-class international relations program.\n       ``Patterson School has a unique combination of superior \n     foreign-affairs training and related community outreach,'' \n     said David D. Newsom, former ambassador and adviser to the \n     Patterson School. Newsom, who was undersecretary of state \n     during the Carter administration, was the featured speaker.\n       Although the Patterson School was founded in 1959, it was \n     the brainchild of UK's first president, James K. Patterson, \n     who served from 1878 to 1910.\n       Patterson died in 1922 at the age of 89. In his will, he \n     ordered that his estate's assets go to the university for the \n     creation of such a school, with the proceeds invested for a \n     prolonged period before UK could gain the money.\n       The school, Patterson also ordered, should be named in \n     honor of William Andrew Patterson, his son.\n       Davis worked to build the program into one nationally known \n     for the quality of its graduates. Although enrollment is \n     limited to 25 to 30 students, the Patterson School is often \n     compared to similar but larger programs at prestigious \n     universities, such as Harvard and Princeton.\n       Current and past students of the school praised Davis as an \n     interested mentor with a quick wit.\n       Davis, himself, didn't dwell on the accolades bestowed on \n     him, including a $100,000 endowed trust to support Patterson \n     students' internships.\n       ``All I have done is to work to carry on the great \n     tradition started by my predecessors,'' Davis said.\n       On his retirement, he said he got a hint from a former \n     student a couple of months ago that it was time to retire.\n       ``When your former graduate students start to retire, \n     perhaps it's wise to consider joining them.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/13/senate-section/article/S4841-1", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ANTI-SLAMMING AMENDMENTS ACT\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday, an amendment offered by \nSenator Feinstein to the anti-``slamming'' bill, S. 1618, was passed \nwithout debate. While this amendment was intended to enhance the \nprivacy rights of patients, the consequence of this amendment would be \nfar different. Specifically, this amendment would change current \nfederal law and put patients at risk of criminal liability if they \nrecord their conversations with health providers and health insurers \nwithout first alerting and obtaining the consent of those providers and \ninsurers.\n  This Feinstein amendment modifies the wiretap law, in title 18 of the \nUnited States Code, but was never considered by the Committee of the \nJudiciary, which has jurisdiction over this law. The risk of passing \nlegislation quickly and bypassing the Committee with jurisdiction over \nthe subject matter is amply revealed by the unintended consequence of \nthis amendment.\n  If this amendment becomes law, the minority rule adopted by only a \nsmall number of States--sixteen--requiring the consent of all parties \nfor the lawful interception of telephone calls, would be applied to all \nconversations that take place between patients and health insurers or \nproviders. There are a number of legitimate reasons for patients to \nwant to record their calls with a health provider or insurer: medical \ninstructions can be complicated. Insurers' explanations of coverage or \ndecisions regarding reimbursement may be complicated. Patients may have \nsound reasons for recording those conversations if they are unable to \ntake notes or want to keep the oral instructions for future reference. \nFor example, patients, especially Alzheimer sufferers, may want to \nrecord their calls as a memory aid, and be too embarrassed to say so.\n  A more carefully crafted amendment would have reduced the unwarranted \nrisk of criminal liability to patients. If this provision were to \nbecome law, we would have to revisit this issue promptly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/05/13/senate-section/article/S4841-2", "month": "05", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES--H.R. 2676\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
