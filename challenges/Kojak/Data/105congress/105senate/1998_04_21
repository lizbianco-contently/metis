Mr. President, I am going to take the 2 or 3 minutes \nwe have before we begin the debate on the Gorton amendment just to \nfamiliarize my colleagues with the bill that is before us, the Ocean \nShipping Reform Act of 1998, and give an overview of the bill.\n  This is something that I think has been a long time coming. What we \nare trying to do is open our ports and give our carriers and our \nshippers more of an opportunity to compete with foreign competitors \nwhere they have been at a disadvantage in the past because our markets \nwere so open that they were transparent in their contracts to the \nextent that many shippers would go to foreign carriers in order to \nescape the requirement to have so much openness and on the other hand \ncarriers would be able to compete at a disadvantage to our shippers \nbecause they knew everything about a contract and they could undercut \nthat contract.\n  So it has not been a good situation. Particularly our ports that are \nnear Canada or are near Mexico have felt a loss of business because of \nthe competition from the foreign carriers. What we are trying to do is \nlevel the playing field for American shippers, American carriers, and \ntry to help American ports get more of the business, which we think, of \ncourse, would create more jobs for our port cities.\n  So what we tried to do was balance the interests. We want \ntransparency. We want openness. But we also want to allow the privacy \nof contracting to the extent that shippers and carriers can make \ncontracts which they ought to be able to do privately, and as long as \neverything is open in competition it should be an open marketplace.\n\n[[Page S3306]]\n\n  I would not say this is a perfect bill. Certainly nothing we ever \npass is just the way we would pass it if we alone wrote it. But we are \nnot alone. We have 100 Members. We have a Commerce Committee that \ndebated this bill, that worked on it for a long time. In fact, we have \nbeen working on it for 2 years, and it has been a compromise bill. But \nI think everyone will be better off as a result of this effort.\n  I appreciate the support of the Commerce Committee. It has been a \nmajor achievement for the Commerce Committee. I appreciate the work of \nSenator Lott, our majority leader, who is very interested in this \nmatter. I appreciate the work of Senator Gorton and Senator Breaux, \nboth of whom have worked very diligently to try to hone the balance in \nthis bill.\n  Senator Gorton has an amendment. There was one part of the bill that \nhe felt needed changing. So he is going to debate that amendment. I \nthink the bill should pass as it is because I think the balancing has \nbeen done.\n  So with that, I will yield the floor. I know we have a unanimous \nconsent agreement that at 9:40 we will begin the debate on the Gorton \namendment. And Senator Breaux will be arguing on the other side for the \ncommittee.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/21/senate-section/article/S3305-5", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3306-S3321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   OCEAN SHIPPING REFORM ACT OF 1997\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 9:40 \na.m. having arrived, the Senate will now resume consideration of S. \n414, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 414) to amend the Shipping Act of 1984 to \n     encourage competition in international shipping and growth of \n     United States imports and exports, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Hutchison amendment No. 1689, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Gorton amendment No. 2287 (to amendment No. 1689) to \n     provide rules for the application of the act to \n     intermediaries.\n\n                           Amendment No. 2287\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to allow a \nCommerce Committee staffer, Jim Sartucci, the privilege of the floor \nduring the remainder of the debate on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. I also ask unanimous consent that my own assistant, \nJeanne Bumpus, be granted the privilege of the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the 1984 Shipping Act significantly \nbrought openness and competition into the field of ocean shipping, a \nfield dominated for decades by cartels, by fixed prices, by underhanded \ncompetition, and by, very frequently, the victimization of those who \nship their goods by sea.\n  This 1998 set of amendments to the Shipping Act further opens up the \nprocess to competition and allows the business of ocean shipping to \noperate far more like most of the rest of the free market in the United \nStates, with one exception. If you are a large shipper of goods by sea, \nsophisticated, a major customer, you deal directly with the ocean \ncarrier, and those relationships with the ocean carrier are made much \nmore flexible, much more subject to competition, by this bill.\n  If, on the other hand, you are a modest shipper, a small or medium-\nsized shipper, perhaps someone new to the business of exporting your \ngoods from the United States of America, you don't, as a general \npractice, deal directly with the ocean carrier, you deal with a \nmiddleman, a consolidator, a freight forwarder. That small businessman \nin the various ports of the United States gathers together shipments to \nthe same place from a number of different shippers and makes the \narrangements with the ocean carrier.\n  As this bill was debated and reported from the Committee on Commerce, \nit treated both of these groups in an identical fashion. Each got the \nbenefits of the bill; each got the benefits of competition.\n  Somewhere, however, between the Commerce Committee and the floor, the \nbig boys got together behind closed doors, and a combination of the \nocean carriers and the longshoremen's unions, working with a handful of \nSenators, determined that the small business people would not get these \nadvantages, that they would continue to have to operate, under most \ncircumstances, under the requirements of the 1984 act.\n\n  Under the 1984 act, they were treated identically. If this bill \npasses without my amendment, they will no longer be treated \nidentically. The small shipper will be discriminated against. The small \nbusinessman who is a freight forwarder will be discriminated against. \nThe big guys will get away with something.\n  It is curious, Mr. President, that neither the small shippers nor the \nfreight forwarders were included in the negotiations that led to the \nrevised bill, the substantive bill that is before us, as against the \nbill that came out of the Commerce Committee. The big boys got \ntogether, shafted the small business people on both sides, and now \npresent this bill to you with the statement, ``Take it or leave it; \nit's tough, but we've made a deal with the longshoremen's unions \nbecause they think that they may not get some of the business from \nthese small businessmen, and you're just simply going to have to take \nit that way.''\n  I don't think that is the way the laws ought to be made. I don't \nthink that is the way we ought to deal as Senators. We make wonderful \nspeeches at home, all of us, about the sanctity of small business, but \nhere we are asked to discriminate against small business and in favor \nof big business.\n  If we adopt my amendment, we will simply put this bill back into the \nsame condition in which it found itself when it was reported by the \nCommerce Committee--everyone treated equally, everyone the beneficiary \nof a freer market than we have at the present time--and we will have \ndone our duty to all of our constituents and not just to those who are \nable to afford expensive lobbyists in Washington, DC.\n  The bill, in its present form, is unfair to small businesses. It \ndiscriminates against small businesses. The bill as reported from the \nCommerce Committee did not do so. We should restore provisions that the \nCommerce Committee saw fit to include in the bill.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I would imagine that all Members of the Senate who are vitally \ninterested in this legislation must be here this morning to follow \nthese very complicated, very detailed arguments. This, indeed, is \nincredibly complicated. It just always continues to amaze me how \ncomplicated some of these international shipping agreements can become. \nIt is part of the reason why it took 4 years to put together this \nlegislation. This is not something that just came to the floor \novernight but is the result of 4 years of painful negotiating and \ncompromise among people who ship packages and cargo, people who carry \npackages and cargo internationally.\n  Mr. President, 96 percent of our cargoes carried internationally are \non shipping vessels. It also has involved, to a large extent, the \npeople who put together packages for people to ship in order to make it \nmore efficient than it has been in the past.\n  Like all other compromises that normally are reached, everybody \ndoesn't get everything they want. I think this legislation is an \nexample of what a true compromise is. This legislation clearly is \nincredibly important because it further deregulates the shipping \nindustry and makes it more competitive than it has been in the past.\n\n  But in reaching that compromise among all of the Senators who are \ninvolved, including Senator Gorton and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, \nwho has done such a terrific job as the chairman of our subcommittee, \nSenator Lott's involvement, Senator Inouye's involvement--everybody on \nthe committee has been deeply involved on this very complicated issue, \nlike I said, for 4 years.\n\n[[Page S3307]]\n\n  Unfortunately, the amendment of the Senator from Washington is a \nkiller amendment in the sense that if this amendment were to be \nadopted, the 4 years of hard work would go for naught. This bill would \nnot be able to pass because the carefully crafted compromise would fall \napart. As in most compromises, if you lose one part, you will lose the \nwhole deal.\n  So it is very, very important for all of us who want to see a \nshipping act adopted and signed into law to recognize that it is \nnecessary this morning to defeat the amendment of the Senator from \nWashington. I know it is well intended. I do not in any way question \nhis motives in offering it, but I think that on the facts, there is a \nstrong difference of opinion.\n  The non-vessel-operating common carriers, the so-called NVOCCs, are \nnot actually in the business of carrying cargo at all. These \norganizations were formed in 1984 and recognized in 1984 in order to \nhelp very small shippers who would not ordinarily have enough cargo to \nfill an entire container, who would hire these NVOCCs to consolidate \nthe cargo and put them in the container. But it is very, very clear \nthat they are not a carrier, they don't own ships, they don't have the \nexpense of having an entire shipping company at their disposal in \nbuilding ships and operating ships and everything else.\n  Yet under the Gorton amendment, they would want to be treated just \nlike a shipper would be treated and yet not have any of the expenses of \na common carrier. That is wrong. That is why it was not done. It is \nwrong to say they are going to get special treatment and be treated \njust like an international shipping company with all of their expenses \nbecause in fact they are not so. Yet the Gorton amendment would \nbasically accord these intermediary companies, who actually do not \nperform any transportation function itself, the same contractual rights \nthat an ocean carrier enjoys, without any of the expense, without any \nof the liability, without any of the responsibility. That is simply not \nright, and it is not correct.\n  I submit that this is a hindrance to small business because the small \nNVOCCs could not do this. They do not have enough cargo to be able to \nprovide these types of special deals. So the small NVOCCs would not be \nhelped at all. What it would help basically is a large number of \nforeign NVOCCs, particularly from the European theater, who would be \nable to assimilate large enough amounts of cargo in order to \nparticipate under the Gorton amendment.\n  This would not help small intermediaries at all. They simply do not \nhave the capacity to benefit from it. Small NVOCCs, by virtue of the \nmodest cargoes that they handle, as I have said, would not be able to \ntake advantage of the Gorton amendment. Only the big, huge \nmegacompanies out of Europe and foreign companies who are our \ncompetition would be able to participate. America's small businesses, I \nthink, do not deserve this type of treatment.\n  So I just conclude by saying, No. 1, it not fair to the small \ncompanies in America. It helps the larger ones basically in Europe; and \nthat is not our responsibility. In addition to that, it is a killer \namendment. The 4 years of hard work led by so many on this committee--\nincluding Senator Gorton, who has been, I think, very helpful in \nputting this package together; we differ on this one amendment--but the \nwhole thing would go down the drain, and we would not have the moderate \nreform of the Shipping Act that I think is so important. I hope at the \nappropriate time those who are managing the legislation, Senator \nHutchison and others, will make a motion to table the Gorton amendment. \nI intend to support that motion to table and hope that in fact it is \ntabled and we can go along and proceed to final passage in an expedited \nfashion.\n  Mr. President, we have been laboring long and hard over the past four \nyears to reformulate, and further deregulate the ocean shipping \nindustry. S. 414, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act, reflects an effort to \ncompromise the sometimes dissimilar interests of the international \nocean shipping industry, from the ocean carriers and shippers and \nshipping intermediaries to the interests of U.S. ports and port-related \nlabor interests such as longshoremen and truckers. The effort to \nprovide further deregulation has been difficult due to some of the \nunique characteristics of international liner shipping. Currently, \nevery nation affords ocean liner shipping companies an exemption from \nthe relevant antitrust or competition policies that regulate \ncompetition for domestic companies. Given the need to provide some \nregulatory oversight to protect against abuse of the grant of antitrust \nimmunity, it has been difficult to balance the desire for further \nderegulation. However, I feel that we have reached a workable agreement \nwhich almost all parties can support.\n  It is safe to say that our ocean shipping industry affects all of us \nin the United States as currently 96% of our international trade is \ncarried on board ships, but very few of us fully understand the ocean \nshipping industry. International ocean shipping is an over half a \ntrillion dollar annual industry that is inextricably linked to our \nfortunes in international trade. It is a unique industry, in that \ninternational maritime trade is regulated by more than just the \npolicies of the United States, in fact, it is regulated by every nation \ncapable of accepting vessels that are navigated on the seven seas. It \nis a complex industry to understand because of the multinational nature \nof the trade, and its regulation is different from any of our domestic \ntransportation industries such as trucking, rail, or aviation.\n  The ocean shipping industry provides the most open and pure form of \ntrade in international transportation. For instance, trucks and \nrailroads are only allowed to operate on a domestic basis, and foreign \ntrucks and railroads are required to stop at border locations, with \ncargo for points further inland transported by U.S. firms. \nInternational aviation is subject to restrictions imposed as a result \nof bilateral trade agreements, that is, foreign airlines can only come \ninto the United States if bilateral trade agreements provide access \ninto the United States. However, international maritime trade is not \nrestricted at all, and treaties of friendship, commerce, and navigation \nguarantee the right of vessels from anywhere in the world to deliver \ncargo to any point in the United States that is capable of \naccommodating the navigation of foreign vessels.\n  The Federal Maritime Commission (``FMC'') is charged with regulating \nthe international ocean shipping liner industry. The ocean shipping \nliner industry consists of those vessels that provide regularly \nscheduled services to U.S. ports from points abroad, in large part, the \ntrade consists of containerized cargo that is capable of being moved on \nan international basis. The Federal Maritime Commission does not \nregulate the practices of ocean shipping vessels that are not on \nregularly scheduled services, such as vessels chartered to carry oil or \nchemicals, or bulk grain or coal carriers. One might ask why regulate \nthe ocean liner industry, and not bulk shipping industry? The answer is \nthat the ocean liner industry enjoys a worldwide exemption from the \napplication of U.S. antitrust laws and foreign competition policies. \nAlso, the ocean liner industry is required to provide a system of \n``common carriage,'' that is, our law requires carriers to provide \nservice to any importer or exporter on a fair, and non-discriminatory \nbasis.\n  The international ocean shipping liner industry is not a healthy \nindustry, in general, it is riddled with trade distorting practices, \nchronic over-capacity, and fiercely competitive carriers. In fact, \nrates have plunged in the trans-pacific trade to the degree that \nimporters and exporters are expressing concerns about the overall \nhealth of the shipping industry. The primary cause of liner shipping \novercapacity is the presence of international policies designed to \npromote national-flag carriers and also to ensure strong shipbuilding \ncapacity in the interest of national security. These policies include \nsubsidies to purchase ships and to operate ships, tax advantages to \nlower costs, cargo reservation schemes, and national control of \nshipyards and shipping companies. This results in an industry which is \nnot completely driven by economic objectives. For instance, one of the \nlargest shipping companies in the world, China Overseas Shipping \nCompany (``COSCO'') is operated by the government of China, much in the \nway the U.S. government controls the Navy, however, the government of\n\n[[Page S3308]]\n\nChina is not constrained by considerations that plague private sector \ncompanies.\n  Historically, ocean shipping liner companies attempted to combat \n``rate wars'' that had developed because of the situation of over-\ncapacity by establishing shipping conferences to coordinate the \npractices and pricing policies of liner shipping companies. The first \nshipping conference was established in 1875, but it was not until 1916 \nthat the U.S. government reviewed the conference system. The Alexander \nCommittee (named after the then-Chairman of the House Committee on \nMerchant Marine and Fisheries) recommended continuing the conference \nsystem in order to avoid ruinous ``rate wars'' and trade instability, \nbut also determined that conference practices should be regulated to \nensure that their practices did not adversely impact shippers. All \nother maritime nations allow shipping conferences to exist immune from \nthe application of antitrust or competition laws, and presently no \nnation is considering changes to their shipping regulatory policies.\n\n  In the past, U.S. efforts to apply antitrust principles to the ocean \nshipping liner industry were met with great difficulty, since foreign \ngovernments objected to the application of U.S. antitrust laws to the \nbusiness interests of their shipping companies, and to the exclusion of \ntheir own laws on competition policy. Many nations have enacted \nblocking statutes to expressly prevent the application of U.S. \nantitrust laws to the practices of their shipping companies. As a \nresult of these blocking statutes, U.S. antitrust laws would only be \nable to reach U.S. companies and would destroy their ability to compete \nwith foreign companies. With the difficulties in applying our antitrust \nlaws, U.S. ocean shipping policy has endeavored to regulate ocean \nshipping practices to ensure both that the grant of antitrust immunity \nis not abused and that our regulatory structure does not contradict the \nregulatory practices of foreign nations.\n  The current regulatory statute that governs the practices of the \nocean liner shipping industry, is the Shipping Act of 1984. The \nShipping Act of 1984 was enacted in response to changing trends in the \nocean shipping industry. The advent of intermodalism and \ncontainerization of cargo drastically changed the face of ocean \nshipping, and nearly all liner operations are now containerized. Prior \nto the Shipping Act of 1984, uncertainty existed as to whether \nintermodal agreements were within the scope of antitrust immunity \ngranted to carriers. In addition, carrier agreements were subject to \nlengthy regulatory scrutiny under a public interest-type of standard. \nDissatisfaction with the regulatory structure led to hearings and \nlegislative review in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In the wake of \npassage of legislation deregulating the trucking and railroad industry, \nderegulation of the ocean shipping industry was accomplished with the \nenactment of the Shipping Act of 1984.\n  The Shipping Act of 1984 continues antitrust immunity for agreements \nunless the FMC seeks an injunction against any agreement it finds ``is \nlikely, by a reduction of competition, to produce an unreasonable \nreduction in transportation service or an unreasonable increase in \ntransportation cost.'' The Act also clarifies that agreements can be \nfiled covering intermodal movements, thus allowing ocean carriers to \nmore fully coordinate ocean shipping services with shore-side services \nand surface transportation. One can easily measure the success of this \nprovision, in examining the number of railroad double stack services, a \nrail service that was actually pioneered by U.S.-flag shipping \ncompanies, that have promulgated since the enactment of the Shipping \nAct of 1984.\n  The Shipping Act of 1984 attempts to harmonize the twin objectives of \nfacilitating an efficient ocean transportation system while controlling \nthe potential abuses and disadvantages inherent in the conference \nsystem. The Act maintains the requirement that all carriers publish \ntariffs and provide rates and services to all shippers without unjust \ndiscrimination, thus continuing the obligations of common carriage. In \norder to provide shippers with a means of limiting conference power, \nthe Shipping Act of 1984 made three major changes: (1) it allowed \nshippers to utilize service contracts, but required the essential terms \nof the contract to be filed and allowed similarly situated shippers the \nright to enter similar contracts; (2) it allowed shippers the right to \nset up shippers associations, in order to allow collective cargo \ninterests to negotiate service contracts; and (3) it mandated that all \nconference carriers had the right to act independently of the \nconference in pricing or service options upon ten days' notice to the \nconference.\n  Amendments to the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, and the passage of the \nForeign Shipping Practices Act of 1988, strengthened the FMC's \noversight of foreign shipping practices and the practices of foreign \ngovernments that adversely impact conditions facing U.S. carriers and \nshippers in foreign trade. The FMC effectively utilized its trade \nauthorities last year to challenge restrictive port practices in Japan, \nand after a tense showdown, convinced the Japanese to alter their \npractices that restrict the opportunity of carriers to operate their \nown marine terminals. The changes that will be required to be \nimplemented under this agreement will save consumers of imports and \nexporters trading to Japan, millions of dollars, and the FMC deserves \npraise for hanging tough in what was undeniably a tense situation.\n  Ten years later, after the enactment of the Shipping Act of 1984, we \nstarted anew on the process of providing a deregulated shipping \nenvironment to allow our shippers to become more competitive in \ninternational trade, and to provide more contractual flexibility to our \nocean shipping companies. After four years of stops and starts, I think \nthat we have reached a point where nearly all sectors of the maritime \ntransportation community can get behind a common proposal for change. \nIt has not been easy to balance the different interest involved in this \nlegislation because of the competing differences of each of their \nneeds, but I think that we have had each of the different sectors \nwilling to give up a little of what they hoped to get in order to move \nthe bill forward, and I would congratulate the private sector \nrepresentatives for their willingness to compromise to move the process \nforward.\n  The Ocean Shipping Reform Act moves forward to provide further \nderegulation to the ocean shipping industry, while at the same time, \nbalancing the need for a degree of oversight given the continued \nprovision of immunity from antitrust laws. The bill will not alter the \nstructure of the FMC. The FMC is a small independent agency with an \nannual appropriation of $15 million which oversees over one half a \ntrillion dollars of trade. It is important to note, that the agency's \nstatus of independence allows it to effectively fulfill its trade \nopening related functions without interference from other sorts of \nconsiderations. We had considered the possibility of merging the \nfunctions of the Federal Maritime Commission and the Surface \nTransportation Board, but ultimately concluded that the combination of \nthe two agencies did not save the taxpayer anything because the \nagencies would have no real overlap of responsibility.\n\n  One of the major problems in moving forward with legislative change \nin this area was the need to provide additional service contract \nflexibility and confidentiality, while balancing the need to continue \noversight of contract practices to ensure against anti-competitive \npractices immunized from our antitrust laws. I think the contracting \nproposal embodied in S. 414 adequately balances these competing \nconsiderations. The bill transfers the requirements of providing \nservice and price information to the private sector, and will allow the \nprivate sector to perform functions that had heretofore been provided \nby the government. The bill broadens the authority of the FMC to \nprovide statutory exemptions, and reforms the licensing and bonding \nrequirements for ocean shipping intermediaries.\n  I have been contacted by Senators Lautenberg and Moynihan about their \nconcerns for the freight forwarding community, and their desire to set \nmandatory or reasonable compensation for forwarding services provided \nunder a shipping contract. While we were unable to provide a legal \nrequirement for forwarder compensation, I would urge the FMC to \ncontinue to be vigilent to ensure that forwarders and forwarding\n\n[[Page S3309]]\n\nexpertise is not jeopardized in this new and more deregulated \nenvironment. The forwarding community provides valuable expertise to \nthe shipping community and I will continue to monitor the impacts of \nthis legislation to ensure that it does not adversely impact \nforwarders. Additionally, we were able to provide less stringent report \nguidance about what sort of activity should be monitored by the FMC to \nensure against unjust discrimination against shipping intermediaries at \nthe request of Senator Harkin, and I would like to thank him for his \nimput on this legislation.\n  Importantly, the bill does not change the structure of the Federal \nMaritime Commission. The FMC is a small agency with a annual budget of \nabout 14 million dollars. When you subtract penalties and fines \ncollected over the past seven years, the annual cost of agency \noperations is less than $7 million. All told, the agency is a bargain \nto the U.S. taxpayer as it oversees the shipping practices of over $500 \nbillion in maritime trade. Added benefit to the U.S. public accrues \nwhen the FMC is able to break down trade barriers that cost importers \nand exporters millions in additional costs, such as what recently \noccurred when the FMC challenged restrictive Japanese port practices.\n  The FMC is an independent regulatory agency that is not accountable \nto the direction of the administration. Independency allows the FMC to \nmaintain a more aggressive and objective posture when it comes to the \nconsideration of eliminating foreign trade barriers. When we first \nassessed the issue of agency structure we considered appending the \nfunctions of the FMC to a new enlarged Surface Transportation Board \n(``STB''). However, the functions performed by the STB are quite \ndifferent than the FMC functions that would remain after implementation \nof the deregulatory changes provided in S. 414 and the Congressional \nBudget Office did not estimate any savings through a merger approach. \nAdditionally, the initial proposal to merge the functions of the FMC \nand the STB would have run afoul of the Appointments Clause of the \nConstitution. Ultimately, we decided to pursue solely the needed \nregulatory changes, and not needlessly alter the structure of the \nagency for no real purpose.\n  S. 414 also provides some additional protection to longshoremen who \nwork at U.S. ports. The concerns expressed by U.S. ports and port-\nrelated labor interests revolved around reductions in the transparency \nafforded to shipping contracts, and the potential abuse that could \noccur as a result of carrier antitrust immune contract actions. In \norder to address the concerns of longshoremen who have contracts for \nlongshore and stevedoring services, S. 414 sets up a mechanism to allow \nthe longshoremen to request information relevant to the enforcement of \ncollective bargaining agreements.\n  I would also like to thank Senators Hutchison, Lott and Gorton for \ntheir efforts on this bill. Additionally, the following staffers spent \nmany hours meeting with the affected members of the shipping public and \nlistening to their concerns about our proposal and I would like to \npersonally thank Jim Sartucci, Carl Bentzel, Clyde Hart, and Jim Drewry \nof the Commerce Committee staff, Carl Biersack of Senator Lott's staff, \nJeanne Bumpus of Senator Gorton's staff, Amy Henderson of Senator \nHutchison's staff as well as my own staffers, Mark Ashby and Paul \nDeveau. It is my hope that our progress on ocean shipping will spill \nover to our efforts to implement the OECD Shipbuilding Trade Agreement, \nso we can move forward with another positive piece of legislation for \nthe maritime industries.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, my friend from Louisiana makes a curious \nset of arguments. The single word he used most in his remarks was \n``compromise,'' that this provision is now the result of a compromise \nof 4 years' work. No; this provision is not the result of 4 years of \nwork. This provision is the result of a discussion that took place \nafter this bill was reported from the Commerce Committee, after all of \nthe open public hearings and all the open discussion. And what kind of \ncompromise was it? Well, it was a compromise between the big unions, \nthe big carriers and maybe some of the big shippers. It isn't a \ncompromise that involved its victims.\n  No representative of small shippers was in the room where this \n``compromise'' was made. None of the small businessmen who were \nmiddlemen were in the room when this ``compromise'' was made. A curious \ncompromise, I must say, when the victims were excluded from it, after \nhaving been a part of everything that went on for the 4 years of work \non this bill up through and including its report from the Commerce \nCommittee. No, this was not a compromise; this was a backroom deal, the \nworst kind of backroom deal.\n  The Senator from Louisiana says, ``Carefully, carefully crafted.'' \n``Killer amendment.'' Strange. I don't see any dissent on the Commerce \nCommittee, Republicans or Democrats, with the bill in its original \nform. How can it be a killer amendment?\n  Does the Senator from Louisiana mean that, if we pass this amendment, \nevery Member of his party will then filibuster the bill? Simply because \nwe have not done the will of the longshoremen's unions, they will give \nup competition and open shipping, lock, stock and barrel across the \nboard? Well, if that is what he means--if that is what they mean, let \nthem say so. It isn't going to kill the bill over here; and I do not \nthink it will kill the bill over there.\n  What do outsiders say about it? Today's Journal of Commerce, the \nnewspaper that deals with business, endorses this bill. It says:\n\n       Today, the Senate is expected to approve a bill that boosts \n     competition and makes it easier for shipping lines and their \n     customers to operate.\n       In one respect, however, this bill actually limits \n     competition by denying freight consolidators--middlemen--full \n     opportunity under the new law.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Lately, however, middlemen have become an important export \n     conduit and even a threat to the status quo. Not \n     surprisingly, it was the major shipping lines and labor \n     unions that teamed up to deny to consolidators private \n     contracting privileges.\n\n  In other words, they have given themselves the ability to do business \nin a way they now want to deny to others in the same business. The only \ndifference is the people who made this ``compromise'' are big and the \nones who are victimized are small.\n  This amendment is consistent with the philosophy of the bill. It was \nincluded in the bill in every stage to this point. It is backed by \neveryone who deals with this issue objectively. It will not kill the \nbill, unless there are 41 Members here who will simply vote to kill the \nbill on behalf of one small set of labor unions who want a monopoly. \nAnd I do not think that will happen.\n  We should do the right thing and pass the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the article in the \nJournal of Commerce, which is dated April 21, 1998; a statement in \nsupport by the Transportation Intermediaries Association, dated April \n20, 1998; and a letter from the New York/New Jersey Foreign Freight \nForwarders and Brokers Association, Inc., dated April 20, 1998, printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Journal of Commerce, April 21, 1998]\n\n                       Ship Deregulation Promise\n\n       After three years of tortured debate, a congressional bid \n     to curb regulation of the ocean shipping business is at a \n     critical stage. Today, the Senate is expected to approve a \n     bill that boosts competition and makes it easier for shipping \n     lines and their customers to operate.\n       In one respect, however, this bill actually limits \n     competition by denying freight consolidators--middlemen--full \n     opportunity under the new law. Even with this blight, the \n     bill deserves support. But senators should be aware of its \n     tainted nature and the culprits who shaped it, and revisit it \n     later to fix its shortcomings.\n       The shipping bill scheduled for debate today lets ocean \n     carriers and their customers, for the first time, negotiate \n     direct, confidential contracts--without influence from the \n     cartels that define this business. Thus, parties in the \n     maritime industry would enjoy the same contracting privileges \n     as other buyers and sellers of transportation.\n       With one important exception.\n       The bill does not let ocean freight consolidators--\n     companies that pool small export shipments, then buy space \n     aboard\n\n[[Page S3310]]\n\n     ships--sign private contracts with their customers. \n     Confidential contracting is important to carriers and \n     shippers because it allows them to negotiate deals free from \n     competitors' prying eyes. If consolidators--or non-vessel-\n     operating common carriers--do not have the same right, they \n     could have trouble keeping customers and striking good deals.\n       At the time of the 1984 Shipping Act, freight consolidators \n     were not a major industry force. Lately, however, middlemen \n     have become an important export conduit and even a threat to \n     the status quo. Not surprisingly, it was the major shipping \n     lines and labor unions that teamed up to deny to \n     consolidators private contracting privileges.\n       The unions are predictably doing whatever they can to hurt \n     non-union companies. Ocean carriers take a more subtle tack, \n     arguing that companies that don't have ships shouldn't have \n     the same privileges as those that do.\n       Ultimately the carriers' arguments are just as self-serving \n     as the unions'. Low-overhead middlemen are an important part \n     of many industries, brokering deals, arbitraging markets and \n     holding down prices. This sometimes exerts price pressure on \n     higher cost operators; in this case, shipping lines. The \n     carriers hope to deny consolidators private contracting \n     rights to curb a competitive threat. That is wrong.\n       To correct this problem, Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., will \n     offer an amendment today that extends private contracting to \n     freight consolidators. It doesn't stand much of a chance, \n     however. Why? Because supporters say the shipping bill is a \n     delicate compromise that could blow apart if the careful \n     balance between carriers, shippers, ports and labor is \n     disturbed. Part of that balance is to hammer consolidators.\n       Distasteful as that is, the bill is still worth passing. \n     The basic contracting freedoms it offers are simply too \n     important to be delayed yet again. Fortunately, some \n     consolidators may have a way around the bill's restrictions. \n     Shippers' associations--groups of shippers who pool their \n     business to get better rates--have full contracting rights \n     under the bill, so consolidators working with them may be \n     able to sidestep the bill's restrictions.\n       Even so, the House should shine as much light as possible \n     on this issue when it considers the bill, perhaps later this \n     year. The ``delicate compromise'' argument likely will \n     prevail there as well, but the issue still needs debating.\n       If the bill becomes law, lawmakers should look for a chance \n     next year to fix the consolidator provision, a strategy the \n     bill's chief sponsor, Sen. Kay Baley Hutchison, R-Texas, \n     hinted at earlier this month. If deregulation is to yield \n     real benefits, everyone must have the same right to compete, \n     not just those who wield the biggest sticks.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Support Gorton Amendment to S. 414, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of \n                                  1998\n\n       The Transportation Intermediaries Association (TIA) urges \n     you to support Senator Slade Gorton's amendment to the Ocean \n     Shipping Reform Act of 1998. Passage of the Gorton amendment \n     April 21 is essential to permit the benefits of deregulation \n     to flow to small business as well as large business.\n       The Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998 requires NVOCCs \n     (transportation intermediaries) to publish tariffs and does \n     not permit them to deviate from those tariffs in confidential \n     contracts. The bill does, however, permit the ocean carriers \n     to deviate from tariffs by entering into confidential \n     contracts. The Gorton amendment will permit both carriers and \n     transportation intermediaries to offer confidential contracts \n     to shippers.\n       This issue is important, because while large shippers can \n     enter into direct negotiations with ocean carriers, small \n     shippers usually deal with transportation intermediaries to \n     arrange for their transportation. S. 414 as it is currently \n     written will permit large shippers to know what their small \n     competitors pay for ocean freight, while the small competitor \n     will not know what the large shipper is paying. The benefits \n     of deregulation in S. 414, therefore, will flow only to big \n     business! Senator Gorton's amendment will permit all shippers \n     to benefit from ocean carrier deregulation through the right \n     to confidential contracting for ocean freight transportation.\n       Transportation intermediaries have the ability to enter \n     into confidential contracts with their shipper customers and \n     with motor carriers, railroads, and airlines. Forwarders \n     based in other countries can enter into confidential \n     contracts for ocean carriage anywhere in the world except to \n     or from the U.S. It is baffling why the Senate would treat \n     U.S. ocean carriage differently than other modes of \n     transportation and ocean carriage everywhere else in the \n     world. It will be American small businesses that suffer \n     because of this distinction.\n       TIA is the leading organization of North American \n     transportation intermediaries.

Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senator, Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Re: S. 414: The ``Gorton Amendment''--Votes YES for Small \n         Business and US Exports\n\n       Dear Senator Graham: On Tuesday morning S. 414 will come \n     before the Senate and Senator Slade Gorton will offer an \n     amendment on behalf of small exporters and shippers. Members \n     of the New York/New Jersey Foreign Freight Forwarders & \n     Brokers Association, Inc. encourage you to vote YES on the \n     Gorton Amendment and help make the Ocean Shipping Reform Act \n     true ``reform'' for small business and US exports.\n       S. 414 is about international trade. The Gorton Amendment \n     is about whether the small guy is going to benefit from this \n     legislation or suffer as a result of special interests. \n     Voting YES on the Gorton Amendment will help to protect in \n     the global commerce of the 21st Century the 70% of U.S. \n     exports that small shippers produce. The Gorton Amendment \n     helps ensure that the small shipper and business will be able \n     to compete by enabling the freight consolidator (NVOCC), who \n     works on behalf of smaller shippers, to sign confidential \n     contracts with the shipper-client. Without the Gorton \n     Amendment, large multi-national companies, that don't use \n     NVOCCs, would be able to sign confidential contracts with the \n     steamship companies--but since the NVOCCs would not be able \n     to sign contracts with their shipper-clients, small business' \n     transportation costs will NOT be confidential--unlike their \n     larger competitors. This is not reform.\n       The ironic twist to this debate is that the Senate Commerce \n     Committee initially recommended that NVOCCs be able to sign \n     contacts with shippers--but longshore labor and some carriers \n     used the legislative process to advance their dislike for \n     consolidators--and small shippers. As it stands now, S. 414 \n     would please labor, large shippers and carriers, and place \n     the small shipper at a severe disadvantage and impede the \n     entry of small business in the global marketplace. The \n     question is simple: Do you support small business? The Gorton \n     Amendment helps to right the wrong done to small shippers. We \n     urge you to support small business and vote YES of on the \n     Gorton Amendment.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                 Louis Policastro,\n                                 Vice President, Export Committee.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I would just, as we move toward a vote on \nthis measure, make one other comment, and that is that it is very clear \nthat there is a great deal of support for the current bill that is on \nthe floor. And there is pretty much across-the-board opposition to the \namendment that Senator Gorton is offering. And it is across the board \nin the sense that it is opposed by all segments of the industry.\n  I want to have printed in the Record, and ask unanimous consent to do \nso, a letter addressed to myself in opposition to the Gorton amendment.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         Supporters of S. 414.\n\n                                    Arlington, VA, March 11, 1998.\n     Re Opposition to Senator Gorton Amendment.\n\n     Hon. John B. Breaux,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Breaux: We wish to convey to you our full \n     support for the managers' floor amendment for S. 414, The \n     Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998, without additional \n     amendments. It represents a carefully crafted compromise \n     serving a broad cross section of the maritime industry \n     including importers/exporters, ports, carriers, and labor.\n       We understand that Senator Slade Gorton plans to offer an \n     amendment to S. 414 managers floor amendment that would alter \n     current law and allow non-vessel operating common carriers \n     (NVOCCs) to offer confidential service contracts directly to \n     the proprietary owners of the cargo. Some interests have \n     argued that the retention of current law would disadvantage \n     smaller volume shippers who might utilize NVOCC's in order to \n     obtain competitive rates with larger volume shippers.\n       However, the perceived benefits that smaller shippers might \n     receive from the ability of NVOCCs to enter into service \n     contracts with their customers is largely misunderstood. \n     Under current law, NVOCCs are allowed to enter into service \n     contracts with carriers and this can generate a significant \n     cost savings that is passed onto shippers. This would not \n     change under the latest version of S. 414. NVOCC's would \n     however benefit from the provisions allowing confidentiality \n     of certain terms in their contracts with carriers. Smaller \n     volume shippers would also\n\n[[Page S3311]]\n\n     have the option to consolidate their cargoes by joining \n     shippers associations who may then negotiate lower rates as \n     larger volume shippers.\n       Therefore, we urge you to oppose the Gorton amendment. This \n     amendment is unnecessary and would kill legislation which has \n     been carefully constructed by the bill's sponsors to make \n     U.S. ocean shipping law compatible with the rest of the \n     transportation industry and which will benefit the U.S. \n     economy.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Association of Port Authorities; APL, Limited; \n           Council of European and Japanese Shipowners' \n           Associations; Crowley Maritime Corporation; Internal \n           Longshoremen's Association; International \n           Longshoremen's & Warehousemen's Union; The Chamber of \n           Shipping of America; The National Industrial \n           Transportation League; Sea-Land Service, Inc.; \n           Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. The letter basically says that:\n\n       We understand that Senator Slade Gorton plans to offer an \n     amendment . . . that would alter current law and allow non-\n     vessel operating common carriers (NVOCCs) to offer \n     confidential service contracts directly to the proprietary \n     owners of the cargo. Some interests have argued that the \n     retention of current law would disadvantage smaller volume \n     shippers who might utilize [the non-vessel operating common \n     carriers] in order to obtain competitive rates with larger \n     volume shippers.\n\n  They point out:\n\n       However, the perceived benefits that smaller shippers might \n     receive from the ability of NVOCCs to enter into service \n     contracts with their customers is largely misunderstood. \n     Under current law, NVOCCs are allowed to enter into service \n     contracts with carriers and this can generate a significant \n     cost savings that is passed onto shippers. This would not \n     change under the latest version of S. 414. NVOCCs would \n     however benefit from the provisions allowing confidentiality \n     of certain terms in their contracts with carriers. Smaller \n     volume shippers would also have the option to consolidate \n     their cargoes by joining shippers associations who may then \n     negotiate lower rates as larger volume shippers.\n\n  The point is pretty clear that this group opposes the amendment of \nthe Senator from Washington. I would like to list for the Record the \nones who have signed this letter because it indeed is significant, and \nthat is across-the-board opposition.\n  It is signed by the American Association of Port Authorities; by \nAmerican President Lines, Limited; by the Council of European and \nJapanese Shipowners' Associations; by the Crowley Maritime Corporation, \na major shipping company; the International Longshoremen's Association; \nby The Chamber of Shipping of America; by The National Industrial \nTransportation League; by Sea-Land Service, one of the largest carriers \nin the world; by the Transportation Trades Department of the AFL-CIO.\n  So whether you are talking about the workers who handle the cargo, or \nby the port authorities who have the cargo shipped through their ports, \nor by the ship carriers who are actually carrying the cargo, it is \npretty unanimous agreement that this is not the right thing to do.\n  Let us support the compromise. Everything in that compromise is a \npositive step forward. It may not be as much as some would want, but it \nis far better than the current law. It allows some more decontrol, \nallows some more deregulation, more competition. And that is good. But \nit is simply unfair to say to people who have no responsibility for \nowning ships or the expense of running ships that they are going to \nallow them to have the same advantages as a shipping company does. It \nsimply would break the balance in this industry, which I think is very \nimportant to preserve.\n\n  I think the bill is a good bill. It took 4 years to get us to this \npoint. These compromises were not entered into behind the scenes, but \nwere debated on a regular basis among all the active participants. This \nis a good bill. It should be passed.

It was my intention to \nvote yea. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to have a \nchange of my vote reflected in the Record. It in no way changes the \noutcome of the vote. I did not note it was a motion to table rather \nthan the substance of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Hutchison, \nLott, and Breaux amendment to S. 414. This amendment reflects a fair \nand reasoned compromise among the various interests affected by the \nbill. While I am no great fan of deregulation, I do believe that it is \nnecessary to balance the interests affected by the bill in order not to \nadversely impact or destroy any particular sector. I am particularly \npleased that the amendment preserves the Federal Maritime Commission \n(FMC) as an independent agency to oversee our waterborne foreign \ncommerce.\n  As introduced and reported out of Committee, S. 414 would have merged \nthe FMC and Surface Transportation Board (STB) into a new entity to be \nknown as the Intermodal Transportation Board (ITB), placed within the \nDepartment of Transportation (DOT). The Hutchison, Lott, and Breaux \namendment alleviates several problems with this approach.\n  In the first place, there are no overlaps in jurisdiction or \nfunctions between the FMC and the STB that in any way hamper effective \nregulation. There are simply no significant synergies between the FMC's \nmandate to protect U.S. international ocean commerce and the STB's \nresponsibilities with respect to domestic railroad mergers, rate \nregulation, and the like. Moreover, given the two vastly different \nconstituencies and the two entirely different systems of regulation, \nthere would have been a continuing\n\n[[Page S3312]]\n\nstruggle to determine priorities and to allocate scarce resources \nwithin a merged agency. Lastly, even though there might be some \nmarginal savings in administrative expenses from such a merger, these \nwould be offset by the more substantial costs of combining and \nrelocating the two agencies. I understand that when the FMC was \nrequired by the General Services Administration to relocate in 1992, \nthe moving costs to the government were $1 million.\n  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has determined that if the two \nagencies were merged, the ``ongoing costs to carry out the new board's \nresponsibilities would be about the same as those incurred by the FMC \nand the STB under current law.'' Clearly then, the combining of these \ntwo agencies could not be justified by any cost savings that would \naccrue to the government.\n  I would also note that during the ocean shipping reform process, the \nvast majority of the commenters have supported an independent, free-\nstanding agency to oversee our waterborne foreign commerce. Those \nsentiments were initially expressed by the South Carolina State Ports \nAuthority and have subsequently been endorsed by many others. This \nincludes the three U.S. shipping companies who otherwise supported the \nbill but stated that ``the Federal Maritime Commission has done a \nsuperb job,'' and ``[o]ur strong preference would be to preserve the \nagency's structure as an independent agency.'' Others who joined in \nsupport of an independent FMC include: the International Longshoremen's \nand Warehousemen's Union; the Transportation Trades Department, AFL-\nCIO; the National Customs Brokers & Forwarders Association of America, \nInc.; the NY/NJ Foreign Freight Forwarders and Brokers Association; the \nCouncil of European and Japanese National Shipowners' Association; and \nthe American Association of Port Authorities, as well as many \nindividual port authorities. Further, it is my understanding that the \ncoalition supporting this amendment supports, in toto, the retention of \nthe FMC in its present form. A change in the agency's structure could \nserve to fracture that fragile coalition of support for the amendment.\n  Another reason I support the amendment is that merging the FMC into \nthe STB would have sent the wrong message to our trading partners--\ni.e., that the new agency would be constrained from taking direct and \nimmediate action against unfair foreign shipping practices. The FMC has \nbeen able to effectively combat unfair trading practices of foreign \ngovernments largely because of its status as an independent agency. The \nagency has an international reputation for aggressively and swiftly \naddressing restrictive shipping practices without the threat of \ndiplomatic interference or retaliation in other sectors. In fact, I \nwould hope that some of our other trade agencies could learn a thing or \ntwo from the FMC. Both the Department of State and DOT regularly cite \nthe FMC's independence to persuade foreign governments that maritime \nissues must be addressed directly and expeditiously. In fact, Admiral \nHerberger, former Administrator of the Maritime Administration (MarAd), \ntestified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee that the FMC's \nindependent status has been critical to MarAd's success in negotiations \nwith foreign governments. Also, in his August 5, 1997, letter to the \nJapanese Ministry of Transport, Secretary of Transportation Rodney \nSlater cited the FMC's authority to impose sanctions while urging Japan \nto reform its port practices.\n\n  The agency's recent actions against Japanese port restrictions are a \nperfect example of its successful accomplishments. The agency took \ndecisive action to address Japanese intransigence on easing \nrestrictions which impede the operations of U.S. carriers. As an \nindependent agency, the FMC did not have to overcome the hurdles or \nvarious pressures imposed by other Executive branch departments within \nthe Administration that have competing interests. And this body, by a \n100 to zero vote, in S. Res. 140, endorsed the action taken by the FMC \nto respond to the unfair practices of Japan.\n  Supporting this amendment and the FMC ensures that the agency's \neffectiveness will not be impeded, and sends the right message to our \ntrading partners: that the U.S. Congress endorses an aggressive stance \nagainst foreign-imposed restrictions on open competition in shipping.\n  I would further note that by retaining the FMC as an independent \nagency, the amendment alleviates the concern of some that merging the \nFMC and STB into a new entity could violate the Appointments Clause of \nthe Constitution, U.S. Const. Art. II, Sec.  2, cl. 2, to the extent \nthat STB members would be accruing new responsibilities unrelated to \nthose for which they were appointed and confirmed, and could \naccordingly subject the new agency to challenges that it is not legally \nconstituted.\n  The amendment offered by Senators Hutchison, Lott, and Breaux \ncorrects a major and potentially disastrous flaw in S. 414. I support \nthis amendment enthusiastically.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to join my colleagues \nin support of the Hutchison amendment to S. 414, the Ocean Shipping \nReform Act of 1998. I believe that this amendment further improves upon \nthe bill as reported out of the Commerce Committee and takes into \naccount and alleviates many of the concerns raised by interested \nparties who may be affected by the bill. As is true with all \ncompromises, you cannot please everybody. Nonetheless, I believe this \namendment represents a workable solution to the regulation of our \nwaterborne foreign commerce and should serve us well for many years to \ncome. I would like to commend my Chairwoman, Senator Hutchison, for her \neffort in moving this bill forward, and also thank Senators Breaux, \nLott, and Gorton for their invaluable imput into the process.\n  I am pleased to note that the bill preserves antitrust immunity for \nthe conference system which has been an integral part of our ocean \ntransportation regime since 1916. While it may be best for everyone if \nthe antitrust laws were applicable on a global basis, it is unrealistic \nto believe that we could achieve a global recognition of the value and \nutility of the Sherman Act. However, the Shipping Acts of 1916 and 1984 \nbalanced the inability to apply our antitirust laws to foreign \ncorporations, with a realistic approach allowing us to operate in \ncomity with international shipping regulatory practices, and the need \nto protect our citizens from potential abuses brought on by a lack of \nantitrust law enforcement.\n  This bill, however, makes several changes to the conference system to \nmake it more ``user-friendly'' for its shipper customers. For example, \nthe bill requires shipping conferences to allow their members to offer \nrates that are different than those of the conference--so-called \n``independent action.'' As a result, individual conference carriers can \noffer their own service contracts unimpeded by conference action. I am \nfurther pleased that the notice requirement for all independent action \nhas been reduced from 10 business days to five calendar days. This will \nensure that independently negotiated rates or service contracts will \nquickly become effective. I also support the prohibition against \nconferences requiring their members to disclose service contract \nnegotiations.\n\n  The bill as reported out of committee treated all service contracts \nequally. Subsequently, there were several attempts to develop a \nbifurcated treatment for service contracts, with one set of rules \ngoverning carrier agreement service contracts and another dealing with \nindividual carrier contracts. I am pleased that the current amendment \nreturns to a version more closely resembling that which was reported \nout of committee and, more importantly, treating all service contracts \nthe same. While there was some merit to the bifurcated treatment \napproach, it may have been very difficult to have implemented in \npractice.\n  The amendment will require that all service contracts be filed \nconfidentially with the Commission, that they contain certain essential \nterms, and that a limited number of those terms be published and made \navailable to the general public. I believe that this compromise \nrepresents the best approach to service contracting. It allows carriers \nand shippers a certain degree of confidentiality with respect to the \nbargains they have struck, while at the same time informing the general \npublic of the types of arrangements being\n\n[[Page S3313]]\n\nmade for certain commodities, for certain minimum volumes, in specific \ntrade lanes. I also believe that the continued filing of the actual \ncontracts with the Federal Maritime Commission (\"FMC\") will enable it \nto monitor them and take appropriate action if necessary. It will also \nhelp the U.S. port community in monitoring trade developments and \nreacting accordingly.\n  Like many of you, I am particularly pleased to see that the amendment \nmaintains the FMC as an independent agency overseeing the ocean \ntransportation industry. The Commission has time and again proven its \nworth in administering Congress' system of regulation and combating \nunfair foreign shipping practices, most recently in Japan. And the \nSenate unanimously backed the FMC in its action to address the unfair \npractices of Japan in passing S. Res. 140. The Commission has developed \nconsiderable expertise in implementing the Shipping Act of 1984. It \nwill now be able to bring this expertise to bear on the new era of \nocean shipping reform engendered by this bill.\n\n  Another aspect of this bill that is particularly commendable is the \nnew provision dealing with the disclosure of certain terms of service \ncontracts to labor organizations. A labor organization which is party \nto a collective bargaining agreement that includes an ocean common \ncarrier now has a mechanism for obtaining information concerning \nmovements of cargo within port areas and the assignment of certain work \nwithin those areas. It is my understanding that this type of \ninformation is especially relevant to labor organizations and this bill \nshould ensure that they will have easy access to it. This information \nwill enable them to make sure that the terms of their collective \nbargaining agreement are complied with.\n  This amendment, in my opinion, achieves a balance in S. 414 which \nprovides the best possible compromise among the broad array of \ninterests in shipping. It has not been easy to balance the many \ndisseparate interests involved, but I think that we have reached an \napproach which accomodates many of these interests. It fosters one of \nthe bill's primary goals of stimulating U.S. exports through a more \nefficient and market-reliant ocean transportation system. It provides \nfor a more effective system of industry oversight, regulating where we \nneed to and not regulating where we do not. And it keeps the FMC as an \nindependent agency, unfettered by political or other influences as it \nperforms its critical international trade functions. I support this \namendment, and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts).

Mr. President, today is a great day for America's maritime \ncommunity; for those who sailed the high seas during the final days of \nWorld War II; for those who sail the seas today in the international \ncontainer industry; and for those who will go to sea in the future.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will permit me to take a long \nview of the maritime issues being addressed by the Senate during the \n105th Congress.\n  I am a product of the maritime industry. I grew up in a maritime \ncommunity where my father built ships. The maritime world was the \nsource of my first job as a lawyer. I still live in Pascagoula, \nMississippi where the proud maritime tradition continues with Navy \ncontracts to build DDG-51 Destroyers.\n  As I grew up on Mississippi's coast, an important lesson was learned. \nOur nation was founded as a maritime nation and remains one today. We \nare a nation that must continue to invest in this vital industry.\n  As you know, this is the International Year of the Ocean and tomorrow \nis Earth Day. As we celebrate the 28th Earth Day, we recognize the \nimportance of the world's 4 oceans and 54 seas. Oceans cover more than \n75% of our globe. Oceans provide us all with vast sources of food, \nmedicine, and minerals. They provide a means for recreation, \ntransportation, and commerce. Teaming with life and resources, oceans \nare where America's merchant maritime industry must be present. Oceans \nare where our government must make a conscious decision to maintain \nAmerica's presence.\n  Many of our colleagues understand the importance of a strong, healthy \nmaritime industry. This including ports, vessel owners, vessel \noperators, shipbuilders and the workers to run the ports, sail the high \nseas or build the latest ship. In a world of increasing international \ntrade by sea, a strong maritime industry is essential to our national \nsecurity and our economic strength. This is a simple but true equation.\n  To provide a context for today's action, I want to reflect on our \nwork in the 104th Congress changed our maritime public policy. In the \nlast Congress, the Maritime Security Act of 1996 was enacted into \npublic law. It received overwhelming and bipartisan support. It was the \nfirst maritime policy change in over a decade. It was a profound change \nand has successfully reformed how our maritime industry supports our \nnation's defense.\n  This program now effectively ensures that efficient commercial ocean \ntransportation services are available to the Department of Defense for \nnational security purposes. The use of modern U.S.-flag commercial \nvessels saves DOD hundreds of millions of dollars that would otherwise \nbe required to procure additional sealift capacity. As we enter the \nappropriation cycle, I hope my colleagues will support full funding of \nthe Maritime Security Program.\n  Today, the Senate completed action on S. 414, the Ocean Shipping \nReform Act of 1998.\n  This bill will increase competition in the ocean liner shipping \nindustry and help U.S. exporters compete in the world's market. S. 414 \nwas a bipartisan compromise. It was supported by all segments of the \nindustry. Even U.S. businesses that use ocean liner services supported \nthis legislative approach. The bill is a true compromise where the many \ndiverse and competing interests benefited equally.\n  My good friend, Senator Slade Gorton, wanted to get a little bit more \nfor one of these segments, but in so doing jeopardized the Senate's \nability to pass this important legislation during this Congress by \ntaking the delicate compromise out of balance. This is why the \namendment was defeated.\n  Just for the record, non-vessel-operating common carriers are not \nreal common carriers. However, they can successfully compete with \nvessel operators. Also small shippers will continue to have equal \naccess to the transportation systems.\n  Mr. President, S. 414, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998 is a \nmajor step forward in the 105th Congress' maritime reform agenda.\n  This year's maritime bill focuses on one part of the commercial \nsegment while last year's bill dealt with the defense segment.\n\n  As with the maritime bill in the last Congress, competition is its \nhallmark. It will permit competition for the ocean liner shipping \nindustry. This means that U.S. exporters will also enhance their \ncompetitiveness in the world's market. The majority of international \ntrade is carried on ships and that is why S. 414 is so important. The \nUnited States will now have an ocean liner shipping system that enables \nAmerica to compete with other countries on a level playing field.\n  S. 414 is that level playing field.\n  This effort started back in the 104th Congress. It has taken the \nSenate a long time to develop a workable solution because the shipping \nindustry includes so many different competing segments. Balancing their \ninterests has been difficult and everyone made compromises.\n  S. 414 is solidly backed by U.S. shippers; U.S. and foreign ocean \ncarriers; U.S. ports; and U.S. labor. Achieving such strong support \nfrom such a diverse group demonstrates that the entire maritime \nindustry wants and needs this meaningful reform.\n  I call upon the House of Representatives to complete the legislative \nprocess and promptly adopt S. 414 this year. The nation's consumers, \nbusinesses, and maritime industry deserve to reap the benefits of a \nreformed ocean liner shipping system.\n  This bill is fair. This bill is needed.\n  S. 414 also contains a provision concerning World War II merchant \nmariner burial benefits, which was introduced separately as S. 61.\n  Mr. President, today the Senate also celebrates the passage of S. 61 \nanother very important piece of maritime legislation which recognizes \nthe sacrifices made by a group of merchant mariners.\n  This provision clarifies, once and for all, that those American \nmerchant mariners who served our country in World War II between August \n16, 1945 and December 31, 1946 are in fact eligible for veteran's \nfuneral and burial benefits. Just like all other World War II merchant \nmariners.\n  This legislation, originally introduced last year as the Merchant \nMarine Fairness Act, has 71 cosponsors. I want to thank each cosponsor \nfor their bipartisan support for mariners who ask to be recognized upon \ntheir deaths for service to our nation.\n  Mr. President, the overwhelming majority of World War II merchant \nmariners have already been awarded veteran status. However, through \nthis 16-month extension, the Senate recognizes in a limited, yet \nmeaningful, fashion those who stood, in harm's way, through the war's \nfinal day when on December 31, 1946 President Truman officially \ndeclared an end to hostilities.\n  Although Japan officially surrendered in August of 1945, the job was \nnot complete for our nation's merchant mariners. In fact, more \ndangerous work awaited them, and their allies.\n  Harbors in Japan, Germany, Italy, France, and other parts of the \nworld's maritime trade lanes were still filled with mines. This created \nmany hazards as merchant mariners transported Allied troops home, or \ntransported them to occupational duties. Axis stragglers also needed to \nbe transported. When the men of the U.S. merchant marine were called to \nserve, they were ready and willing. Their duties were vital to \nconsolidating the battlefield victory that our combat forces had just \nwon.\n  Let me be clear. The services performed by these merchant mariners \nwere extremely dangerous. Twenty-two U.S.-government-owned vessels--\ncarrying military cargoes--were damaged or sunk by mines after V-J Day. \nAt least four U.S. merchant mariners were killed and 28 injured aboard \nthese vessels. Those American merchant mariners who served during this \ntime did so with pride, professionalism and a dedication to their \ncountry. They deserve this simple, proper recognition.\n  I hope the House of Representatives will act swiftly on this \nlegislation, too.\n\n[[Page S3319]]\n\nBills similar to S. 61 have passed in the House of Representatives \nthree times in recent years. Already, H.R. 1126, the companion bill to \nS. 61, has more than 150 cosponsors.\n  Mr. President, our nation values the sacrifices of our veterans and \nso should Congress. The service's of these merchant mariners to America \ndeserves recognition for a job well done.\n\n  The passage of the Merchant Mariner's Fairness Act confers the title \nof veteran to a small group of elderly, surviving mariners--an \nacknowledgment they richly deserve.\n  Mr. President, I remember one of these extraordinary mariners telling \nme why it was so important to receive this official recognition and why \nthis delay has been so frustrating.\n  What that merchant mariner said, quite simply, was that he wants to \ntell his grandchildren that he too is a World War II veteran.\n  Mr. President, this particular merchant mariner and many other \nmerchant mariners deserve our nation's profound gratitude for their \nWWII service.\n  Mr. President, there is yet another important maritime bill that the \nSenate must enact this year. S. 1216.\n  This legislation will ratify and implement the OECD Shipbuilding \nAgreement. It will eliminate foreign shipbuilding subsidies and provide \na level playing field for our shipbuilding industry.\n  S. 1216 was approved by both the Finance Committee and the Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation Committee. It is ready to move to the \nSenate floor. The amendments added through separate committee actions \naddress head on and completely the concerns identified by segments of \nthe maritime community.\n  I am disappointed that a few maritime associations continue to oppose \nthis bill despite its many changes. I am disturbed by their unfortunate \nmisrepresentations.\n  Let me set the record straight on this bill. S. 1216 and the OECD \nAgreement do not threaten the Jones Act or the construction of Jones \nAct vessels. Period.\n  S. 1216 clearly excludes America's defense requirements and maritime \nfeatures while ensuring that no country may illegally subsidize its \ncommercial shipbuilding industry.\n  S. 1216 first equaled, then exceeded, the amendment offered by \nRepresentative Bateman in the 104th Congress to extend the current \nTitle XI program's terms and conditions. The Senate bill provides an \nadditional year. However, these associations moved the goalposts by \ndemanding even more exemptions.\n  S. 1216 implements OECD. It does not speak to every individual \nargument that came up during its negotiations. That is water under the \nbridge. Rather, the bill recognizes that the United States cannot out-\nsubsidize other countries' shipbuilding industries and should not try. \nIt forces these other countries to give up their subsidies.\n  On a different legislative tract, but a related issue, the Senate \nshowed that it will take steps to address shipyard subsidies. Through \nthe International Monetary Fund bill, the Senate ensured that South \nKorean shipyards are not entitled to a bail out from American \ntaxpayers.\n  S. 1216 is about ratifying this international agreement this year; \nhowever, it is clear these associations' aim is to scuttle OECD. I \nbelieve they want to shift funds from shipyards where only commercial \nvessels are built to those yards where naval vessel construction occurs \nbecause the level of military construction is decreasing. This is folly \nbecause America needs both types of shipyards for a healthy maritime \ncommunity.\n  The U.S. must preserve its commercial shipbuilding base and that \nmeans ratifying the OECD agreement. That means adopting the \nimplementing language in S. 1216 this year.\n  One last point--the Jones Act and other related cabotage related \nlegislation. There is no secret that I am an ardent supporter of the \nJones Act. I acknowledge that there are some members of Congress who do \nnot see the wisdom of protecting our domestic water-borne maritime \ntrade--just like every other coastal nation. I take it as my challenge \nto spread the wisdom and value of the Jones Act to my colleagues. I \nalso realize that the current system is not meeting the needs of every \ndomestic shipper and that is why I encourage the Jones Act maritime \nindustry and the Administration to work closely with these shippers to \nsolve their transportation needs. Still, I remain a firm believer that \nthese needs can be served by U.S.-built, U.S.-owned, U.S.-flagged, and \nU.S.-crewed ships.\n  In summary, Mr. President, the Senate has made much progress in our \nmaritime public policy agenda this year, and I hope there will be more \nbefore the 105th Congress adjourns. Maritime issues are bipartisan and \nimportant to our economy and our national security.\n  Mr. President, thank you. I want to also thank all mariners who go to \nsea to face the elements and work. I also want to thank all who work on \nshore, at the dock and in the shipyard, to enable our nation's maritime \ntransportation system to go to sea safely and profitably. It is a \nfitting tribute to pass the Ocean Shipping Act of 1998 during the \nInternational Year of the Ocean.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Senate on \nits adoption of S. 414, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998. We have \nworked long and hard to achieve the consensus necessary to move this \nbill forward. The revisions that S. 414 would make to the Shipping Act \nof 1984 will help U.S. shippers, ports, and containership operators \nsucceed in an increasingly competitive world of international trade.\n  I want to thank all Senators who worked on this bill for their key \ncontributions, especially Senator Lott, our distinguished Majority \nLeader; Senator McCain, Chairman of the Commerce Committee; and \nSenators Gorton and Breaux who ensured that all affected groups' \nconcerns were thoroughly considered and addressed. I ask the leadership \nof the House to quickly adopt S. 414 without amendment so that the \nparticipants in the ocean liner shipping industry can turn their \nefforts toward reaping the benefits of these changes.\n  Mr. President, for the record, I now want to explain some of the key \nprovisions of S. 414.\n  The most significant benefit of S. 414 is that it will provide \nshippers and common carriers with greater choice and flexibility in \nentering into contractual relationships for ocean transportation and \nintermodal services. It accomplishes this through seven specific \nchanges to the Shipping Act of 1984. It allows multiple shippers to be \nparties to the same service contract. It allows service contracts to \nspecify either a percentage or quantity of the shipper's cargo subject \nto the service contract. It prohibits multiple-ocean common carrier \ncartels from restricting cartel members from contracting with shippers \nof their choice independent of the cartel. It allows service contract \norigin and destination geographic areas, rates, service commitments, \nand liquidated damages to remain confidential. It eliminates the \nrequirement that similarly situated shippers be given the same service \ncontract rates and service conditions. It eliminates the current \nrestrictions on individual common carriers engaging in discriminatory, \npreferential, or advantageous treatment of shippers and ocean \ntransportation intermediaries in service contracts (while retaining \nthose restrictions for groups of common carriers and strengthening \nprohibitions against refusals to deal or negotiate by individual common \ncarriers). It allows groups of ocean common carriers to jointly \nnegotiate inland transportation rates, subject to the antitrust laws \nand consistent with the purposes of the 1984 Act.\n  The Commerce Committee report on S. 414 dated July 31, 1997, includes \nin pages 12 through 17 a new legislative history for section 6(g) of \nthe 1984 Act. Although a substitute amendment to the Commerce Committee \nreported version of S. 414 has been adopted by the Senate, the \nlegislative history for section 6(g) and other sections of the 1984 Act \naffected by S. 414 contained in the Committee report remains intact, to \nthe extent that the Committee reported provisions of S. 414 are not \nsubstantively amended by the substitute amendment, or the Committee \nreport legislative history is not superseded by the below comments.\n  It is anticipated that members of ocean common carrier agreements \nwill enter into individual service contracts with shippers and that, \nconsistent with section 8(c) of the 1984 Act, as amended\n\n[[Page S3320]]\n\nby S. 414, some of the terms and conditions of those service contracts \nwill not, by agreement of the contracting parties, be publicly \navailable.\n  Section 5(c) of the 1984 Act, as amended by S. 414, states that an \nagreement of ocean common carriers may not require its members to \ndisclose any service contract negotiations they may have with shippers \nor the terms and conditions of any service contracts which they may \nenter into for the transportation of cargo. It is important to note \nthat, while section 5(b) of the 1984 Act applies only to conference \nagreements, new section 5(c) would apply to all agreements among ocean \ncommon carriers, including conference agreements.\n  Any agreement requirement that members disclose confidential contract \ninformation would violate section 5(c) and subject agreement members to \npenalties under the 1984 Act, as amended by S. 414. In the event a \nmember divulged confidential contract information, that member would \nlikely be in breach of its contract with the shipper and could be held \nliable by the shipper under the contract. However, in the absence of \nany agreement requirement that disclosure be made, neither that carrier \nnor any other agreement member would be subject to penalties under the \n1984 Act, as amended by S. 414. Section 8(c)(1) of the 1984 Act, as \namended by S. 414, provides that the exclusive remedy for a breach of a \nservice contract shall be an action in an appropriate court, unless the \nparties otherwise agree.\n  Section 8(c)(2) of the 1984 Act, as amended by S. 414, would continue \nto require that all service contracts be filed with the Federal \nMaritime Commission. The purpose of this requirement is to assist the \nFMC in the enforcement of applicable provisions of United States \nshipping laws. However, other Federal agencies have expressed concerns \nover how they are to ensure ocean carrier compliance with United States \ncargo preference law requirements concerning shipping rates in an era \nof service contract rate confidentiality. The FMC is encouraged to work \nwith affected Federal agencies to address this concern.\n  S. 414 would add a new section 8(c)(4) to the 1984 Act that would \nallow a labor union with a collective bargaining agreement with an \nocean common carrier to request information from the carrier with \nrespect to cargo transported under a service contract entered into by \nthat carrier to assist the union in enforcing its collective bargaining \nagreement and would require the carrier to provide that information. \nSection 8(c)(4) envisions the release of information not necessarily \ncontained in the service contract. While the cargo transportation in \nquestion has to be made pursuant to a service contract, the carrier's \nresponse to an information request authorized by section 8(c)(4) may \nrequire the use of documents other than the service contract.\n  The purpose of section 8(c)(4) is to provide the requesting labor \nunion with information concerning certain land transportation \nservices and other services for which an ocean common carrier subject \nto a collective bargaining agreement with that labor union may be \nresponsible pursuant to a service contract. The specific language of \nsection 8(c)(4)(A) describing the work covered by that disclosure \nrequirement is intended to ensure that the ocean common carrier is not \nable to avoid compliance with the disclosure requirement by narrowly \ninterpreting the statutory language of the work covered by the \ndisclosure requirement. Section 8(c)(4), however, has no other purpose \nbut to require disclosure of specified information and is not intended \nto serve any other purpose.\n\n  The Senate understands that disputes have arisen, or may arise, \nconcerning the assignment of certain off-dock and inter-dock \ntransportation services at U.S. ports. We want to make it perfectly \nclear that nothing in this provision is intended to resolve or \ninfluence the outcome of any such dispute in any manner. The \ndescriptions of work contained in section 8(c)(4)(A) should not be \nmisinterpreted by a court or agency to imply a Congressional \nendorsement of any position in any such dispute. These issues are to be \nconsidered and determined by the appropriate agencies and courts taking \ninto consideration existing provisions of the National Labor Relations \nAct, the Taft-Hartley Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, other \nprovisions of the Shipping Act of 1984, as amended by S. 414, and other \nfederal and state laws. Nothing in these disclosure provisions should \naffect or influence the outcome of the decisions of those courts or \nagencies, one way or the other.\n  The substitute amendment to S. 414 contains several significant \nchanges with respect to the anti-discrimination provisions contained in \nsections 10(b) and 10(c) of the Commerce Committee reported version of \nS. 414 affecting shippers' associations and ocean transportation \nintermediaries that need to be clarified. These revisions by the \nsubstitute amendment remove limitations placed on these sections in the \nCommittee reported bill with respect to shippers' associations and \nocean transportation intermediaries and thus supersede the Committee's \nReport of July 31, 1997 at pages 28 and 29.\n  S. 414 is intended to promote a more competitive ocean transportation \nmarketplace. In such a marketplace, it is anticipated that small to \nmedium-sized shippers will increasingly rely upon non-profit shippers' \nassociations and other forms of transportation intermediaries in order \nto obtain access to competitive economies of scale enjoyed by the \nlargest shippers. Recognizing the important role that the small shipper \nplays in the competitiveness of the United States in the global \neconomy, S. 414 contains several strong provisions to ensure that \nshippers who seek to combine their cargo with other shippers to obtain \nvolume discounts in a shippers' association are not subjected to \nunreasonable discrimination due to their status as a shippers' \nassociation when entering into such service contracts.\n  As amended by S. 414, new section 10(b)(10) of the 1984 Act would \nmake it unlawful for a common carrier to ``unreasonably refuse to deal \nor negotiate.'' Previously, the prohibition against refusals to \nnegotiate was limited to shippers' associations. The new section \n10(b)(10) continues to provide a shippers' association or ocean \ntransportation intermediary with protection against an unreasonable \nrefusal to deal by one or more common carriers, and continues to \nprovide the other protections included in section 10(b)(12) of the \ncurrent law.\n  New sections 10(c)(7) and 10(c)(8) of the 1984 Act, as amended by S. \n414, would protect individual shippers' associations and ocean \ntransportation intermediaries against the type of conduct specified in \nthose paragraphs which is due to such person's status as a shippers' \nassociation or ocean transportation intermediary. The FMC should direct \nits enforcement efforts with respect to unreasonable discrimination due \nto a person's status as a shippers' association or ocean transportation \nintermediary for other than objective, relevant economic transportation \nfactors on those groups of ocean common carriers that have the greatest \npotential to economically harm a shippers' association or an ocean \ntransportation intermediary. S. 414 does not require identical \ntreatment of shippers' associations and affords ocean common carriers \ngreater flexibility than the current 1984 Act to differentiate their \nservice contract terms and conditions.\n  Section 10(c)(4) of the 1984 Act currently prohibits concerted action \nby ocean common carriers in negotiation of U.S. inland transportation \nrates and services with truck, rail, air, or other non-ocean carriers. \nSince the enactment of the 1984 Act, U.S. ocean common carriers have \nmade very substantial investments in inland intermodal networks in \nreliance on the protections of section 10(c)(4).\n  S. 414 would amend section 10(c)(4) to remove the current per se \nprohibition on joint negotiation of inland transportation agreements. \nS. 414 would allow joint negotiations and agreements with respect to \nthe inland portion of these ocean common carriers' intermodal \nmovements, but retain protections to ensure that U.S. inland intermodal \ncarriers are not harmed.\n  First, any such joint negotiations and agreements permitted under \nthis section must be in conformity with the antitrust laws. There is no \nintention under this provision to permit or authorize any joint \nactivity with respect to the negotiation of purchasing of U.S. inland \nservices provided by non-ocean carriers that would not be permitted \nunder the principles that apply\n\n[[Page S3321]]\n\nto joint purchasing activities under the antitrust laws.\n  Second, the joint negotiations and agreements permitted under this \nsection must be consistent with the purposes of the Act, as amended by \nS. 414 and as determined by the Federal Maritime Commission. For \nexample, the ability of joint purchasing arrangements to contribute to \nefficiencies in the U.S. transportation system in the ocean commerce of \nthe United States that are then passed on to shippers is a factor that \nmay be considered in determining whether an arrangement is consistent \nwith the purposes of the 1984 Act. Another purpose of the 1984 Act is \nthe development of an economically sound and efficient U.S.-flag liner \nfleet capable of meeting national security needs. As stated above, \nU.S.-flag liner operators have made very substantial investments in \naffiliated inland intermodal providers, and harm to these providers \nresulting from the use of market power by conferences or other groups \nof ocean common carriers would be inconsistent with the 1984 Act's \npurpose of maintaining a sound U.S.-flag liner fleet.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has adopted \nS. 414, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998. S. 414 was approved by \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on May 1, 1997. \nOver the past several months, the bill has been adjusted to address the \nconcerns of several members.\n  S. 414 would instill greater competition within the U.S. \ninternational ocean liner shipping market by ensuring that every liner \nvessel operator has the right to enter into a service contract with any \nshipper without interference from other vessel operators. This will \nallow U.S. importers and exporters to contract with vessel operators of \ntheir choice, not as directed by ocean shipping cartels.\n  Also, S. 414 would allow vessel operators and shippers who negotiate \nservice contracts to keep the rates and terms of service of those \ncontracts private. The bill would also remove the requirement that \nvessel operators provide the same contract rate and terms to other \nsimilar shippers. This change, combined with the one I just described, \nwill increase the responsiveness of ocean liner system to market \nforces.\n  The bill would also privatize the function of publishing ocean \ntransportation tariffs, which should reduce the expense of this system. \nThe bill would provide the Federal Maritime Commission adequate means \nto review and enforce tariff and service contract regulations.\n  The bill also includes a provision I added during the Commerce \nCommittee markup. This provision would require the Secretary of \nTransportation to obtain certification from the Federal Maritime \nCommission that a liner vessel operator has not violated certain U.S. \nshipping laws within the past 5 years prior to the Secretary granting \nthe operator a shipbuilding loan guarantee under title XI of the \nMerchant Marine Act, 1936.\n  I realize that S. 414 is not perfect. In my view, a lot more could be \ndone to improve competition in this business. However, in this case the \nbill makes significant progress, and should not be held up in the hope \nthat greater progress can be made in the future. I hope the other body \nwill take action on S. 414 so that the bill may be enacted this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/21/senate-section/article/S3306-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3321-S3331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          EDUCATION SAVINGS ACT FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of H.R. 2646, the Education Savings Act for Public \nand Private Schools.\n  The clerk will report the bill.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2646) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to allow tax-free expenditures from education individual \n     retirement accounts for elementary and secondary school \n     expenses, to increase the maximum annual amount of \n     contributions to such accounts, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Mack/D'Amato amendment No. 2288, to provide incentives for \n     States to establish and administer periodic teacher testing \n     and merit pay programs for elementary and secondary school \n     teachers.\n       Glenn amendment No. 2017, to delete education IRA. \n     expenditures for elementary and secondary school expenses.\n       Kennedy amendment No. 2289, to authorize funds to provide \n     an additional 100,000 elementary and secondary school \n     teachers annually to the national pool of such teachers \n     during the 10-year period beginning with 1999 through a new \n     student loan forgiveness program.\n       Coverdell (for Hutchison) amendment No. 2291, to establish \n     education reform projects that provide same gender schools \n     and classrooms, as long as comparable educational \n     opportunities are offered for students of both sexes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2289\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is a motion to table the \namendment to H.R. 2646 by the Senator from Massachusetts. There will be \n4 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  Who seeks time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the issue that is before the Senate now \nis whether we are going to take the $1.6 billion and use it in such a \nway that is going to effectively help and assist the private schools--\nbecause that is where the majority of the money is going to be \ninvested--or whether we are prepared to invest that money to increase \nthe total number of teachers.\n  Again, Mr. President, the legislation that we have before us this \nmorning will provide $1.6 billion. We have to decide whether we are \ngoing to use that money to create an IRA which will be primarily used \nto support private schools, or whether we will take that $1.6 billion \nand use to it create more teachers across this country. If we use the \n$1.6 billion, we will provide 100,000 new schoolteachers for the public \nschools across this Nation.\n  It is estimated that we are going to need 2 million new high school \nteachers. This will at least provide 100,000. It seems to me that if we \nare interested in academic achievement and accomplishment and we \nsupport our public schools, then getting highly qualified teachers to \ninvest in those schools is the way to go. That is what this amendment \ndoes. It takes the $1.6 billion and uses it to create 100,000 more \nschoolteachers rather than to use it to create additional funds to \nsupport private schools.\n  We have a modest program in our higher education bill that will \nprovide $200 million for 5 years, which is $40 million a year. That is \nbipartisan. I support it. But it is not enough. We have a major \nopportunity now to do something significantly for the public schools, \nand that is to increase the number of qualified teachers who will serve \nin our public schools.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, first, I am pleased that we are finally \ncoming to a point where we can vote on these core issues. I have three \nthings to say about the statements that have been made by the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, first, the Labor Committee has already \naddressed the issue of new teachers and done it in a more expeditious \nmanner focusing new teachers on inner-city schools.\n  Second, the effect of the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts \nis to gut and make moot the entire exercise we have been at here now \nfor 6 months. He would in effect deny 14 million families and 20 \nmillion children the benefits of education savings accounts, the \nmajority of which are public, not private. He would deny 1 million \nemployees the opportunity for continuing education and 1 million \nstudents the opportunity and benefit of State prepaid tuition plans and \n500 new schools through new school construction.\n  Later in the debate we will have another opportunity, through the \nGorton amendment, which will be discussed later this afternoon, to free \nup from Federal regulation large sums of money, over $10 billion, which \nlocal communities and States can use to address teacher shortages, if \nindeed they have them.\n\n[[Page S3322]]\n\n  I conclude by saying the effect of the amendment would be to make \nmoot this 6-month debate.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Kennedy's \namendment to the Coverdell bill, which would provide loan forgiveness \nto teachers in high need areas and subjects. Attracting well qualified \nteachers through the use of loan forgiveness is a terrific idea and one \nthat I've introduced and supported in the context of the reauthorized \nHigher Education Act. Loan forgiveness for teachers ensures that \nteachers are not saddled by excessive debt during their first crucial \nyears of teaching.\n  Just two days ago, a new report from the American Federation of \nTeachers on teacher salaries showed that, in part due to the low \nunemployment and tight labor market of recent months, teacher salaries \nare falling behind wages for other occupations and will make it even \nharder for schools to find qualified candidates.\n  Given all the other jobs that may be available, we as a nation have a \nserious problem in recruiting strong candidates for teaching. Clearly, \nloan forgiveness needs to be part of a comprehensive strategy to raise \nthe quality of teachers and attract the best candidates to the \nclassroom.\n  To help attract more teachers, this amendment proposes to provide up \nto $8,000 in loan forgiveness to teachers in high need areas or \nsubjects, as determined by local school districts. While I strongly \nsupport the amendment and its intention, there are two issues that are \nworth raising. One is that the criteria for eligibility are too broad, \nespecially given the amount of money associated with the legislation. \nMore importantly, however, the amendment does not address the basic \nissue of teacher quality outlined in the findings that preface the \nlegislation. I believe that, in order to be qualified to teach a \nsubject area, particularly on the secondary level, a teacher should \nhave a major in that subject or a related field.\n  According to a recently completed analysis of state-level student \nachievement data, states with more teachers holding full certification \nplus a major in their field do significantly better on National \nAssessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) reading and math \nexaminations. Students of teachers who completed undergraduate academic \nmajors and appropriate professional coursework achieve better than age \npeers whose teachers completed education majors, no matter how poor, \nwhat their ethnicity, or whether English is a second language.\n  For these reasons, I am glad to be working with Senator Kennedy on \nefforts to raise the quality of teaching in our classrooms and reduce \nthe financial burden on those who have entered this essential \nprofession. If we expect higher standards from students, we need to \nprovide them with teachers who have the documented content area \npreparation to help them meet those standards.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment to increase the nation's supply of qualified teachers. \nInvesting in teachers is an investment in our children, an investment \nin the future, and an investment in America. If students in communities \nacross the country are to be prepared to compete in the global \nmarketplace, we must attract and retain the best and the brightest \nteachers.\n  We know that having a qualified teacher in the classroom is one of \nthe most important influences on a child's academic success. Yet too \nmany schools are already understaffed. During the next decade, rising \nstudent enrollments and massive teacher retirements mean that the \nnation will need to hire 2 million new teachers. According to the \nNational Center for Education Statistics, between one-third and one-\nhalf of all elementary and secondary school teachers are 45 years old \nor older. The national average age of teachers is 43 years old. The \naverage age of Massachusetts teachers is 46 years old--tying the \nDistrict of Columbia for having the oldest teachers in the Nation.\n  Boston alone expects almost half of the city's teachers to retire \nover the next decade. In addition, Boston already has acute teacher \nshortages in areas such as bilingual education and high school science. \nAt the same time, Boston's student enrollment is growing by 900 \nstudents a year.\n  The teacher shortage has forced school districts to hire more than \n50,000 under-prepared teachers each year, and to ask certified teachers \nto teach outside their area of expertise. One in four new teachers does \nnot fully meet state certification requirements.\n  We need to do more--much more--to assure that quality teachers are \navailable for each and every child and classroom.\n  This amendment provides for the forgiveness of federal student loans \nas an incentive to college students to become teachers. We know that \nqualified young men and women can often make more money in private \nindustry. Many of them, burdened with heavy undergraduate and graduate \ndebts from student loans, refuse to even consider teaching as their \ncareer. Reducing the burden of their debt can be a significant \nincentive to encourage them to become teachers, and to agree to teach \nin areas where the need is greatest.\n  Attracting more qualified teachers to the teaching field over the \nnext ten years will help to address teacher shortages across the \ncountry and improve student achievement. This amendment will move us \ncloser to that goal.\n  The Labor Committee has recommended a similar provision as part of \nthe Higher Education Act Amendment. But it is entirely appropriate to \nconsider this here as part of the pending bill as well.\n  Our goal is to recruit 100,000 additional teachers over the next 10 \nyears, especially in high-need subjects such as math and science.\n  We should be doing all we can to encourage good students to become \ngood teachers. It is one of our highest priorities in education. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this amendment to help us meet that goal.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I would like to briefly explain my vote on \nthe motion to table the amendment offered by my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Kennedy, to H.R. 2646, the Education Savings Act for \nPublic and Private Schools. Despite my support for excellence in \nteaching and the need for more teachers--high-quality teachers--in the \nclassrooms across America, I voted in favor of tabling the amendment.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I realize the importance of quality \nteachers in our nation's elementary and secondary\n\n[[Page S3323]]\n\nschools. I started out in a modest two-room schoolhouse where I did not \nhave high-technology equipment or much money for supplies, but what I \ndid have were dedicated teachers who really cared about my future and \nmy education. Today, our children and grandchildren are being taught \nmathematics by teachers who have no background whatsoever in the \nsubject area--none at all! There are situations in which teachers who \nhave been trained to teach physical science instead find themselves \nteaching mathematics! That is not right, and not fair to the teacher \nor--more importantly--to the students.\n  This amendment would provide a maximum of $8,000 of loan forgiveness \nover a five-year period to graduate students entering the teaching \nprofession. Given the rising costs associated with a higher education, \nthis certainly does not amount to much in the eyes of a student faced \nwith loans totaling $50,000 or more. Nor does such an incentive help to \nbring in more teachers in demand subject areas, such as mathematics.\n  Mr. President, the issue and need is for more qualified teachers, not \njust more teachers. Teaching is a profession for which one must have a \ntrue passion as well as dedication and talent. As Aristotle stated so \neloquently in his day,\n\n       Teachers who educated children deserved more honour than \n     parents who merely gave them birth; for bare life is \n     furnished by the one, the other ensures a good life.\n\n  This amendment does not ensure that quality teachers will be brought \ninto the classrooms. While ostensibly a targeted amendment designed to \nhelp provide better teachers for Title I schools and those schools \nwhich lack quality teachers in core subject areas, it would cover over \nninety percent of all schools. Over ninety percent, Mr. President. I do \nnot call this targeted.\n  While I support the amendment in principle, I believe that it is an \nunfocused proposal at best. The amendment relies heavily on the hope \nthat limited student loan forgiveness will serve as incentive for \ngraduate students to opt into a teaching profession in lieu of a higher \npaying job. Furthermore, it does not target the schools which are truly \nin need of better quality teachers, nor does it ensure that it will be \nquality teachers in the needed subject areas who make their way into \nthe classrooms. For these reasons, Mr. President, I have voted to table \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is amendment No. 2291 by \nthe Senator from Texas to H.R. 2646. There will be 30 minutes of debate \nequally divided.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \nscheduled for 2:15 today now be postponed to occur at 2:30 with all \nother parameters of the consent agreement in status quo. I further ask \nunanimous consent that following those votes, Senator Moseley-Braun be \nrecognized to offer her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing none, without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the pending business is the Hutchison \namendment. However, the Senator from Massachusetts has a short comment \nto make, as does the Senator from Missouri. I believe Senator Hutchison \nhas agreed to that. So they will make the appropriate motion to set the \namendment aside for a moment.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing none, without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to proceed for \nnot to exceed 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I just wanted to explain with respect to my \nvote cast on the Coverdell amendment that I respect the notion that \nhaving a savings account is not a bad one. I want to compliment the \nSenator from Georgia for his efforts to create it. The problem is that \nthe numbers I have received from CBO and elsewhere on the distribution \ncreate problems, in my judgment, in terms of fairness of that \ndistribution.\n  Secondly, because of the low-income reach of some of it, there are \ndifficulties in the takeup on the available tax benefit as to whether \nor not it will really reach education.\n  And thirdly and most important of all, I think that to address the \nquestion of trying to improve people's opportunities for schools in a \nvacuum, not to include it in the context of the place where 90 percent \nof our children are going to school, which is the public school system, \nis a mistake. Every time we come at it in one of these marginal efforts \nthat, in a sense, gives people an opportunity to make a choice in one \ncomponent but we do not address it with respect to the school system as \na whole, we are diminishing the opportunities for that other 90 \npercent, which now may become 88 percent, but it is still the vast \nmajority of America's schoolchildren.\n  For that reason, while I compliment the Senator in addressing the \nquestion of savings accounts and choice--which I think is a critical \nelement of the larger reform--we ought to be doing it in the context of \na broad reform. I think until we do that, these kinds of efforts can \nactually wind up being harmful, well-intentioned as they are.\n  I thank my colleague for permitting me the time to make my \nexplanation and my vote. I yield the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2291\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The pending question is \namendment 2291 by the Senator from Texas to H.R. 2646. There will be 30 \nminutes of debate equally divided.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to be notified at least 4 \nminutes before the end of my 15-minute allocation, with the intention \nof giving 2 minutes to the Senator from Georgia to argue in favor, and \nthen I want to reserve the remainder of my time for the end of the \ndebate following any debate opposing my amendment.\n  My amendment simply seeks to give the opportunity to public schools \nwhat private schools can now do, and that is offer an option of same-\ngender classes or schools. I seek to amend the allowable uses of title \nVI funds for education reform projects that provide same-gender schools \nand classrooms as long as comparable educational opportunities are \noffered for students of both sexes.\n  Mr. President, title VI is the place in our education code providing \nfor reform of education to create new and innovative programs to try to \nimprove our public education opportunities in this country.\n  I am offering this amendment to remove a cloud of doubt hanging over \nthe education community about the Federal policy on whether we allow a \nlocal decision by a local public school district to operate same-gender \nschools and classrooms.\n  The amendment is very simple. It adds the establishment and operation \nof same-gender schools and classes to the allowable uses for funds \nunder title VI. It is not a mandate; it is an option. The title VI \nprogram is so broad and flexible that I believe it already allows same-\ngender education programs. But due largely to the fear that many \nschools throughout our country have, believing that the Education \nDepartment's Office for Civil Rights would not allow same-gender \neducation efforts, most States and school districts are reluctant to \nuse their own money, much less Federal money, for these purposes. This \nis unfortunate.\n  Ask almost any student or graduate of a same-gender school, most of \nwhom are from private and parochial schools, and they will almost \nalways tell you that they were enriched and strengthened by the \nexperience. Surveys and studies of students show that both boys and \ngirls enrolled in same-gender programs tend to be more competent, more \nfocused on their studies, and ultimately more successful in school as \nwell as later in their careers. We are talking here about K through 12. \nSpecifically, girls report being more willing to participate in class \nand to take difficult math and science classes that they otherwise \nwould not have attempted. Boys also report less pressure of being put \ndown by their classmates for wanting to participate in class and excel \nat their studies. Both sexes report feeling more of a camaraderie and\n\n[[Page S3324]]\n\nsense of peer and teacher support than they do when they are in a coed \nenvironment. Teachers, too, report fewer control and discipline \nproblems, something almost any teacher will tell you can consume a good \npart of class time.\n  Inevitably, these positive student attitudes translate into academic \nresults. Study after study shows that girls and boys in same-gender \nclasses, on average, are academically more successful and ambitious \nthan their coed counterparts.\n  I also note that a recent well-publicized report by the American \nAssociation of University Women did not so much challenge the \ndemonstrated benefits of same-gender schools as it called to implement \nthese benefits into coed classrooms. That is exactly the point. For \nmany students, the same-gender schools and classrooms is the most \nconducive environment for success, precisely because they are same \ngender. No one would dispute that schools and teachers should strive to \nmaintain order, academic rigor, and treat boys and girls equally. The \nfact is that in some cases this tends to be easier in a same-gender \nenvironment.\n  Same-gender education has benefited students like Cyndee Couch, a \nseventh grader at Young Women's Leadership school in East Harlem. \nCyndee and the other students at this all-girls school, located in a \nlow-income, predominantly African American and Hispanic section of New \nYork City, have an attendance rate of 91.8 percent--significantly above \nthe New York City average. They also score higher on math and science \nexams than the city average. In fact, 90 percent of the school's \nstudents recently scored at or above the grade level on the \nstandardized public school math problem solving test. The citywide \naverage was only 50 percent.\n\n  Last year, Cyndee bravely appeared on the television show ``60 \nMinutes'' to talk about why she likes the all-girl public school. She \ntold host Morley Safer, ``As long as I'm in this school and I'm \nlearning and no boys are allowed in the school, I think everything is \ngoing to be OK.''\n  Unfortunately for Cyndee and for other students in fledgling same-\ngender public school programs around the country, everything is not OK. \nOpponents of same-gender education have sued to shut down the Young \nWomen's Leadership school and other schools like it around the country. \nMr. President, I can't imagine why they would do this. Why would they \ntake away this option for parents in East Harlem of New York City? When \nthey can't choose the environment that they find is more supportive and \nconducive to learning for their children, what are their options? Whose \ncivil rights are being violated when parents and their children \nvoluntarily enroll in same-gender programs in the hope that they will \nbe able to get a better education and have a better chance at success \nin life? Who is harmed by that?\n  Mr. President, many of our Nation's public schools are failing in \ntheir jobs to adequately prepare our young people for the challenges \nthat face them. After decades of rhetoric about who is to blame for \nthis failure, it is time to stop talking and give more options. We need \nto find out what works and use it. For many students, same-gender \neducation works. It is certainly not the only answer to our public \nschool woes, but it is one solution that should not be left out of the \nequation.\n  We are adding to the list of choices. We are not mandating anything. \nIn education, one-size-fits-all is simply not going to work. We have to \nallow our local schools to have all the choices that can best fit the \nindividual students in their school districts.\n  Some opponents of same gender education may also try to claim that it \nviolates title IX of the Civil Rights Act or the equal protection \nclause of the Constitution. Both of those arguments are erroneous. \nTitle IX was passed as part of the Education Amendment of 1972. It \nprohibits discrimination on the basis of sex at any school receiving \nFederal financial assistance. Title IX was never intended to prohibit \nsame-gender K-12 education. In fact, with regard to admissions, the \nlanguage of title IX applies only to higher education institutions that \nwere not same-gender at the time of passage of the provision and to \nvocational and professional institutions. An earlier version of title \nIX that would have prohibited same-gender admissions policies, K-12, \nwas specifically defeated in Congress.\n  The language of title IX as well as subsequent judicial \ninterpretations of title IX make it clear that the law does not \nprohibit same-gender schools. What, then, about same-gender classrooms \nlocated at coed schools? Are they prohibited by title IX? The answer \nagain is no. The overriding purpose and intent of title IX is to \nprohibit discrimination against individuals because of their sex, not \nto erase any consideration of the different educational needs of boys \nand girls. There simply is no discrimination if comparable educational \nopportunities are afforded to each sex, as my amendment requires.\n  Indeed, title IX itself recognizes a number of gender differences in \nallowing separate programs for physical education, organized sports, \nand sex education. Even the Department of Education sees same-gender \nclassrooms as acceptable if the school is able to come up with a \nsufficiently convincing argument that it is doing so to overcome some \npast discrimination against one sex or the other with regard to that \ncourse offering, even though no such proof of past discrimination is \nrequired by the language of title IX.\n  I believe the only justification that schools should need to have to \ninstitute a single-sex classroom or school is that the school and the \nparents believe it will provide a better educational opportunity for \nthe parents and children who choose the option. This reflects both the \nlanguage and the intent of title IX, and what we would do today with \nthis amendment is clarify that that is the will of Congress.\n  Mr. President, I will yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Georgia, \nafter which I will reserve my final 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Texas. Federal funding should not \ndiscriminate in favor of same-sex education. Currently, it does.\n  Same-gender schools boast years of success. Studies have shown that \nsingle-gender education worked well in the inner city. Seventh graders \nwho had attended Malcolm X Academy in Detroit, MI --an all-boys inner-\ncity school--had the highest math scores among 77 Detroit schools and \nthe second highest in Michigan among 780 schools. Cornelius Riordan, a \nprofessor at Providence University, found that African American and \nHispanic students in single-gender schools outperform their coed peers \nby nearly a grade level.\n  This proposal simply rights a wrong without increasing burdens on the \ntaxpayers. Right now, neither IX nor the equal protection clause \nprohibits single-sex schools. This is another example of how one size \ndoes not fit all. Parents and children should have the choice of \nsingle-sex education in public schools. As I said, I support the \nexcellent work and the amendment offered by Senator Hutchison of Texas.\n  I yield back to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to reserve the balance of \nmy time for after any opponents who might appear.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, it is my intention to finish the use \nof my time. I understand there will be no one speaking against it at \nthis time. So we will close out this debate and go to the next \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I just want to speak to the last point, which is the \nconcern about the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to the \nConstitution. The Supreme Court recently struck down the all-male \nadmission policy of Virginia Military Academy on the grounds that it \nviolated equal protection for female applicants because Virginia did \nnot meet the constitutional requirement that there be a comparable \nfacility for women.\n\n[[Page S3325]]\n\n  My amendment clearly requires that there be comparable opportunities \nfor both sexes. Mr. President, we are meeting the constitutional test \nof the 14th amendment. We are meeting the constitutional test of equal \nprotection, and we are meeting the definition of title IX, and we are \nadding an option to title VI.\n  In short, what we are trying to do is say that the parents of \nchildren who go to public schools should have the option--not any kind \nof mandate, but the option--in grades K through 12 to allow same-gender \nclasses or same-gender schools to be offered in their school districts.\n  We believe that for some children it is proven that they can excel \nacademically in the lower grades when they are in a same-gender \nenvironment. This has been proven with both boys and girls. Why not \nallow our public schoolchildren to have the same opportunities that \nparents could choose if they could afford to send their children to \nprivate schools? Why not say our education system is failing and the \nway we are going to improve it and tailor it to individual boys and \ngirls in this country so that they can meet their full potential with \nthe best education that they can receive is to allow more options for \nour public schools?\n  I believe these options are available now. But because it is not \nabsolutely clear, many public schools are afraid to go forward for fear \nthey might be sued to shut down, which is exactly what is happening to \nthe Young Women's Leadership School in East Harlem that is showing \nnothing but success. Someone has come in to sue and to say that this \nviolates the Constitution. I argue that it doesn't violate the \nConstitution; it is required by our Constitution to give our children \nin our public schools the same opportunities that a child going to \nprivate school would have. Let's improve the education system and vote \nfor this amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time \nbe yielded on the Hutchinson amendment No. 2291, and that a vote occur \non or in relation to that amendment immediately following the two \npreviously scheduled votes at 2:30. I further ask unanimous consent \nthat no amendments be in order to amendment No. 2291 and, finally, that \nSenator Moseley-Braun be recognized to offer her amendment following \nthose votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided between each of the stacked votes at \n2:30 today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that \ngeneral debate be in order to the pending legislation until the hour of \n12:30 today with the time equally divided in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HAGEL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise this morning to express my strong \nsupport for the Parent and Student Savings Account Act, or PASS Act, of \nwhich I am a cosponsor. I have listened over the last few weeks to the \ndebate on this issue. It is about things bigger than just the Coverdell \nbill. It is about the philosophy of education in America. I am \nconstantly astonished that the Coverdell bill has so exercised so many \nof my colleagues. I question why this is such a big deal.\n  The Coverdell bill is part of an overall philosophy about education. \nYes; our future is our children, and our children's future is \neducation. But this Coverdell bill should be part of the national \ndebate about where we take education into the next century--this new, \nbold, dynamic competitive new century. For the first time we will ask \nour young people to compete in a new, competitive, international world.\n  After all, Mr. President, what is education about? What is education \nreally about? It is not about debating amendments on the floor of the \nSenate. It should not be about whose money it is, or whose money it is \nnot, nor about bureaucracy. It should be about our young people. It \nshould be about educating our young people so that they are prepared to \ncompete in this brave new world--this world full of immense \nopportunities. But there will not be opportunities if we do not prepare \nour young people to negotiate this new world.\n  Education is about something else. It is not just about science and \nmath, and reading and writing--yes, that is important--and economics, \nhistory, and geography. It is also about developing young people so \nthat we are producing happy, productive citizens--happy, productive \ncitizens so that they, too, might contribute to our society and to our \nculture. But ignorance is the great enemy to productivity and to \nsecure, happy lives. It is all connected. It is all connected.\n  If in fact you believe, as I do, that the Federal Government does not \nbelong in education--in fact, if we will roll this back 200 years, you \nshow me in the Constitution of the United States, or show me anywhere, \nwhere the Federal Government has the responsibility to educate our \nyoung people. It does not. It can't. We are overloading our circuits. \nWe are overloading our system. We are asking the Government to do \nthings that Government can't possibly do. Therefore, as we have done \nover the last 30 years, there has been a breakdown in confidence in our \ncountry and in government at every level, but especially Government at \nthe Federal level.\n  What do we do about it? Let's step back for a moment and pause and be \nunemotional and sort this out. We sort it out this way. Who has the \nmost to win or lose when it comes to education of our young people? Of \ncourse, the parents are the ones who care the most, and who should care \nthe most. The parents are the connecting rod for our children in every \nfacet and every aspect of our children's lives. Who also cares about \nour students and about their education? Teachers. Revelation--\nteachers--parents and teachers.\n  So we have a good combination going on here--not the Government, not \nthe Federal Government, not the Department of Education, not the \nPresident, not Senator Hagel nor Senator Coverdell. Education belongs \nat the local level because that is where the issue is. This is not \nabout books and textbooks, numbers, frogs, dissecting, and biology \nclass. It is about people. It is about young people. It is about their \nlives. It is about the strains and stresses of young people. We have \nall been through it.\n  What is wrong with examining in some detail, as we are doing, the \nCoverdell bill? What is wrong with actually allowing parents to put \naside after-tax income? By the way, after-tax income is not costing the \npublic schools a dime. It is not costing the public schools a dime. We \nare allowing the parents who have the most to win or lose by the \neducation of their children an opportunity to take their own money that \nthey work for after they have paid their taxes and put it into a \nsavings account. It is the same thing that we did last year. My \ngoodness, President Clinton had a Rose Garden ceremony. He took great \ncredit for allowing our parents to have education savings accounts to \neducate our children after they are out of high school.\n  All this does is allow the same parents to set aside money to help \neducate their children in K through 12. That is all we are doing here. \nWe are not really breaking any new ground. What is so wrong with that? \nWhat is wrong with that concept? This Senator from the State of \nNebraska doesn't think there is anything wrong with it. As a matter of \nfact, we need more of that. We need more. We need less government \ninfluence and more local parent-teacher influence in education.\n  So much misinformation has been spread around on this issue. We \nshould set the record straight. As I said, this does not inhibit, \ndamage, nor affect public schools adversely at all. As a matter of \nfact, it helps public schools\n\n[[Page S3326]]\n\nbecause the parents who set up the savings account can draw from that \nsavings account to help their students and their children if they are \nin public school just as if they are in private school. Those moneys \ncan be used for transportation, tutors, equipment, supplies, tuition--\nanything that helps the student learn. After all, Mr. President, isn't \nthat what this debate should be about? It shouldn't be about defending \nturf. It shouldn't be about, ``Gee, I do not want to give that program \nup.'' It should be allowing the parents to have as much direct \ninfluence and responsibility, as well as teachers, as well as the local \nschool board, the city, the county and State, in how our young people \nare educated.\n  That is what this debate is about. As we work our way through this \nCoverdell bill, expanding on what we already did last year in setting \nup education savings accounts, it should be a national debate, and it \nshould reside in the arena of a philosophy about education.\n  I would also point out that in the more than 200-year history of this \ncountry, there is one point that has been unmistakably clear. And I go \nback to an earlier point I made. Governments do not change behavior. \nYoung people are formed from the inside out. Young people are not \nformed from the outside in. Young people are formed from their parents, \ntheir religious mentors, their religion, their teachers, their coaches, \nand private voluntary organizations like Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts.\n  That is how young people are taught. That is how they develop \nstandards. That is how they develop expectations and understand values. \nThat is what this debate is about. I hope we can focus on what is \nreally important here, and that is helping our parents and our teachers \nhelp our students learn, to prepare them for a hopeful, happy, \nproductive educated life. Only then can this great Nation not only \nsurvive but be dominant well into the next century, a nation which has \nproduced so much good not only in this country but in the world.\n  Think of what this country through freedom of expression, individual \nliberty, and our educational system has done for the world. That is our \ncharge in this body. That is our responsibility--to assure that the \nnext generations not only have the same opportunities but better \nopportunities and are better prepared than we were. The Coverdell bill \nis one way to help us get there.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on each \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 23 minutes under \nhis control and 32 minutes on the other side.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska for \nhis passion on behalf of reform, breaking the status quo, not only on \nthis but so many issues. I very much appreciate the comments that were \nmade in the name of changing this system so that we can start turning \naround this horrible data we are receiving from our kindergarten \nthrough high school classes. We cannot prepare for the new century in \nthis vein. Change has to occur. I appreciate very much the comments \nmade by the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the \ntime be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to oppose the anti-\neducation Republican tax bill. Improving education can and must be a \ntop priority for Congress and the Nation, but this Republican bill \nflunks the test. They call it the A+ bill, but it is anti-education and \ndeserves an F. This Republican bill and its proposed Republican \namendments are bad tax policy and bad education policy, and it clearly \ndeserves the veto that President Clinton has pledged to give it.\n  It is the Nation's public schools that need help. So what do our \nRepublican friends do? They propose legislation to aid private schools. \nThat makes no sense at all. Our goal is to strengthen public schools, \nnot abandon them. Our goal is to help all children get a good \neducation, not just the ones with wealthy parents. It is clear that our \nRepublican friends are no friends of public schools. They have an anti-\neducation agenda. They want tax breaks for the wealthy who send their \nchildren to private schools.\n  The underlying bill uses tax breaks to subsidize parents to send \ntheir children to private schools, and it is a serious mistake. It \ndiverts scarce resources away from public schools that have the \ngreatest need. The regressive Republican tax bill does nothing to \nimprove public schools--it does nothing to improve public schools. It \ndoes nothing to address the serious need of public schools to build new \nfacilities and repair the existing crumbling facilities.\n  This afternoon, we will have the excellent amendment of the Senator \nfrom Illinois, Carol Moseley-Braun, who has really been the leader in \nthis body and in the country in recognizing the challenges that so many \nof our schools are facing. They are old and crumbling, and we need to \nmodernize them.\n  It is a powerful amendment because the amendment says we are prepared \nto put resources to reconstruct our schools, but it also has a \nsubliminal message, and that is that we want our children to go into \nthe best facilities. If we say to the young people of this Nation that \neducation is a priority, and day after day they go to dilapidated \nschools or schools that have leaky ceilings or the windows are broken \nor they have inadequate facilities, we are sending a message to \nchildren that they are not a priority in this country and that \neducation is not a priority.\n  When we ask our children to spend the time to do the hard and \ndifficult work to master subject matters, they have to really wonder \nwhether the message that is coming from an older generation has much \nmerit. That is why the amendment of Senator Carol Moseley-Braun is so \nimportant and why I think all of us are very hopeful that we can attain \nthe objectives of that amendment and see that amendment approved.\n  I know she will have an opportunity to go into very considerable \ndetail about the General Accounting Office study of the schools across \nthe Nation. It estimates that $110 billion is needed to invest in our \nschools in order to bring them up to satisfactory condition. Her \namendment is much more modest, but it is an important amendment, and it \nis one that deserves the support of all of us who are interested in \nmaking sure that at least the physical facilities are going to be first \nrate for the future generations of children. It just makes common \nsense.\n\n  In many of our communities, particularly older communities, whether \nit is in urban areas or rural communities, they just don't have the \nwherewithal to do that. But the amendment of the Senator from Illinois, \nCarol Moseley-Braun, provides some help and assistance in providing \ninterest-free loans to those communities so that they can themselves \nmake the judgment, make the determination, but they will get some help \nand assistance in terms of borrowing those funds interest free.\n  It makes a great deal of sense. I think we will have an alternative \nand an opportunity to say whether that amendment is really where we \nwant to go or, on the other hand, if we want to continue with the \nRepublican proposal that will provide just some tax benefits for a \ncertain group of Americans who are going to use those tax benefits to \nbenefit children attending the private schools. That is going to be a \nvery, very important debate and one where I hope our colleagues will \nfind compelling reasons to support that amendment.\n  Second, Mr. President, the underlying Coverdell proposal does nothing \nto reduce the class size in our schools. I don't know how many more \nhearings we have to have in our education committee and how many other \nexaminations of what is happening in a number of different States--in \nKentucky and in many other communities across this country--to \nunderstand that when you have too many children in the class--\n\n[[Page S3327]]\n\nyou may have teachers who are able to handle it and do it very well, \nand we take our hats off to them--but when you are talking about having \nclasses with 30 students, 25 students, 20 students, you are talking \nabout an enormous demand on the teacher and also inappropriate lack of \nattention for the students. We will also have an opportunity to vote on \nthat later in the course of this debate. That can make a major \ndifference in helping and assisting local communities in having reduced \nclass sizes. That, I think, is a higher priority than, again, providing \nthe tax benefits for those who want to use those for private schools.\n  This underlying proposal does nothing to provide qualified teachers \nin more classrooms across the Nation. We had an opportunity to address \nthat briefly in our debate earlier today. It was turned down. I welcome \nthe fact that we had 41 Senators who supported our proposal that said, \nif we are going to spend $1.6 billion in education, let us make the \ndecision that we want to invest it in more teachers for the 4 million \nadditional children who are going to be attending our public school \nsystem, to help meet the gap, which we recognize is 2 million teachers \nthat we are going to need for our public schools over the next 10 \nyears; let us at least have 100,000 new, well-qualified teachers to \nteach in those schools. That is a preferable way of spending $1.6 \nbillion rather than, again, spending this as a tax break, as a new \nentitlement--a new entitlement program--that is going to benefit, \nagain, those who send their children to private schools.\n  It does nothing in this underlying amendment to help children reach \nhigh academic standards. I don't, again, know how many hours of \nhearings we have to have to say that children respond best when they \nare challenged. Most of us as human beings do. Our Nation does. It \nalways has at a time of its greatest need. We should challenge children \nto raise the bar, rather than teaching down to them. We should create \nhigher academic standards. We ought to be doing that.\n\n  There is nothing in this legislation that will do anything like that \nfor the public schools in this country. It does nothing to provide \nafterschool activities to keep kids off the street, away from drugs, \nand out of trouble. We know the value of afterschool programs.\n  We have some 5 million children in our country who this afternoon at \n2 or 2:30 will go home to empty houses. They will be told by their \nparents, ``Look, maybe have a little snack, and if you have to watch \ntelevision, watch television on X station; try and get your homework \ndone.'' But we know what happens in those circumstances. Too many of \nthose children who are left alone, unsupervised, more often than not \nwill find that the temptations of getting into trouble are increased \ndramatically.\n  This is not just a diversion from education, but it also has an \nimportant impact in terms of crime in our local communities.\n  A city that has made about as much progress as any city in this \ncountry is my city of Boston. It has gone 2 years and 4 months without \na single youth homicide. And if you ask Paul Evans, who is the \ncommissioner of the police department in Boston, MA, he will say, yes, \ndealing in an appropriate way with gangs, that is No. 1. No. 2, tracing \nvarious weapons that are used in gangs. But No. 3, afterschool \nprograms. Afterschool programs keep kids out of trouble. That is very, \nvery important.\n  Is there anything with the $1.6 billion that is being recommended on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate to try to develop programs that we know \nare tried and tested, that will provide an incentive for children to go \nto various community centers, to work with volunteers? The number of \nyoung people who are volunteering is increasing every single day to \nhelp children with their homework so that when they do go home and they \nsee their parents, who have been working hard all day, they will have \nquality time with their parents rather than hearing from their parents, \n``Well, you ought to go upstairs and make sure you get your homework \ndone.'' This is enormously important, and it is recognized by educators \nand those who are concerned about law enforcement across this \ncountry. There isn't a nickel in this program--not a nickel in this \nprogram--to try to address that particular issue.\n\n  So, Mr. President, we know where these benefits are going to go. They \nare going to go to the individuals who are going to invest those \nbenefits in the private schools rather than investing in our public \nschools.\n  The challenge is clear. We must do all we can to improve teaching and \nlearning for all of the students across the country. We must continue \nto support efforts to raise academic standards. We must test students \nearly so we know where they need help in time to make that help \neffective. We must provide better training for current and new teachers \nso they are well-prepared to teach to higher standards.\n  We must reduce class size to help students obtain the individual \nattention they need. We must provide afterschool programs to make \nconstructive alternatives available to students. We must provide \ngreater resources to modernize and expand the Nation's school buildings \nto meet the urgent needs of schools for up-to-date facilities. We \ncannot stand by and let regressive tax policy pass to help private \nschools at the expense of the public schools.\n  In those items that I have just mentioned, every superintendent of \nschools, every schoolteacher, every department of education across this \ncountry would agree with those essential parts of a sound education \nprogram to help and assist the public schools in this country. Where in \nthat list do we find ``Let's have tax breaks. Let's have the creation \nof a new entitlement. Let's create a new entitlement that is basically \ngoing to be used in order to support the private schools in this \ncountry''? It makes no sense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We cannot stand by and let this regressive tax policy \npass to help private schools at the expense of public schools. Parents \nacross the country want real solutions, not token gestures in the name \nof education. We should not waste $1.5 billion of public tax dollars on \na do-nothing tax break program. So I hope my colleagues will join us in \nopposing this bill. We should do all we can to help the public schools \nand not abandon them.\n  Finally, I just want to say that we will be under the close timeframe \nthis afternoon, but I want to just add my strong support again to \nSenator Moseley-Braun's substitute for the Coverdell bill. It is well-\ndesigned to help communities across the country to modernize, repair, \nand expand their school facilities.\n  Schools across the Nation face the serious problem of overcrowding. \nAntiquated facilities are suffering from physical decay and are not \nequipped to handle the needs of modern education. Across the country, \n14 million children, in a third of the Nation's schools, are learning \nin substandard buildings. Half the schools have at least one \nunsatisfactory environmental condition. It would take over $100 billion \njust to repair the existing facilities.\n  It is difficult enough to teach or learn in dilapidated classrooms \nbut now, because of escalating enrollments, classrooms are increasingly \novercrowded. The Nation will need 6,000 new schools in the next few \nyears just to maintain the current class size given the expansion of \nthe number of children who will be going to our schools.\n  Democrats have made this a top priority to see that America has the \nbest education system in the world. Providing safe and adequate school \nfacilities is an important step towards meeting that goal.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that our Members will go and support the \nexcellent amendment of the Senator from Illinois this afternoon and \nthat it will be successful. It is far preferable to just providing a \ntax break for individuals who are going to use that to support the \nprivate schools.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio has 15 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GLENN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S3328]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 2017\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I offered an amendment yesterday to the \nCoverdell educational IRA bill. The amendment I propose will simply \ndelete the K-12--kindergarten through grade 12--expenses as an \nauthorized deduction for education IRAs. The amendment will keep the \nincrease in the annual allowable contribution from the current $500 to \nthe maximum $2,000 a year. I think that is fine, that is good.\n  But deleting K-12 and increasing the allowable contribution returns \neducation IRAs to their original purpose of providing incentive savings \nincentives for higher education purposes. That is what the Federal \nGovernment has basically taken responsibility for through all the many \nyears that we have been around here.\n  We should be looking at this whole bill for what it is. It is tax \nsupport for private school education. I believe it is bad education \npolicy. I believe it is bad tax policy. I also think it is probably \ngoing to pass. If it does, I think the President is going to veto it. \nHe has indicated that that is his intention.\n  If we look back to the days of our forefathers when people were \ncoming to this country, they came here to have the opportunity for \neducation. They were used to only the rich or--kids from the castle--\nbeing able to have formal education.\n  There were basically two kinds of people. There were the educated and \nthe uneducated. And that is another way of saying there were the \nwealthy and the poor. That is what education was all about. It was to \nenable everybody to move up, to have a chance, to use their God-given \ntalents and capabilities and their own desires to move ahead, to make a \nbetter life for themselves. And in this country, in the United States, \nwe knew that if a democracy was to succeed--we did not want to return \nto serfdom, and rule by a few, and wealth for just a few--education was \nkey to making a democracy succeed. It was not a choice in our \ndemocracy, it was a must, or our country was doomed.\n  And the freedom to be educated, that most important freedom to be \neducated, spread to communities and States. And they all formed and \nsupported public schools for all--for all--of our people. And that is \nthe important thing we are addressing here today--education for all of \nour people. It was a requirement that we have minimum education.\n  This is my 24th year as a U.S. Senator representing the people of \nOhio. And in that time, I have seen many attempts to divert Federal \nfunds from public to private education. The approaches to accomplish \nthis goal have been many. We had tuition tax credits; we had the \nvoucher system; school choice; now educational IRAs for elementary and \nsecondary education.\n  The Coverdell IRA, I believe, is a backdoor voucher that will do \nnothing to improve public schools for our public schoolchildren. That \nis the responsibility of Government. If other people want to take \nmoney, for whatever reason, whether it is religious or whether they \njust want a different school for their kids, whether they want all boys \nor all girls schools--that was a choice we did not deny. We did not say \nthat we are going to Federally subsidize that kind of educational \nchoice. And we should not be trying to do it now.\n  The educational expenses that the Coverdell bill provides would \ninclude tuition and fees at public, private, and religious schools. The \nbill does not target needy families. And I believe here is one of the \nbiggest reasons against what is being proposed here with the bill.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator would yield for \njust one moment on an administrative matter.\n  Mr. GLENN. Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. We have concluded that following your remarks we would \nuse the balance of the remaining time as in morning business. Both \nsides agreed to that. I just wanted to make it clear, because I will be \nleaving the floor. I ask unanimous consent for that.\n  Mr. GLENN. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request to proceed \nto morning business after the Senator from Ohio completes his remarks?\n  Mr. GLENN. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, the point I was going to make is this: \nFamilies in the top 20 percent of income distribution, would receive 70 \npercent of the benefit of this bill--70 percent.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that more than half the \nsavings would go to families whose children would attend private \nschools anyway. So 70 percent of the money, 70 percent of the benefit, \nis going to go to those who already are fully capable of sending their \nkids to private schools. So the bill subsidizes the savings and \nspending patterns that already exist.\n  I do not think we should be heading back toward a bill that sends us \nback to the place where our forefathers started in Europe: where \neducation is going to be best for the wealthy, where education is for \nthose who have political connections, where education is available for \nthe kids from the castle. That is not the way this country developed. \nOur country went ahead because we had programs that made education \navailable for every single young person in this country--every single \nperson. And that is what we should still be shooting for today.\n  Cleveland, OH, has one of only two voucher programs in the country. \nThe other is in Milwaukee. In Ohio, this program permits State funds to \nbe used to send low-income children to private schools. It is the only \nprogram that allows the children to attend religious schools, parochial \nschools, with taxpayer funds. It is being challenged now before the \nOhio State Supreme Court on that basis. It is funded at $12.5 million \nover 2 years. It is just finishing its second year right now, and \nresults have been very spotty.\n\n  As a matter of fact, there are other problems that have developed \nalso. How about paying for taxicabs for the kids? They found out that \nthe yellow schoolbuses that the school system depends on were not \nadequate to furnish the transportation for the young people that were \ngoing to be taking advantage of the voucher program. That wasn't \nforeseen. So student taxi rides account for more than half of the $4.8 \nmillion deficit in Cleveland's 2-year-old school voucher program. It \nshows how an unintended consequence can take over in some instances. \nThe voucher program had to turn to taxi firms and provide payments to \nparents in lieu of transportation services. That is half the funding.\n  There is no strong evidence at the end of the second year of the \nprogram that the voucher program increases student achievement. We need \nto have a better understanding of what makes a school successful before \nwe institute a program that benefits a comparatively few young people \nand takes money out of the public school system. That should be our \nmajor concern--our desire to have a good public school system.\n  Strengthening public education in this country is something we have \nto do. It is necessary if we are going to be competitive in the \neconomic future of this country. Only by making high-quality education \navailable to all American children --not a favored few, but all \nAmerican children--will we help develop the skills they need to find \nmeaningful high-wage jobs, while developing a capable and productive \nwork force that is essential, literally essential, to the economic \nfuture of this country in this new worldwide economic environment in \nwhich we live.\n  Education reform is one of the top issues before the country now. It \nis talked about all over, in magazine articles, and is on the cover of \nmagazines. One that I read last night talked about the education \nproblem. That is why I continue to oppose attempts to encourage the use \nof Federal funds for nonpublic education, whether in the form of \ntuition tax credits or vouchers or school choice. I believe including K \nthrough 12 in educational IRAs is the first step toward establishing a \npermanent voucher system. It just bleeds off necessary money from the \npublic schools.\n  We have a public school system of education in this country that is \navailable to all children. If this educational system is not producing \nthe high level of achievement this Nation now needs, we can't abandon \nthem, we can't say we will just take less money and put it in the \npublic school system. We can't abandon them. That is why I support\n\n[[Page S3329]]\n\nthe school construction amendment initiatives that will help reduce \nclassroom size and directly benefit all our Nation's public schools by \nensuring that all children attend safe and modern public schools. \nSenator Kennedy mentioned that a moment ago, and I agree with his \nremarks on that.\n  I believe everyone should be saving for their children's education, \nbut the difference between elementary and secondary education and \nhigher education is important. Every child in this country is entitled \nto a free, appropriate, tuition-free education in every State. We have \nState laws in every State in our Union that require that. Higher \neducation, going on to the college and university level, however, is \noptional and is tuition-based. It is hard for parents to save for \ncollege. I believe it is appropriate to provide incentives to help them \ndo so. I have supported the prepaid tuition plans in the State of Ohio \nas a way that students can be assured of a quality education at one of \nOhio's State universities or at one of their colleges there.\n  The amendment which I am offering returns the educational IRA back to \nits original purpose--higher education expenses only. The only change I \nmake is to keep the increase that is proposed in the contribution limit \nfor education IRAs from $500 to $2,000. I think that is fine. This \nincrease in the contribution will enable parents to save more per year \nfor higher education. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthis amendment.\n\n  We have a lot of problems in this country. The old property tax that \nhas been around for a long time is no longer adequate to do the job. It \nmay have been OK back in the days of Jefferson and Washington when we \ndidn't have NASDAQ, the American Stock Exchange and the New York Stock \nExchange, mutual funds and so on. Most of the wealth at that time was \nin property, so a property tax was very appropriate to support the \nschools. Particularly over the last four or five decades we have now \ndeveloped into being a service economy where two-thirds of our wealth, \ntwo-thirds of our national income, comes from the service industry. So \nthe old property tax is no longer adequate to do our schools. We have \nto get away from that.\n  Proposition 13 in California we are familiar with, did, in my view, \nwreck one of the finest education systems in the country. They are \nhaving a lot of problems that everybody else has around the country \nthese days.\n  We are the only industrialized nation in the world that does not have \na national education system. I am not here today to say we should go to \na national education system. That would probably get me run down the \nfront steps of the Capitol pretty fast. But we have to do more from the \nFederal level. We are only a tiny part of our K through 12 education. I \nthink it is just around 5 percent now. Most of that is in school lunch \nprograms and things like that and not directly on educational matters.\n  Our system in this country, as Lester Thurow pointed out in his last \ncouple of books, our system is basically run by 15,000 independent \nschool boards all saying, ``We won't raise your taxes,'' and then they \nget together and decide what they will do in the local school \ndistricts. They get elected on ``we won't raise your taxes,'' ``We \naren't going to vote on any other taxes; we will not raise your \nproperty taxes,'' so we at the Federal level are increasingly up \nagainst this as to what we should be doing.\n  What we see is we are becoming gradually less competitive in a \nworldwide environment. We can't let that happen. The answer is not, as \nin this Coverdell bill, to say we will siphon money off from the public \nschool system and give it over to the private school system in the form \nof vouchers or IRAs or whatever, take it out and put it over there, \naway from the public school system and support them less instead of \nmore. That doesn't solve our problems in this country. So we do have \nsome other problems. We have to address those, but not this way and not \nwith this particular piece of legislation.\n  I noted this morning in looking at the Los Angeles Times their lead \neditorial today was entitled ``Don't Drain Public Schools.'' I ask \nunanimous consent to have this printed at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GLENN. ``Don't Drain Public schools.'' That is exactly what we \nare talking about. We will drain public schools to the benefit of \nprivate schools, and 70 percent of the money will go to people already \ncapable of providing, to the top 20 percent of the people already \ncapable of providing for private schools for their kids if they want \nit.\n  The insert in this article, and I will not read the complete article, \nthe insert says, ``Washington should help address the education \ndeficits in the Nation's public schools, but shifting even a small \namount of tax money to private schools is not the answer, at least not \nyet.'' That about summarizes everything that I want to make a point of \nthis morning.\n  I think there is a vote on my amendment at 2:15 after our respective \nparty caucuses. I hope people can think long and hard about this. I see \nthis as a first step down a long slippery slope toward less and less \nsupport for our public school system, that which serves all America, \nthat which enables people at the lowest level of economic advantage in \nthis country to get opportunity through education and their own hard \nwork to be a contributing member of society and make as much of a \nsuccess of their lives as anybody else.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         [From the Los Angeles Times Editorials, Apr. 21, 1998]\n\n                       Don't Drain Public Schools\n\n       The White House and the Republican majority in Congress \n     both talk about how much they want to improve education in \n     the United States. But they have very different plans for \n     doing it. President Clinton speaks of more teachers, more \n     schools, more special programs and higher standards. \n     Republicans would rather offer a small monetary reward to \n     every parent who saves for educational expenses, including \n     tuition for non-public elementary or high schools. The White \n     House opposes this modest tax break because it would allow \n     the use of federal funds to subsidize private and parochial \n     schools. On this issue, Clinton is right.\n       Improving public education has become a top political \n     priority from the District of Columbia, where public schools \n     are in dismal shape, to Los Angeles, with its overwhelmed \n     system and awful test scores. Washington should help address \n     the yawning educational deficits in the nation's public \n     schools, but shifting even a small amount of tax money to \n     private schools is not the answer--at least not yet.\n       Clinton isn't personally against private schools; his \n     daughter graduated from one last year. But rather than \n     encourage an exodus from public schools at the expense of the \n     taxpayer, he says he wants to fix the public schools to serve \n     all children, including those whose parents cannot afford \n     private or parochial schools with or without a new education \n     savings account.\n       Fixing the schools is a tall order, as residents of Los \n     Angeles know all too well, and parents can never be blamed \n     for wanting the best for their children. But most educators \n     and employers would agree that the White House is right.\n       The House of Representatives has approved a GOP bill that \n     would create education savings accounts that work like \n     individual retirement accounts for parents of students in \n     kindergarten through 12th grade. Parents would be allowed to \n     save as much as $2,000 a year in a special account. The \n     interest would accrue tax-free, so long as the money was \n     withdrawn only for education purposes, including books, \n     computers, tutoring and, foremost, tuition. The Senate is \n     expected to take up its version of the bill this week.\n       Though schools are traditionally a local responsibility, \n     Washington has been increasingly willing to help. That help \n     should be expanded, but care must be taken to avoid \n     undermining public education. America's great economic engine \n     was built on public schools that took all comers--poor, \n     working-class, middle-class and beyond--and that same mix \n     remains essential for a healthy educational system.\n       Tax savings under the bill would, according to an analysis \n     by the Joint Tax Commission, average a paltry $7 to $37 a \n     year per family. But the principle is big.\n       This national private-versus-public debate boils down to a \n     difference of priorities. Clinton's ambitious wish list, \n     unveiled during his State of the Union address, calls for \n     spending $12 billion over seven years to pay for 100,000 new \n     teachers, reducing class size to 18 students in the primary \n     grades and creating 50 ``education opportunity zones,'' \n     patterned after urban enterprise zones, in high-poverty \n     areas, plus funding to help build new schools. Republicans \n     favor initiatives that would allow more parents to remove \n     their children from public schools.\n       Neither side can expect to prevail while a Democrat sits in \n     the White House and Republicans control Congress, but \n     irreconcilable differences should not be allowed to lead\n\n[[Page S3330]]\n\n     to gridlock. Both sides agree that something needs to be done \n     about public education.\n       Public schools, especially in cities, are in trouble. But \n     there are promising reforms being tried, from a radical \n     public school choice program in Seattle to a mayoral takeover \n     in Chicago to L.A.'s focus on the 100 worst-performing \n     schools. Playing on the frustration of parents in a way that \n     undermines the whole system is not the cure.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I felt compelled, while I was in the \nchair in the last hour, to comment on the statements of the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts and the Senator from Ohio. I found it quite \nremarkable, sitting and listening to what was laid out, I think, \nsomewhat factually about the problems we have in education, that the \neducational system is not meeting the needs of our country in providing \ngood citizens, the education necessary to be good citizens, and the \neducation necessary to perform needed functions in our economy.\n  The response to the problem in education from the Senator who spoke, \nand from others who oppose this bill, is two things. I hear two things. \nOne, we need more bricks and mortar. If we had better looking schools \nand more nicely appointed schools, or even better equipment, somehow \nthe problem would go away. On top of that, we need more teachers. So if \nwe just did more of the same, only did it better, with nicer buildings \nand more people, things would improve.\n  I am not too sure that most Americans who are interfacing with the \nschool systems in this country right now would accept that as the \nreasonable course, that what we need is just a few more teachers in the \nschools and better looking buildings. I have been to a lot of schools. \nI have been to about 120 public school districts in my State. I go to \nschools all the time. I spend a great deal of my time as I travel the \nState talking in the public schools. I have been to a few private \nschools, too. By and large, I would say that the public schools I went \nto were in much better condition than the parochial schools and private \nschools I went to. No comparison. Much better equipment, much more \nstate-of-the-art, much better teacher ratios than the parochial schools \nI went to. So if the problem in the public schools was better buildings \nand more teachers, then the results that I would get in going to a \npublic school in inner-city Pittsburgh, and one that is a parochial \nschool, should be dramatically different based on this criterion that \nmore teachers and nicer buildings make good school districts and \neducate children.\n  In fact, the results are just the opposite. It is not bricks and \nmortar. It is not numbers of teachers. It is structure, it is \ndiscipline, it is order, and it is caring and concern, it is love, it \nis involvement--all of those intangible things that have to do with \nfamilies and people who are committed to educating children. So what \nthose of us on our side believe is the answer is not to pump more money \ninto bricks and mortar and existing structures, but to pump more money \ninto the people who make a real difference in children's lives, and \nthat is families--families, who can help their children by assisting \nthem with some resources, help them in their public or private or \nparochial education. That is just a fundamental difference as to what \nwe believe works in education.\n  I don't think that continuing to throw money at the system would \nwork. This is truly remarkable. You would think this bill took money \nfrom the public schools. For the record, there is nothing in this bill \nthat takes one dollar out of the Federal commitment to education. In \nfact, there is more money in this bill, but you would not know that. I \nhave been here for the last hour and 15 minutes, and you would not know \nthat by listening to the other side. You would think that this were \nstripping money out of Federal support for education in the public \nschools. That is not true. Not one penny. In fact, more money for \nschool construction is in this bill. So there is not one dollar being \ntaken away, not one dollar being diverted away. This is in fact ``new \nFederal support'' for education.\n\n  Where is it going? It is going to families. This is sort of funny. I \nalmost feel bad saying, ``Where is it going?'' ``To families.'' We are \nletting it stay there; we are just going to be benevolent enough to let \nthem keep it if they do with it what we want them to do, which is to \nhelp support their children in education. It is saying that if you do \nwhat we want you to do with that money, we will let you keep it.\n  It is very nice of us to do this, isn't it? It is sort of nice to \ncome around and say we will let you keep the money if you do what we \ntell you. What the other side wants to do is say, ``No, we are not \ngoing to even let you have the choice to take that money. Excuse me, we \nare going to give it over here to build more schools and give it to \nmore teachers.'' They say that is the problem, that we don't have nice \nschools and we don't have enough teachers.\n  Again, I don't think too many people really believe that. What we \nwant to do is get at the heart of the problem, which is to give parents \nthe opportunity to educate their children, not to give schools more \nmoney.\n  There is another remarkable thing here. When I say not to give \nschools more money, what we are talking about here with these A+ \naccounts is $100 million a year. You would think we were talking about \nhuge amounts of money vis-a-vis what we spend on public education. We \nspend roughly one-quarter of a trillion dollars on public education per \nyear. The Senator from Georgia told me that. This bill is $100 million \nper year. This is hardly a division plowing into the main line of the \neducational establishment; this is a sniper, at best, saying, ``Look, \nwe are here.'' This is a very moderate, very modest proposal, to say: \nLet's allow families to have some choices here. We do a great job.\n  This is another astounding thing. The amendment of the Senator from \nOhio says that we should not allow this money to be used for K-12, let \nit be used for postsecondary education. I travel around the State of \nPennsylvania a lot and around the country a little bit. I hear a lot of \npeople complaining to me about the quality of K-12 education and the \nproblems in primary and secondary education. I hear a lot of complaints \nabout higher education, but it is not about quality. It is not about \nquality. It is somewhat about access and about costs, yes. But I think \nwe are the envy of the world when it comes to colleges and universities \nand technical schools after primary and secondary school.\n  Yet, what do we want to do? We want to put more money where there \nisn't a problem as far as quality and producing good products, and not \nput it into the area where people think the biggest problem exists. \nNow, I am telling you, if I were running a company and I had two \ndivisions, one that was doing well producing good product and the other \nthat was not, and someone came forth and said they thought we could \nchange the system by which we produce this product, look at a different \napproach, because we have been trying this old approach now for decades \nand it just isn't keeping up with the requirements of the new age that \nis out there, as far as the need for education, this product isn't \nkeeping up with standards and we need to look at how to change it, some \nfolks might come forward and say, ``See these old machines here. We \nneed to put more bells and whistles on to make them look nicer. We \ndon't need to change the structure or how it works, it just needs to be \nrun better and we need more people running it.'' That is what their \nanswer is.\n  Some of us are saying, as well, that maybe we should try other \nmachines or look to change this machine so it doesn't function a little \ndifferently than it has done in the past. We want to put some money in \nto do that. This board of directors is saying, ``Oh, no, no. Leave this \nsystem just the way it is. Clean it up a little bit, put a few more \noperators on the machine, and put the money over here where we have the \ngood product. Don't fix the old product.''\n  I don't think that makes sense to most Americans. It certainly does \nnot make sense to me. So what we are trying to do here in a very modest \nway is to say the future of education is going to be just like the \nfuture in everything we do, as we become more and more decentralized as \nan economy and as a\n\n[[Page S3331]]\n\ncountry, with people demanding and expecting more choices and more \nfreedom and needing it to be flexible enough to deal with the changing \neconomy and the changing world. Instead of setting up institutions and \nstructures that may or may not--in most cases, they will not--meet the \nchanging needs of our economy and our educational needs, to invest that \nmoney into the flexible family, if you will, into the family that in my \ncommunity in Penn Hills, PA, maybe have very different needs as to what \ntheir child needs to be educated for, given the capability of the \nchild, given what the economy is in the area, given what skills are \nnecessary in the region, whatever it is, than someone in Birmingham, \nAL, who may have a very different set of skills needed, a very \ndifferent community, very different needs, but allow that family to \nmake that decision, give them the resources if they want to send the \nchild to the public school and use that money to buy some software, or \nto buy a computer, or to buy other kinds of teaching aids, or to buy \ntutorial services, whatever it is, give them the flexibility to meet \nthe needs of their child instead of putting more bricks in a school.\n\n  It is just common sense. It makes sense. It is so obvious on its face \nthat, if we are going to do anything to allow the family and the \nindividual student to have the flexibility to deal with this changing \nenvironment in education and our economy, it is the only direction we \ncan take rather than put money into the old machine to just make it \nlook nice and put more operators pulling the gadgets. I mean, it is \njust inconceivable that anybody thinks that is the answer to this \ndynamic educational marketplace that we have. We have a great \nopportunity here to show that we get it--that we in our hallowed Halls \ncan walk outside and go into a community school to see what makes the \ndifference in education is not nice buildings or small classrooms. \nThose are nice things. But it is committed families, committed \nteachers, and it is community involvement--someone going to a school \nwhere they can take part of something that is good for them, they can \ncontribute to their well-being. That can only be done through families \nand giving them the resources to maximize their own children's future.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. Res. 211, which I submitted earlier and \nis at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 211) expressing the condolences of \n     the Senate on the death of the Honorable Terry Sanford, \n     former United States Senator from North Carolina.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I note that all 100 Senators have \njoined me as cosponsors of this resolution.\n  This resolution is to honor a truly great American and a great North \nCarolinian, former Senator Terry Sanford, a man I knew since I was \nabout 18, 19 years old. In fact, I joined him in managing the campaign \nfor a candidate for Governor, a man named Kerr Scott, and with that \nelection we changed the direction of politics in North Carolina.\n  We had a long friendship. As I say, it began with that campaign, and \nwe went through many political campaigns together. He had a remarkable \nlife. He managed two or three senatorial campaigns on which I had the \npleasure of working with him.\n  Prior to that, Terry Sanford graduated from the University of North \nCarolina in the late thirties. During World War II, he was an FBI agent \nin the early part of the war, in the very beginning, but being an FBI \nagent was not exciting enough for Terry Sanford. He chose to join the \n82nd Airborne and became an officer and a paratrooper. He was involved \nin five different battles during World War II, and he won the Bronze \nStar and the Purple Heart.\n  Terry Sanford was always a paratrooper. He was ready to go for it. He \nwas ready to jump into the middle of whatever might be happening.\n  As I mentioned earlier, he managed and ran some political campaigns, \nbut he was also a State legislator and took great interest when he was \na State legislator in developing the Port of Wilmington, NC, and \nestablished the ports authority for North Carolina.\n  He ran for Governor and won. He was Governor from 1961 through 1965, \nand never did a man have greater vision for a State than Terry Sanford \nhad for our State. He was a leader in education, but not just education \nin the sense of teaching young people to read and write and the \nfundamentals of education. He certainly did that and promoted that. But \nfar more, he promoted a school of excellence for those children who \nwere far more gifted. Then he established a school of the arts, which \nnow exists in Winston-Salem, NC, and is one of the foremost training \nand teaching institutions in the country for young people who are \nentering the arts from dancing to moviemaking. This school is there \nbecause of him.\n  Although he did not technically start the community college system, \nhe did more than any Governor we have had since or before to promote \nthe community college system in North Carolina with 59 campuses. He \nreally brought it to fruition.\n  Again, although he did not start, technically, the Research Triangle \nPark, he and his administration were deeply involved in bringing it \nabout and setting it on the path it has taken.\n  I mentioned he was a lawyer for many, many years and started a couple \nof very prestigious law firms. After his tenure as Governor, he became \npresident of Duke University and served there for some 15 years. It was \na great school, a great university when he went there, but the changes, \nthe improvements, the expenditures, the endowment, the doubling of the \nmedical center all transpired and took place under the leadership of \nTerry Sanford as president of Duke. It became an internationally \nrecognized university under his tenure.\n  He came to the U.S. Senate and left an admirable record here with \nmany initiatives that he sought and worked toward. One of them is \nsomething we are still working on today, and that is to ensure the \nfuture and fiscal stability of Social Security.\n  Senator Sanford was married to Margaret Rose, his wife of 55 years. \nThey had two children, Terry, Jr., and a daughter Betsy.\n  North Carolina and the Nation are better places today for all of us \nto live in because of men like Terry Sanford and because of Terry \nSanford and his vision and tenacity to carry it forward. The country \nwill miss him, the State will miss him and I will miss him as a friend.\n  Mr. President, I believe I said this, but I will note that all 100 \nSenators have joined me in cosponsoring this resolution.\n  Are there any other Senators wishing to speak?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I yield the remainder of my time.\n\n[[Page S3332]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join in expressing my sadness over the \ndeath of our former colleague, Senator Terry Sanford, and I commend the \nSenator from North Carolina for his eloquent statement. Senator Sanford \nwas an extraordinary leader of many talents. He was an outstanding \nMember of this body, an outstanding educator, and an outstanding \nGovernor of North Carolina.\n  Many of us had the privilege of serving with him in the Senate and of \nknowing him personally. We admired his great ability, his unusual \neloquence, and his abiding commitment to the people of North Carolina \nand the nation.\n  In a sense, I inherited Terry Sanford from President Kennedy. He was \none of the first Southern leaders to endorse my brother for President \nin the 1960 campaign. My brother had visited North Carolina as a \nSenator, and had been very impressed by Terry Sanford. I know the very \nhigh regard that my brother had for him as a voice of the New South, as \na champion of education, and as a leader who understood the importance \nof bringing people together.\n  In July 1960, at a critical moment leading up to the Democratic \nConvention in Los Angeles, Terry Sanford endorsed my brother and then \nseconded my brother's nomination for President. It made an enormous \ndifference. In a very real sense, Governor Sanford helped to lay the \nfoundation for my brother's New Frontier.\n  Later, after serving with great distinction as Governor, Terry \nSanford became a President himself--of Duke University, where he served \nfor 16 years, and won world-wide renown as one of the pre-eminent \neducators of the century.\n  He won election to the United States Senate in 1986. All of us on \nboth sides of the aisle held him in great respect--and in great \naffection as well. In so many ways, Terry Sanford was a Senator's \nSenator. He was fair-minded and warm-hearted, and he knew the issues \nwell. Above all, he impressed us with the power of his commitment, the \neloquence of his words, the remarkable moral authority of his \nleadership, and his dedication to excellence in all aspects of public \nservice. We admired him for his statesmanship, and we loved him for his \nfriendship. We will miss him very much. He was truly a profile in \ncourage for our time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the New York Times of \nApril 19 on Senator Sanford may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 19, 1998]\n\n        Terry Sanford, Pace-Setting Governor in 60's, Dies at 80\n\n                            (By David Stout)\n\n       Washington.--Terry Sanford, who lowered racial barriers as \n     Governor of North Carolina in the 1960's, setting the style \n     for a new kind of Southern politician, and later became a \n     United States Senator and Presidential candidate, died today \n     at his home in Durham, N.C. He was 80.\n       The cause was complications from cancer, said Duke \n     University, where Mr. Sanford was treated and where he was \n     president from 1969 to 1985.\n       Until his cancer was diagnosed in December. Mr. Sanford had \n     taught government and public policy at Duke and practiced \n     law. He was president of the university, in Durham, after \n     serving as Governor and before his term in the Senate. Mr. \n     Sanford was at various times a lawyer, a member of the North \n     Carolina State Senate, from 1953 to 1955, and, in the early \n     1940's, an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n       Mr. Sanford was Governor from 1961 to 1965, a time when \n     civil rights demonstrations were frequently met with \n     violence. In a speech on Jan. 18, 1963, he called for an end \n     to job discrimination against blacks and announced the \n     creation of a biracial panel, the North Carolina Good \n     Neighbor Council, to work toward that end.\n       ``Despite great progress, the Negro's opportunity to obtain \n     a good job has not been achieved in most places across the \n     country,'' Mr. Sanford said. Opening more opportunities would \n     be good for the state's economy, he said, but there was a far \n     more compelling reason. ``We will do it because it is honest \n     and fair for us to give all men and women their best chance \n     in life,'' he said.\n       By today's standards, those words seem unremarkable. But in \n     January 1963, when Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama \n     delivered his ``segregation forever'' inaugural address, Mr. \n     Sanford's stand for civil rights was seen as particularly \n     courageous for a governor from the old Confederacy.\n       Mr. Sanford established himself as one of the most liberal \n     Southern governors--too liberal, in the eyes of some \n     constituents--as he named black people to high state \n     positions, pushed state lawmakers to raise more money for \n     schools and started a state anti-poverty program that was a \n     forerunner to President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty.\n       In some ways, Mr. Sanford was a contradictory politician. \n     He seemed to have good timing but bad luck. He had shrewd \n     instincts, yet he seemed to lack burning desire. His changes \n     of mind and heart confounded ally and rival alike.\n       Mr. Sanford was an early supporter of John F. Kennedy's \n     quest for the Presidency, and so enjoyed easy access to the \n     White House in the early 1960's. The President's personal \n     secretary, Evelyn Lincoln, later wrote in a book that \n     President Kennedy had told her he was thinking of Mr. Sanford \n     as his running mate for 1964.\n       His own liberal programs notwithstanding, Mr. Sanford \n     preached the virtues of ``state responsibility,'' if not \n     states' rights, as an antidote to creeping ``big Federal \n     Government.'' Under state law, Mr. Sanford could not succeed \n     himself as Governor.\n       He tried for the White House in 1972 and in 1976, while he \n     was president of Duke University, offering himself as a \n     candidate for those disenchanted with the political system \n     and those who were part of it.\n       Mr. Sanford, who had declared his support for school \n     integration, was beaten in the 1972 North Carolina Democratic \n     Primary by Governor Wallace of Alabama. That humiliating loss \n     in his home state effectively ended his candidacy.\n       Four years later, Mr. Sanford ran for President again but \n     dropped out early. He said he had found it impossible to gain \n     enough news coverage and to raise enough money, and that he \n     was sick of campaigning.\n       In 1986, having left Duke, Mr. Sanford ran for the Senate. \n     When President Ronald Reagan made several appearances on \n     behalf of his opponent, Mr. Sanford knew better than to \n     criticize a President. So he suggested instead that North \n     Carolina did not need a ``go-along Senator.'' Mr. Sanford won \n     a narrow victory.\n       In the Senate, Mr. Sanford gained a reputation for \n     intelligence, personal decency and, in one celebrated \n     instance, indecision. In 1987, after President Reagan had \n     vetoed an $87.9 billion highway bill, Mr. Sanford changed \n     his mind three times: first voting simply ``present'' on a \n     vote to override the veto, then voting to sustain the veto \n     and finally, under tremendous pressure from other \n     Democrats, switching again and voting to override it. His \n     vote made the count 67 to 33, the precise margin required \n     to override.\n       ``Nobody in the Senate thinks I caved in,'' he said later.\n       In fact, his colleagues on both sides of the aisle were \n     saddened at seeing him buckle.\n       ``He's a gentleman,'' said Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, \n     Republican of New York. ``Maybe that's his problem. He's such \n     a beautiful man.''\n       In 1992, Mr. Sanford appeared at first to be in good \n     position for reelection, but he was hospitalized with a heart \n     problem during the campaign. His opponent, Lauch Faircloth, a \n     former Democrat and one-time friend, tried to tar him with \n     the brush of liberalism. And Mr. Faircloth deftly made an \n     issue of Mr. Sanford's health by publicly wishing him a \n     speedy recovery.\n       Mr. Faircloth's narrow victory ended Mr. Sanford's \n     political life, one that had begun when he was 11: in a 1928 \n     parade in his hometown, Laurinburg, N.C., Terry Sanford \n     carried a sign for Alfred E. Smith, the Democratic \n     Presidential candidate.\n       Terry Sanford was born on Aug. 20, 1917. His father was a \n     merchant and his mother a schoolteacher.\n       He graduated from the University of North Carolina at \n     Chapel Hill in 1939. After a brief stint in the F.B.I., he \n     joined the Army in 1942. That year, he married Margaret \n     Knight of Hopkinsville, Ky.\n       Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, Terry Jr., of \n     Durham; a daughter, Elizabeth, of Hillsborough; two sisters, \n     Mary Glenn Rose of Pennsylvania, and Helen Wilhelm of Bern, \n     Switzerland, and two grandchildren.\n       As an Army private, Mr. Sanford served as a paratrooper, \n     taking part in the invasion of Southern France and later in \n     the Battle of the Bulge, for which he received the Bronze \n     Star and a Purple Heart.\n       After the war, mustering out as a first lieutenant, he \n     received his law degree from the University of North Carolina \n     at Chapel Hill and became active in the North Carolina \n     Democratic Party.\n       Whether working for himself or on behalf of other \n     Democrats, he was known as a tireless campaigner, and a cool \n     one. While he was running for governor, the pilot of his \n     small plane seriously misjudged a short landing strip and \n     came within inches of touching down in a cornfield.\n       Unruffled, Mr. Sanford stepped out and, grinning, helped \n     several ashen reporters down the steps.\n       ``Start picking corn, boys,'' he said before walking away.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  The Chair would note there are just 32 seconds or so remaining before \nthe vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I want to join my friends and colleagues in paying \ntribute to Terry Sanford. I did not serve on\n\n[[Page S3333]]\n\nany committee with Terry, but in the few years that we served together, \nhe immediately struck me as a wonderful man, a good man, with a ready \nsmile, a very thoughtful, very wise, very good, very deep person, the \nkind of Senator that not only North Carolina, I know, is very proud of, \nbut the kind of Senator that I think most Americans would want their \nSenator to be.\n  I cannot, as I am standing here thinking of Terry Sanford, think of \nanother person whom I respected more and loved more and appreciated \nmore, going through all the history, Research Triangle of North \nCarolina, the Governor, president of Duke University. But the main \npoint I want to make is, working with Terry personally, and talking \nwith him, and working through issues, he was a man who will be very \ndifficult to replace. And, as I said, I can think of no Senator whom I \nwould hold in higher esteem or regard than Terry Sanford.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the resolution and preamble \noffered by the Senator from North Carolina are agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 211) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 211\n\n       Whereas Terry Sanford served his country with distinction \n     and honor for all of his adult life;\n       Whereas Terry Sanford served his country in World War II, \n     where he saw action in 5 European campaigns and was awarded a \n     Bronze Star and a Purple Heart;\n       Whereas as Governor of North Carolina from 1961-1965, Terry \n     Sanford was a leader in education and racial tolerance and \n     was named by Harvard University as 1 of the top 10 Governors \n     of the 20th Century;\n       Whereas as President of Duke University, Terry Sanford made \n     the University into a national leader in higher education \n     that is today recognized as 1 of the finest universities in \n     the United States; and\n       Whereas Terry Sanford served with honor in the United \n     States Senate from 1987 to 1993 and championed the solvency \n     of the social security system: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) has heard with profound sorrow the announcement of the \n     death of the Honorable Terry Sanford and expresses its \n     condolences to the Sanford family, especially Margaret Rose, \n     his wife of over 55 years; and\n       (2) expresses its profound gratitude to the Honorable Terry \n     Sanford and his family for the service that he rendered to \n     his country.\n\n     SEC. 2. TRANSMITTAL.\n\n       The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit an enrolled copy \n     of this resolution to the family of the Honorable Terry \n     Sanford.\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH.

The Senate now turns to the amendment No. 2017 \noffered by the Senator from Ohio. Under the previous agreement, there \nwill be 2 minutes of debate equally divided followed by a vote on that \namendment.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I think this Nation of ours came to be what \nit is, more than anything else, for one reason, and that is public \neducation in this country was not what it had been in Europe. It had \nnot been just for the kids from the castle. It had not been just for \nthe rich kids or the wealthy young people. It had not been just for \nthose who were politically well connected, who knew somebody.\n  In this country, education came to be for every single person, and \nthat grew as a national interest. It was implemented then for the K-12, \nas we know it now, through the States and localities and communities \nacross this country. They formed local school boards, and we have \nschool districts. Now every single State has a requirement for public \neducation.\n  We did not preclude other people who had parochial school ideas for \ntheir children, or whether they wanted to send their kids to boys \nschools or girls schools or a special interest of some kind, from \nforming those schools and from sending their children to those schools. \nBut we looked at the public responsibility as being to the public \nschools that gave a good education to every single young person in this \ncountry.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to lend my strong support \nto the efforts of my colleague from Ohio, Senator Glenn. Our colleague \nfrom Georgia has introduced a bill which he claims will improve savings \nfor education. Unfortunately, the evidence from economists seems to \ndisagree with him. The average American family would save only $37 \nunder Senator Coverdell's approach.\n  The reason for this is simple to understand. In order to experience \nreal economic benefit from a tax free savings plan, the principle and \ninterest must stay untouched for significant periods of time in order \nto have a chance to grow. With H.R. 2646, parents would be allowed to \ndeposit up to $2,000 into an educational IRA, which is a significant \nincrease over the $500 they are currently allowed to contribute. \nHowever, Senator Coverdell would also allow these families to withdraw \nfunds from the education accounts for the annual costs of elementary \nand secondary education. So in essence, you would have families \ndepositing $2,000 into an educational savings account, accruing some \nlimited tax savings, and withdrawing it the next year.\n  Under this scenario, there are no long terms savings, no accumulated \ninterest and none of the real benefits that we are attempting to create \nwith these educational IRAs. That is why I am so pleased with the \napproach taken by my friend, John Glenn. Through Senate Amendment 2017, \nfamilies would be able to contribute more to their tax free savings \naccounts, however, it would be reserved for higher education expenses. \nBy increasing the contribution limit to $2,000, Americans can all reap \nthe benefit of increased savings for education. They will see their \nprinciple grow with compound interest and Congress will preserve the \ntrue intention of this newly created IRA.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this table be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    SAVINGS GROWTH THROUGH COMPOUND INTEREST\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                   Less than--\n                                                                ------------------------------------------------\n                                                                            $10 per\n                              Year                                $10 per   week at   $40 per week at   $40 per\n                                                                  week at     12%        6% yield       week at\n                                                                 6% yield    yield                     12% yield\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     1.........................................................       530       560             2,120      2,240\n     2.........................................................     1,091     1,187             4,367      4,748\n     3.........................................................     1,687     1,889             6,749      7,558\n     4.........................................................     2,318     2,676             9,274     10,705\n     5.........................................................     2,987     3,557            11,950     14,230\n     6.........................................................     3,696     4,544            14,787     18,178\n     7.........................................................     4,448     5,649            17,794     22,599\n     8.........................................................     5,245     6,887            20,982     27,551\n     9.........................................................     6,090     8,274            24,361     33,097\n    10.........................................................     6,895     9,827            27,943     39,309\n    11.........................................................     7,934    11,566            31,739     46,266\n    12.........................................................     8,941    13,514            35,764     54,058\n    13.........................................................    10,007    15,696            40,030     62,785\n    14.........................................................    11,137    18,139            44,551     72,559\n    15.........................................................    12,336    20,876            49,345     83,506\n    16.........................................................    13,606    23,941            54,425     95,767\n    17.........................................................    14,952    27,374            59,811    109,499\n                                                                ------------------------------------------------\n$8,500.........................................................   $14,952   $27,374   $34,000/$59,811   $109,499\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized for an additional minute.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, what my amendment would do is say we could \nkeep the $2,000 that is in the bill now, but we would move that just to \nbe used for post-12th grade education. In other words, we move from \n$500 up to $2,000, but we say it cannot be used for private schools, \nfor private school vouchers, and so on.\n  I think when we start down this track, we start toward the ruination \nor start opening the door, a toe in the door, for a ruination of our \npublic school system. I want the finest public school system we can \nhave. Voting a voucher system or taking public money off to support \nprivate schools is not the way to go about it. I urge support for my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n\n[[Page S3334]]\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

So I will reserve the time and wait until those \nwho favor the issue speak in favor of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Who yields time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will take 30 seconds to explain the \namendment, and then if the Senator would like to take his time, and \nthen I will reserve the last 30 seconds for Senator Collins to close.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Helms of North \nCarolina be added as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, my amendment offers the opportunity, \nthe option to local school districts and parents to choose single-sex \nclassrooms or schools if there are comparable opportunities for both \nsexes. ``Comparable'' is the word used by the Department of Education \nand the Supreme Court in the VMI case to determine if there is equal \nprotection under the law.\n  I hope we will allow all of the parents of our country to have this \nas an option. We have to break out of the box in public education to \ngive options to our parents for what is best for their child.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the purpose of the amendment of the \nSenator from Texas is to permit separate classrooms for different \ngenders, you can already do that. We already have it. So there is no \npurpose in this. If the purpose is to set up schools which are separate \nand allegedly providing, as the amendment says, ``comparable,'' all you \nhave to do is look at the court opinions and what ``comparable'' means, \nand it fails to meet the constitutional standard in terms of real \nequality.\n  We don't have to learn in this country again that, when you have \neither minorities in separate facilities or women in separate \nfacilities, it is second-level education or treatment. We can debate \nthat at another time. That is the history. If you just want to have \nseparate classrooms, you can already have them, and it is \nconstitutional.\n  There is a much more sinister and real issue of constitutionality \nthat is raised by this. We virtually had no hearings. If you don't want \nto undermine the whole movement of trying to get equal treatment for \nwomen in the classrooms and education, vote in opposition to the \namendment of the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to support the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Texas. There is a wonderful example of what she is talking \nabout in Presque Isle, ME. There is an all-girl's math class. They \nproduce wonderful results. I have been in that classroom, and the \nlearning there is absolutely terrific. But they had to go through all \nsorts of regulatory hoops in order to be able to do that. They would \nnot have to under the amendment of the Senator from Texas. I am pleased \nto join her in support of it. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have 15 seconds left. I ask that the \nSenator from Illinois be permitted 15 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you very much. I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts. I will be brief. As both a minority --the only minority \nMember of this Chamber--and a woman, I fit both bills. Quite frankly, \nwe have been down the road of separate but equal and unequal in this \ncountry. Unless it is equal, it winds up being unequal. The \ndiscrimination that is possible by this legislation for girls is too \nfrightening to support it. I rise, therefore, in opposition. I ask \nthere be hearings on this matter so that we can visit with the parents \nand see what direction they would like to take. Thank you.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 seconds to \nask the Senator a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is there anything sinister about your amendment?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am so pleased to have the question asked because, \nof course, this is to allow local school districts to have the option. \nWe are not forcing this on anyone. But where an individual child can \nbest perform in a single-sex classroom, why not let them try it? Are we \nnot going to open our minds and be creative with our public education \nsystem? If it is good enough for private education, it should be good \nenough for public education, and everyone should have the opportunity \nto do the best in the circumstances that fit them best. I thank the \nSenator for the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2291. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Utah (Mr. Bennett) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mr. Moynihan) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 69, nays 29, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 89 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--69\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--29\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bumpers\n     Cleland\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Sarbanes\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Bennett\n     Moynihan\n       \n  The amendment (No. 2291) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, shortly I will offer an amendment \non behalf of myself and 18 others to submit a plan to help rebuild and \nmodernize our schools for the 21st century. The amendment creates a \nsimple and effective partnership between the Federal Government, State \nand local governments, and the private sector to provide the financial \nbacking communities need to upgrade and modernize our schools.\n  This legislation will help modernize classrooms so that no child \nmisses out on the information age. It will also help ease \novercrowding--again, so that no child is subjected to what Jonathan \nKozol in his landmark book called ``Savage Inequalities'' that are \ncreated by school environments that are unsuitable for learning. It \nwill help local governments patch the roofs, fix broken plumbing, and \nstrengthen the facilities that provide the foundation for our \nchildren's education.\n  Just last month the grades were posted on a set of international math \nand\n\n[[Page S3336]]\n\nscience tests. Though results of those tests were profoundly \ndisturbing--American students placed at or near the bottom of every one \nof the math and science tests offered, below countries like Cyprus, \nNorway, Iceland and Slovenia--these results should be a clarion call to \nevery policymaker at every level that we need to do more to support \npublic education in this country.\n  Our amendment does exactly that. It creates a new category of zero \ninterest bonds for States and school districts to issue to finance \ncapital improvements. States and school districts will be able to issue \nsome $21.8 billion worth of these bonds over the next 2 years. \nPurchasers of the bonds would receive Federal income tax credits \ninstead of interest. By using this innovative mechanism, this plan cuts \nthe costs of major school repair and construction by at least a third, \nand in many cases by up to 50 percent. Over a 5-year period of time, \nthis plan will cost the Federal Government only $3.3 billion. We pay \nfor the amendment with several tax proposals from the President's \nbudget, several of which have already been approved by the Finance \nCommittee. So this bill is paid for, it is in the President's budget, \nand it will allow the leveraging of substantial amounts of money to \nhelp rebuild our crumbling schools.\n  The interesting thing about it, even at $21.8 billion, this amendment \nonly scratches the surface. According to the U.S. General Accounting \nOffice, it will cost $112 billion just to bring the schools in this \ncountry up to good overall condition. That is just the basics, just \nbringing them up to code. That does not equip them with computers and \nfancy cosmetics but just to address the toll of deferred maintenance. \nThe GAO found that crumbling schools are to be found in every corner of \nAmerica. According to the General Accounting Office, 38 percent of \nschools in urban areas are in the worst condition, 30 percent of rural \nschools are in the worst condition, and 29 percent of suburban schools \nare in the worst condition. So it is about a third, a third, a third. \nThis is not just an inner-city phenomenon. Crumbling schools can be \nfound in every kind of community in every part of our country.\n  In my home State of Illinois, school construction and modernization \nneeds top $13 billion. Many of our school districts have a difficult \ntime even buying textbooks and pencils, let alone financing major \ncapital improvements.\n  I will share some pictures. I think everybody who is listening to \nthis debate has probably seen some crumbling schools, but for those who \nhave not been in a local school recently, I show a picture of a hallway \nin a school in my city. Nobody is proud to show pictures like this, but \nthis is just reality. As you can see, it looks like they have a new \nfire alarm, but given the hallway, the infrastructure, they need a new \nwall. They probably should replace the whole building, but the point is \nthe deferred maintenance is clearly evident.\n  Here is another picture showing the same school. We see the peeling \npaint and the water damage. Here is the floor and the wall. It looks \nlike someone tried to cover up parts of the hallway, but the efforts \nwere obviously not good enough.\n  Our children should not have to learn in these kinds of conditions. \nThis is a picture of a school in a suburb of Chicago. Again, this is a \nsuburban school. These are the kinds of classes kids are required to \nlearn in during these times. A couple of weeks ago, President Clinton \ncame to Chicago and toured the Rachel Carson Elementary School. That \nschool has two buildings, an old one and a brand new one. In the old \nbuilding, classrooms are unusable because of many years of water \ndamage, and the windows have turned opaque. In the new building, \nstudents can learn in modern and bright facilities. According to the \nstudents and teachers, the new facility affords a much greater \nopportunity to learn. And the teachers were so pleased because it \nafforded them an opportunity to teach, again, without regard to the \nthreat of falling plaster.\n  Mr. President, our amendment will allow for school districts to build \nand modernize more than 5,000 new schools across the country. It will \nalso give communities the power to relieve overcrowding. We have the \nlargest number of children in our schools in the history of our \ncountry.\n  According to the Department of Education, enrollment will continue to \ngrow over the next 10 years. Just to maintain current class sizes, we \nwill need to build 6,000 new schools over the next 10 years. Now, \nagain, the problem of overcrowding, in addition to the problem of \ndeferred maintenance and neglect, is a serious one. I have visited \nschools in my home State of Illinois where study halls are held in \nhallways because there is no other classroom space. I have seen \nstairway landings converted into computer labs, and cardboard \npartitions used to turn one classroom into two. There was one school \nwhere the lunch room had been converted into two classrooms so that the \nstudents would have to eat in the gymnasium instead of having gym class \nwhere they have ``adaptive physical education,'' where they stand next \nto their desks because the gymnasium is now a lunch room. I was tickled \nto listen to the young people talk about this problem and this issue. \nOne young man talked about a phenomenon called ``hall rage.'' He said, \n``it happens when you are in the halls trying to get to class and it is \nso crowded that you can't go anywhere.'' They are experiencing violence \nin the hallways because of overcrowding.\n  These conditions directly affect the ability of children to learn \nand, again, the research has backed up the intuition, what people know \nintuitively, which is that we cannot expect our children to learn \ntomorrow's skills in buildings that are crumbling down around them.\n  The problem is so widespread and pervasive, and I submit to anyone \nlistening that this really is a direct and foreseeable result of our \narchaic school funding system. The current system of school funding was \nestablished over a century ago when the Nation's wealth was measured in \nterms of landholdings. Wealth is no longer accumulated just in land, \nand the funding mechanism of relying primarily on the local property \ntax is no longer appropriate, nor is it adequate. The current school \nfinance budget works against most American children and mitigates most \nfamilies' best efforts to improve local schools.\n  Again, according to the General Accounting Office, in another study \nthey did, poor and middle-class school districts really make the \ngreatest tax effort, but the system works against them. In some 35 \nStates, poor and middle-class districts have higher tax rates than the \nwealthiest districts, but they raise less revenue because there is, of \ncourse, less property wealth to tax. In 11 States, this unfair system \nhas led the State courts to rule that their State school finance \nsystems are unconstitutional. In nearly every case, States complied by \nraising property taxes or sales taxes to finance school improvement. By \nthe way, litigation is pending in 16 other States. The odds are that \nmany of those lawsuits will in fact result in higher local property \ntaxes.\n\n  Mr. President, our amendment can break this cycle of crumbling \nschools and higher local taxes. Our amendment breaks the mold of school \nfinancing and creates a new partnership for the 21st century where the \nFederal Government, by giving tax benefits for investment, allows \nStates and local governments to leverage $22 billion worth of \ninvestment in school infrastructure. I urge my colleagues to take a \nclose look at the needs of the schools in their States and decide what \nthey stand for--higher property taxes and crumbling schools, or lower \nproperty taxes and a new partnership to improve our schools for the \n21st century. Our students should learn about gravity in a science lab, \nnot from falling ceiling tiles. Our schools should be wired for \ncomputers, not just metal detectors. Our classrooms should be \ncomfortable, not just crowded like rush hour commuter trains.\n  I believe that the American public understands this issue. According \nto a bipartisan poll released earlier this year, 76 percent of \nregistered voters would support a $30 billion, 10-year Federal \ncommitment to rebuilding and modernizing our schools.\n  I want to submit for the Record a letter from the President of the \nUnited States, which is on every Member's desk, I believe, in support \nof this amendment, the last lines of which say:\n\n\n[[Page S3337]]\n\n\n       Our children deserve schools they can be proud of. I urge \n     you to help our schools provide a learning environment that \n     will prepare our children for the challenges of tomorrow by \n     supporting the Moseley-Braun amendment, and opposing the \n     expanded Education IRA's.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                       Washington, April 20, 1998.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: As you consider H.R. 2646 this week, you \n     will have the opportunity to vote for the first time on a \n     version of my proposal to help build and modernize more than \n     5,000 schools across America. I am writing to ask for your \n     support in this important effort and for your opposition to \n     the expanded Education IRAs in the bill.\n       Never before have the education infrastructure needs of the \n     Nation been so great. In order to accommodate record \n     enrollments, move to smaller class sizes, repair aging \n     buildings, take advantage of new technologies, and better \n     educate children with disabilities, States and localities are \n     faced with unprecedented construction and renovation needs. \n     The Federal Government helps build roads, bridges, and other \n     infrastructure projects, but none of that will matter much if \n     we let the education infrastructure come crumbling down on \n     our children. We must be part of the solution.\n       I understand that Senator Moseley-Braun will offer an \n     amendment that would replace the IRA provisions with a \n     proposal to allow communities to issue nearly $22 billion in \n     bonds for modernizing public schools. Because bond purchasers \n     would receive interest payments through a Federal tax credit, \n     communities' costs would be reduced by one-third or more. A \n     vote for this amendment is a vote for safer, state-of-the-art \n     schools that will open doors to the future for our children.\n       The IRA provisions, which provide tax benefits for \n     elementary and secondary education expenses, are both bad \n     education policy and bad tax policy. Instead of targeting \n     limited Federal resources to build stronger public schools, \n     this proposal would divert needed resources from public \n     schools. In addition, the expanded IRAs provide little \n     financial assistance to average families, disproportionately \n     benefiting the highest-income taxpayers. For these reasons, \n     and because of other potential amendments that may be \n     adopted, I would veto this bill.\n       Our children deserve schools they can be proud of. I urge \n     you to help our schools provide a learning environment that \n     will prepare our children for the challenges of tomorrow by \n     supporting the Moseley-Braun amendment, and opposing the \n     expanded Education IRAs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I would not be here as a Member of \nthe U.S. Senate if it were not for a system of quality public education \nwhen I came through the system. It breaks my heart that we have failed \nto maintain that level of quality public education across this country \nfor every child that wants to access it.\n  It seems to me that as we go into the next century, it is the \nresponsibility of our generation to give every child the opportunity to \nlearn and to give every child at least the basic tools with which that \nindividual would not only be able to provide for themselves, but really \nprovide for our country's well-being. As we go into the next century, \nthere is no question that in this international global competition, in \nthis information age and age of technology, unless we educate every \nchild and give every child the ability to access a quality education, \nto go as far as their talents will allow them, we will be undermining \nour Nation's ability to maintain its standard as a leader in this world \neconomy. How and whether or not we train our work force may well come \ndown to something as simple as providing an environment that is \nsuitable for learning.\n  Our kids cannot learn if they are put in environments that are not \nsuitable for learning, in which they cannot access the new technology. \nI submit to my colleagues that this is a very, very serious matter. I \nfind it interesting that even the columnists and the cartoonists have \ndrawn cartoons about this. But this is certainly no laughing matter. If \nanything, this issue goes to the heart of our generation's commitment \nto provide the next generation of Americans with at least as much as we \ninherited from the last generation. We inherited from them a school \nsystem that was quality, that was adequate, in which people like me \ncould get an education and ascend to the U.S. Senate. I am afraid that \nunless we tackle this problem and create a partnership to help \nmodernize the schools, we will fail the next generation of Americans. I \ntherefore call upon my colleagues to put partisanship aside and support \nthis amendment.\n  I yield to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, just an administrative technicality. \nUnder the unanimous consent agreement, we agreed that the amendment to \nbe offered by the Senator from Illinois would have an hour equally \ndivided. We have endeavored to accommodate the Senator from Illinois. I \ndon't believe the amendment is technically prepared, but I assume that \nthe Senator from Illinois agrees that the time we are spending now \nwould operate under the 1 hour equally divided time.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Absolutely. I thank the Senator from Georgia. He \nis exactly right. It was my assumption that in light of the fact that \nthere was a technical glitch in the amendment as prepared, the time \nused at this point would come off of that.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Illinois. I commend her for her incisive \namendment, which will aid the children of America and the parents of \nAmerica. I appreciate very much her effort today.\n  Does the Senator from Delaware wish to say something? I will be happy \nto yield temporarily.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I believe that, in the normal order of \nthings, as the manager of the bill, I would be next to address the \namendment proposed by the distinguished Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois had control and \nyielded to the Senator from Rhode Island, which was her right to do.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, let me continue by again commending the \nSenator from Illinois. It goes right to the heart of what we do \nmaterially to aid the States and localities in the United States in \nproviding for excellent public education and excellent education \noverall.\n  The statistics that we have seen about crumbling schools in the \nUnited States is staggering. Just recently, the American Society of \nCivil Engineers concluded that our schools are in the worst condition \nof any of America's infrastructure. We know that because we go back to \nour States and to our communities every weekend and we see these \nbuildings.\n  Just yesterday I was in the Providence Street Elementary School in \nWest Warwick, RI. The reason I went there is because this is an \nexcellent elementary school, one of two elementary schools in Rhode \nIsland accredited by the New England Association of Schools and \nColleges. I was talking to the principal and his staff. They do \nwonderful things. I asked them: What is the biggest problem in this \nschool? They said, without hesitation, the facilities. The main \nbuilding of the Providence Street School was built in 1914 onto a \nwooden structure. But in 1969 the school department acquired a \nparochial school across the street. The classes are operating in both \nof these schools. Schoolchildren--first graders, second graders, third \ngraders, and fourth graders--have to cross a busy thoroughfare each and \nevery day to change classes. There is no room in the old building, the \n1914 building, to accommodate the new technology. The heating system \ndoes not work. Yet, this is a wonderful school.\n  That is just an example of one school in my State. I could go on and \non and on. In Woonsocket, the Harris School was built in 1876, the year \nthat George Custer met his fate at Little Bighorn. It is still \noperating. The Thompson Middle School in Newport, RI, part of it was \nbuilt in 1898.\n  These schools need help. These communities need help. This is not \njust about improving the academic quality, which I think it could do \ndramatically; it is also assisting taxpayers. More and more of our \nconstituents are coming up to us and telling us they cannot afford to \nsupport increased property taxes\n\n[[Page S3338]]\n\nthat support schools in their communities.\n  If we want to do anything constructive, pragmatic, and useful to help \nnot only the schools of America but the taxpayers of all the towns and \ncities of America, then we will support this legislation because it \nwill directly assist them in their efforts. The proposal that Senator \nMoseley-Braun has submitted is an ingenious way to use Federal \nresources to promote public education at the local level.\n  Once again, we require the initiative of the locality. They will have \nto decide what schools will be fixed up. They will have to go to their \ncommunities and ask for bond authority to do it. But we would by paying \nthe interest to allow these communities to get the resources to make \nthe investment to fix the schools, to provide the education which we \nknow is at the heart not only of the individual progress of the next \ngeneration of Americans but the progress of our Nation, because without \ngood schools, without schools that are at least sanitary, that at least \nhave the ability to accept modern equipment, without this minimal level \nof adequacy, we cannot expect children to learn to be not only \nproductive members of our economy in the 21st century but to be \nproductive citizens of the 21st century. This is the way to proceed--\nnot by disseminating Federal resources in tax plans to aid private \nschools but by allowing the local communities to use their initiative \nto issue bonds with Federal help to fund, repair, and renovate schools.\n\n  This is what our constituents want. This is what we must do to \nimprove public education in this country.\n  I thank the Senator for her recommendation of this amendment. I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois for two reasons. First, it is important to \nunderstand that the amendment strikes section 101 of the Coverdell \nbill. This section is the very heart of the legislation, for it is the \nprovision that provides the most widespread benefits for American \nfamilies. This section increases the maximum contribution to an \neducation IRA from $500 to $2,000. It permits the education IRA to be \nused for elementary and secondary school expenses, and it permits the \neducation IRA to be used for public and private schools.\n  I have already spoken numerous times about the importance of making \nthese changes to the education IRA. In fact, the Senate has already \nendorsed these changes as they were all included in the Senate version \nof the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. The provisions made sense at that \ntime, and they continue to make sense today. Our students and our \nfamilies need these resources and the benefits of an education IRA to \nhelp them meet the cost and realize quality education. I hope my \ncolleagues continue to recognize just how important this tool can be \nfor the American people.\n  Mr. President, a second reason I oppose this amendment is that, in \neffect, it would create a massive Federal mechanism whose stated \npurpose is to spur the construction and rehabilitation of public \nschools. It appears to be the same proposal contained in the \nadministration's fiscal year 1999 budget, and it would create a new \ntype of bond called a ``qualified school modernization bond.'' Unlike \nregular tax-exempt bonds, like those already in the Coverdell bill \nwhere holders receive tax-exempt interest payments, the holders of \nthese new ``qualified school modernization bonds'' would receive a \nFederal tax credit in an amount to be set by the Treasury Department. \nThis amendment provides that a total of $19.4 billion worth of these \nschool modernization bonds could be issued around the country over the \nnext 2 years. It also increases the amount of qualified zone academy \nbonds by $2.4 billion over 2 years.\n  Even more massive than the amount of bonds to be issued under the \nproposal is the bureaucracy that would be created to administer this \nprogram. The Treasury would need to establish a formula to allocate the \nschool modernization bonds. The amendment calls for half of the bonds \nto go to the 100 largest school districts with the largest number of \nlow-income children. The other half of the bonds would go to the States \nand Puerto Rico divided in proportion to their share of Federal \nassistance. This would be according to the basic grant formula of the \nElementary and Secondary School Act of 1965. Then all of this would be \nreadjusted for allocation to the 100 largest school districts.\n  This runs contrary to President Clinton's promise that the ``era of \nbig government is over.'' It runs contrary to our objective to \nstrengthen schools by empowering families and communities. It \nconsolidates ever-increasing power in the hands of a few Federal \nbureaucrats while it robs our families and communities of local control \nover their schools and precious financial resources.\n  Not only does the Moseley-Braun amendment create more bureaucracy in \nthe way that it requires the Federal Government to sift through the \ncriteria and bond allocation process, but it calls on the Federal \nGovernment to oversee another massive program.\n  According to this amendment, a bond would only be deemed to be a \nqualified school modernization bond if the Federal Department of \nEducation signs off on it. The Federal Department of Education would \nhave to approve the school construction plan of the States or eligible \nschool districts. By giving its OK, the Federal Department of Education \nis supposed to consider whether--I am quoting from the administration's \ndescription of its proposal:\n\n       The school construction plan must, one, demonstrate that a \n     comprehensive survey of a district's renovation and \n     construction needs has been completed; and, two, describes \n     how the jurisdiction will assure the bond proceeds are used \n     for the purposes of this proposal.\n\n  If we are to meet the education needs of our children and the \nchallenges of the future, we need less bureaucracy, not more. We need \ngreater involvement in oversight from our parents and communities, not \nless. We need a Federal Government that supports the best and most \ninnovative programs and policies implemented by our States and local \nschool boards, not one that takes them over.\n  The bond proposals in this amendment are modeled after a much more \nlimited measure that was included in the 1997 tax bill at the request \nof Congressman Rangel and the administration. The 1997 bill created \n``qualified zone academy bonds.'' The purpose of these bonds was to \nprovide additional incentives for private entities to get involved in \nschool construction.\n  Holders of the qualified zone academy bonds, all of whom have to be \nin the business of lending money, are to receive a tax credit instead \nof an interest payment, and the amount of qualified zone academy bonds \nfor 1998 and 1999 was capped at $400 million per year.\n  The qualified zone academy bond program was deliberately kept small \nfor several reasons. First, there was a fundamental concern about the \nFederal Government taking on the traditional State and local \nresponsibility for school construction. Second, it was unclear whether \nthe academy bond program would place funds where they need to be, in \nthe hands of local schools.\n  Nevertheless, here we are, less than 1 year later and the push is on \nfor a massive expansion of what is nothing more than an untested \nproposal.\n  The attempt with this amendment is to authorize almost $22 billion in \nall-school bonds, and this attempt is being made without any data that \nthe bond mechanism in the amendment is the most efficient or beneficial \nway to help States and localities deal with school modernization. It is \nsimply unclear whether issuing a new type of bond, no matter how catchy \nits name, will ultimately result in schools being modernized. What is \nclear is that it once again falls back on the failed notion that \nWashington knows best. It assumes that creating layer upon layer of \nunneeded bureaucracy within the Department of Education is a far \ngreater solution than giving parents and local communities greater \ncontrol over the education of their children.\n  Under the proposal, the Department of Education would be required to \napprove the school construction plan of a\n\n[[Page S3339]]\n\nState or eligible school district. This means that the bureaucrats from \nWashington would be micromanaging a local school district's renovation \nplans--in effect, second-guessing and even directing the decisions of \nState and local officials. It also means that parents, local leaders, \nand school districts would have to watch as their vital financial \nresources are commandeered by Washington, DC, and sent out to build and \nrenovate schools elsewhere despite the fact that they themselves might \ndesperately need improvements in their own community schools.\n  This amendment strikes right at the heart of local control. It gives \nthe Department of Education the final say about how a school district \nshould address its construction and renovation needs. It allows the \nDepartment of Education in Washington to tell local officials that they \nhave misjudged the needs of their district. This is wrong. Local \nofficials are the people who are on the front lines every day. They \nknow the needs of their students. They are directly accountable to \nparents. It seems only a matter of common sense that they are the ones \nwho best understand the need of their district and the best ways to fix \nany problems.\n\n  Yet this amendment would set up a structure whereby the availability \nof this Federal tax benefit is controlled by Washington and not by the \nlocalities. As the Department of Education would be required to monitor \nwhether the bond proceeds were being used for the stated, appropriate \nrenovation plan, Washington bureaucrats would have an ongoing \nsupervisory role.\n  It just does not make sense for the Department of Education to get \ninvolved at this level. President Clinton himself stated in 1994 that \n``the construction and renovation of school facilities has \ntraditionally been the responsibility of State and local governments, \nfinanced primarily by local taxpayers.'' And in that respect I agree \nwith the President.\n  I remind my colleagues that the approach in the Moseley-Braun \namendment is not risk free. The costs are substantial. The Joint Tax \nCommittee estimates that the revenue loss to the Federal Government for \na program like this would be about $3.26 billion over 5 years and $9 \nbillion over 10 years.\n  The Coverdell bill offers better government. I oppose the Moseley-\nBraun amendment, and I urge my colleagues to join me.\n  I yield back the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Who yields time?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Chair.\n  I say to my chairman, Senator Roth, that in the first instance the \nSenator misread the bill. This plan provides for minimal administrative \nrequirements on the State and local authorities charged with school \nrepair and construction. The State and local school districts need meet \nonly two main requirements for issuing these new school bonds. First, \nthey have to document their school facility need. Second, they have to \ndescribe how they intend to allocate the bonding authority to assure \nthat the schools get the benefit of it.\n  End of story. There is no reapplying for money. There is no \ncontinuous oversight. There is no getting individual projects approved \nby the Federal agency. There is nothing about having to deal with big \nGovernment at all in this legislation.\n  I would add also that no school district, no State is required to \ntake this. This is for those school districts that want to issue these \nbonds. It is a matter of engaging the private sector, engaging \ncommunities, engaging local governments in helping to rebuild their \nschools.\n  I yield 5 minutes--he wants 7.\n  Mr. ROTH. Will the distinguished Senator from Illinois yield on my \ntime for 60 seconds?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Yes, of course.\n  Mr. ROTH. First of all, I think it is important to point out that we \nhave not been graced with a copy of the amendment so that we are not in \na position to state specifically what it says. But my comments are \nbased on the administration's proposal, which specifically spells out \nthese requirements and would result in a major buildup of a Federal \nbureaucracy. I would just like to point out that this local approach \nis, indeed, contrary to what the President himself said in 1996. I \npoint to this chart here which says:\n\n       The construction and renovation of school facilities has \n     traditionally been the responsibility of State and \n     local governments, financed primarily by local taxpayers.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       We are opposed to the creation of a new Federal grant \n     program for school construction.\n\n  With that I 100 percent agree, and it is because of that kind of \nthinking I think it is important that this amendment be defeated.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2292\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand the \n incentives for the construction and renovation of public schools, and \n                          for other purposes)\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I say to my chairman, again, I apologize if he has \nnot had a copy of the amendment. It has just been cleaned up. We had a \ntechnical modification, as you know.\n  I send this amendment to the desk so it is formally offered and ask \nthe clerk to dispense with the reading of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Ms. Moseley-Braun], for herself, \n     Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n     Dodd, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Lautenberg, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Reed, \n     Mr. Robb, Mr. Glenn, Mr. Reid, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. \n     Feinstein, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kerrey, and Mr. Harkin proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2292.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the reading of the \namendment is dispensed with.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, yesterday I attended the groundbreaking ceremony for a \nnew elementary school in Richmond, VA. It was an important occasion for \nthe city of Richmond because the last groundbreaking for a new public \nschool in the capital city of my State was 13 years ago, in 1985, the \nlast year I had the privilege of serving as Governor. Today, the \naverage age for all public schools in the Richmond system is 55 to 60 \nyears, and two of them have portions of their facilities that date back \nto 1888, 110 years.\n  Last month, Education Secretary Dick Reilly and I visited Chantilly \nHigh School in Fairfax County. Even though Chantilly High is a new \nschool, its enrollment is already 20 percent over capacity. Classes are \nbeing taught in 17 trailers that have no bathrooms, bad ventilation and \nare not wired to the Internet. Some classes have student-teacher ratios \nas high as 27 or 28 to 1.\n  I am an enthusiastic cosponsor of the school construction amendment \nof the Senator from Illinois because this legislation gives important \nFederal help to cities like Richmond and counties like Fairfax to help \nbuild and renovate public schools. It not only addresses one of the \nmost pressing needs our schools face--the urgent need for school \nconstruction money--it also represents an eminently appropriate and \nconstructive role for the Federal Government in education.\n  If we had unlimited resources, there is much more I would like to do \nfor education, and I support many of the provisions in the underlying \nbill. But because Federal dollars are limited, we are forced to make \ndecisions on what is most important, on how best to spend the limited \nFederal dollars we have.\n  To me, the provisions of the underlying bill simply do not meet this \ntest.\n  In truth, the simple question before us today is this: How can we \nbest invest $1.6 billion on education? Do we help States face their \nurgent construction needs? Do we give States additional money to help \nreduce class size? Do we help States incorporate technology into their \nclassrooms and curriculum? If we look into the language of the \nunderlying bill, the answer to every question is no.\n  But if we look at the language in the pending amendment and we ask \nthis\n\n[[Page S3340]]\n\nquestion--will we help States and localities build and renovate public \nschools?--the answer is an emphatic yes.\n  Mr. President, there is no question the need is great. The Government \nAccounting Office has estimated that our national school repair and \nconstruction needs are $112 billion. Fourteen million children attend \npublic schools that are in need of major repair or complete \nreplacement. In addition, far too many young Americans attend woefully \novercrowded public schools. We need to help States repair and modernize \nexisting facilities.\n  In order to hire new teachers and reduce class size, we need \nadditional classrooms in which to place those teachers. In order to \nincrease student access to computers and technology, we need to help \nsome existing facilities undergo complete electrical upgrades to \nsupport the use of that technology, and as we debate this bill, we \ncannot be confused about what this bill is and is not.\n  Just because the word ``education'' is in the name, that does not \nmean that the bill gives money to schools. In truth, this legislation \nwill not build a single school or hire a single teacher or help \nincorporate technology into a single classroom.\n\n  Despite all the rhetoric, this bill is really nothing more than a tax \ncut for the few when what we so urgently need is a new roof for the \nmany. Encouraging individuals to save their own money is a noble \nintention, but like every decision we face, we have to acknowledge that \nthere is a cost, and the real cost of the underlying bill lies in every \nschool we don't help build, every teacher we don't help hire, every \nleaking roof we don't help fix and every classroom we don't help wire \nfor the Internet.\n  Again, we have two choices: We can invest $1.6 billion in support of \nschool construction with the pending amendment, or we can spend $1.6 \nbillion on tax cuts, disguised as education money, with the underlying \nbill. I hope the Senate will support school construction.\n  I thank the Chair and yield back any time to the sponsor of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on both \nsides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixteen minutes 34 seconds to the Senator from \nGeorgia; 5 minutes 23 seconds to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, first, I have the utmost respect for my \ngood colleague from Virginia, but I do want to correct one statement \nthat he made. He said that the underlying bill provides no provisions \nfor school construction. That is not accurate. The underlying bill \nembraces the provisions of the Senator from Florida on the other side \nof the aisle that does have a significant expansion of funding for \nschools at the local level and, without creating a new bureaucracy, \nleaving all the decisions to be made at the local level rather than at \nthe Department of Education.\n  In the debate between the chairman and the Senator from Illinois, it \nis suggested that this does not carry that traditional, onerous Federal \nintervention with prevention. But I would just like to share with you \nthat under this legislation, the Federal Government is required to \nestablish a formula to allocate the school modernization bonds.\n  The Federal Government would need to ensure that half the bonds go to \nthe 100 largest school districts with the largest number of low-income \nchildren, and the other half of the bonds would go to the States and \nPuerto Rico divided in proportion of shares of Federal assistance \naccording to the basic grant formula for the Elementary and Secondary \nSchool Act of 1965.\n  The Federal Government would not only scrutinize the criteria and \nfigure out who gets what, it would be required to do more.\n  Under these provisions, a bond would only be deemed to be a qualified \nschool modernization bond if the Department of Education signs off on \nit.\n  The Department of Education would also have to approve the school \nconstruction plan of the State--that is a key one--or eligible school \ndistrict.\n  In approving the construction plan, the Department of Education is \nsupposed to consider whether a comprehensive survey of the district's \nrenovation and construction needs have been completed, et cetera; \nexpansion of the Federal oversight, the master principle envisioned \nover local control.\n  The chairman of the board of education in my State accepts the \nPresident's admonition that construction of schools is a responsibility \nof local government. There is already Federal relief in terms of \nfinancing, but that leaves all the decisions at the local level, like \nthe President wanted to do in 1996.\n  My State is spending over nearly $5 billion in school construction; \n$186 million last year for 57 brand new schools and for modifications \nin 110 additional schools.\n  This proposal rewards failure, because it moves to where the job has \nnot been done. Those States and communities that have been doing what \nthe President appropriately said here, they do not meet the criteria \nanymore because they have eliminated the criteria.\n  Mr. President, we have heard a lot during the course of this debate \nabout how a modest tax relief for 14 million families is inappropriate \ntax policy. I reminded the other side that the definition of the tax \nrelief is identical to the IRA we passed last year and signed by the \nPresident for college education, and all we have done is taken that \nproposal and expanded it to $2,000 instead of $500 and have allowed it \nto be used for grades kindergarten through high school.\n  This amendment eliminates that proposal and that modest tax relief, \nwhich is about $500 million over 5 years and a little over $1 billion \nover 10 years, and creates tax relief of $9 billion--for whom? Banks, \ninsurance companies and very, very successful people are going to be \nthe recipients of this $9 billion. So we just take these little folks \nmaking $75,000 or less, $150,000 or less, mop that out--that's not good \npolicy--and create tax relief on these bonds that would go to banks and \ninsurance companies, and we all know who buys these kinds of bonds, \nthese tax-exempt bonds. Out goes the little guy, in comes the big guy.\n\n  Mr. President, school construction and quality of schools and the \nfacilities are important. For as long as we have known, that has been a \nduty of the State and the local government. A lot of States and a lot \nof local communities have fulfilled that requirement. They will be on \nthe short end of this proposal.\n  The underlying proposal for school construction expands financing for \nschools, gives additional options, but it keeps the decision apparatus \nat the local level. And it does not create another Federal outreach, \nanother Federal intervention, into the local process of school \nconstruction.\n  I oppose the amendment on those grounds. But I am particularly \nconcerned that it eliminates the heart of the underlying proposal, \nwhich is to create a modest--the families will not be taxed on an \ninterest buildup, such a modest proposal that creates such a big \nresponse in America where 14 million families come forward and save $5 \nbillion in the first 5 years, up to $10 billion over 10 years, and \nthere is not a single tax dollar involved. These are voluntary dollars, \nan enormous infusion, frankly, larger than this proposal, behind the \nstudent--not the building, but the student. Those billions of dollars \nwill buy computers and tutors and deal with special learning \ndisabilities and cost the Federal Government, in terms of taxes not \ncollected, a very modest amount.\n  But this will go to buildings, and this will cost the taxpayers $9 \nbillion. Conversely, this little proposal, the education savings \naccount, creates $10 billion. There is no school board that has to \nraise its property tax base. There is no State that has to raise its \nincome tax. There are no new taxes from the Federal Government. It is \npeople doing it on their own, simply because we have said, we will \nallow you to keep your investment, your principal, and we will not tax \nyou on the interest if you use it to help your child in school wherever \nthey happen to be.\n\n[[Page S3341]]\n\n  The other side has repeatedly said this is for private schools. And \n7.5 percent of the underlying cost of the underlying bill could help \nsomebody who has a child in private schools; 90-plus percent goes to \nchildren and helps people in the public school system. So it is just \nincorrect--and the Senator from Illinois has not been part of that, but \nall morning long I have heard this business that the underlying \nproposal is for private schools. It is just not the case.\n  Seventy percent of the families who use these savings accounts have \nchildren in public schools. Half the money that is generated--and it is \ntheir money--would go to support children in public; half of it would \ngo to support children in private. Tax relief that would be associated \nwith private is about $200 million over 5 years, or about 7 percent of \nthe cost of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield back whatever is left of my 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, it is important to note \nthat under the Moseley-Braun amendment the provision dealing with the \nconstruction, the Graham amendment, is not struck, it is preserved, as \nwell as the tuition assistance programs. What is struck is the \nCoverdell proposal. And the Coverdell proposal, according to the Joint \nTax Committee, provides that the majority of its money is going to go \nto private schools. Now that is a fact.\n\n  You have the choice of whether you want that or whether you want to \nhave a downpayment in our public schools to try to help ensure that we \nare going to free our public schools from asbestos, from boilers \nbreaking down, and from leaky pipes.\n  Mr. President, I want to just mention a case here that is right on \npoint. And this is the Revere public schools. That is a blue-collar \narea in Massachusetts. It has increased by 25 percent the enrollment \nover the past 5 years in the elementary schools. Revere recently passed \na $2.2 million referendum to repair roofs in three schools and to \nremove the asbestos panels and modernize the fire alarm system in the \nhigh school. Since then, the high school roof has begun to leak, \nthreatening to ruin the new fire alarm system. The town estimates it \nwill cost $1 million to repair the roof. The mayor says: We would \nrepair the roof if we had the Carol Moseley-Braun amendment.\n  What I hear from the mayors all over Massachusetts, in the old towns \nand communities, as well as in the rural areas, is that interest on \nsome of these bonds runs up to 40 percent of the burden and the debt, \nin many instances, if they are not attended to in a prompt way.\n  This provides a helping hand to those needy communities. And it is an \nessential part of the President's program. I commend the Senator from \nIllinois for making this strong case and hope our colleagues will \nsupport her.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to support two \nconstruction initiatives to help our public schools reduce \novercrowding. The first is included in Senator Roth's substitute bill \nthat is before us and the second is an amendment by Senator Carol \nMoseley-Braun.\n  The two proposals combined mean that California could issue tax \nexempt bonds totaling $2.8 billion. They differ in their approach and \nhelp two different types of districts. The Roth proposal will help \nsuburban high-growth areas. The Moseley-Braun proposal will target \ndisadvantaged, inner city districts, while also providing the state \nwith authority to address the needs of other districts.\n\n\n                           the roth proposal\n\n  The school construction provisions of Senator Roth's education bill \nprovide $2.4 billion per year for new tax-exempt bonds and allocate \nthem according to a state's population, at $10 per person. It targets \nfunding at the school districts with a 20 percent enrollment growth \nbetween 1990 and 1995. Under this proposal, California could issue tax-\nexempt bonds totaling $322 million and as many as 77 high-growth school \ndistricts in California could take advantage of these bonds. This means \nthat using these bonds, we could build 40 elementary schools, 8 middle \nschools and 2 high schools in my state. We could build schools in high-\ngrowth school districts like Clovis, Capistrano, Tustin, Elk Grove, \nModesto, Palo Alto, Lancaster, Culver City, and Fontana.\n  The Roth proposal creates a new category of tax exempt facility bonds \nto encourage innovative public-private partnerships for school \nconstruction, but the ownership of the school building would stay with \nthe public school district. This approach could brings some innovative \nfinancing to school construction, in my view.\n  While in terms of California's enormous needs, the amount of bonding \nauthority in this proposal is modest, it does offer a new financing \ntool for our schools.\n\n\n                      the moseley-braun amendment\n\n  I also will vote for the school construction amendment to be offered \nby Senator Moseley-Braun, which will provide $22.6 billion in authority \nfor state and local governments to issue bonds to construct and \nrehabilitate schools. In addition, her amendment will make more \nqualified zone academy bonds available by increasing the national bond \ncap from $400 million to $1.4 billion and by allowing them to be used \nfor school construction. Bondholders would get federal tax credits in \nlieu of interest.\n  Under this proposal, California could get $2.5 billion in bonds, the \nmost of any state. Thirty-five percent of these bonds would be used by \nthe 100 largest school districts based on their ESEA Title I funding, \nwhich assists disadvantaged children. Sixty-five percent would be \ndistributed by states based on their own criteria. In addition, the \nSecretary of Education could designate 25 additional districts based on \nthe state's share of ESEA Title I grants, excluding the 100 largest \ndistricts.\n  Under this amendment, the following school districts could receive \nthe following allocations:\n\n  Bakersfield City Elementary, $19 million;\n  Compton Unified, $30 million;\n  Fresno Unified, $56 million;\n  Long Beach Unified, $48 million;\n  Los Angeles Unified, $481 million;\n  Montebello Unified, $22 million;\n  Oakland Unified, $35 million;\n  Pomona Unified, $18 million;\n  Sacramento City Unified, $31 million;\n  San Bernardino City Unified, $32 million;\n  San Diego City Unified, $68 million;\n  San Francisco Unified, $28 million;\n  Santa Ana Unified, $27 million; and\n  Stockton City Unified, $24 million.\n  In addition to these, the state would get $1.2 billion to allocate \namong needy school districts.\n  In my state, these two proposals provide two approaches to address \nthe school construction needs in two different types of California \nschool districts. The Roth-Coverdell proposal helps districts with \nenrollment growth exceeding 20% between 1990 and 1995, high-growth \ndistricts. The Moseley-Braun proposal helps the large, urban, poor \ndistricts, districts that also have pockets of escalating enrollments \nand dilapidated and crowded buildings.\n\n\n                      california's critical needs\n\n  My state faces severe challenges.\n\n\n                       soaring enrollment growth\n\n  California's public school enrollment between 1997 and 2007 will grow \nby 15.7 percent, triple the national rate of 4.1 percent. California's \nschools will see the largest enrollment increase of all states during \nthe next ten years.\n  Each year between 160,000 and 190,000 new students enter California \nclassrooms.\n  California's high school enrollment is projected to increase by 35.3 \npercent by 2007. Approximately 920,000 students are expected to be \nadmitted to schools in the state during that period, boosting total \nenrollment from 5.6 million to 6.8 million.\n  California needs to build 7 new classrooms a day at 25 students per \nclass between 1997 and 2001 just to keep up with the growth in student \npopulation.\n\n\n                              overcrowding\n\n  California needs to add about 327 schools over the next three years \njust to keep pace with the projected growth. Yet these phenomenal \nconstruction rates would only maintain current use and would not even \nbegin to relieve current overcrowding.\n  We have the largest class sizes in the nation. Students are crammed \ninto every available space and in temporary buildings. Los Angeles \nUnified School\n\n[[Page S3342]]\n\nDistrict, for example, has 560,000 seats for 681,000 students.\n  Here are a few other examples:\n  At Horace Mann Year-Round School in Oakland, increasing enrollment \nand class size reductions require some teachers and students to pack up \nand move to a new classroom every month.\n  At John Muir Elementary School in San Bruno, one class spent much of \nthe year on the stage of the school's multipurpose room as it waited \nfor portables to arrive.\n  Anaheim City School District has a 6 percent enrollment growth rate, \ndouble the state average and recently approved the purchase of 10 \nportable buildings, at a cost of $235,000 to relieve overcrowding.\n  Los Angeles Unified School District has 195 schools on a \nnontraditional, year-round schedule and is bussing 11,000 students away \nfrom their neighborhoods because of overcrowding. Garfield High School \nin East Los Angeles was built for 2,500 students but now has almost \n5,000. Many classes have 40 or more students per teacher.\n  In order to build it's way out of overcrowding, Oceanside School \nDistrict in San Diego, would need to build four elementary schools, two \nmiddle schools and a high school at an estimated cost of $110 to $140 \nmillion.\n\n\n                              Old Schools\n\n  60 percent of our schools are over 30 years old.\n  Today's schools need a modern infrastructure, including updated \nwiring for computers.\n  In California, 87 percent of the public schools need to upgrade and \nrepair buildings, according to the General Accounting Office,\n\n\n                               High Costs\n\n  The California Department of Education estimates that the state needs \n$22 billion during the next decade to modernize our public schools and \nan additional $8 billion to meet enrollment growth.\n  Here's what it costs to build a school in California:\n  An elementary school (K-6), $5.2 million;\n  A middle school (7-8), $12.0 million; and\n  A high school (9-12), $27.0 million.\n  Our schools must be built to withstand earthquakes, floods, El Nino \nand a myriad of other natural disasters. California's state earthquake \nbuilding standards add 3 to 4 percent to construction costs.\n  The cost of building a high school in California is almost twice the \nnational cost. The U.S. average is $15 million; in California, it is \n$27 million.\n\n\n                          Class Size Reduction\n\n  Our state, commendably, is reducing class sizes in grades K through 3 \nbecause smaller classes improve teaching and learning.\n  We have the largest pupil-teacher ratios in the country and \nfortunately, we are beginning to reduce class sizes. Small classes \nbring more individual attention to students, but smaller classes mean \nmore classrooms.\n  In short, California's needs are immense and states and local \ncommunities need the federal partner.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  These new bond programs will provide important assistance for school \ndistricts across America. Some of the bonds can especially help small \nand low-income area school districts, because low-income communities \nwith the highest school rehabilitation and construction needs may have \nto pay the highest interest rates in order to issue the bonds, if they \ncan be issued at all.\n  These approaches are similar to the bill I introduced on March 12, \nthe Expand and Rebuild America's Schools Act, S. 1753. My bill would \nprovide a tax credit for bond holders of school construction bonds and \nincludes criteria to address high growth areas and older schools in \nneed of modernization.\n  School overcrowding places a heavy burden on teachers and students. \nStudies show that the test scores of students in schools in poor \ncondition can fall as much as 11 percentage points behind scores of \nstudents in good buildings. Other studies show improvements of up to 20 \npercent in test scores when students move to a new facility.\n  The point is that improving facilities improves teaching and \nlearning. School overcrowding undermines the health and morale of \nstudents and teachers, disrupting education. Overcrowded schools \nprevent both teachers and students from reaching their full potential.\n  Our nation's school districts face huge challenges as we move toward \nthe 21st century, with a record 52.2 million children this year and a \nbooming school population forecast well into the next century. The \nlegislation proposes modest, targeted federal support for school bonds \nin growth areas, offering important assistance to school districts, \nteachers, parents and students.\n  In the end, it is improved student achievement is what this is all \nabout and in the end, that is the goal of this Senator.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby my colleague from Illinois, Senator Moseley-Braun. The Senator's \namendment would authorize over $22 billion in essential bonding \nauthority to the 50 States and territories to improve our Nation's \npublic school system.\n  The Moseley-Braun school construction amendment would provide direct \nassistance to states to improve and construct school facilities for our \nnation's children. The amendment before us will help thousands of \nschools across the country modernize their facilities to meet \nincreasing technological demands. It will also provide assistance to \nlocal school districts to build additional facilities for the growing \nnumber of students.\n  Hawaii's schools, particularly our rural schools on the neighbor \nislands, are in great need of improvement and modernization. The \ninclusion of modern technology in our education curriculum requires \nextensive renovations in older school buildings to ensure that all \nchildren have equal access to today's technological advancements. \nHawaii's schools could receive an estimated $53 million for school \nconstruction under this amendment. This would greatly assist my state \nin meeting the increased educational demands of our children.\n  Mr. President, as a former teacher, I have taught in both the private \nand public school systems, and I recognize the advantages and \ndisadvantages of both systems. However, I believe that the Federal \nGovernment has a moral obligation to ensure that all our children are \nprovided a quality education, and diverting potential resources away \nfrom our public schools is a disservice to the majority of American \nchildren who attend public schools. The underlying proposal does not \nfocus on those who need the most help. The bill before us provides an \naverage tax break for families with public school children of only $7 \nover five years, while families with children in private schools would \nreceive a $37 benefit. This proposal provides a disproportionate share \nof benefits to wealthier families who do not need the additional \nFederal assistance.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Moseley-Braun school construction \namendment and provide all our nation's children an equal opportunity to \nlearn in safe, clean, modern school facilities. Thank you, Mr. \nPresident, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I will close. How many minutes do I \nhave left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes 18 seconds.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I will close briefly by saying this: The choice, \nunfortunately, here is between a new and complicated tax cut that is \ndisguised as education policy--and I say ``new and complicated;'' it is \nall of $7 to a maximum of $37 a year tax cut that nobody really asked \nfor. It will not fix a single school. It will not deal with an existing \nproblem. It will not reduce a single dollar of property taxes.\n  I point out that the quote from the administration that was made in \n1996 makes it very clear: Traditional responsibility, financed by local \ntaxpayers. We are trying to provide a partnership to break the cycle of \ncrumbling schools and high property taxes by providing a partnership \nthat allows us to fix crumbling schools, to fix up the schools, provide \nan environment suitable for learning, and reduce the property tax \nburden, and bring the Federal Government, in cooperation and \ncollaboration--not a lot of bureaucracy, but as a helping hand.\n  The Federal Government is not the problem here. It is not the \nsolution here. It can only help and assist local\n\n[[Page S3343]]\n\nefforts. That is all this amendment does. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Moseley-Braun amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, the statement was made by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Illinois that her legislation would not require the creation of \nthe type of bureaucracy of which I spoke in my opening remarks. I have \nsince then, for the first time, received a copy of the amendment. But I \nhave to say that exactly as I spelled out in my statement, this \nlegislation requires very detailed action on the part of the Department \nof Education and the Treasury in allocating and granting the funds \nprovided for under this agreement.\n  Let me just give you one or two illustrations of what I speak. On \npage 17, in paragraph 5, it says:\n\n       Approved state application.--For purposes of paragraph (1), \n     the term ``approved State application'' means an application \n     which is approved by the Secretary of Education and which \n     includes--\n       (A) the result of a recent publicly-available survey \n     (undertaken by the State with the involvement of local \n     education officials, members of the public, and experts in \n     school construction and management) of such State's needs for \n     public school facilities, including descriptions of----\n\n  I will not read on. But I want to reemphasize that this legislation \nis putting control of school construction in the hands of Washington, \nof the Federal bureaucracy. And that is exactly contrary to what the \nPresident himself said in the justification of an appropriations \nestimate.\n  I think it is important too, because I agree with what he says here:\n\n       The construction and renovation of school facilities has \n     traditionally been the responsibility of state and local \n     governments, financed primarily by local taxpayers; we are \n     opposed to the creation of a new federal grant program for \n     school construction.\n\n  That is exactly what I am saying today. We are opposed to the \ncreation of a new Federal program with a bureaucracy. We think the \ncontrol of our schools, including the construction of new facilities, \nshould be in the hands of the State and local government.\n\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes and 14 seconds, and the Senator \nfrom Illinois has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I reiterate in the underlying proposal \nthere is a concern about school construction. In that sense, there is a \nsharing of concern with the Senator from Illinois. We have a different \nview about how to come to it.\n  I believe, as I said, this proposal moves to failure. A State that \nhas met its responsibilities and kept schools up to the level they \nshould be doesn't meet the criteria in the amendment for the funding.\n  The second point, and probably for me the most significant, is that \nthis amendment obviates and destroys the education savings account that \nwe have been discussing now for almost 6 months. This education savings \naccount offers modest tax relief, which causes Americans to do very big \nthings. About $500 million-plus tax relief on the interest buildup in \nthe savings account will cause 14 million families, according to the \nJoint Tax Committee, to open such an account and save, of their own \nmoney, $5 billion in 5 years, over $10 billion in 10 years, all of \nwhich comes to the direct support of a child's need--tutor, computer, \ntransportation, afterschool program, uniform; it goes on.\n  So with just a modest incentive offered from the Federal Government, \nwe cause Americans to step forward and give massive support to \neducation.\n  Now, that is taken out of the bill and exchanged for something that \ntakes $9 billion of Federal money, doesn't create a dime on the part of \nthese families, and this tax relief goes to the financiers. A certain \nsegment of it can only be managed by banks and insurance companies, and \nthe balance of it certainly will gravitate to the wealthiest of our \nsociety.\n  So we kick out these average families--middle-income families. They \ncannot open a savings account and save this modest tax on their \ninterest. That goes in the trash can. But the big dollars for big \ninvestors comes forward. The net exchange is, the Federal Government \nexpends $9 billion instead of $1 billion and creates no investment \nversus $10 billion in investment. That is not a very good exchange. The \nlittle guy gets shortchanged. He or she cannot open a savings account, \nbut the big institutions have an incentive to come forward.\n  So I repeat, this proposal rewards failure, it creates a massive new \nFederal reach, new Federal intervention into what even the President \nsays should be a local decision, and wipes out those 14 million savings \naccounts.\n  I just say, one of the important features of that savings account \nthat I think never gets talked about is the fact that every time the \nfamily opens it, from that point on, every month when they get the \nstatement--not with their billions, but with their hundreds of \ndollars--every month they get it, they will be reminded of what that \nchild needs for the school they attend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the opponents has expired.\n  The Senator from Illinois has 2 minutes.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I fear somehow that in parts of this debate we are \ntalking at each other. That is unfortunate.\n  Everybody, of course, supports increased savings. That is not the \nissue. The question is whether or not this is education policy and \nwhether or not we are responding to a very real need.\n  The relief provided in the Coverdell proposal, the $7 a year, is not \ngoing to fix a single broken window or roof. It is not going to address \nthis issue of public schools at all. That is where this issue is \njoined, unfortunately.\n  In closing, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nlist of the supporters of this proposal, along with a representative \nsample of letters, including one from a teacher in downstate Illinois.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           List of Supporters\n\n       AFL-CIO.

We are very concerned about the physical \n     condition of the schools in downstate Illinois, especially. \n     My husband's school is in rural Stark County. The building is \n     almost 80 years old. It is completely inaccessible to the \n     handicapped. His classroom has windows which will not stay \n     open and having an open window in a classroom with no air-\n     conditioning is important. In order to have fresh air in the \n     room he must climb on a chair and onto the window sill to \n     prop a stick in the window. This is just one example of the \n     poor conditions he must face every day when he goes to work.\n       As for my situation, the worst problem I face is the lack \n     of air-conditioning. My school is in Peoria County. Our \n     school year begins August 15 and at times the room in which I \n     teach has a temperature of 95+ degrees. We have state-of-the-\n     art computer technology, but no air-conditioning.\n       I hope the federal government can pass legislation to help \n     school districts in this country bring their buildings up to \n     livable standards. We have brand new jails going up all \n     around us, but our children and teachers in the schools are \n     trying to work in conditions no one in any other part of \n     society would tolerate.\n           Sincerely,\n     Dorothy Strickler.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               National Education Association,\n\n                                    Washington DC, March 11, 1998.\n     United States Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator:  On behalf of the 2.3 million members of the \n     National Education Association (NEA), we reiterate our \n     opposition to the ``education IRAs'' for private schools in \n     S. 1133 and urge you to vote against passage of this bill or \n     any similar provision. No modification or additional \n     amendments to this provision, such as school construction, \n     would change our position. Positive ideas, such as \n     modernizing public school buildings, should not be tied to \n     tax schemes to benefit private and religious schools.\n       Instead of supporting S. 1133, NEA urges you to vote for a \n     substitute to provide tax credits to subsidize $22 billion of \n     school modernization bonds over 10 years. These bonds would \n     enable states and local public school districts, which serve \n     more than 90 percent of all students, to provide safe, modern\n\n[[Page S3344]]\n\n     schools that are well-equipped to prepare students for jobs \n     of the future. School modernization bonds would target one-\n     half of the funds to schools with the greatest number of low-\n     income children and allow states to decide where to \n     distribute the remaining half. This would ensure that rural, \n     urban, and suburban schools all benefit from these bonds.\n       The provision in S. 1133 to create tax-free savings \n     accounts to pay for private and religious schools would do \n     nothing to improve teaching or learning in our public \n     schools. It would also disproportionately benefit wealthy \n     families who already send their children to private and \n     religious schools. The public and parents say they want \n     federal investments to improve teacher training, promote safe \n     schools, and establish programs to help all students reach \n     high standards. Tax shelters, as proposed by S. 1133, would \n     do nothing to help achieve these goals.\n       Further, this tax-free savings account does not guarantee \n     parents a choice of schools. Private school admissions \n     officers would decide which students to accept. An editorial \n     about S. 1133 in the September 11, 1997 issue of the \n     Christian Science Monitor stated: ``Sounds innocent enough. \n     But where does it lead? It's a small step toward positioning \n     government behind private--most often church-related--\n     elementary and secondary education.''\n       NEA urges you to vote for the public school modernization \n     bond substitute and against cloture and final passage of S. \n     1133 if it contains the private school tax scheme.\n     Sincerely,\n                                           Mary Elizabeth Teasley,\n     Director of Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     National PTA,\n\n\n                             Office of Governmental Relations,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 20, 1998.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The 6.5 million-member National PTA opposes \n     H.R. 2646, expected to be taken up during the week of April \n     20th. There are two amendments the National PTA urges you to \n     support because they would eliminate the problem of funneling \n     public dollars into tax breaks for private and religious \n     school participation. One of the amendments will be offered \n     by Senator Moseley-Braun and would substitute Senator \n     Coverdell's tax package for a proposal to fund school \n     construction projects designed to modernize public schools. \n     The other amendment we urge you to support will be offered by \n     Senator Glenn. His proposal would strike the language that \n     allows for a tax subsidy for K-12 education, so that the tax \n     breaks would go toward higher education accounts only.\n       The substitute package authorizes a tax credit for \n     desperately needed construction and renovation. Instead of \n     investing taxpayers' money in savings accounts that would \n     primarily reward wealthy families, the substitute would \n     direct federal resources to build and modernize public \n     schools across the nation. By paying for the interest on \n     nearly $22 billion in state and local bonds, the substitute \n     will help ensure that children across the nation will be able \n     to learn in safe, modern, well-equipped schools and get \n     preparation they need to succeed in the 21st Century.\n       The amendment eliminating the K-12 language would still \n     allow parents to invest $2,000 in higher education savings \n     accounts, thus providing greater long-term financial benefits \n     to families. According to The Joint Committee on Taxation, \n     families who withdraw funds from the accounts to pay for \n     primary and secondary school education will only receive an \n     average tax benefit of $7 if their child goes to public \n     school and $37 if their children attend private schools.\n       If either the substitute or the amendment do not pass, we \n     urge you to oppose passage of H.R. 2646. Instead of using \n     investing taxpayers' money to help a few children, we implore \n     you to support investments in public schools that serve \n     approximately 90% of K-12 students.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Shirley Igo,\n     Vice President for Legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Rebuild America's Schools,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 20, 1998.\n     Re: Moseley-Braun School Modernization Amendment to H.R. 2646 \n         (S. 1133)\n       Dear Senator: Rebuild America's Schools is a coalition of \n     school districts and national organizations organized to help \n     local communities in their efforts to modernize and build the \n     school facilities needed to prepare our nation's students for \n     the 21st century.\n       Rebuild America's Schools supports the Moseley-Braun, \n     Moynihan, Daschle, Kennedy, School Modernization substitute \n     amendment to H.R. 2646 (S. 1133). This amendment provides tax \n     incentives to assist local communities in offering school \n     construction bonds. The Qualified School Construction Bonds \n     will enable states and school districts to offer $9.7 billion \n     in school construction bonds in FY '99 and 2000. The \n     Qualified Zone Academy Bonds established in the 1977 \n     Taxpayers Relief Act also are expanded.\n       The need to repair, modernize and build new schools to meet \n     rising enrollments is well documented in virtually every \n     community in the nation. The Government Accounting Office \n     report on the condition of America's schools established the \n     alarming fact that over $112 billion must be invested to \n     repair and modernize existing school facilities. State and \n     local communities are struggling to finance school \n     modernization programs. It cannot be done without federal \n     support. The students educated in the local public schools of \n     today will be tomorrow's political, economic and social \n     leaders.\n       Federal support through the tax incentive programs \n     presented in the Moseley-Braun, Moynihan, Daschle and Kennedy \n     amendment will provide federal support in a magnitude which \n     will help local communities renovate and build the schools \n     they need. Decision making prerogatives and local \n     responsibility for management of school facilities will \n     remain at the local level. Proposals such as exempt facility \n     bonds or private activity bonds for public schools do not \n     provide enough resources to provide real assistance to the \n     broad range of rural, urban and growing school districts \n     straining to provide modern and safe school facilities for \n     their students.\n       The Moseley-Braun, Moynihan amendment can generate more \n     than $20 billion in school construction bonds. This will \n     reach every state at a cost to the federal government of $3.3 \n     billion over five years, according to the Joint Committee on \n     Taxation.\n       The Moseley-Braun Substitute amendment to H.R. 2646 (S. \n     1133) commits significant federal incentives to help state \n     and local communities provide educational facilities to \n     enable students to thrive and prosper in the society and \n     economy of the 21st century.\n       We urge your support of the substitute amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Robert Canavan,\n     Chair.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           American Association of\n\n\n                                        School Administrators,\n\n                                    Arlington, VA, April 16, 1998.\n     Hon. Carol Moseley-Braun,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moseley-Braun: The American Association of \n     School Administrators (AASA), representing more than 14,000 \n     public school superintendents nationwide, urges you to oppose \n     the ``A+ Savings Accounts'' championed by Senators Coverdell \n     and Torricelli. If enacted into law, this cleverly packaged \n     voucher scheme would mark a landmark shift of the federal \n     role in elementary and secondary education. It represents the \n     first step in an effort to shift federal aid away from public \n     schools, where 90 percent of American children are educated, \n     and towards private and religious schools.\n       As you know, and as research and testing prove, most of the \n     challenges that public education currently faces are related \n     to poverty. AASA's members believe that, because of this, it \n     is illogical for Washington to create new education programs \n     that only wealthy taxpayers will be able to effectively \n     utilize. As you know, AASA has designed a bold reform plan \n     specifically aimed at impoverished local schools which \n     incorporates ideals championed by Republicans and Democrats. \n     AASA's members support strong, decisive, and innovative \n     action at the federal level to improve public education; \n     however, the Coverdell-Torricelli plan is none of these \n     things.\n       We understand that Senator Dodd will offer an amendment to \n     spend the money that would be spent on the Coverdell-\n     Torricelli plan on the Individuals With Disabilities \n     Education Act (IDEA). As you know, the federal government has \n     never come close to meeting its fiscal responsibilities under \n     IDEA. Senate Republicans have stated, and included in their \n     budget resolution, their intent to fully fund IDEA before \n     embarking on new education spending. AASA strongly supports \n     fully funding IDEA, and AASA's members believe that the Dodd \n     amendment offers an excellent opportunity to move the federal \n     government towards meeting its commitment.\n       AASA also strongly supports Senator Moseley-Braun's \n     amendment to modernize American schools and Senator Glenn's \n     amendment to modify the Education Individual Retirement \n     Accounts. Considering the Joint Tax Committee's estimate of \n     the benefit to public school families from the Coverdell-\n     Torricelli plan, the contrast between the Moseley-Braun \n     school modernization initiative and this thinly disguised \n     voucher plan could not be more stark.\n       Thank you for considering our views. AASA stands ready to \n     assist you however we are able. Please do not hesitate to \n     call on us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Andrew Rotherham,\n     Legislative Specialist.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial \n           Organizations,\n                                   Washington, DC, March 17, 1998.\n       Dear Senator: The AFL-CIO strongly urges you to oppose \n     motions to invoke cloture and final passage of S. 1133, the \n     Parent and Student Savings Account Plus Act. The provisions \n     of this bill amount to nothing more than subsidized private \n     education for children of wealthy Americans paid for by the \n     tax dollars of the working public.\n       The simple truth is that the average working family will \n     never benefit from the IRA accounts created by S. 1133. \n     Ninety percent of American children grades K-12 attend public \n     schools and will never benefit from IRA accounts. Because S. \n     1133 can be used by wealthy taxpayers making up to $160,000, \n     70% of the benefits from the new IRA accounts will go to 20% \n     of the nation's wealthiest families. The average American \n     working family with children under the age of 18 cannot \n     accumulate the savings necessary to use the new IRA. The \n     Joint Committee on Taxation found that 60% of taxpayers would \n     not establish such an account.\n\n[[Page S3345]]\n\n       S. 1133 does nothing to achieve educational goals that are \n     widely agreed upon. There is no funding to facilitate higher \n     academic standards, improved teacher training and safer \n     schools. Instead, the bill allows scarce federal funds to be \n     used for undefined ``tutors'' (including babysitters or \n     family members) and transportation, which according to the \n     Joint Committee on Taxation, could mean using the IRA to buy \n     a car for a student. Equality of educational opportunity \n     cannot be achieved by diverting funding from public schools \n     attended by many to private schools benefiting few.\n       S. 1133 amounts to little more than a voucher program to \n     defray private education costs for the children of a very \n     small number of wealthy Americans. The AFL-CIO urges you to \n     oppose motions to invoke cloture and final passage of S. \n     1133, and work with us to address the educational needs of \n     all our children.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Peggy Taylor,\n     Director, Department of Legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              American Federation of Teachers,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 15, 1998.\n       Dear Senator: On April 20, 1998, the Senate will return to \n     H.R. 2646. On behalf of 950,000 members of the American \n     Federation of Teachers (AFT), I again urge you to vote \n     against H.R. 2646, The Parent and Student Savings Account \n     Plus Act, commonly called the Coverdell bill. H.R. 2646 \n     provides a $2,000, IRA-like investment account, whose tax-\n     free proceeds can be used to pay for private K-12 educational \n     expenses. The American Federation of Teachers strongly \n     opposes this bill because it is an indirect form of \n     educational voucher that would undermine support of public \n     schools.\n       H.R. 2646 will not benefit working families because they do \n     not have the necessary discretionary income. It is an \n     expensive bill that would provide tax breaks primarily to the \n     wealthiest families. The Treasury Department estimated that \n     70 percent of the benefits will go to the wealthiest 20 \n     percent of the nation's families, and as drafted, will \n     increase the administrative problems of the IRS. Further, the \n     Joint Tax Committee estimates the average benefit for public \n     school families would be only $7 by the year 2002, and $37 \n     for private school families.\n       The bill ignores the fact that almost 90 percent of K-12 \n     students go to tuition-free public schools. For this reason, \n     the Coverdell bill can be described as a ``voucher-like'' \n     tax-free savings account that for the most part will benefit \n     wealthy families who send their children to private schools.\n       While AFT does not oppose the right of parents to choose \n     private education, we strongly oppose the direct or indirect \n     use of publicly funded vouchers, tax credits, IRAs, or other \n     such mechanisms to pay for private K-12 educational expenses. \n     It is essential to have an effective public education system \n     to realize equality of opportunity for all Americans. The way \n     to help all schools become more effective is by implementing \n     high academic standards, high behavioral standards, and \n     investing in needs such as new or improved school buildings.\n       AFT does support the Democratic school modernization \n     substitute for the Parent and Student Savings Account Act. \n     The school modernization substitute would provide federal tax \n     credits for the interest on special school modernization \n     bonds, at a five-year cost of $5 billion. This would leverage \n     approximately $22 billion of school modernization bonds--a \n     modest federal contribution to the $112 billion school \n     construction shortfall projected by the GAO.\n       We also support Senator Glenn's amendment to strike K-12 \n     from the Coverdell IRA. If the Glenn amendment were adopted, \n     the Coverdell IRA would be exclusively for higher education \n     and not undermine support for K-12 public education.\n       If the Democratic School modernization amendment and the \n     Glenn Amendment fail, the American Federation of Teachers \n     urges you to oppose H.R. 2646.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Gerald D. Morris,\n     Director of Legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n         International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & \n           Agricultural Implement Workers of America\n                                   Washington, DC, March 11, 1998.\n       Dear Senator: This week the Senate may take up the proposed \n     Parent and Student Savings Account Plus Act (S.1133), \n     sponsored by Senator Coverdell. The UAW strongly opposes this \n     legislation; we urge you to vote against this measure and to \n     oppose and attempt to invoke cloture when it is taken up by \n     the Senate.\n       The Coverdell bill would allow individuals to contribute up \n     to $2,000 per year to tax-free IRA type accounts for \n     elementary and secondary school expenses, including the \n     expenses associated with attending private and parochial \n     schools. In our judgment, these tax subsidies are simply \n     private school voucher by another name. This bill would \n     disproportionately favor privileged families who are more \n     likely to have money to put into their IRA type accounts than \n     are families with lower incomes. In addition, the legislation \n     would divert urgently needed funds from public schools, \n     thereby undermining our system of public education and \n     encouraging well to do families to send their children to \n     private and parochial schools.\n       The UAW understands that a substitute package may be \n     offered to S. 1133 that would fund school construction \n     projects designed to modernize public schools the UAW \n     supports this initiative to ensure that children across the \n     nation are able to learn in a safe, modern, well-equipped \n     school environment. We believe that federal policies should \n     direct limited resources into public schools where over 89 \n     percent of American children are educated, not divert funds \n     to private and parochial schools.\n       For these reasons the UAW urges you to vote against the \n     Coverdell bill (S. 1133) and to oppose any attempt to invoke \n     cloture on this measure. We also urge you to support the \n     substitute proposal providing additional funds for school \n     construction. Thank you for considering our views on these \n     important issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Alan Reuther,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Federation of State, County and Municipal \n           Employees, AFL-CIO,\n                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 1998.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of 1.3 million members of the \n     American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees \n     (AFSCME), I strongly urge you to oppose the ``education \n     IRAs'' for private schools in S. 1133 and urge you to vote \n     against passage of this bill. Instead, we urge you to vote \n     for a substitute to be offered by Senator Carol Moseley-Braun \n     to provide tax credits to subsidize $22 billion for school \n     modernization bonds over 10 years. These bonds would enable \n     states and local public school districts, which serve more \n     than 90 percent of all students, to provide safe, modern \n     schools that are equipped to prepare students for the future.\n       The provision in S. 1133 creating tax-free savings accounts \n     to pay for private and religious schools would do nothing to \n     improve teaching or learning in our public schools. It would \n     disproportionately benefit wealthy families who already send \n     their children to private and religious schools.\n       This tax subsidy does nothing to raise academic standards \n     for all children, provide safe learning environments for \n     children, provide more teacher training, or increase parent \n     involvement in schools. Tax subsidies are private school \n     vouchers by another name. They would divert public resources \n     to support private education at a time when we need to do all \n     we can to improve our public schools. Please vote against S. \n     1133 and for the Moseley-Braun substitute.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Gerald W. McEntee,\n     International President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Hispanic Education Coalition,\n\n                                                   April 20, 1998.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Hispanic Education Coalition \n     (HEC), an ad hoc coalition of national organizations \n     dedicated to improving educational opportunities for \n     Hispanics and other interested organizations, we are writing \n     to urge you to strengthen our educational infrastructure as \n     you begin debate and votes on S. 1133. In passing \n     transportation legislation, the Senate signaled that \n     transportation infrastructure is of vital national interest, \n     crucial to the economy and future development. Education is \n     equally important. Socially, politically, and economically, \n     education will be the determining factor in the quality of \n     life in our nation.\n       Please support Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun's amendment, in the \n     nature of a substitute, to provide critical federal resources \n     to help states and local education agencies modernize schools \n     and reduce class sizes. There is little disagreement that \n     across the nation, many of our public schools are in terrible \n     physical shape, placing our children's safety in jeopardy and \n     cheating them of access to critical educational tools. \n     Likewise, there is broad consensus that we are facing an \n     acute teacher shortage that will worsen as the current \n     teaching corps ages and the student population grows. Not \n     surprisingly, the schools that are in the worst condition and \n     suffer the most from teacher shortages are located in our \n     most disadvantaged and fastest growing communities. As a \n     nation, we can ill afford to poorly educate large segments of \n     tomorrow's workforce. Sen. Moseley-Braun's amendment will \n     move us toward resolving these pressing problems by \n     leveraging local resources to build, repair and modernize \n     schools and providing incentives that will help put more \n     qualified teachers in our classrooms.\n       We also encourage you to support Sen. Jeff Bingaman's \n     amendment to focus national attention on drop out prevention. \n     As stated in the Hispanic Dropout Project's final report, No \n     More Excuses, ``For students, dropping out forecloses a \n     lifetime of opportunities--and in turn makes it far more \n     likely that their own children will grow up in poverty and be \n     placed at risk. For business, this means a lack of high \n     skilled employees, fewer entrepreneurs, and poorer markets. \n     For communities, this cumulates the risk of civic \n     breakdown.'' For the Hispanic community, with a drop out rate \n     of nearly 30 percent, this issue is of paramount importance.\n       Unfortunately, two amendments that will be offered would \n     significantly undermine our education system and could do \n     real harm to many low-income students. Individual tax credits \n     will not improve our educational infrastructure, put quality \n     teachers into classrooms, nor improve the educational \n     achievement and attainment for our students. Secondly, \n     Federal resources that are carefully targeted are most \n     effective. Federal education programs were created to fill \n     gaps\n\n[[Page S3346]]\n\n     that local and state governments allowed to occur. Block \n     grants would dilute the positive impact many of these \n     programs have made in providing opportunities for \n     disadvantaged students. Although these proposals may spark \n     interesting political debates, they do little to help us \n     accomplish the task at hand--ensuring that all children have \n     access to quality education.\n           Sincerely,\n     Patricia Loera,\n       HEC Co-Chair, National Association for Bilingual Education.\n     Raul Gonzalez,\n       HEC Co-Chair, National Council of La Raza.\n       On behalf of: Hispanic Association of Colleges and \n     Universities, League of United Latin American Citizens, \n     Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, National \n     Association for Migrant Education, and National HEP-CAMP \n     Association.\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. This chart is a ``report card'' for America's \ninfrastructure, which was put together by the American Society of Civil \nEngineers--not exactly a probureaucracy group. We can see mass transit \ngot a C; bridges, a C-minus; solid waste, a C-minus; waste water, a D-\nplus; roads, a D-minus; but schools got an F. We clearly have a \nproblem.\n  A minimum $112 billion only begins to set up a partnership. Again, it \nis not the grant program that the administration opposed several years \nago but a bureaucracy-free tax credit. We give local governments the \nhelp we can best give them, which is access to the tax benefits that \nthis legislation provides. And from that assistance, from that modest \nassistance that we as a national community give these local \ngovernments, we will be able to go to the private sector, go to the \ncapital markets, and raise the money to begin to grapple with this \nproblem.\n  We have an ``F'' on schools in this country in terms of \ninfrastructure needs. I daresay the real tragedy here is that we have \nnot reached consensus yet that it is appropriate as a national \ncommunity that we come together in a partnership, that we work \ntogether, instead of pointing fingers about what is wrong and pointing \nthe blame and saying it is this group's fault or the local property \ntaxpayer. We ought to work together to make certain issues like this \nget resolved in behalf of the children of our country and the future of \nthis country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a minute?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I wanted to explain the reason I voted the \nway I did on the last amendment. I strongly support Senator Moseley-\nBraun's amendment and approach.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order so the Senator \nfrom Delaware can be heard.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Once again, Mr. President, as often occurs here, we are \npresented with Hobson's choices. As I said, I have strongly supported \nand continue to support the school construction initiatives of Senator \nMoseley-Braun, but her amendment should have been added to the bill, \nnot given as an alternative to it. In order to vote for her amendment, \nI would have had to vote against the guts of the Coverdell bill. I \nsupport the essence of what Senator Coverdell is doing. So I voted \nagainst Senator Moseley-Braun's amendment, although I strongly support \nit and think we need to invest considerable amounts of money in school \nconstruction.\n  I conclude by saying I only wish it had been an add-on to the \nCoverdell bill, not in place of the Coverdell bill.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware for \nhis remarks.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that debate only be in order \nfor the remainder of the session of the Senate today to be equally \ndivided between the majority and minority leaders or their designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, in light of this agreement, I announce \non behalf of the majority leader there will be no further votes this \nevening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues that I will try to be \nrelatively brief.\n  I wish to speak to the agreement that the Senator from Georgia had \nannounced. Senator Gregg had an amendment that he wanted to bring to \nthe floor dealing with IDEA. Many of us were concerned about his \namendment. From my point of view, this was an amendment that I believe \nthreatened to undercut some of what I think has really been rich and \nimportant about IDEA.\n  That is my own view. Many people in the disabilities community, many \nparents of children are worried about it as well. IDEA is really a \npretty wonderful breakthrough for many families because up until the \nmid seventies--I know Senator Harkin will speak about this later--there \nwere about 8 or 9 million children, many of whom felt shut out from the \nschools. The concern we had was that this amendment might turn the \nclock back. We did not want that to happen. It was our view it wasn't a \nquestion of it might turn the clock back; we were worried that it \nwould. I guess the agreement we have reached is that now Senator Gregg \nis going to withdraw the amendment.\n  I now want to speak about the amendment I am withdrawing. I want to \nsay to parents and people in the disabilities community, especially in \nmy\n\n[[Page S3347]]\n\nState of Minnesota, that I have withdrawn this amendment reluctantly, \nbut I understand their concern, and people really kind of got to my \nheart because there was a tremendous amount of concern about this \namendment and I care fiercely about IDEA. I thought last year we had \nreached a good bipartisan consensus. I think this amendment by Senator \nGregg is mistaken. I am glad it is now withdrawn. And when Senator \nHarkin--who is one of my really close friends here, somebody whom I \nhave a tremendous amount of respect for and who has been probably, I \nthink, just a giant in the Senate when it comes to issues that affect \nthe disabilities community--said that he thought this agreement would \nput his mind at ease, then I so agreed.\n  Mr. President, I will therefore offer the amendment that I had \ninitially had to the Coverdell bill to the higher education bill, which \nmakes a great deal of sense because that is really what this is about. \nI think we can get a majority vote for this because this amendment is \nvery reasonable. Some Senators, such as Senator Ford from Kentucky, \nSenator Levin from Michigan, Senator Durbin from Illinois, who are \namong the original cosponsors, voted for the welfare bill. I voted \nagainst the welfare bill, but that is not what this amendment is about. \nWhat this amendment says is that we really have to fix the welfare \nbill. We have to make a modification here because what's happening \naround the country is that too many States are put in a position, in \norder to meet the work participation requirements, of essentially \nsaying to single parents, almost all of them women with small children, \nyou have to leave school and take a job even if that job is maybe a $6-\nan-hour job, and then a year later they will be worse off because they \ndon't receive any health care benefits.\n  This is shortsighted, and I do not think anybody intended this to \nhappen. What this amendment will say, I say to my colleague from \nGeorgia, is it will leave it up to States. There is no mandate at all. \nIt will just say that if the State of Minnesota--and I think my State \ncertainly wants to do this, or the State of Georgia or the State of \nKentucky so decides--the States can say to us, ``Look, we would like to \nbe able to give these parents, these women, 2 years of higher education \nbecause they are on the path to economic self-sufficiency.'' Why would \nyou want to take them off that path?\n  These are the parents who have the best chance of completing at least \n2 years of school and then obtaining a living wage job and doing better \nfor themselves and their children, and that this would not count \nagainst the work force participation requirements that States now have \nto meet. It would leave it entirely up to the States, but it would at \nleast give States that option.\n  I think my colleagues will be hearing from a lot of Governors and a \nlot of States and the higher education community. I think it makes all \nthe sense in the world.\n  This surely is not what we intended. I do not think we intended, \nunder the framework of what is called welfare reform, to put States in \na position where States have to say to all too many women, ``Look, you \nhave to leave school.'' We ought to let these parents complete the \nschool and, therefore, they are going to do much better for themselves \nand much better for their children as well.\n  Mr. President, I, therefore, want to make it clear that I will offer \nthis amendment. I see my colleague, the chairman of our Labor and Human \nResources Committee, Senator Jeffords, here. I wanted to do it on this \nbill, but we got into this impasse. I care about IDEA. I didn't want us \nto have some acrimonious debate and a lot of ill will. So I am \nwithdrawing the amendment; Senator Gregg is withdrawing his amendment. \nTherefore, I will look for another vehicle.\n  The higher education bill is going to come before us. It is a good \nbill, a bipartisan bill. This amendment, I promise colleagues, is as \nreasonable as it can get. There is no reason in the world why we would \nwant to put States in a position and put too many parents in a position \nof not being able to complete 2 years of education. It certainly would \nmake a huge difference to them.\n  Just one other word. I gather that we are going to talk about IDEA, \nand Senator Gregg or Senator Gorton is going to want to come to the \nfloor and speak about that, and Senator Harkin can respond to what they \nhave to say. For my own part, I thought we had a really strong \nagreement on IDEA. I think we should stick to that. It is a bipartisan \nagreement. It is important to make sure that children who are disabled \nhave equal opportunities. I would hate to see us weaken this very, very \nimportant step that we have taken as a Senate. We will not be dealing \nwith that debate tonight. But this amendment on higher education will \nbe there.\n  I also want to say one other thing to my colleagues, and then I will \nfinish.\n  Again, please look at the evidence that is coming in. What you are \ngoing to see with the welfare bill is that in all too many cases, we \nhave now seen a reduction in the caseload, that is true, but it does \nnot equal the reduction of poverty, which is where we should be \nheading. Too many of these parents are finding jobs, but they pay \nbarely minimum wage without any health care benefits.\n  In addition, the child care arrangements are really rather \nfrightening, and too many small children, prekindergarten children, are \nnot receiving good developmental child care. Too many children who are \nage 4 are home alone, and too many children are going home from school \nalone.\n  We really have to look at what is happening, because a year from now \nor 2 years from now or 3 years from now, depending on the States, there \nis going to be a drop-dead date certain, and there will be no \nassistance. We have to know whether these families are reaching \neconomic self-sufficiency, and the best way these families can do that \nis for that mother to be able to get an education.\n  If we want real welfare reform or we want to reduce poverty or we \nwant to have a stable middle class in our country, there is nothing \nmore important to do than to make sure that we focus on a good \neducation and a good job. That is what this amendment is about.\n  I thank my colleague from Georgia for his graciousness. I hope when I \noffer this amendment there will be good, strong support. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments by the \nSenator from Minnesota and the accord and cooperation by all parties \nconcerned in facilitating the debate on this education proposal. I \nthank my colleague for his comments.\n  Because of the large number of amendments on this measure, it has \nbeen difficult at times for Senators to know when they might make a \ncomment. Senator Grams has been here most of this afternoon. Now that \nwe are in this open period--and I know Senator Jeffords also was here--\nI hope that some accord can be shown our two colleagues who have been \nwaiting to make a comment.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to take a few minutes \nthis afternoon to rise and speak in support of Senator Coverdell's \neducation bill, S. 1133.\n  Mr. President, today the Senate continues its debate on this very \nimportant bill, a bill that is really out to promote education \nalternatives. It is a far-reaching bill which advances educational \noptions, one which promotes quality education where it can best be \nachieved and that, Mr. President, is at the local level and by family \ninvolvement. It is sound policy, and I believe it is long overdue.\n  S. 1133, the Parent and Student Savings Account Plus Act, is a modest \nbill, but it is a very important step forward for restoring \ndecisionmaking authority in the hands of parents and families and, \nagain, this is where that authority belongs.\n  The heart of this bill is simply a measure that would allow families \nto save for their children's education and without tax penalty.\n  S. 1133 is the Senate's version of the education IRA which has \nalready passed in the House. The bill, commonly referred to as the A+ \nsavings accounts, would expand the college educational savings accounts \nestablished\n\n[[Page S3348]]\n\nin the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, and that would then include primary \nand secondary education as well.\n  A+ accounts would also increase the maximum allowable annual \ncontributions from $500 to $2,000 per child. The money could be used \nwithout tax penalty to pay for a variety of education-related expenses \nfor students in K through 12, as well as college expenses.\n  A number of mega-dollar, pumped-up political Band-Aids are being \noffered in the form of amendments to the A+ accounts legislation. It \nwould be nice to think that we could solve the problem of education by \njust spending more and more money, but unfortunately, that does not \nwork. The United States is the world leader in national spending per \nstudent.\n  Again, the United States is the world leader in national spending per \nstudent. Yet, our test scores show that our system is failing our \nchildren. Test results released in February show that American high \nschool seniors scored far below their peers from other countries in \nmath and science. Education Secretary Riley called the scores \n``unacceptable'' and indicated that schools are failing to establish \nappropriate academic standards.\n  Legislation like A+ accounts would help direct responsibility and \naccountability, again, where it belongs--at the family level where \nfamilies can make decisions and take responsibility for their \nchildren's education. The A+ accounts legislation includes many \nimportant legislative initiatives beyond the savings accounts. For \ninstance, it fosters employer-supported education for employees by \nextending the tax credit to the year 2002. I hear time and time again \nemployers are desperate for well-trained employees, and this \nlegislation allows them to continue to provide that training.\n  Graduate level courses would be permitted under this exclusion as \nwell as undergraduate courses. If we are ever going to be able to \ntackle the shortage of high-tech employees, this tax incentive is very \ncrucial.\n  Additionally, the A+ accounts bill would assist local governments in \nissuing bonds for school construction by increasing the small-issuer \nexemption from $10 million to $15 million, provided that at least $10 \nmillion of the bonds are issued to finance public schools.\n  It is estimated that 600 schools would be improved under this \nlegislation. Our bill also provides tax-free treatment for students who \nreceive National Health Corps scholarships. Students can thereby \nexclude the scholarship value from their taxable income. That would \nprovide further important education assistance when it is most needed.\n  A complimentary amendment to the A+ accounts is the Investment in \nAmerica's Future bill. That was Senator Gorton's block granting \namendment. Under this bill, most federally funded K-12 programs, except \nfor special education, would have been consolidated and the dollars \nsent directly to local school districts--free from the usual Washington \nred tape. This would have ensured our education dollars would go to \nstudents, as opposed to going to bureaucrats. The Gorton amendment was \nnot a cutting measure.\n  The bill maintained that if Federal funding were to fall below the \nlevels agreed to in the 1997 budget agreement, then the program would \nrevert back to funding categorical programs.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of additional amendments, crucial \nfor education, which greatly enhance the core A+ accounts legislation. \nThe teacher testing and merit pay amendment would serve to retain \ncompetent teachers by providing incentives to States to implement \nprograms geared at rewarding successful, high-quality teachers.\n  The Coats amendment would increase to 110 percent deductions that \nindividuals and families could take on charitable contributions to \nschools and programs aimed at poor children.\n  Another important amendment would expand literacy programs that are \nso important to assist in poverty areas. So this simple and modest bill \nfosters education through families, through employers, and through \nlocal governments. We could accomplish so much through the A+ accounts \npackage.\n  Common sense would have had us pass these measures a long time ago. \nBut, unfortunately, tired, groundless attacks continue to hang on. And \nthe charge I hear most frequently is that ``education savings accounts \nand tax breaks for parents would shift tax dollars away from public \nschools.'' That simply is not the case.\n  More education dollars under parental control would actually promote \neducation by encouraging parents to save, to invest in, and support \nprograms and materials that facilitate and help provide the right \noption for a child's education. Nothing, Mr. President, would be taken \naway from public education resources--nothing.\n  The A+ accounts help working families by encouraging savings and \nenabling families to make plans which shape a child's future. They are \ndirected at low- and middle-income families, not at the wealthy \nfamilies which currently have more educational options for their \nchildren.\n  It seems ironic to me that some of the loudest opponents of these \nsavings accounts are high-income and high-option individuals who can \nnow afford to send their own children to private schools--and often do.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the great majority of \nfamilies expected to take advantage of the education savings accounts \nare families that have incomes of $75,000 or less. These are the \nfamilies who need those savings options and need the incentives the \nmost.\n  So, Mr. President, the bill provides educational alternatives for \nworking families. These are very important options to improve the \neducation of our children. I urge my colleagues to join in and support \nthis very important education initiative.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we just finished a vote on the \ncontroversial Moseley-Braun amendment related to school construction. \nThere is no question about the tremendous school infrastructure needs \nthroughout this Nation. Well over $180 billion are necessary to bring \nthe schools up to some appropriate standard.\n\n  However, as was very aptly pointed out, and no doubt was one reason \nthat the amendment was defeated, it is States that have the primary \nresponsibility for that construction. It is not a constitutional \nresponsibility of this body.\n  I just bring to the attention of the body a chart that was discussed \nearlier today. Quoting the words of the Clinton administration:\n\n       The construction and renovation of school facilities has \n     traditionally been the responsibility of state and local \n     governments, financed primarily by local taxpayers. We are \n     opposed to the creation of a new Federal grant program for \n     school construction.\n\n  I want people to keep that in mind when they consider what I have to \nsay.\n  Under the Constitution, the District of Columbia, the Capital of the \nUnited States, is, in the view of Congress, at least in the writings, \nare our responsibility as a state legislature is to a State. We, the \nMembers of the Congress of the United States, are responsible for the \ninfrastructure of this city and its school system. And we should be \nashamed of our negligence in that regard. The neglect did not occur \nover a few years; it has occurred over decades.\n  So, the deficit in the school infrastructure is the responsibility of \nall of those who have been in power, whether it was the local \ngovernments to whom we gave the power in the 1970s and 1980s or whether \nit was the Congress that was in power before that. Everyone has \nneglected the school infrastructure. There is no question that the \nNation's Capital, for which Congress is responsible, has one of the \nworst school infrastructures in the Nation.\n  Again, this fall, the DC schools did not open on time. How that \nhappened is another story that could be discussed some other time. But \nthe bottom line is that it was because of the dilapidated conditions of \nthe schools. The students marched to make us all aware of what was \nhappening.\n  I now show you a chart that appeared as a photograph in the \nWashington Post on Wednesday, October 8th, in\n\n[[Page S3349]]\n\nwhich the students say, ``Why should students suffer for adult \nincompetence?'' It should be ``For congressional incompetence,'' \nbecause we are responsible for those schools being closed. The question \nis, what should we do about it?\n  I voted against the Moseley-Braun amendment because I felt that that \nmoney, which would be more than adequate to fix up the D.C. schools, \nshould be utilized for that purpose. I am not pushing this issue right \nnow for this reason: Last year, I raised the issue of funding the \nconstruction of the DC public schools to bring them up to standard. I \nalmost got $1 billion in the Finance Committee. That effort failed by \none vote. We did end up with $50 million coming out of the Senate. But \nin the reconciliation bill, even the $50 million was dropped.\n  Why? Because it was said that there were better programs to be \nfinanced by the Federal Government to help the District of Columbia \nthan to help the school system. I violently disagree with that. At the \nsame time, the Director of OMB said that he would work with me this \nyear to find the money for the schools, as did other members of the \nFinance Committee. The members of the conference committee also said \nthat they would help. Thus I have formed a working group with the OMB \nDirector, Frank Raines, and other Members of both the House and the \nSenate, and we will be working over the next month or two to be able to \ntry to find out what we can do to make sure that these schools get \nbrought up to proper standards.\n  Congress is not meeting its obligation. The infrastructure repair \nrequirements--just to bring schools up to modern standards--is $2 \nbillion. That is with a ``b,'' $2 billion, to give the students in this \ncity the necessary funds to fix up the schools. The District is the \nsize of a small State--population-wise, about the size of Vermont. That \nwe are not able to help these kids is a travesty. There is no excuse \nfor that.\n  Also, if you want to look at the DC schools compared to the rest of \nthe country, we have a chart. The red bar is where D.C. is on critical \nareas in need of repairs, and the yellow is the national average.\n  The national total is $180 billion necessary to bring schools up to \nproper standards--not very good. But if you compare the national \naverage with the D.C. schools, my God, look at that. Exterior walls and \nwindows, 72 percent of DC schools are inadequate. The national average \nis 27 percent. Sixty-seven percent of the roofs on the schools in this \ncity are in bad need of repair, 65 percent of the heating and \nventilation needs repair, and 65 percent of the plumbing needs repair. \nElectrical lighting, 53 percent. That is just not acceptable. We should \nbe ashamed.\n  It is our responsibility to make sure that those repairs are made. \nHowever, not only have we not done that, but in 1974 when we created \nhome rule, we prohibited the District from raising its own money from \nthe most likely source to repair its schools. How did we do that? Well, \nthe Senators from Virginia and Maryland very cleverly put a provision \nin the act that says the District cannot tax the income of nonresident \nworkers. Every State in the Union that has a tax on income, taxes the \nincome of nonresidents.\n  Every city in a multistate area that has an income tax also taxes the \nincome of nonresidents. So in prohibiting a commuter tax in DC, we have \nprecluded District residents from generating the revenues to improve \nthe physical infrastructure of the schools. The District has to have a \nrevenue stream to be able to raise the bonds in order to pay for the \nschool repairs.\n  We in Congress have the responsibility to repair the schools, and we \nhave prevented the local government from raising the money using the \nmost logical source to fix those schools.\n  What must we do? We have a number of options. I first point out that \nthe closing of the schools this past fall demonstrates the necessity of \nfunding the school repairs. In this regard, I want to clear up \nsomething for the record. A lot of blame has been heaped on General \nBecton, the school superintendent. Actually, what happened was that the \ncitizen's group, Parents United, brought a lawsuit to ensure proper \nrepairs while some repairs were already in process of being made. The \nwork was planned so the schools wouldn't have to be closed, but the \njudge, who got fed up with city's inability to repair the schools, \nsaid, ``No, you are not going to open the schools until you complete \nthe repairs.'' This then created a panic, because the school \nadministrators had to search all of a sudden to find contractors to get \nthe schools fixed to then get the schools re-opened. That process, as a \nsubsequent GAO analysis showed, ended up adding expense to the \nrenovation process.\n  It is important for us to recognize that before we go home this year, \nbefore we fix schools in other areas, it is our responsibility to fix \nthe schools of this city. We are constitutionally responsible. I am \nhopeful that in the days ahead, when our DC schools working group \nmeets, our task will be to figure out how Congress is going to find the \nnecessary $2 billion in the years ahead, either through some revenue \nstream created for the District or by utilization of Federal funds. We \nhave to do that. We cannot allow this travesty to continue for the \nyoung people of D.C. when we have a constitutional responsibility to \nfix their schools.\n  I am hopeful that as we go forward, we will be able to work together, \nboth sides of the aisle, to find a solution to this inexcusable \ntravesty for the young people of Washington.\n  I want to make sure that my colleagues understand that what I have \nsaid is valid. First, we have a letter from Dr. Brimmer, the head of \nthe control board, which indicates that it is impossible to create a \nrevenue stream for the DC schools under the present fiscal situation of \nthe city, nor does the school district have the authority to create a \ndedicated revenue source. Therefore, it would be necessary for Congress \nto do something to acquire the necessary money for construction and \nrepairs of the school system.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and \n           Management Assistance Authority,\n                                 Washington, DC, February 9, 1998.\n     Hon. James M. Jeffords,\n     Chairman, Committee on Labor and Human Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I appreciate your continued support of \n     the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) and the \n     opportunity to provide you with information on the outlook \n     for the DCPS capital program.\n       Simply put, the school system must rely upon the District \n     of Columbia government for its capital improvement funds and \n     the City government's related bonding capacity. The General \n     Services Administration has estimated the total cost of \n     repairing and improving the District's educational facilities \n     at more than $2 billion Years of deferred maintenance have \n     left the DCPS education facilities in a state of extreme \n     disrepair.\n       District school officials estimate that between $20 million \n     and $30 million may be realized from the sale of former \n     school properties in the next year. All of the proceeds from \n     these sales will be used for school capital improvements. \n     While these funding sources are substantial, they are finite \n     infusions. Recent additions of capital improvement funds, \n     principally through your efforts, from the privatization of \n     Connie Lee and Sallie Mae, have raised $18.25 million and \n     $36.8 million, respectively. These have greatly enhanced the \n     capital program. However, the sums made available through \n     these means, even when added to the District's current annual \n     capacity to borrow for school repairs and improvements, are \n     woefully inadequate. They do not fully fund the program \n     developed to bring the DCPS facilities into the new \n     millennium.\n       In February, 1997, the DCPS issued its first Long Range \n     Facilities Master Plan covering the years 1997 through 2007. \n     This plan, updated in July, 1997, sets out goals and plans \n     for emergency repairs, right sizing, stabilization, and \n     modernization of the District's public school facilities. \n     Without additional resources, which are not now in sight, \n     this program cannot be fully implemented, and its goals \n     (including equipping schools with modern technology) cannot \n     be achieved.\n       The only continuing source of funding available to the \n     District is its annual capital borrowing program. This source \n     must bear not only a school repair burden, but also the \n     significant infrastructure needs, including the requirements \n     of roads and bridges, of the rest of the District government. \n     This capital program has been limited to approximately $150 \n     million for the entire city in recent years. This is due \n     to the District's statutory limitation on the amount of \n     debt, as a percentage of total revenue, that the city is \n     allowed to carry. Given this limitation, and past \n     commitments to the Washington Metro system, the District \n     can only afford to commit approximately $30 million to \n     public school capital annually, while the annual capital \n     improvement need is well in excess of $100 million.\n\n[[Page S3350]]\n\n       The Authority continues to evaluate alternatives, including \n     a non-profit corporation financing vehicle and a dedicated \n     revenue stream. However, to date none of these alternatives \n     appears to achieve the needed capital funds flow to DCPS \n     without a negative effect on the City's other capital needs. \n     It is also important to note that, for fiscal year 1997, the \n     Federal government provided a Federal Payment (in-lieu-of-\n     taxes) to the Nation's Capital. The District of Columbia \n     Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997 \n     (Revitalization Act) repealed the authorization for such a \n     payment and replaced it with a Federal Contribution of $190 \n     million for fiscal year 1998, with no specific authorization \n     beyond that year. The President's budget for fiscal year 1999 \n     makes no request for the Federal Contribution. This puts \n     further stress on the District's revenue sources and amounts \n     that can be obtained through a capital borrowing program.\n       Your efforts on behalf of the District's school children is \n     recognized and appreciated by this District's citizens and \n     leaders. I hope that this information will be useful to you.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                Andrew F. Brimmer,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. In addition, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record the testimony of Professor Raskin from hearings I held in \nJanuary. It addresses the constitutionality of Congress' responsibility \nfor those schools. As a constitutional scholar, his testimony justifies \nwhat I think has become obvious from the debate, that the Congress has \na responsibility to provide for the D.C. schools infrastructure.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                            [Attachment 1A]\n\n  Testimony of Professor Jamin B. Raskin Before the Senate Labor and \n              Human Resources Committee, January 13, 1998\n\n       The Constitution confers on Congress the same powers over \n     the District of Columbia that states have within their \n     domains. In 1899, the Supreme Court stated that Congress \n     ``may exercise within the District all the legislative powers \n     that the legislature of a state might exercise within the \n     state . . .  so long as it does not contravene any provision \n     of the constitution of the United States.'' \\1\\ In 1932, the \n     Court found that the District Clause endows Congress with \n     ``all the powers of legislation which may be exercised by a \n     state in dealing with its affairs, so long as other \n     provisions of the Constitution are not infringed.'' \\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     See footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Thus, Congress has a structural responsibility for \n     education in the District, and this is a responsibility that \n     must be executed in a constitutional way. In 1954, when the \n     Supreme Court struck down racial segregation in public \n     schools in the states as a violation of the Fourteenth \n     Amendment, it also struck down racial segregation in public \n     schools in the District of Columbia as a violation of the \n     Fifth Amendment. This was Bolling v. Sharpe,\\3\\ the unsung \n     companion case to Brown v. Board of Education, which ended a \n     century of Congressional segregation of public schools in \n     D.C. and malign neglect of the black population.\n       Even after Bolling v. Sharpe, however, Congress oversaw a \n     system of what federal District Court Judge J. Skelly Wright \n     in 1967 called ``racially and socially homogeneous schools'' \n     that ``damage the minds and spirits of all children who \n     attend them'' and ``block the attainment of the broader goals \n     of democratic education.'' \\4\\ In Hobson v. Hansen that year, \n     the court found that the Congressionally-appointed school \n     board, which had a maximum quota of three black members of \n     nine (later changed to four), had effectively segregated the \n     schools by race and class and created ``optional zones for \n     the purpose of allowing white children, `trapped' in a Negro \n     school district to `escape' to a `white' or more nearly white \n     school, thus making the economic and racial segregation of \n     the public school children more complete than it would \n     otherwise be under a strict neighborhood assignment plan.'' \n     \\5\\\n       The Hobson court also found that teachers and principals \n     were assigned according to their race and the race of their \n     students, that a tracking system was used to divide students \n     according to race and class and consigned many students to an \n     inferior and demeaning education, and that reading scores \n     fell increasingly behind the national norm in each grade.\\6\\\n       Thus, although Congress clearly has an ultimate \n     constitutional responsibility for schooling in the district, \n     it is one that it has not generally lived up to, except by \n     court order. Even now, we see that the Emergency School Board \n     of Trustees, appointed by the Control Board, is an illegally \n     created body. So now would be a good time to figure out how \n     Congress can best fulfill its very real obligations to the \n     District and its children.\n       On this question, I just have two quick points. First, \n     unlike the citizens of the fifty states, residents of the \n     District have no state constitution to fall back on in order \n     to demand equality of resources and excellence of result in \n     the educational process, something that has taken place in \n     dozens of states. Thus, as you know, the Supreme Court's \n     decision in San Antonio v. Rodriguez,\\7\\ holding that \n     education is not a fundamental right and that disparate \n     funding of schools does not violate Equal Protection, is the \n     barren and controlling constitutional framework for the \n     District. This makes it all the more important that Congress \n     try to take the rights of the people and the needs of the \n     children seriously. As the Court put it in Brown v. Board, \n     ``education is perhaps the most important function of state \n     and local governments.''\n       But, second, this is a delicate matter since education, as \n     the Court observed in Rodriguez, is also a public function \n     jealously guarded by local governments, one in our nation's \n     history that has been traditionally the province of the local \n     community itself. So, Congress must also act with maximum \n     respect and deference for the wishes of the local population, \n     the American citizens who live there. Thus, your presumption \n     should be that matters of fundamental educational policy \n     should be decided by the local school board and elected \n     officials so long as they do not implicate an independent \n     federal interest that would justify congressional action \n     under the District Clause. On matters of proposed departures \n     from existing educational policy, such as the school voucher \n     proposal currently in play, Congress should allow the \n     District of make up its own mind in the way that every other \n     locality in America is getting to choose for itself. Nothing \n     could be more averse to the spirit of federalism, democratic \n     government and local control over education than to have \n     members of Congress elected from other jurisdictions deciding \n     such basic matters for the people of the District \n     themselves.\n       We must never forget that the District is part of America \n     and its citizens have all the rights of other Americans. In \n     1933 in O'Donoghue v. United States,\\8\\ Justice Sutherland \n     recited explained why District residents may not be treated \n     as second-class citizens:\n       ``It is important to bear constantly in mind that the \n     District was made up of portions of two of the original \n     states of the Union, and was not taken out of the Union by \n     cession. Prior thereto its inhabitants were entitled to all \n     the rights, guaranties, and immunities of the Constitution, \n     among which was the right to have their cases arising under \n     the Constitution heard and determined by federal courts \n     created under, and vested with the judicial power conferred \n     by Article 3. We think it is not reasonable to assume that \n     the cession stripped them of these rights, and that it was \n     intended that at the very seat of the national government the \n     people should be less fortified by the guaranty of an \n     independent judiciary than in other parts of the Union.''\n       Justice Sutherland quoted the Court's opinion in Downes v. \n     Bidwell \\9\\ to the same effect, emphasizing that the District \n     clause had not subtracted constitutional rights from people \n     who already had them as citizens of states:\n       ``This District had been a part of the states of Maryland \n     and Virginia. It had been subject to the Constitution, and \n     was a part of the United States. The Constitution had \n     attached to it irrevocably. There are steps which can never \n     be taken backward. * * * The mere cession of the District of \n     Columbia to the Federal government relinquished the authority \n     of the states, but it did not take it out of the United \n     States or from under the aegis of the Constitution. Neither \n     party had ever consented to that construction of the cession. \n     If, before the District was set off, Congress had passed an \n     unconstitutional act affecting its inhabitants, it would have \n     been void. If done after the District was created, it would \n     have been equally void; in other words, Congress could not do \n     indirectly, by carving out the District, what it could not do \n     directly. The District still remained a part of the United \n     States, protected by the Constitution.'' \\10\\\n       Thus, in closing, I would say that you walk a tightrope \n     here, the way that all states do when the get involved in the \n     essentially local issue of education. On the one hand, you \n     have a basic constitutional and indeed moral responsibility \n     to see to it that excellent education for effective \n     democratic citizenship is made available to all children in \n     the District regardless of race, ethnicity, language, income, \n     social status, geography, and disability. On the other hand, \n     as much as possible, you must respect the basic American \n     principles of local control over education, democratic \n     participation, and one person-one vote. These I would see as \n     your basic constitutional responsibilities.\n\n\n                               FOOTNOTES\n\n     \\1\\ Capital Traction C. V.

There is no excuse for our inability to fulfill our \nresponsibility to make sure that these schools are brought up to code \ncompliance and modern standards.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, just a few moments ago, the manager of \nthis bill had a vehicle for a wide-ranging debate over Federal \neducation policy and received unanimous consent to withdraw from \nconsideration the Gregg amendment.\n  Because the Gregg amendment was identical to an amendment that I \noffered last year in debate over the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act, and because the Gregg amendment perhaps created more \ninterest on the part of school authorities, school board members, \nsuperintendents, principals, and teachers, than any other amendment \nbeing debated this week, it seemed important to me to explain to \neducators all across the country why the debate on the Gregg amendment \nor the Gregg-Gorton amendment will not be pursued during the course of \nthe debate on this Coverdell A+ bill.\n  Violence in our schools--assaults, the carrying into schools of guns \nand other dangerous weapons, disruptive behavior that threatens the \nsafety and security of the educational environment, disruptive behavior \nthat detracts from the educational experience of all students--is an \nincreasingly serious problem.\n  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the purposes of \nwhich are not only praiseworthy but in some respects essential in \nguaranteeing to all students, including even the most severely \ndisabled, the opportunity for a public education that will allow them \nto live to the maximum of their capacities, nevertheless includes \nwithin it a set of provisions relating to safety, to discipline, and to \nthe orderly nature of our classrooms that amounts to a clear and \nexplicit double standard and, in an increasing number of cases, \nseverely detracts from the educational atmosphere for all of the \nstudents of such a school.\n  In Seattle, late last month, a student designated ``disabled'' \nattacked other students with a knife on a schoolbus. In Louisiana, a \nteacher was attacked and hospitalized. In several States, as\n\n[[Page S3352]]\n\nwe know, assaults with guns have actually resulted in the deaths of \nstudents and of teachers. In Danbury, CT, parents picketed a school and \nwithdrew their children from the school because two students were \nsuspended for a mere 10 days for bringing a gun into the school \natmosphere.\n  The Seattle Post Intelligencer, Seattle's morning newspaper--not a \nnewspaper from which I often quote--wrote an editorial shortly after \nthe incident that took place on that Seattle school bus that reads, in \npart, as follows:\n\n       Tuesday's stabbing incident involving a student aboard a \n     Seattle school district bus has called attention to unwise \n     provisions of Federal law that apparently require more \n     tolerance of dangerous behavior by special education \n     students.\n       If the school district really is required by law to allow \n     students back into class who carry weapons or otherwise have \n     demonstrated intent to harm others, that law is in error and \n     must be changed.\n       . . . In this school year, there have been four or five \n     instances in which special education students have been \n     accepted back into school even though they had carried \n     weapons, according to Brenda Little, an assistant legal \n     counsel for the district.\n       Before a special education student can be disciplined, said \n     Little, principals are required by Federal law to prove that \n     the child understood the consequences of his or her behavior \n     and that it was not related to the student's disability.\n       That's a prescription for disaster.\n       If a child carries a weapon to school, it is irrelevant \n     whether that child understands the possible consequences of \n     doing so.\n       . . . In fact, if the child doesn't understand the \n     consequences, that's all the more reason to remove that child \n     from situations where other children may be harmed.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire editorial be \nprinted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Cut No Slack for Weapons Bearers\n\n       Tuesday's stabbing incident involving a student aboard a \n     Seattle School District bus has called attention to unwise \n     provisions of federal law that apparently require more \n     tolerance of dangerous behavior by special education \n     students.\n       If the school district really is required by law to allow \n     students back into class who carry weapons or otherwise have \n     demonstrated intent to harm others, that law is in error and \n     must be changed.\n       The bottom line is this: There is no case to be made for \n     extending special civil rights protections to anyone if doing \n     so results in threats to the safety of others.\n       This is especially so in public schools. \n     ``Mainstreaming''--educating special education students with \n     others--is good. But there are cases where it may have its \n     limits, and safety is one of them.\n       School administrators cannot tolerate threats to children \n     regardless of who poses that threat. There can be no double \n     standard in this matter. It's not rational public policy to \n     tie the hands of those who have legal responsibility for \n     ensuring the safety of students.\n       A 13-year old Denny Middle School special education student \n     has been expelled for the stabbing, but he could be back in \n     class within 10 days despite the district's zero-tolerance \n     for weapons. That's because the district has to jump through \n     higher hoops to expel special education students.\n       ``We have to take kids back that would ordinarily not be \n     allowed to return,'' said Denny Middle School principal Pat \n     Batiste-Brown, alluding to the newly tightened federal \n     regulations for special education students who break rules. \n     Twenty percent of the students in her school are classified \n     as special education students.\n       In this school year, there have been four or five instances \n     in which special education students have been accepted back \n     into school even though they had carried weapons, according \n     to Brenda Little, an assistant legal counsel for the \n     district.\n       Before a special education student can be disciplined, said \n     Little, principals are required by federal law to prove that \n     the child understood the consequences of his or her behavior \n     and that it was not related to the student's disability.\n       That's a prescription for disaster.\n       If a child carries a weapon to school, it is irrelevant \n     whether that child understands the possible consequences of \n     doing so.\n       In fact, if the child doesn't understand the consequences, \n     that's all the more reason to remove that child from \n     situations where other children may be harmed.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the editorial is correct; it is correct in \nits understanding and it is correct in its policy judgments.\n  In Louisiana, the Shreveport Times reports in an article about the \nGregg-Gorton amendment that Louisiana Department of Education revealed \nthat there were 22,790 out-of-school suspensions in special education \nin the 1996-97 school year. . . . The Bossier Parish school board led \nthe fight for more local control by signing a resolution last week that \nsupports Gorton and Gregg. . . . Bossier School superintendent Jane \nSmith vowed that if a special education student posed a considerable \nsafety threat, such as bringing a gun to class, the parish would treat \nhim or her like a regular education student regardless of the Federal \nlaws.\n  In other words, Mr. President, we have a law, we have a statute, we \nhave a set of regulations that actually causes a school superintendent \nto say that this is so bad, this is so dangerous to the students I am \nattempting to educate that I will simply defy the law. The Seattle \nschool district hasn't taken that position.\n  In Danbury, Connecticut, parents had to picket and take their kids \nout of school because of the requirements of the statute that literally \nsets up a double standard. School districts have plenary authority over \nsafety and discipline and an appropriate educational atmosphere for all \nof their regular students. They now have almost none--very limited \nrights to oppose discipline on students denominated ``disabled.'' And \ndon't think that this country isn't full of imaginative lawyers who can \ncome up with a plausible case to denominate a student ``disabled.'' In \nfact, often they use the very violent or safety-threatening activity of \nthe student to demonstrate that a particular student is disabled.\n  The Gorton-Gregg amendment was very simple and very short. I believe \nthat our colleagues ought to be reminded of exactly what it said. I am \ngoing to read it now:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of the Individuals With \n     Disabilities Education Act, each State educational agency or \n     local educational agency may establish and implement uniform \n     policies with respect to discipline and order applicable to \n     all children within its jurisdiction to ensure safety and an \n     appropriate educational atmosphere in its schools.\n\n  That's all. That is the entire proposal.\n  Well, when I made this proposal last year on my own, 47 Members of \nthis body--just 3 short of the number needed to pass it--voted in favor \nof it. Several members who have voted against it have come to me since \nthen to say that the combination of the reauthorization of IDEA, and \nthe even more prescriptive regulations now proposed by the U.S. \nDepartment of Education, and the reactions of their own school boards, \nhave caused them to rethink the issue. As a consequence, I believe that \nthere is a very real chance that the Gorton-Gregg amendment would have \nbeen accepted by this body had we presented it.\n  But I must say, in a very interesting side line, that it truly cross-\npressured our school board members, our superintendents, our \nprincipals, our teachers, and our PTA members because, of course, by \nand large, they don't much like the Coverdell bill. They recognize that \nthe Coverdell bill is very likely to pass, that it will be presented to \nthe President and the President will veto it. So a combination of the \nproposition that the President would veto this amendment in connection \nwith the veto of the Coverdell bill and their own opposition to Senator \nCoverdell has caused them to be less than enthusiastic about pursuing \nit at this time.\n\n  That is a valid concern, Mr. President. Both Senator Gregg and I \nwould like to accomplish our goal, would like to see to it that schools \nhave restored to them the authority to keep order and to provide for \nthe safety and security of their students. We feel this way in spite of \nthe fact that we are strong supporters of the Coverdell bill.\n  A second element is involved. The amendment can be read to cover two \nclosely related, nonetheless distinct, subjects. One of those is the \npure physical safety and security of students in schools; that is to \nsay, allowing schools to take disciplinary measures even against those \nwho are disabled. That will assure the safety and security of all of \nthe rest of the students. That is what the editorial in the Seattle \nPost Intelligencer is about.\n  But the other element in this amendment has to do with an appropriate \neducational atmosphere in the schools. That is even more worrisome to \nthe community advocating the rights of the disabled. They see that as \nauthorizing school boards, or teachers, or principals to expel students \nwho present no safety hazard to their fellow students, but can be seen \nby the tremendous\n\n[[Page S3353]]\n\namount of attention they require on the part of teachers severely to \ndistract from the educational atmosphere of a particular classroom. \nPersonally, I believe that that is an appropriate consideration for our \nteachers and our principals and our school board members. I believe \nthey have a right to weigh the quality of education of all of their \nstudents in making these judgments. I do recognize, however, that that \naspect of this amendment is more controversial--not only more \ncontroversial, but more arguable than the balance is. And as a result \nof a series of meetings during the last two-week recess at schools all \nacross the State of Washington, in which both the amendment I will \nintroduce tomorrow on block grants and IDEA, aforementioned, more of \nour time was spent on this Disability Act and safety and security in \nthe schools than on any other subject.\n  At the last of those meetings when both the disability community was \nrepresented and school authorities were represented, I detected for the \nfirst time some willingness to meet on a middle ground. Whether that \nmiddle ground has to do with safety and security only, how far the \ndisability community is willing to go in that connection, whether or \nnot there ought to be some consideration of the educational atmosphere \nof all students, none of these questions were settled by any stretch of \nthe imagination in the course of the meetings that I had, even with the \neducation community in the State of Washington. But I do feel that it \nis at least possible that on this very controversial issue a bit more \ntime may permit us to find some common ground. From my perspective at \nleast, that is the second reason that it was appropriate that I \nconsented to the withdrawal of the Gregg amendment at this point in the \ndebate.\n  I want to make it crystal clear, however, to educators all over the \ncountry who have supported us in this cause, that this withdrawal does \nnot mean that the debate is over by any stretch of the imagination. The \npresent Gregg-Gorton amendment, or something very similar to it, will \nbe presented at an early opportunity on some other bill that relates \ndirectly or indirectly to education. It will not go away. But I hope \nthe next time that it is presented, it is presented on a bill that is \nalmost certain to be signed by the President of the United States \nrather than vetoed by the President of the United States.\n  In addition, I hope that by that point we may have at least a partial \nmeeting of the minds--one might hope a full meeting of the minds--\nbetween those genuinely concerned with the educational rights and civil \nrights of the disabled community and those genuinely concerned with the \nsafety and security of all of our students, and on the proposition that \nall of our students receive their education in an atmosphere best \nconducive to that education for all students in the public schools of \nthe United States.\n  It is with those twin hopes--that we will have a better vehicle for \nthis debate and that perhaps we can have the debate at a somewhat more \nextended fashion than the very limited time on the Coverdell bill and \nthat we might bring the two sides together to a greater extent than \nthey have ever been in the past--that I have agreed to the withdrawal \nof that amendment.\n  It is withdrawn from this bill. It will come up again. I believe that \nwe need to do more to empower those men and women all across the United \nStates who provide the educational services to our children day after \nday, week after week, year after year because of their own professional \ndedication. I believe their views need to be considered, and I think \nthat we will be able to consider them better a little later on this \nyear. I pledge, however, that consider them we will.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \nthank John Danforth, the former Senator from Missouri, for initiating \nthe ultimately successful effort to create greater opportunity in \npublic schools to have same-gender classes schools.\n  I was a freshman in 1994. I remember the compelling argument made by \nSenator Danforth about what an opportunity this would be for a girl \nlike Cyndee Couch, the seventh grader at the Young Women's Leadership \nschool in East Harlem, NY, to have a safe haven where she could learn \nwithout worrying about her safety, or her ability to speak out without \nbeing made fun of, or in any way not able to be secure in feeling that \nshe could ask questions and participate in the classroom.\n  He also thought about the young girls in the classroom in Maine that \nwere spoken about by Senator Collins today where the school had to go \nthrough hoop after hoop after hoop to be able to have an all-girl math \nclass. When they were able to finally do it and break down all the \nbureaucratic barriers, the test scores have shown that this has been an \noutstanding success for the girls in that class, without any detriment \nwhatsoever to the other students in that school.\n  What we want and what the Senate has done today is to help pave the \nway to ensure that every child in America to has this same option. This \namendment is not a mandate. We are not saying that same-gender classes \nare best for everyone. But it has been proven that they are good for \nsome, especially for girls and minority boys, who have demonstrated \nhigher test scores and higher grades when they are allowed to \nconcentrate on their studies, free from the distractions of a coed \nenvironment.\n  I am very proud that the Senate has spoken so clearly today in favor \nof this option for our public school students, an option that I might \nsay is available at private schools, for parents who can afford it. \nShould this amendment ultimately become law, this same option will \nbecome available for many thousands of parents and their children who \nmay not be able to afford private school tuition. In short, the \namendment expands the proven benefits of private, same-gender education \nto the public school system.\n  I am very pleased the Senate has spoken so decisively today on this \nissue, and I am confident Congress will include it in the final version \nof this important bill. And this success would not have been possible \nbut for the hard work, vision, and leadership of Jack Danforth, who \ntook-up this cause and in whose footsteps I proudly follow. When he \nleft the Senate and said he would not seek reelection, I told him I \nwould take up the mantle on this issue, and that I would continue his \nfight to ensure that our nation's schools pursue excellence wherever \nthey may find it. The parents and students of this nation now await the \ncompletion of this job, and I urge my colleagues to continue to work \nfor expanded educational opportunities and choices for all Americans.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/21/senate-section/article/S3333-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

A resolution adopted by the Idaho State Grange \n     relative to the Environmental Protection Agency; to the \n     Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n       POM-377. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan; to the Committee on \n     Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\nSenate Resolution No. 151\n       Whereas, The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 (FQPA) was \n     signed into law on August 3, 1996, by President Clinton; and\n       Whereas, Among the purposes of the FQPA is to assure that \n     pesticide tolerance decisions and policies are based upon \n     sound science and reliable data; and\n       Whereas, Another purpose of the FQPA is to assure that \n     pesticide tolerance decisions and policies are formulated in \n     an open and transparent manner; and\n       Whereas, The EPA is required by the FQPA to have reviewed \n     approximately 3,000 of the approximately 9,700 existing \n     tolerances by August 1999 to determine whether these \n     tolerances meet the safety standards established by the FQPA; \n     and\n       Whereas, The implementation of the FQPA could have a \n     profound negative impact on domestic agricultural production \n     and on consumer food prices and availability. With Michigan's \n     diverse agriculture, this impact could be especially severe \n     on our numerous specialty crops; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to take the following actions:\n       1. Direct the EPA to initiate immediately appropriate \n     administrative rulemaking to ensure that the policies and \n     standards the agency intends to apply in evaluating pesticide \n     tolerances are subject to thorough public notice and comment \n     prior to final tolerance determinations being made by the \n     agency.\n       2. Direct the EPA to use its authority under the FQPA to \n     provide interested persons the opportunity to produce data \n     needed to evaluate a pesticide tolerance so that the agency \n     can avoid the use of unrealistic default assumptions in \n     making pesticide tolerance decisions.\n       3. Direct the EPA to implement the FQPA in a manner that \n     will not disrupt agricultural production nor have a negative \n     impact on the availability, diversity, and affordability of \n     food.\n       4. Conduct oversight hearings immediately to ensure that \n     actions taken by the EPA are consistent with the FQPA \n     provisions and congressional intent. If the intent of the \n     legislation is not carried out, then Congress should postpone \n     the August 1999 deadline. Following oversight hearings, \n     Congress should, if necessary, take appropriate actions or \n     amend the FQPA to correct problem areas.\n       5. Encourage the Secretary of Agriculture and the United \n     States Department of Agriculture to increase its commitment \n     of manpower and budgetary resources to work with the EPA to \n     gather scientific data. Furthermore, Congress should \n     encourage the United States Department of Agriculture to \n     conduct an economic impact statement on the implementation of \n     the FQPA.\n       6. Clarify the role of Section 18 of the Federal \n     Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act as its provisions \n     relate to the reestablishment of tolerances under the FQPA, \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, and the United States \n     Environmental Protection Agency.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-378.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Kansas; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 5029\n\n       Whereas, In the span of a few years, 1971 through 1973, the \n     Federal Courts made it clear that an appropriate education is \n     a fundamental right of children with disabilities that is \n     secured by the due process and equal protection clauses of \n     the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; and\n       Whereas, In 1975, Congress passed Public Law 94-142, the \n     Education for All Handicapped Children Act, known since 1990 \n     as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of IDEA; \n     and\n       Whereas, The IDEA requires that all children with \n     disabilities receive a free, appropriate public education and \n     provides a funding mechanism to assist states and local \n     educational services agencies with the costs of maintaining \n     programs; and\n       Whereas, For several years, the costs of providing special \n     education services required under federal and state law have \n     been escalating rapidly and have been a major concern of \n     policymakers who have reviewed the matter studiously. To \n     date, solutions have proven elusive; and\n       Whereas, All of the states have some mechanism in their \n     school finance laws that acknowledge the additional costs of \n     providing special education services for children with \n     disabilities, estimated on average to be about 2.3 times \n     greater than for general education pupils; and\n       Whereas, The U.S. Supreme Court has opined that the IDEA is \n     a comprehensive scheme set up by Congress to aid the states \n     in complying with the constitutional obligation to provide \n     public education for children with disabilities; and\n       Whereas, The IDEA authorizes funding in accordance with a \n     formula, a key variable of which is the average per pupil \n     expenditure for general education pupils. The Act authorized \n     Congress to appropriate a sum equal to 5 percent of this \n     average per pupil expenditure in 1977, 10 percent in 1978, 20 \n     percent in 1979, and 40 percent by 1980. Though the Act \n     authorized funding according to this formula, appropriations \n     have never approached the authorization level and remains at \n     10 percent or less today: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of \n     Kansas, the Senate concurring therein, That the Legislature, \n     in recognition that children with disabilities are endowed by \n     the Constitution with the right to be provided with a free \n     and appropriate public education and that the Congress of the \n     United States has enacted the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act in order to insure that right, hereby urges the \n     Congress to acknowledge the fact that special education\n\n[[Page S3355]]\n\n     services are extremely costly and should be supported by a \n     combination of local, state, and federal funds; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature hereby requests the Congress \n     to assume its fair share of the costs of special education \n     services by increasing funding to a level more nearly \n     approaching the level authorized by the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State is hereby directed to \n     send enrolled copies of this resolution to the President and \n     President pro tempore of the Senate of the United States, to \n     the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United \n     States, and to each member of the Kansas Congressional \n     Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-380. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the General \n     Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky; to the Committee on \n     Appropriations.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, The conditions of the roads and bridges in the \n     states is deteriorating; and\n       Whereas, The demand placed upon the nation's transportation \n     system has increased and will continue to increase into the \n     21st Century; and\n       Whereas, Safe, reliable, and cost effective movement of \n     people, goods, and information is critical to economic \n     development and competitiveness in the market; and\n       Whereas, The United States Department of Transportation has \n     estimated that over five years, $357 billion is needed to \n     improve the highway system, while $39.5 billion is needed \n     just to maintain current road conditions; and\n       Whereas, States need every possible unencumbered dollar to \n     improve their roads and bridges; and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress is urged to focus on \n     incentives rather than disincentives in any transportation \n     bill; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the General Assembly of the \n     Commonwealth of Kentucky:\n       Section 1. The Senate hereby urges the Congress of the \n     United States to provide funding without mandates to the \n     Transportation Cabinet.\n       Section 2. The Senate Clerk of the Senate is directed to \n     submit a copy of this Resolution to each member of the United \n     States House of Representatives and the United States Senate.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-381. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; to the \n     Committee on Appropriations.\n       Whereas, Transportation access and safety are essential to \n     economic hopes in communities across Pennsylvania; and\n       Whereas, While Pennsylvania has taken steps to increase the \n     amount of State transportation funding to match Federal \n     dollars and to deal with State areas of responsibility, the \n     list of priority projects still exceeds available funds and \n     the State's 12-year transportation plan contains many \n     projects for which funding is unidentified; and\n       Whereas, Huge increases in vehicle miles traveled and in \n     shipping products and goods on interstate highways add \n     significantly to maintenance needs; and\n       Whereas, The Federal Highway Administration periodically \n     documents the substantial number of structurally deficient \n     and functionally obsolete bridges in Pennsylvania; and\n       Whereas, Federal funding remains the most critical share of \n     the funding for major construction and reconstruction \n     projects, and the six-year reauthorization bill will \n     determine the size and effectiveness of the transportation \n     program Pennsylvania can undertake; and\n       Whereas, Congressman Bud Shuster, as Chairman of the \n     Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and other \n     congressional transportation advocates have proposed greatly \n     increasing Federal funding as part of the transportation \n     reauthorization, in the understanding that infrastructure \n     investment is vital to the economic health of the nation and \n     the states; and\n       Whereas, A long-term determination of Federal funding \n     levels is necessary to allow for coordinated transportation \n     planning at the State and local levels; and\n       Whereas, Money raised through Federal transportation taxes \n     should be used to pay for transportation projects and \n     enhanced motor vehicle and truck safety measures; not to \n     cover deficits in other areas of Federal endeavor; therefore \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania urge the Congress of the United States to take \n     action on the comprehensive multiyear transportation funding \n     legislation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That congressional action on the transportation \n     reauthorization include provisions for releasing trust fund \n     moneys being withheld from transportation projects; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That Pennsylvania support an increase in the \n     Federal funding available to expand the array of projects \n     that can be undertaken, which in turn will move up the \n     completion of transportation priorities and secure the \n     considerable job creation and highway safety benefits that \n     will result; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of each house of Congress and to each \n     member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-382.

A bill to prohibit the expenditure of Federal funds to \nprovide or support programs to provide individuals with hypodermic \nneedles or syringes for the use of illegal drugs; to the Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources.\n\n\n          the needle exchange programs prohibition act of 1998\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am today introducing, along with \nSenators Ashcroft and Brownback, a bill to prohibit the use of federal \nfunds to carry out or support programs for the distribution of sterile \nhypodermic needles or syringes to illegal drug users.\n  This bill would effectively continue and make permanent the ban \nimposed through the appropriations process which expired at the end of \nMarch. We are pleased that the Administration has decided not to use \nfederal tax dollars to fund needle exchanges despite the expiration of \nthe ban. But coinciding with this announcement, Health and Human \nServices Secretary Donna Shalala strongly endorsed needles exchanges \nand encouraged local communities to use their own dollars to fund \nneedle exchange programs. This legislation is therefore needed to \nforeclose any temptation the Administration may feel to federally fund \nneedle exchanges in the future.\n  The Drug Czar, General Barry McCaffrey, has laid out the strong case \nagainst needle exchange programs. Handing out needles to drug users \nsends a message that the government is condoning drug use. It \nundermines our anti-drug message and undercuts all of our drug \nprevention efforts.\n  A report by General McCaffrey's office reviewed the world's largest \nneedle exchange program in Vancouver, British Colombia, in operation \nsince 1988. It found the program to be a failure. HIV infections were \nhigher among users of free needles than those without access to them. \nThe death rate from drugs jumped from 18 a year in 1988 to 150 in 1992. \nIn addition, higher drug use followed implementation of the program.\n  Dr. James L. Curtis of New York, who has studied needle exchange \nprograms was quoted in the Washington Times stating that the programs \n``should be recognized as reckless experimentation on human beings, the \nunproven hypothesis being that it prevents AIDS.''\n  According to recent scientific studies, eight persons a day are \ninfected with the HIV virus by using borrowed needles, while 352 people \nstart using heroin each day and 4,000 die every year from heroin-\nrelated causes other than HIV. Far more addicts die of drug overdoses \nand related violence than from AIDS. It is wrong to aid and abet those \ndeaths by handing out free needles to drug addicts. We should not be \nencouraging higher rates of heroin use.\n  Therefore, I hope my colleagues will join me in making permanent the \nprohibition on federal funding and support of needle giveaway programs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1959\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S3357]]\n\n     SECTION 1. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR HYPODERMIC \n                   NEEDLES.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no Federal \n     funds shall be made available or used to carry out or \n     support, directly or indirectly, any program of distributing \n     sterile hypodermic needles or syringes to individuals for the \n     hypodermic injection of any illegal drug.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nSenator Coverdell, a very important piece of legislation. It is a \ntragedy that this legislation is necessary. However, following \nyesterday's announcement by the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nthat this Administration supports giving clean needles to drug addicts, \nI believe that Congress must now act. Congress must act to ensure that \nfederal funds are never used to support these programs. This decision \nby the Administration, to support clean needle programs--but to \nwithhold federal funding--is an intolerable message that it's time to \naccept drug use as a way of life.\n  Not surprisingly, the American people do not want their hard earned \ntax dollars spent to give illegal drug users the tool to continue their \nhabit. We already take too much money from the American people. We \nshould not use it to subsidize a lifestyle of which the people so \nfundamentally disagree. When we pass this bill we will send a message \nthat giving free needles to drug addicts is not a policy that this \nnation should embrace.\n  Federal policy should call Americans to their highest and best and \nnot accommodate them at their lowest and least. That is exactly what \nneedle exchange programs do. They tell drug addicts, ``we know that you \nare too weak to beat your addiction; therefore, we are going to make \nthe lifestyle you have chosen easier.''\n  This approach is called ``harm reduction.'' The Harm Reduction \nCoalition states on their webpage that the organization ``accepts drug \nuse as a way of life.'' Therefore, they support policies which make \ndrugs as harmless as possible. There are many that are part of this \nharm reduction movement who believe that legalization of drugs is the \nappropriate policy. In fact, the logical conclusion to their belief \nthat drug use is a way of life and that it should be made as harmless \nas possible is legalization. The harm reduction philosophy is the basis \nof needle exchange programs. They say that if we provide people with \nclean needles, there will be less risk involved in using drugs. I am \nhere today to reject that view.\n  Since 1988, the United States Congress has banned the use of federal \nfunds for needle exchange programs. Recognizing that government \nsubsidies for drug addicts is bad policy, this ban consistently has \nbeen supported by both sides of the aisle. Unfortunately, the 1998 \nLabor and Health and Human Services Appropriations bill included \nlanguage to allow the Secretary of HHS to lift the ban after March 31, \n1998. Yesterday, the Administration stated--wisely--that the federal \nfunding ban should not be lifted. However, the Administration foolishly \nrecommended that local communities fund these programs.\n  This endorsement of needles on demand opens the door to a subsequent \ndecision to fund needle exchanges with the hard-earned money of \nAmerican taxpayers. Yesterday's endorsement of clean needle programs \nsends the intolerable message that the Administration accepts illegal \ndrug use as a way of life. It says clearly that this Administration \nwill give approval to taxpayer funding the moment it appears that the \ndecision can be sneaked past Congress. That is why this legislation has \nbecome necessary.\n\n  Mr. President, needle exchange programs are touted as a way of \nreducing HIV rates among intravenous drug users. First, there is no \nsound scientific evidence to support that assertion. Second, even if \nthere were, there are other public health and moral reasons to oppose \nneedle exchange programs.\n  Experts agree that the only scientifically sound method of making an \naffirmative showing that NEPs reduce the rate of HIV is to withhold \nclean needles from one group of drug users while providing clean \nneedles to another. Since there are obvious problems in conducting such \na study, it has not been done. In fact, there are studies which find \njust the opposite--that there are significant increases in HIV among \nclean needle program participants.\n  Participants in the Montreal needle exchange program were two times \nmore likely to become infected than those who did not participate in \nthe program. Vancouver has the largest needle exchange program in North \nAmerica which was started in 1988. In 1987, the estimated HIV \nprevalence among IV drug users was 1-2 percent, in 1997, it was 23 \npercent.\n  Even the so-called ``California'' study which is heavily relied upon \nby needle exchange proponents, merely found that it is ``likely'' that \nNEPs decrease the rate of new HIV infection in intravenous drug users.\n  The nation's drug czar, Gen. Barry McCaffrey agrees that studies have \nnot yet scientifically substantiated the claims embraced by Secretary \nShalala in her announcement. In an April 17, 1998, letter to my office \noutlining the concerns of General McCaffrey, the Office of National \nDrug Control policy states that ``science [on needle exchange programs] \nis uncertain.'' The letter states further that ``[s]upporters of needle \nexchange frequently gloss over gaping holes in the data--holes which \nleave significant doubt regarding whether needle exchanges exacerbate \ndrug use and whether they uniformly lead to decreases in HIV \ntransmission.''\n  A significant concern of those of us who oppose federal funding of \nneedle exchange programs--and I oppose all needle exchange programs, \nwhether federally funded or not--is that they will increase drug use. \nThat is the precise reason that the Secretary was required to show that \nNEPs do not increase drug use before lifting the ban. There is \nabsolutely no data to support the Secretary's finding that NEPs do not \nincrease drug use.\n  While the California study found ``no evidence'' of increased drug \nuse, the conclusion was based on interviews with drug users--illegal \ndrug users.\n  In Vancouver, deaths from drug overdoses have increased more than 5 \ntimes since 1988--the year the needle exchange program started. Since \ntheir needle exchange program began, hospital admissions for heroin \nhave increased 66 percent in San Francisco. In fact, the researcher who \nfounded the San Francisco program and the founder of the New York \nprogram have both died of heroin overdoses during the last two years.\n  I think the letter outlining General McCaffrey's concerns says it \nbest. ``The bottom line is that General McCaffrey believes that we need \na better understanding of how needle exchange programs will impact our \nnation's fight against drugs before we consider altering the current \npolicy.''\n  I believe that needle exchange programs send the wrong message to the \nyouth of America. To say on the one hand, that drug use is wrong, and \nthen on the other hand--to provide the tools necessary to safely use \nillegal drugs--undoubtedly will confuse the nation's youth. When their \nparents are paying taxes to the federal government that ultimately will \nbe used to inject heroin into an addict's arm--how do you tell them \nthat the government thinks drug use is wrong?\n  According to the drug czar's office, each day over 8,000 young people \nwill try an illegal drug for the first time. While perhaps eight \npersons contract HIV directly or indirectly from dirty needles, 352 \npeople start using heroin each day. More than 4,000 people die each \nyear from heroin/morphine related causes.\n  General McCaffrey, who has been entrusted by this administration to \nadvise the President on drug policy agrees. He says: ``The problem is \nnot dirty needles, the problem is heroin addiction. . . . The focus \nshould be on bringing help to this suffering population--not give them \nmore effective means to continue their addiction. One does not want to \nfacilitate this dreadful scourge on mankind.''\n  Secretary Shalala also said that NEPs are effective when supported by \nthe communities. I think she would be hard pressed to find a community \nthat embraces the needle exchange program in their neighborhood. I \nwonder if the Secretary would like a clean needle program in her \nneighborhood.\n  As the name suggests, needle exchange programs are supposed to get a \ndirty needle back from an addict for every needle they hand out. The \nidea is that these dirty needles will not be\n\n[[Page S3358]]\n\nused again or left on the streets. However, according to needle \nexchange workers, an ``exchange'' usually does not take place.\n  According to the Associated Press, in Willimantic, Connecticut, \n``more than 350 discarded hypodermic needles were collected from the \ncity's streets, lots, and alleys in a single week.'' These were found \nafter a two year old girl found and accidentally pricked herself with a \ndirty needle.\n  One needle exchange worker, who said they got approximately one-third \nto one-half of the needles back, handed out 950 needles in just one \nnight. That means that about 475 dirty needles are either being used \nagain--defeating the stated objective of these programs--or they are \nlying on our cities' streets, parks and playgrounds. In response to low \nnumber of needles they get back, the worker casually said that ``one-\nfor-one exchange does not fit the reality of how injection drug users \nlive.''\n\n  Needle exchanges also turn into one-stop shopping for drug addicts. \nEven the needle exchange proponents recognize this and talk about it as \nthough it were a virtue of the program. From Harm Reduction \nCommunication--``A user might be able to do the networking needed to \nfind good drugs in the half hour he spends at a street-based needle \nexchange site--networking that might otherwise have taken half a day.''\n  There are many tragic examples all over the nation. However, one \narticle from the Pittsburgh Post Gazette best explains what this does \nto America's neighborhoods. ``Our community has worked hard to battle \nthe drug problem that plagues our neighborhoods at many levels. But the \nneedle exchange program gives dealer and users one more reason to stay \nhere. In addition, drug users from outside our community now find \nreasons to frequent our neighborhood. Drug addiction is not a \nvictimless crime. Not only does it kill the addict, but also, in the \nprocess, the addict preys on those around him. Prostitution, burglary, \nand now violence are an increasing problem in our community. So while \nthe needle exchange people try to help addicts, they do so at the \nexpense of our neighborhoods.''\n  This legislation is simple. It says that federal funds cannot be used \nto support directly, or indirectly, needle exchange programs.\n  The Nation's drug policy should be one of zero tolerance. It should \nnot be a policy of accommodation. Drugs are turning our once vibrant \ncities into the centers of despair and hopelessness. We need an \nAdministration who has no tolerance for the drug culture. An \nAdministration who says that America can be called to a higher standard \nrather then accommodated in a culture of consuming drugs.\n  This Administration has shown that it is willing to ignore the \nrecord, ignore sound drug policy, and ignore the will of the American \npeople. This is just another example of Washington, D.C. attacking, \nthrough policy, American values. Giving bulletproof vests to bank \nrobbers would make bank robbery safer and simpler, and send the message \nthat we accept bank robbery. A free needle policy is no different. What \nadvocates of free needles on demand would clothe in rhetoric of `harm \nreduction' and `public health' is, instead a decision to subsidize, \ntolerate, and facilitate the use of illegal drugs.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues \nSenator Coverdell and Senator Ashcroft in introducing legislation that \nwould prohibit the use of federal funds for any program that gives out \nhypodermic needles or syringes for use with illegal drugs.\n  Mr. President, last Friday, the Clinton Administration announced \ntheir intention to use federal funds to distribute free drug needles. \nAlthough they abruptly reversed course this week, they have maintained \ntheir intention of encouraging state and local governments and other \ninstitutions to distribute drug needles.\n  This is bad policy, bad science, and bad news for our country. A \ncomprehensive study of the needle exchange program in Vancouver, \nBritish Columbia--the city with the world's largest needle give-away \nprogram--found that drug use, crime, and HIV transmission all increased \nwhere drug needles were handed out.\n  This should come as no surprise. One of the primary principles of \neconomics is that you get more of what you subsidize and less of what \nyou tax. You do not discourage drug use by giving out free needles. You \ncannot reduce disease by encouraging addiction.\n  More than ever before, we need strong leadership in the war on drugs, \nand a clear message that drugs are wrong, and harmful. Consider the \nfacts: Over the past three years, casual drug us among teens has almost \ndoubled. A survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse found that \nthe proportion of eighth graders who had tried heroin had doubled \nbetween 1991 and 1996. Every year, there are thousands of young people \nwho fall prey to drugs. We need to send the clear message that using \ndrugs is illegal and wrong. Drug use must be stopped, not subsidized.\n  That is why I am proud to stand with Senators Coverdell and Ashcroft \nin introducing legislation that to prohibit spending taxpayer dollars \non drug needle give-aways, and urge my colleagues to expedite passage \nof this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 1961. A bill for the relief of Suchada Kwong; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n                       private relief legislation\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am offering today, legislation that \nwould provide permanent residency to Suchada Kwong, a recently widowed \nyoung mother of a U.S. citizen child who faces the devastation of being \nseparated from her child and family here in the United States.\n  Suchada Kwong's U.S. citizen husband, Jimmy Kwong, was tragically \nkilled in an automobile accident in June of 1996, leaving a 3-month-old \nU.S.-born son and his 29-year-old bride.\n  Because current law does not allow Suchada to adjust her status to \npermanent residency without her husband, Suchada now faces deportation.\n  Suchada and Jimmy Kwong met in Bangkok, Thailand, through a mutual \nfriend in 1993. He communicated with her frequently by phone and \nvisited her every time he was in Bangkok. They fell in love and were \nmarried in September 1995, and Suchada gave birth to Ryan Stephen Kwong \nin May 1996.\n  Suchada was supposed to have her INS interview on August 15, 1996. \nHowever, Jimmy was killed in an accident in June, less than 3 weeks \nafter his son was born and 2 months short of the INS interview. Now, \nbecause the petitioner is deceased, Suchada is ineligible to adjust her \nstatus. While the immigration law provides for widows of U.S. citizens \nto self-petition, that provision is only available for people who have \nbeen married for over 2 years.\n  Suchada's deportation will not only cause hardship to her and her \nyoung child but to Suchada's mother-in-law, Mrs. Kwong, who faces \nlosing her grandson, only a short time after she lost her only son.\n  Mrs. Kwong is elderly, and though she is financially capable, could \nnot care for her grandson herself. Mrs. Kwong is proud to be self-\nsupporting, having owned and worked in a small business until her \nretirement. The family has never used public assistance, and through \nJimmy's job, the family has sufficient resources to support Suchada and \nRyan. It would also be difficult for Suchada as a single mother in \nThailand. Here in the United States, she has the support of Mrs. Kwong \nand their church.\n  Suchada was granted voluntary departure for one year on October 1996 \nto explore other options or prepare to leave the United States. During \nthat time period, Suchada and her family have explored all options but \nfailed. Now, the voluntary departure period has expired and Suchada \nmust leave the country, leaving behind her young child and her family \nhere in the United States.\n  Suchada has done everything she could to become a permanent resident \nof this country--except for the tragedy of her husband's death 2 months \nbefore she could become a permanent resident. I hope you support this \nbill so that we can help Suchada begin rebuilding her life in the \nUnited States.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1961\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S3359]]\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENCE.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for purposes of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), \n     Suchada Kwong shall be held and considered to have been \n     lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent \n     residence as of the date of the enactment of this Act upon \n     payment of the required visa fees.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FAIRCLOTH:\n  S. 1962. A bill to provide for an Education Modernization Fund, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              the education modernization fund act of 1998\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould provide nearly $5 billion in federal loans for school \nmodernization and construction.\n\n  Mr. President, this legislation would transfer $5 billion from the \nExchange Stabilization Fund at the Treasury Department to the \nDepartment of Education and create an Education Modernization Fund.\n  The legislation would create a new account called the ``Education \nModernization Fund'' that would be used to offer low interest, long \nterm, loans to states for the purpose of building and modernizing \nelementary and secondary schools. The loans would be used for school \ndistricts with fast growing elementary and secondary student \npopulations.\n  The GAO has estimated that one-third of all schools, housing 14 \nmillion students are in need of repair. In my home state of North \nCarolina--36% of schools report that they have at least one inadequate \nbuilding. Fully 90% of schools report that they have some construction \nneeds. The state estimates that $3.5 to $10 million is needed for \nschool repair needs. North Carolina has one of the fastest growing \nstudent populations.\n  The purpose of my legislation Mr. President is very simple. We have a \nslush fund at the Treasury Department called the ``Exchange \nStabilization Fund.'' This fund is under the personal control of the \nSecretary of the Treasury. He can do whatever he wants with it. Over \nthe past four years--he has used it to supplement international \nbailouts, which I think is very wrong.\n  He loaned $12 billion to Mexico. I have to ask, why not $12 billion \nfor schools if New Mexico?\n  He has promised Indonesia $3 billion. Why not funds for schools in \nIndiana?\n  He has promised South Korea $5 billion. Why not $5 billion for South \nCarolina?\n  We have our priorities backwards with this Administration.\n  The ESF has all been used without any Congressional approval or \nauthorization. Further, the fund has more than $30 billion available to \nit.\n  I think it is time that we transfer a small part of this money and \nput it to good use by using it for school construction.\n  Additionally, Mr. President, in my opinion this plan is far better \nthat the Democrat alternative that is being offered today, the one \noffered by Senator Moseley-Braun.\n  The Moseley-Braun formula is skewed so that much of the money will go \nto the larger cities and low income communities--whether or not there \nis a need for new schools. My plan is formulated for student population \ngrowth. For example, under the Coverdell, Republican bill--Rockingham \nCounty, North Carolina would be the first school district eligible for \nschool construction bonds because of student growth.\n  But under the Democrats' plan, my state would receive less than its \nfair share. For example, North Carolina ranks 11th in national \npopulation, and Massachusetts, ranks 13th, but under the Moseley-Braun \nbill, Massachusetts would receive $20 million more in funds. Louisiana \nwhich ranks 22nd in population would receive nearly $90 million more \nthan North Carolina. Of course, its no surprise that New York, \nCalifornia and Illinois, under their plan, receive nearly 25% of all \nthe money.\n  The Democrats alternative would also put the Department of Education \nin charge of school districts. The DOE would have to approve any school \nconstruction plans. Schools that receive the federal benefit would have \nto meet certain curriculum standards and have federal mandates about \ngraduation and employment rates.\n  Finally, in order to finance the government's school construction, it \nwipes out the increased IRA savings for education. There is no more \nstarker contrast between two visions of education: parents being \nallowed to keep their money for their children's education --or the \nfederal government taking it to enhance the power of the Department of \nEducation.\n  In my view the solution is simple, we don't need to rob parents of \ntheir savings for education to pay for school construction--we need to \ntake the foreign aid slush fund from the Treasury Department and put it \nto worthy domestic uses, like school construction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THURMOND (for himself and Mr. Coverdell):\n  S. 1963, A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to permit \ncertain beneficiaries of the military health care system to enroll in \nFederal employees health benefits plans; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n                 THE MILITARY HEALTH CARE FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Military \nHealth Care Fairness Act. A companion measure, H.R. 3613, was recently \nintroduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman J.C. Watts \nand 38 cosponsors. I am pleased to have Senator Coverdell as an \noriginal cosponsor of this measure.\n\n  Mr. President, this bill allows those military retirees over the age \nof sixty-five to sign up for the Federal Employees Health Benefits \nprogram (FEHBP) so that they may have another option for health care \ncoverage. It is estimated that approximately 1.3 million retirees, \ndependents, and survivors meet this criteria. However, it is doubtful \nthat all of them will sign up for the FEHBP.\n  The recent base closures and realignments have limited the number of \nplaces where some retirees can receive health care. By joining the \nFEHBP, health care choices will increase. The FEHBP will probably be \ndesirable to those retirees that do not have prescription drug plans or \nwant to limit catastrophic out-of-pocket cost. Further, the retiree is \nnot excluded from using the traditional military medical treatment \nfacilities on a space available basis. When a retiree, under the FEHBP, \nuses a military facility, the health care plan reimburses the military \nfor the cost of treatment.\n  Mr. President, during the first year of this program the costs will \nbe capped at $100 million. This amount increases $100 million per year \nfor five years to cap the costs at $500 million per year. The costs to \nthe individual should be the same as to any other federal employee in a \ngiven geographical area. In order to determine the actual premiums, the \nhealth plans will be required to establish a separate risk pool to \ndetermine whether the military group's risk characteristics such as \nage, gender, and care-use affect the other federal employees' premiums. \nWhile I realize that some might say the costs of this measure are high, \nsomething must be done to give health care coverage to those retirees \nthat do not have adequate coverage under the current military health \ncare system. The many men and women who have given so much to protect \nour Country by serving in the military are to be commended for their \nsacrifices and we should acknowledge this by giving them adequate \nhealth care choices.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1963\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am proud to join my esteemed \ncolleague, Senator Thurmond, in introducing legislation that will \naddress a growing crisis our nation's military retirees now face. These \nsoldiers who all served so valiantly for our country now find it \nincreasingly difficult to access the lifetime health care promised to \nthem in exchange for 20 years of service. As a veteran myself, I \nbelieve that the government must honor the promises which the country \nmade to those men and women who have served so faithfully in defense of \nthe United States. America's veterans fulfilled\n\n[[Page S3361]]\n\ntheir part of the bargain--now the government has a responsibility to \ndo likewise. The legislation we introduce today is a Senate companion \nto House legislation introduced by Representative J.C. Watts. \nCongressman Watts has put a great deal of effort and leadership into \nthis issue and I applaud his efforts.\n  Military retirees are the only Federal Government personnel who have \nbeen prevented from using their employer-provided health care once they \nreach Medicare-eligible age. In the past, Medicare-eligible retirees \nhave received health care in military treatment facilities on a ``space \navailable'' basis. However, cutbacks in health care funding, force \nreductions and base closures are forcing many Medicare-eligible \nretirees out of the military medical system. The legislation we have \nintroduced today would correct this inequity by giving all military \nretirees health care coverage equal to our FEHBP health plan or the \noption to enroll in FEHBP. As you know, Mr. President, FEHBP is the \nsame plan in which you, I, and all our colleagues and staff in the \nCongress, have the option of enrolling. FEHBP is a successfully \nadministered health benefits plan. The least we can do is offer to our \nnation's military retirees the same choices in health care as are \navailable to us. I dare say they deserve it.\n  This legislation would do more than allow access to FEHBP to \nretirees. It would also allow retirees experiencing difficulties with \nthe TRICARE/CHAMPUS health plans. Due to TRICARE/CHAMPUS reimbursement \nrates, which are 15 percent below Medicare reimbursement rates, many \ndoctors do not participate in TRICARE/CHAMPUS. When a military hospital \nhas no space available for a military retiree, the retiree is referred \nto a private facility. If a private facility does not accept TRICARE/\nCHAMPUS, the retiree is left waiting for available space in a military \nhospital. This is unjust. Under this legislation, military retirees who \ncannot receive under TRICARE/CHAMPUS the same level of care provided \nunder FEHBP have the option of enrolling in FEHBP. Again, Mr. \nPresident, these are the same options available to us as federal \nemployees.\n  Mr. President, the Congress understands the need to fix the military \nhealth care system. Just last year in the 1998 Defense Authorization \nAct, this body recognized through an amendment I proudly cosponsored, \nthe moral obligation we have incurred to provide health care to members \nand former members of the Armed Forces who are entitled to retired or \nretainer pay. This is a huge undertaking and important considerations \nsuch as the cost of such an endeavor must be made. While this \nlegislation places caps on annual spending, providing those with \nfunding concerns concrete numbers which to work, I firmly believe we \ncan ill-afford not to honor the promises our nation made to these men \nand women.\n  Mr. President, this nation has long stood by the men and women who \nhave fought for, and secured, our country's freedom. Without these \nsoldiers America would not stand today as the world's example of \ndemocracy and cornerstone of freedom. We owe it to our nation, to our \nnation's military retirees and to ourselves to make the small sacrifice \nthat passage of this bill would require.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Bryan):\n  S. 1964. A bill to provide for the sale of certain public land in the \nIvanpah Valley, Nevada, to the Clark County Department of Aviation; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n          the ivanpah valley airport public lands transfer act\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to introduce The Ivanpah Valley \nAirport Public Lands Transfer Act for myself and Senator Bryan, which \nprovides for the sale of public lands in the Ivanpah Valley, Nevada, to \nthe Clark County Department of Aviation.\n  Mr. President, Las Vegas Valley has the fastest growing population in \nthe United States. Fifty percent of the visitors to Las Vegas come \nthrough McCarran Airport. This percentage is increasing as Las Vegas \ngrows and increases in importance as an international travel \ndestination.\n  Mr. President, Las Vegas Valley needs to begin developing other \nairports to accommodate passenger, air cargo, and charter flights. It \nis inevitable that McCarran Airport is reaching its capacity.\n  Mr. President, Las Vegas Valley has a unique opportunity to combine \n6,650 acres of public land with up to $400 million in private capital \nto provide a new publicly-owned and operated airport for Clark County. \nThe Ivanpah Valley Airport site is located about 30 miles south of Las \nVegas and would provide a secondary, southern gateway to the Las Vegas \nmetropolitan area. Of the total acreage, about 2,000 acres will be \ndeveloped for the airport and the balance will be developed as an \nindustrial center. The Ivanpah Valley Airport will be integrated into a \nglobal air cargo distribution network.\n  Mr. President, let me assure you that this is not a giveaway of \npublic lands. My bill requires Clark County to pay fair market value \nfor the land. Additionally, even though private dollars will be used to \nhelp develop this complex, the airport will remain publicly-owned and \nmanaged.\n  Mr. President, I request unanimous consent that the Ivanpah Valley \nAirport Public Lands Transfer Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1964\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, on May 2-4, 1998, more than 1,200 \nstudents will participate in the national finals of the We the People . \n. . The Citizen and the Constitution Program. This is a three day \nacademic competition on the Constitution and Bill of Rights here in \nWashington, D.C. I am proud to acknowledge students from Les Bois High \nSchool in Boise, Idaho, who have achieved the great honor of \nparticipating in this outstanding program. Under the direction of their \nteachers, Dan Prinzing and Janet Adams, these students have worked \ndiligently to reach the national finals by winning competitions in \nIdaho.\n  Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the primary goal of \nthe We the People . . . program, is to promote civic competence and \nresponsibility among the nation's elementary and secondary students. \nThis instructional program is designed to increase the students' \nunderstanding of American constitutional democracy. By providing \nfirsthand experience, students are able to witness the relevance of the \nConstitution and Bill of Rights in dealing with contemporary issues.\n  Participation in the national finals requires that the students \ndemonstrate their knowledge of constitutional principles and their \nrelevance to current issues before a simulation of congressional \ncommittees composed of constitutional scholars, lawyers, journalists, \nand government leaders. Here the students will have the opportunity to \nscrutinize and take or defend positions on issues placed before them.\n  This program provides an excellent opportunity for these students to \nincrease their knowledge of our nation's government and legislative \nprocedure. This is an experience that will benefit both these students \nand the nation, as it provides an excellent hands-on course in \npreparing our young Americans for future leadership.\n  I commend these students from Les Bois High School for this \noutstanding achievement, and wish them luck in the National \ncompetition. I am proud to have them represent the great state of \nIdaho.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of student names \nfrom Les Bois High School who will be competing be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Students from Les Bois Junior High (Boise, Idaho) \n     participating in the We the People program:\n       Ryan Abo, Kyle Anderson, Sean Beaver, Heather Birkinshaw, \n     Michelle Blank, Megan Campbell, Elly Davis, Jordan DeLange, \n     Jesika Groves, Patrick Hanks, Julia Holz, Michelle Howland, \n     Justin Hunter, Jaime Jacobson, Chris Johnson, Jesse Judd, \n     Julie Larson, Kellee Matsko, Ellen Misner, Amber Moss-Jensen, \n     Niki O'Neal, Shannon Otte, Louis Poppler, Britanie Poreba, \n     Barbara Sabo, Nicholai Salovich, Melissa Schurger, Bryan \n     Sharmon, Marc Therrien, and David Wymond.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/21/senate-section/article/S3369-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CELEBRATE TUFTONIA'S DAY\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to mark a very \nimportant event to the 78,000 plus other graduates of Tufts \nUniversity--Tuftonia's Day. Tuftonia's day marks the anniversary of \nTufts University on this date in 1852 (It is the second oldest college \nin the Boston area). It is a time for all Tufts students, alumni, \nprofessors, and friends of the university to turn their thoughts to \nTufts and their fellow Tuftonians. Tufts is my alma mater. I graduated \nfrom the university and received both my masters degree and my \ndoctorate from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.\n  Tufts, a school of 7,800 students, is one of the finest universities \nin the country and is rated as such by the most recent U.S. News and \nWorld Report survey. The main campus is located in Medford, \nMassachusetts and is home to the Tufts College of Liberal Arts, Jackson \nCollege, the College of Engineering, the Boston School of Occupational \nTherapy, and the Fletcher School. The Dental and Medical schools are \ndowntown on the Boston campus and the School of Veterinary Medicine, \nthe only such school in New England, is located in Grafton, \nMassachusetts.\n  When Charles Tufts founded the college, it is said he wanted to found \na ``light on the hill.'' The first rate education, the wonderful \nexperiences, the enduring friendships, and the values instilled in \nTufts students during their years on the hill, shows that Charles \nTufts' dream has been realized.\n  Mr. President, Tufts University is a wonderful place, and Tuftonia's \nDay is a special time for all Jumbos (our mascot) to think about our \ndays at Tufts and to pay tribute to our alma mater, the dear old brown \nand blue. I join with my fellow Tufts alumni in doing so and in \nrecognizing Tuftonia's day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/21/senate-section/article/S3369-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3369-S3370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         VICKI DONOVAN: 1998 NEW HAMPSHIRE TEACHER OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \nhonor Vicki Donovan for being named the 1998 New\n\n[[Page S3370]]\n\nHampshire Teacher of the Year. Vicki is a fourth grade teacher at \nBelmont Elementary School in Belmont, New Hampshire, and is being \nrecognized for her excellence in teaching and leadership in innovative \ncurriculum reform.\n  As a teacher for over 15 years, Vicki has proven her dedication to \nher students and her community, going far beyond her classroom duties. \nAs a member of the Belmont Elementary Language Arts Curriculum \nCommittee, Vicki facilitated a pilot program in their new language arts \ncurriculum. She is involved in Belmont Elementary School's \nextracurricular activities, and has always displayed an avid interest \nin the lives and well-being of her students. She is a member of the \nnewly formed Health Fair Committee that involves school staff and local \nhealth care officials in providing resources and information to \nstudents and families. She is an elected member of the Government Study \nCommittee that has done exhaustive work in attempting to restructure \nand improve the Belmont town government, and she is involved with the \nYouth and Education Committee of the Belmont Civic Pride Organization. \nThis is just a sampling of Vicki's professional and civic involvements; \nher contributions to Belmont Elementary School and the Town of Belmont \nare immeasurable.\n  Vicki's own educational record proves the value that she places in \nlearning. She has continued to take professional courses throughout her \nteaching career, and in 1996 completed her Masters degree in Education. \nShe has supported future teachers by supervising student teachers, and \nhelped improve herself and other teachers through her participation at \nprofessional workshops. She has previously been recognized in ``Who's \nWho Among America's Teachers'' and with the Academy of Applied Science \nand Central New Hampshire Educational Collaborative Award.\n  Mr. President, as a former teacher myself, I recognize the \nchallenges, responsibilities and dedication involved in teaching. \nTeachers are entrusted with the enormous responsibility of preparing \nour youth to be active and responsible citizens. I am very honored to \nhave Vicki Donovan as a teacher in the Granite State, and it is with \ngreat pride that I represent her in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/21/senate-section/article/S3369-4", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PRESIDENTIAL TAX CHECK-OFF\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to call my colleagues' \nattention to a guest editorial by a long-time friend of mine, Mr. Sam \nShipley, which recently appeared in the Wilmington News Journal. I \nthink he makes some very important points about the presidential tax \ncheck-off box, and I commend the article to my colleagues. I ask that \nit be printed in the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n         [From the Wilmington (DE) News Journal, Mar. 11, 1998]\n\n                    $3 Election Check-off Can Add Up\n\n                         (By Samuel L. Shipley)\n\n       The presidential tax check-off needs promoting by the \n     Federal Election Commission. It's been a secret to most \n     Americans. One of the most effective strategies to increase \n     taxpayer awareness would be through public service \n     announcements in the news media, particularly national \n     television.\n       And there would be no better time to air them than now, \n     when Americans have their 1040 forms in hand, complete with \n     instructions on making the check-off.\n       This year, the 1040 forms for 1997 taxes will allow each \n     taxpayer to check off $3 as a matching contribution to the \n     presidential campaign. This can be doubled to $6 on joint tax \n     returns, even if only one spouse is employed.\n       The money from the presidential campaign check-off on Form \n     1040 is allocated equally among presidential candidates, \n     after they raise a certain amount of funds on their own.\n       In the 1990s, despite a national decline in voting \n     participation, more than 100 million Americans turned out to \n     cast ballots for president. No doubt the overwhelming \n     majority of these people file annual income tax returns.\n       This means that this year alone, there is the potential for \n     hundreds of millions of dollars from citizens of all walks of \n     life to be set aside for the 2000 elections.\n       It has been estimated that $1 billion or more was spent on \n     the 1996 presidential election by the respective candidates \n     and their parties. If taxpaying Americans would begin using \n     the presidential campaign funding check-off this year and \n     next, federal election funds to presidential races could \n     replace a large percentage of the money that candidates see \n     fit to seek from the special interests.\n       As a Delaware state Democratic Party chairman for many \n     years and participant in many national political activities \n     and campaigns, I am absolutely convinced of one point. The \n     overwhelming majority of candidates for high national office \n     do not like to go, hat in hand, asking people--particularly \n     special interests--for money. Some absolutely detest it. But \n     with the high cost of staff, organization and particularly \n     media, they see no other alternative.\n       The American people have it in their hands, now more than \n     ever, to give presidential candidates the opportunity to back \n     off from special interests--if they will only use the \n     voluntary $3 tax check-off. This would go a long way to let \n     presidential contenders campaign and serve with honor and \n     dignity. This is the beginning of an answer to the cancer of \n     politics, if only the people will take a scalpel to sleazy \n     special-interest money. This could act as a catalyst to \n     pressure on Congress to overhaul campaign spending \n     practices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/21/senate-section/article/S3370-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO EXERCISE TIGER WAR VETERANS\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on April 23, in a ceremony held in \nKings Bay, Georgia on the U.S.S. Maine, Exercise Tiger veterans will be \nhonored. Following the dockside ceremony, there will be a 24 hour \nembark on the nuclear missile submarine of the United States Navy's Sub \nGroup 10.

Of Tiger's \ndeath toll, 201 men were from the 3206th Quartermaster Company in my \nhome State of Missouri. Due to the secrecy of this mission, to see the \nsoldiers, who fought so bravely, finally received the acknowledgment \nthey deserve.\n  Knowing that I cannot adequately express my admiration and respect, I \njoin in the opportunity to say thank you. I hope the raising of the \nanchor memorial will in some way compensate the brave soldiers who \nrisked or lost their lives during this crucial exercise. This week will \nbe a great occasion for the survivors of Exercise Tiger and I pay \ntribute to their courage and service to the United States of \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/21/senate-section/article/S3370-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3370-S3371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MORE QUESTIONS ON GLOBAL WARMING\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, last year the Senate passed a \nbipartisan resolution, S. Res. 98, which expressed the Sense of the \nSenate that the United States should not enter into any global warming \ntreaty unless developing nations joined in the effort by agreeing to \nemission limits. This resolution passed by a vote of 95-0.\n  Despite this clear and specific resolution, the Administration \nnegotiated and agreed to a treaty in Kyoto which sets binding limits on \ncarbon emissions by developed nations, but which compels no similar \nparticipation from the developing world. Clearly, the Kyoto treaty \nfails to meet the criteria established by S. Res. 98.\n  To date, China, India, Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and other emerging \ntrading partners have no obligations under the Kyoto Treaty. Since \nsigning the agreement, the Administration has worked to secure some \nlevel of participation by these nations with the intention of amending \nthe Treaty. Of course, these countries understand the economic impact \nof emissions limits, so it is not surprising that the United States is \nhaving a difficult time convincing these governments that their \nparticipation is necessary.\n  Recently, however, the State Department reports that it has reached \n``a conceptual agreement'' with some countries to ``pursue an umbrella \ngroup to trade emissions permits.'' No details about the nature or \ndesign of the agreement have been released, so it is difficult to judge \nthe success of the recent efforts. A few questions come to mind \nhowever. What limits would these nations agree to? Would this be a part \nof the Protocol or a separate agreement outside the Protocol? How would \nthis ``umbrella group'' even be recognized by the Protocol Parties? \nFinally, what is the U.S. offering to entice this group?\n  Mr. President, the Administration's actions and comments since Kyoto\n\n[[Page S3371]]\n\nraise many questions but provide few answers. I hope the delegation \nwill be more forthcoming in the next few months and allow Congress and \nthe public an opportunity to comment on the U.S. proposals prior to the \nJune and November sessions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/21/senate-section/article/S3370-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING MICHAEL TODD\n\n   Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \ncongratulate Michael Todd, an Army Veteran and fellow Floridian who was \nrecently selected by the Jewish War Veterans Organization to \nparticipate as a non-Jewish delegate on the Allied Veterans' Mission to \nIsrael. Nominated by the Oskar Schindler Post of the Jewish War \nVeterans in Port Charlotte, Mr. Todd was West Coast Florida's only \nrepresentative on the goodwill trip to Israel from April 5-April 13, \n1998.\n  As a U.S. Army combat soldier, Mr. Todd was wounded four times and \nhighly decorated for his valor and meritorious service during the \nVietnam War. Since his return from Vietnam in 1974, Mr. Todd has \nvolunteered on behalf of veterans throughout Florida and the nation. He \nfounded and is the current President of both the National Veterans for \nAmerica, and the South Gulf Coast Regional Veterans Council of Florida. \nFurthermore, Mr. Todd is an active member of various veterans \norganizations, ranging from the American Legion to the Vietnam Veterans \nof America.\n  In addition, the Charlotte County, Florida Board of County \nCommissioners has issued a proclamation declaring April 21, 1998 as \n``Michael Todd Day.'' In the proclamation, the County Commissioners \npraised Mr. Todd's efforts to improve the lives of veterans of the \narmed forces and their family members.\n  Mr. Todd's tireless volunteer service deserves the respect and \nadmiration of Congress, the Country and Charlotte County. I am proud to \noffer my congratulations and look forward to hearing about his \nexperiences while on his mission to Israel. I have no doubt he will \ncontinue to represent the Jewish War Veterans and the United States of \nAmerica with honor.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of Charlotte County's Proclamation \ndesignating today as ``Michael Todd Day'' be printed in the Record.\n  The proclamation follows:\n\n                              Proclamation\n\n       Whereas, the national organization of the Jewish War \n     Veterans of the United States of America in Washington, D.C., \n     provides a program entitled the Annual Allied Veterans' \n     Mission to Israel, under which non-Jewish select veteran \n     leaders from throughout the United States are nominated by \n     local posts and state councils and selected as delegates to \n     visit Israel and learn about its history and people and to \n     act as ambassadors of good will for their state and local \n     communities; and\n       Whereas, a highly decorated local U.S. Army combat Vietnam \n     veteran (wounded four times), Michael Todd, has brought honor \n     and recognition to himself, the State of Florida, Charlotte \n     County, and the City of Punta Gorda by being nominated by the \n     Oakar Schindler Post of the Jewish War Veterans in Port \n     Charlotte and its State Council and subsequently selected as \n     a delegate and an ambassador of good will representing the \n     State of Florida, Charlotte County, and the City of Punta \n     Gorda, to participate in the Jewish War Veterans' Annual \n     Allied Veterans' Mission to Israel from April 5 to April 13, \n     1998; and\n       Whereas, the honor bestowed on Michael Todd provides \n     recognition to Mr. Todd for his tireless efforts as a \n     veterans' advocate and leader, and his devoted service to his \n     community as President of So.
