Mr. President, it is a pleasure to be back on this spring \nday and to hear the Chaplain's prayer and to see the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina here ready for business. I know we are \ngoing to have a productive season as we go into April and May.\n  This afternoon there will be a period for morning business until the \nhour of 1 p.m. Following morning business, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the motion to proceed to S. 104, the Nuclear Policy \nAct.\n  As I announced prior to the recess, no rollcall votes will occur \nduring today's session of the Senate. Under the order, a cloture vote \non the motion to proceed to S. 104 will occur on Tuesday.\n  I had planned to ask unanimous consent that the vote on the motion to \ninvoke cloture occur at 5:15 on Tuesday, with the time between 2:15 and \n5:15 to be equally divided between the proponents and opponents. I \nunderstand that the Democratic leader may have a little bit of a \nconflict, where we may try to move that toward 5:30, although we have \nother Senators who have conflicts at that time. So we will get a \ndefinite unanimous consent request here shortly. The vote will be \nsometime between 5 and 5:30, I presume, and I believe we can get that \nworked out just as long as we have a minute more to confer with our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  All Members should be aware that the next rollcall vote will occur, \nthen, on tomorrow at either 5:15 or 5:30, something like that. It is my \nhope the Senate will invoke cloture tomorrow, which will enable us to \nbegin consideration of this very important legislation, which is the \nnuclear waste legislation. I think there is no more important \nenvironmental issue pending in America than to make the decision of \nwhat we are going to do with nuclear waste that is sitting in sites \nacross this country, from South Carolina to Vermont, from the banks of \nthe Mississippi to the shores of the Pacific. We cannot ignore this. We \ncannot wait another 15 years for studies to be completed. We have spent \nbillions of dollars. We have been working on this for years. It is time \nfor action.\n  The Senate voted by a wide margin last year to make a decision on \nthis issue, to pass this nuclear waste repository legislation. The \nHouse did not act. I have been assured this year the House will act, \nthis matter will go to the President, and we hope that it will go to \nhim in such a way that he recognizes that Senators and Congressmen and \nthe American people all across this country feel that this decision \nmust be made.\n  So, I am looking forward to our beginning the debate. If cloture is \ninvoked, Senators can anticipate debate and rollcall votes during every \nday of the session this week so we may complete action on S. 104 as \nsoon as possible. I remind my colleagues that this\n\n[[Page S2762]]\n\nwill be a busy period legislatively prior to the Memorial Day recess.\n  I think all Senators should be aware that bills are beginning to be \nreported out of committees. We have had 3 months to have the hearings \nto mark up legislation. We have a number of bills that have now been \nreported, including the TEAM Act and the Comptime and Flextime Act, \nwhich can be very helpful to families and working mothers who need time \nto be with their children. That legislation is ready. Sometime late \nthis month or early next month we will, as I have said, have a vote on \nthe partial-birth abortion ban legislation. So we are beginning now to \nenter a period where we will have a lot of legislation.\n\n  Obviously, we need to have a vote on the budget. I had hoped we could \ncome to a grand agreement that would be in the best interests of all \nAmericans with the President. So far, that has been fruitless. I have \ncommitted basically 3 months, along with the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, the time and the meetings, to try to see that something \nhappened in this budget area, but we have not been successful with \nthat. I had asked the President not to oppose the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment. He did. In fact, he and the leadership on the \nother side of the aisle twisted arms, and two Senators switched their \npositions, and we lost that by one vote. But every Republican and 11 \nDemocrats had the courage of their convictions and voted for it.\n  Then I asked the President and his people to send us a real budget, a \nbudget that showed courage, showed leadership, that would have some \nrestraints in the entitlements area, that would preserve and protect \nMedicare, that would give some tax relief to working Americans, that \nwould have some restraint and controls on the rate of increase on \nnondefense discretionary spending and would do what needs to be done in \nthe defense area; show some leadership. They did not. They sent a \npolitical document.\n  Since that time, we have tried to encourage some movement with the \nsuggestion that we have a commission to decide on the accurate, honest \nnumber of the Consumer Price Index. The President indicated \npreliminarily he thought maybe we could get a commission on that. To \nhis credit, the Democratic leader indicated he thought that was a move \nin the right direction. But then they backed away from it. Other \nsuggestions have been made by the Republican leadership, but there has \nbeen no reciprocation, no action.\n  The President needs to lead in this area. If he does not, we are \nmoving on. We are moving on. We have to do this budget. We will do a \nbudget in the Senate in the next few days. I think we have to get \naction in the Budget Committee here in the next couple of weeks. We \nhave to get some decision made so the Appropriations Committee can \nbegin to move forward. We hope it will be a bipartisan agreement. We \nwould like to have the President's help, but the time is over for \nwaiting. We must move forward. I will be talking later today to the \nchairman of the Budget Committee and interested Republicans and \nDemocrats to see how we can proceed. We still would like to have the \nPresident's involvement and help, but he does not seem, so far, to be \nready to do that.\n  Our staffs were meeting during the past 2 weeks. They were supposed \nto be making progress. From what I understand, they had a grand time \nmeeting and saying how wonderful it was they were meeting--but that is \nabout all. It was my understanding, from what the President said, that \nhe would meet with the leadership of Congress when we returned from the \nEaster recess period to discuss, hopefully, the final decisions on the \nbudget--this week. But I understand now, that meeting is not going to \noccur this week. It is next week. Yet, as we wait for leadership from \nthe White House, we see some people saying, why doesn't the Congress \nact? We have been trying to confirm the President's Cabinet. We have \nbeen trying to work with the administration and to work off of his \nbudget agreement so we could move to a final agreement. It has taken \ntime. But that time is gone. We have to go ahead and do our job. And it \nwill be our intent to do so.\n  So, I thank all Senators in advance for their cooperation as we begin \nwhat I hope will be a productive couple of months. We have a lot of \ngood legislation we can take up, we will take up, and I think when we \ngo out for the Memorial Day period we will have several bills that we \ncan point to with pride that we have voted on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/07/senate-section/article/S2761-4", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2762]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 104\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, we are here today to talk about the need \nfor us to reauthorize the Prescription Drug User Fee Act and pass \nlegislation to modernize the Food and Drug Administration.\n  I will just remind everyone as to what happened last year. The Senate \nLabor Committee passed an FDA reform bill out of committee with a \nstrong, bipartisan vote of 12-4.\n  So we are here today to alert the body that we intend to move forward \nexpeditiously this year in order to ensure that we improve the FDA \nreview process for new products as well as reauthorize the Prescription \nDrug User Fee Act. And we are going to do so in a bipartisan manner.\n  Let me state that I intend that these issues will move together. It \nis my goal, as chairman of the authorizing committee, to have a bill \nready for the full Senate's consideration before midyear. During the \nlast Congress, my predecessor, Senator Kassebaum, led our committee in \nreporting out legislation which emphasizes the FDA has a role in \nbringing needed products to the public in a timely fashion as well as a \nrole of protecting the public from harm.\n  This year, I look forward to continuing that work. The objective of \nmodernizing the FDA is to make more information and better products \navailable to the public in an expeditious way, to foster and improve a \nnew product review process, and require that the agency be as efficient \nand effective as possible in carrying out its statutorily defined \nduties.\n  As chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, my approach \nwill be to identify problem areas in the FDA regulatory system for \ndrugs, devices, and other products which can be improved with \nlegislation and gives the FDA the tools it needs to address other \nproblems administratively.\n  Specifically, we will target areas that have the effect of needlessly \ndelaying patient access to safe new therapies and products. In \naddition, we must not squander scarce FDA resources on bureaucratic \nprocedures which confer no demonstrated public health benefit.\n\n[[Page S2763]]\n\n We must also reauthorize the successful Prescription Drug User Fee \nAct, also known as PDUFA.\n  In 1992, the pharmaceutical and biotechnological industries were so \nconcerned about the length of time taken by FDA to approve new drugs \nthat they were willing to adopt FDA's proposal that they pay user fees \nin exchange for faster reviews. FDA has been able to reduce mean \napproval times for new drugs to which user fees were paid from almost \n30 months in 1992 to 15.5 months in 1996. We need to continue this \neffort.\n  Notwithstanding the success in reducing the review time for new drug \napplications, the period of time it takes pharmaceutical and \nbiotechnological groups to work with FDA on the drug development phase \nbefore an application is even submitted has lengthened. It is my hope \nthat we can introduce new performance measures for the FDA in \naddressing the drug development phase and further enhancing the drug \nreview and approval phases as part of the reauthorization of PDUFA.\n  It is essential to note that these user fees are contingent on the \nAppropriations Committee's making available to the FDA the pre-1992 \nlevel of appropriated funds to the Agency updated for inflation. This \nprovides the assurance that user fees do not become a substitute for \nfunds appropriated from general revenues.\n  The administration's budget puts this important principle at risk \nwith an 8-percent cut in the funding for the FDA. I know of Chairman \nStevens' interest in the FDA and its approval process. I look forward \nto working with him, the other Appropriations Committee, and the \nmajority leader to make sure that the FDA has the full level of funding \nit needs to perform its vital functions across each of the centers.\n\n  Mr. President, the Labor and Human Resources Committee will move \nexpeditiously to have the reauthorization of PDUFA and legislation to \nmodernize the FDA ready for the consideration of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I know the Senator from Maryland is here and also \nwants to join myself and the majority leader in making sure that the \nSenate does what it must do in order to make the improvements necessary \nto bring the FDA up to what it can be and should be.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want to state very clearly that I \nagree with the distinguished majority leader, the Republican leader, \nand the respected chairman of the Labor and Education Committee, Mr. \nJeffords, in reauthorizing the Prescription Drug User Fee Act this \nyear. And I also support strong bipartisan agreement on FDA reform. The \ntime has come. The time is now. It is a window of opportunity to just \ndo it.\n  I am so pleased that we are proceeding on this, and not only in a \nbipartisan fashion, but a nonpartisan fashion. I had the pleasure of \nworking with the former chairman, Senator Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, \nwho retired, on fashioning a bipartisan framework on FDA reform.\n  I am so pleased that her successor, Senator Jeffords, has picked up \nthe same framework as a working document for us to be able to proceed \nbecause this is what the American people want us to do--to work \ntogether to be able to have a Federal agency that oversees the approval \nof our pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and biomedical devices to ensure \ntheir safety and efficacy, but also to make sure they move out into \nclinical practice in a timely way. This is what we need to do because \nit will save lives and generate jobs in the United States of America.\n  So I look forward to working with the distinguished chairman in \nfashioning the bill in committee and with the Republican leader in \nmoving it to the Senate floor, because it is time to bring a smokestack \nregulatory framework into the computer age. FDA needs to adopt a new \nculture and move into the 21st century. That is why FDA reform is so \nimportant. We need a new regulatory framework that will make sure that \nwe bring exciting new biomedical technology devices to not only \nmillions of Americans in a timely fashion but this is a global field \nthat will enable us to export around the world.\n  Our country has been often known for exporting smart weapons of war \nbut this will enable us to export smart new technology in the war \nagainst disease. This will be absolutely crucial.\n  Reform is of great interest in my State of Maryland. Maryland is home \nto many biotechnology companies and medical device manufacturers and \nthey are creating new scientific products which will save lives.\n  In the 104th Congress, under the able leadership of now retired \nSenator Kassebaum, we reached that bipartisan consensus on effective \nand responsible FDA reform. Then I was pleased to join several of my \nDemocratic colleagues in supporting the Kassebaum bill. And I am \ncommitted to achieving meaningful bipartisan reform this year.\n  Coupled with FDA reform though, this is the year that we must \nreauthorize something called PDUFA. As has been outlined very ably by \nthe chairman of the committee, this Prescription Drug User Fee Act has \nshown that it will significantly reduce drug approval time because it \ngenerated fees that have been used to hire more staff. It enabled the \nFDA to move more expeditiously in moving new drugs to patients more \nquickly. For example, new AIDS drugs are being approved now in a matter \nof months rather than a matter of years.\n  FDA itself is located in my own State. They work under very difficult \nsituations. They work out of modular buildings, many of which are \nspread over 27 different sites. They often are short-staffed. And they \nneed to make sure we pass PDUFA so that they have the adequate \nresources they need to do the job while we help them fashion an \nadequate legislative and regulatory framework.\n\n  We can build on this great track record. With the extension of PDUFA \nfor another 5 years, we can have the opportunity to make further \nimprovements. What can be done with some new drugs should be done for \nthe benefit of many other patients.\n  Mr. President, we are talking about the need to provide all the help \nwe can to a Government agency that has an enormous impact on the day-\nto-day lives of Americans. The FDA is involved with everything from the \ndrugs we take to the food we eat. Let us move on PDUFA and FDA reform \nin a sensible, responsible bipartisan manner. And as this is done, we \nmust focus on the values of safety and efficacy while we will also \nstreamline our process.\n  I know also in the Chamber is the distinguished Senator from Oregon \n[Mr. Wyden], who when we worked on the original PDUFA was in the House. \nHe brings a great deal of knowledge to that. And we know he will be \npart of our bipartisan effort. So we thank you, I say to the Senator, \nand look forward to working with you.\n  In conclusion, I would like to also thank the chairman of the \ncommittee, Mr. Jeffords. He established a committee now called Public \nHealth and Safety. It is the first time I believe in the committee's \nhistory that we have had a committee devoted strictly to focusing on \nthe public health needs of the American people. The Centers for Disease \nControl and NIOSH and others will be so absolutely crucial. And being \nthe gentleman that he is, he yielded that plum to another member of the \ncommittee, and enabled Dr. Bill Frist to chair that committee, who \nbrings to the committee the experience as a physician of a hands-on \nclinical practice as well as the know-how and what it really takes to \nbe able to save lives.\n  This is what we need to be doing--the right committee structure, the \nright attitude within the committee so that we can all work together so \nthat at the end of the term, we might not have solved every budget \nproblem, we might not have balanced every line item, but at the end of \nthis term people will be safer, their food, their pharmaceuticals, and \nso on, will be able to move quicker, faster, cheaper, maintaining \nsafety and efficacy because of what this committee has done. I look \nforward to cooperating with that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. We are awaiting the arrival of the majority leader. I \nknow the Senator from Oregon has somewhat\n\n[[Page S2764]]\n\nof a lengthy statement. I wonder if he would be willing to be \ninterrupted by the majority leader should he arrive and that we also \nwould place his statement preceding mine such that it would appear in \nthe order originally intended.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the gentleman for his courtesy. Perhaps we might \nwait a few more minutes for the leader.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this Congress has an opportunity to build on \nthe progress made in the 104th Congress to assist the Food and Drug \nAdministration in meeting the needs of millions of Americans who are \nawaiting the advancement of new medicines.\n  Over the years, I have known individuals who have needed medicines \nand medical procedures that they could not get because the FDA had not \ndone whatever was necessary, in their opinion, to approve these \nprocedures. I have known of examples of people going to Mexico for \nmedicine or to England for a medical procedure because they could not \nget that procedure in America. Yet 20 years later, one of the \nprocedures that Americans had to go to England to get now is so common \nit is almost done as an outpatient procedure. That is ridiculous, and \nit is time we make some progress in advancing these new medicines in a \nmore expeditious manner.\n  We also have an urgent need to act to extend the highly successful \nlaw that will expire later this year unless it is renewed in a timely \nfashion.\n  Let me review last year's legislation that would enable the FDA to \nmeet the demands of the rapidly approaching 21st century.\n  This past year, we had wide bipartisan agreement on essential \nelements of FDA reform in both Houses of Congress. In the Senate, the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee approved S. 1477, the Food and Drug \nAdministration Performance and Accountability Act, by a 12-to-4 \nbipartisan margin. In the House, H.R. 3199, the Drug and Biological \nProducts Reform Act was cosponsored by more than 200 Members of both \nparties.\n  It was unfortunate, Mr. President, that despite the best efforts of \nthen Labor and Human Resources Chair Nancy Kassebaum, as well as my \ncolleagues Senator Dan Coats and Senator Chris Dodd, we ran out of time \nlast year before S. 1477 could be brought to the Senate floor. I wanted \nto do it. They wanted to do it. A bipartisan group wanted to do it. In \nthe face of a threatened filibuster by some Senators, we were not able \nto bring it to the floor with that threat hanging over the legislation.\n  However, as the urgency of this legislation becomes more and more \napparent, I am confident that the Labor and Human Resources Committee \nunder the able leadership of the distinguished Senator from Vermont \n[Mr. Jeffords], will undertake this worthy effort without delay.\n  Congress must also consider another important law this year, the 1992 \nPrescription Drug User Fee Act which is scheduled to expire on \nSeptember 30, 1997.\n  The user fee law was the result of a historic agreement between \nCongress, the Food and Drug Administration, and the pharmaceutical and \nbiotechnology industries. Industry agreed to pay $347 million in user \nfees during the 1993-97 period, which enabled the FDA to speed up the \napproval process by employing an additional 600 reviewers. Unless this \nvital law is renewed, the advances made by the FDA will be interrupted \nand the progress will be damaged.\n  As majority leader, I plan to do everything I can to ensure that \nPDUFA, the legislation I just referred to, is reauthorized for another \n5 years, thus ensuring that our sickest patients will have fast access \nto life-saving products.\n  Mr. President, Congress must meet these two challenges. We must act \nnow for the patients all across America. I certainly commend Senator \nJeffords for his efforts in this area, his leadership, and my good \nfriend, the Senator from Maryland, Senator Mikulski. She has been a \nleader in getting this colloquy and getting these statements printed in \nthe Record today. I commend her and urge my colleagues on the \nappropriate committee and on both sides of the aisle to support these \ntwo very important pieces of legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 30 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/07/senate-section/article/S2762-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2764-S2766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the process of making public policy, like \nmuch of life, is about opportunity, risk, and reward. That proposition \nis clearly demonstrated when the Senate looks at the critical issue of \nMedicare reform.\n  I take the floor today, as I plan to do every day this week, to talk \nabout a tremendous opportunity that the Senate has before it, the \nopportunity to finally remake Medicare for the 21st century in a \nbipartisan way. The Senate ought to seize this opportunity to act now \nand act boldly so that Medicare can be preserved for future generations \nof Americans.\n  As Senators return from visiting their respective States today, we \nbegin a legislative period that I believe can be a critical few months \nin Medicare's history. There is an opportunity to engage this issue as \nserious debate begins on the fiscal year 1998 budget. I believe that \nthere is now a unique window of opportunity for reforming Medicare that \nwould come along in only rare instances.\n  Three factors combine to make this a special opportunity to try to \nset Medicare on track for the next century. The first is that the \nFederal deficit is less than was anticipated for this year, just over \n$108 billion. Second, we have a fairly benign economy. Surely, there \nare too many folks still hurting, there are too many folks falling \nbetween the cracks, but overall the economy has been strong. Third, it \nis very clear that our country will face a demographic earthquake in \nthe next century with so many more older people, and we have a window \nof opportunity now to act before those demographic trends are set in \nplace.\n  My view is that Medicare does not need to be reformed because it has \nfailed but because it has been such a great success that it cannot be \nallowed to deteriorate. I argue that only enemies of this program would \nwant it to stay exactly as it is, because the status quo, the Medicare \nstatus quo that encourages waste and discourages user-friendly \ninnovation, in my view, consigns Medicare to very difficult times.\n  The General Accounting Office, for example, has estimated that the \ngap between expected revenues for the program and the enormous service \ndemands is going to produce a gap of almost a half trillion dollars at \nthe end of the next decade. This program, which is a lifeline to 38 \nmillion senior citizens, faces very serious, if not calamitous, \nfinancial circumstances by the end of the decade. There are a variety \nof reasons for this, as I am going to outline this week.\n  In much of the United States, Medicare is engaging in wasteful \npractices that the private sector consigned to the attic years and \nyears ago. In much of the country, Medicare is inefficient, volume-\ndriven, clunky health care, and it is one of the first things that \nneeds to be changed.\n  I believe that there are substantial opportunities for this Senate to \nmove on Medicare reform, and I think there are some special areas that \nwe should be careful to avoid. I say, Mr. President, and colleagues, \nthat I think it would be a great mistake to appoint yet another \nbipartisan commission to study Medicare. A number of our colleagues \nhave proposed that. I have great respect for them, but if there is \nanother bipartisan committee that studies this issue, I believe we will \nsee bipartisan inertia for Medicare for years and years to come. The \nfirst question a bipartisan commission would face is should they report \nbefore the 1998 election. Then there would be a question about whether \nthey would report before the year 2000 election.\n  I do not think that a commission can create a forum for avoiding the \ntough\n\n[[Page S2765]]\n\nchoices. That is why I come to the floor today, as I will this week, to \noutline first why it is so important to act and why I believe that \nfinally, after a substantial period of sharp and acrimonious debate on \nMedicare, it ought to be possible to act in a bipartisan way.\n  I have had a number of private conversations with my colleagues on \nthis issue over the last few months. I believe that despite some of the \npolitical backbiting that has gone on on this issue, every Senator \nunderstands that this program has to be reformed. In some measure, the \nU.S. Senate and the Congress have become like a bunch of reluctant \nseventh graders at a junior high school sock hop, standing on the gym \nsidelines, all waiting for the first brave soul to hit the dance floor.\n  In an effort to try to move the process forward, to jump-start the \ndebate, I recently introduced S. 386, the Medicare Modernization and \nPatient Protection Act.\n  I offered this legislation not as a be-all and end-all solution to \nall of the financial challenges we face with Medicare, but rather as a \ndirection to build on some of the progress that has been made in areas \nof the country like my own in Oregon. Much of Oregon is already \noperating 21st century Medicare services, operating Medicare in a way \nthat is good for seniors and good for taxpayers. So when people tell me \nit's not possible to get this program on track, I invite them to come \nto my own State, because in my own State we have been able to do it.\n  Mr. President, I would like to outline briefly a few of the specific \nitems in my Medicare legislation that I will go into further detail on \nthroughout this week.\n  The first initiative in any responsible Medicare reform effort has \ngot to be to bring more choices and more competition to the program. We \nhave to see Medicare reform in comparison to what the private sector \nhas done. Members of the U.S. Senate should not have too much \ndifficulty grasping this concept because a model, the Federal employee \nhealth benefits plan, exists. Members are part of it, and surely it can \nbe a central plank for any bipartisan Medicare reform to look to the \nmodel of the Federal employees health benefits plan to produce more \nchoices and more options.\n  The second plank of any Medicare reform effort should be to eliminate \nthe rewards that the program has for waste and eliminate the way it \npenalizes the frugal. As incredible as it sounds, that's exactly what \nhappens in the Medicare Program as it relates to health plans. If a \nplan holds down their costs, they end up getting penalized, and very \noften it is tough for providers, particularly in rural areas, to make a \ngo of it. If a plan or part of the country sits on its hands and does \nnot make an effort to hold down costs, they get bigger reimbursement \nchecks. That's not right. The private sector consigned that kind of \napproach to the attic years ago in eliminating the rewards for waste \nand penalties. Efficiency should be a central component of any Medicare \nreform.\n  Third, Mr. President, it seems critical, in my view, to protect the \nrights of patients. I believe that when there is a modernized Medicare \nProgram, there will be more managed care available under the program \nacross this country. Many of our citizens, seniors and others, have had \nlegitimate questions about managed care, and I believe it is important \nto put in place strong patient protections to safeguard the rights of \nolder people. This would include provisions such as a ban on these gag \nclauses that keep older people from knowing their rights in managed \ncare plans. It would include stronger appeals procedures, grievance \nprocedures, and also the right of patients in managed care plans to get \ndata through report cards about how their plan stacks up on key issues. \nI believe that part of the effort to reform Medicare ought to be to \nprotect patients' rights, and this should be a central component of \nMedicare reform as the effort to promote more competition goes forward.\n  Fourth, Mr. President, I would change the reimbursement system that \nis used in Medicare, known as the average adjusted per capita cost. \nThis is a sleep-inducing, eye-glazing concept by any calculus, but it \nis the guts of Medicare reform. To reform this system, we ought to \ngradually increase the reimbursement levels for low-cost areas, many of \nthem in rural areas, and we ought to inject more competition in high-\ncost areas. There have been a number of recent analyses indicating that \nsome managed care plans have been overpaid, many of them in the high-\ncost areas. Introducing more competition in those high-cost areas \nthrough changes in this Medicare reimbursement formula is a sensible \nway to enact bipartisan reform.\n  Then, Mr. President, it is critical that the Senate tighten up \nefforts to fight fraud in Medicare. The General Accounting Office \nrecently indicated that about 10 percent of all of the costs of \nMedicare are lost due to fraud. In a $200 billion program, $20 billion \nlost to fraud and abuse has plagued the program. Stronger penalties \nought to be imposed for defrauding Medicare. If someone engages in a \nflagrant, reprehensible fraud, they ought to be kicked out of the \nMedicare Program for all time, not just some sort of slap on the wrist \nin a resolving door situation. For flagrant frauds, there ought to be \nlifetime debarment.\n  Next, Mr. President, in my legislation we would expand the role of \nalternative health care providers. Nurses, physician assistants, \npharmacists, and chiropractors, among others, have shown an ability \nacross this country to deliver good quality, affordable health care to \nolder people. They ought to be allowed to play an expanded role in the \nMedicare of the 21st century, both because these alternative \nprofessions will help us to hold costs down through more competition \nand also because they offer good quality care.\n  Next, Mr. President, I would unleash the power of new \ntelecommunications technologies in the health care field. A number of \nSenators on both sides of the aisle have sought to expand the role of \ntelemedicine, which is already delivering good quality, low-cost care, \nparticularly in the preventive area. It is time for Medicare managers \nto employ these tools. But as we see in so many parts of Medicare, the \nFederal Government program, which is relied on by millions of seniors \nand their families, lags behind the private sector. The Federal \nGovernment hasn't even taken baby steps in terms of trying to set out a \npolicy to utilize telemedicine. So my legislation tries to ensure that \nInternet access, which at least will help our rural communities, is \navailable. And, Mr. President, Senators on both sides of the aisle have \ndone good work that could be incorporated into a Medicare reform bill.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, I propose in my legislation to clear away the \nregulatory underbrush that needlessly and expensively fragments our \nsystem of care for the older folks who are eligible for both Medicare \nand Medicaid. These are folks on a low, fixed income. They are the so-\ncalled dual eligibles. Right now, they are a big factor in major cost \nincreases in both Medicare and Medicaid. It is time for some more \ncreative approaches for dealing with those older people who are \neligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. My legislation proposes that, \nand I intend to outline that further in the week.\n  Mr. President, the legislation that I have introduced can save about \n$100 billion in hard savings over the next 5 years to provide short-\nterm financial stability for the program. I submit that our challenge \nnow is to lay the foundation for the next century. My legislation \ndoesn't, in any way, deal with all of the tough questions that the \nSenate is going to face on Medicare. Medicare is not just an important \npart of the Federal budget; Medicare is likely to be the Federal budget \nfor the next 15 to 20 years. When we look at the technological \nexplosion and the extraordinary technologies that are available, when \nwe look at the demographic tsunami that is coming in the next century \nwith so many older people, the challenge now is to lay a bipartisan \nfoundation to build on in the years ahead. The program that I have \ndescribed and the legislation I have introduced takes from the efforts \nof both political parties over the last few years on Medicare.\n  For example, my legislation protects defined, secure, guaranteed \nbenefits for older people under Medicare. A number of Senators, led by \nSenator Kennedy, have made this their priority, and I am of the view \nthat they are absolutely right. I think it would be a great mistake to \nsay that the future of Medicare\n\n[[Page S2766]]\n\nought to be to just involve handing a check to an older person and say, \n``Well, ma'am, buy health care until your money runs out. If the cost \nof your care is greater than your check, well, so be it.'' I think it \nis important to have guaranteed, secure, defined benefits. Many \nSenators have stood for this principle. It is at the heart of my \nlegislation.\n  Let me also say that I believe that many Senators on the other side \nof the aisle have been absolutely right in saying that it is time to \nbring more competition and more choice to the Medicare Program. Many \nSenators on the other side of the aisle have made the case that \ncompetitive models--be it the Federal employee health plan or be it the \nprivate sector--ought to be the kind of approach that we look to for \n21st century Medicare. I believe they are right. I believe, in \naddition, that it is now possible to forge a bipartisan coalition on \nMedicare between the two parties, where those who have advocated for \nguaranteeing secure, defined benefits can work with those who have \ncalled for more competition and more choice and the kinds of changes \nthat have come to the private sector.\n  What it comes down to, Mr. President, is, will the Senate have the \npolitical will to do it? Will the Senate have the vision to see beyond \nthe next electoral ridge? I believe that there is an extraordinary \nopportunity now to set out a foundation for the next century. We know \nthat in the next century we are going to have to be dealing with the \nquestion of whether, hypothetically, Lee Iaccoca ought to be paying \nmore for his Medicare than should a woman who is 75 years old and on a \nlow income who suffers from Alzheimer's. I didn't address it in my \nlegislation, but I happen to think that ought to be done. Senators will \nhave different views on that issue.\n  Mr. President, I am not convinced that's the issue that has to be \ntackled right now. The issue that has to be tackled by the Senate right \nnow is to come up with $100 billion of hard savings to deal with the \nbudget resolution and the short-term financial challenge of Medicare \nand then to lay the foundation for the next century. The foundation for \nthe next century can build on some very good work being done by \nSenators of both political parties. I have been meeting with those \nSenators privately.\n  I will have more to say during this week, Mr. President, for I intend \nto go into further detail on my comprehensive Medicare reform \nlegislation every day this week. I will close with one last point. This \nissue is so important to our country and so important to the Senate \nthat I believe in the next century--2010, 2020, 2030--people are going \nto ask everyone in public life today: What did you do to try to get \nMedicare on track?\n  I believe the legislation I have introduced opens up the opportunity \nfor bipartisan discussions toward Medicare reform. I have had a number \nof those already with Chairman Domenici, Chairman Gramm on the other \nside of the aisle, and have been very gracious in that regard. I have \nhad a chance to talk to the minority leader, Senator Daschle, and \nSenator Kennedy, who have done so much good work.\n  Mr. President, I close by saying that my concern is to make sure that \nthe Senate, after years of bitter and acrimonious discussions on \nMedicare, now tries to approach it in a different way, in a bipartisan \nway, in a way that will allow us to tap the revolution of private \nsector health care, in a way that is good for patients, and in a way \nthat is good for seniors and for taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/07/senate-section/article/S2764-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         HONORING THE MAPLES ON THEIR 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \non the motion to invoke cloture on Senate bill 104, the Nuclear Waste \nAct, occur at 5:15 on Tuesday, with the time between 2:15 and 5:15 \nequally divided between the proponents and opponents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I wish the occupant \nof the chair a good afternoon.\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am going to be speaking this \nafternoon at some length on Senate bill 104. This is a bill that \nprovides a comprehensive plan for the Federal Government to meet its \nobligations to provide a safe place to store spent nuclear fuel and \nnuclear waste.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important to reflect on some of the \nbackground associated with nuclear waste and the status of our \ncontinued dependence on nuclear energy.\n  First of all, let me refer to an article by Bertram Wolfe. Mr. Wolfe \nis a consultant at Monte Sereno, CA, and a former president of the \nAmerican Nuclear Society. He suggests that by midcentury, the Third \nWorld population on this Earth will double from 4 billion to 8 billion \npeople while the population of the industrial world will grow by about \n20 percent, to 1.2 billion. He further suggests that unless we expect \nto see the majority of the world's people living indefinitely in dire \npoverty, we should be prepared for per capita energy use to rise \nrapidly with economic progress. Even if the Third World per capita \nenergy use rises to only one-third of the United States level, that \nincrease, in combination with the expected population growth, will \nresult in a threefold increase in world energy use by the year 2050.\n  He further suggests that if fossil fuels are used to supply these \nincreased energy needs, we can expect serious deterioration of air \nquality and possibly environmental disaster from global climate change \ndue to the greenhouse effect. In addition, increased demand for fossil \nfuels, combined with the dwindling supply, undoubtedly will lead to \nhigher prices, slower economic growth, and the likelihood of energy-\nrelated global conflicts.\n  I wonder if anyone in this Chamber would doubt that Kuwait's oil \nresources were a major factor in the United States willingness to take \nmilitary action against Iraq. Unfortunately, alternatives to this \nscenario are few. Perhaps the future world energy use can be stabilized \nat a level much less than a third of present U.S. per capita use. Of \ncourse, that demand could be much higher. Perhaps solar or wind power \nwill become practical on a larger scale. Perhaps fusion, or even cold \nfusion, will be developed. But as we enter the world's energy needs in \nthe 21st century, we have to focus on one area that currently provides \nus with nearly 21 percent of our electricity in the United States, and \nthat is nuclear power. Even conventional nuclear powerplants will face \nfuel supply problems in the next century if their use expands \nsignificantly, which is why we ought to consider the use of the \nadvanced liquid metal reactor which can produce more than 100 times as \nmuch energy per pound of uranium as conventional reactors.\n\n[[Page S2767]]\n\n  The United States, as we know, has been a leader in the development \nof nuclear power technology and in the adoption of stringent safety \nstandards. It is important to note that not a single member of the \npublic has been harmed by the operation of any of the world's nuclear \nplants that meet U.S. standards. The Chernobyl reactor, which lacked a \ncontainment structure, did not meet U.S. standards.\n  But the future of nuclear energy in the United States is now very \nmuch in question. Since 1973, all nuclear energy plant orders \nhave subsequently been canceled. In 1993, U.S. utilities shut down \nthree nuclear energy plants rather than invest in needed repairs. Of \nthe 110 presently operating U.S. nuclear energy plants, 45 will reach \nthe end of their planned 40-year lifetime in the next two decades.\n\n  Mr. President, this is the wrong time for the Nation, and for the \nworld, for that matter, to ignore nuclear power. Demand for energy will \ngrow. Our options are limited. Ironically, environmentalists who have \nopposed nuclear power since the 1970's should have the strongest \nrationale for promoting nuclear energy. Like all large endeavors, \nnuclear power has its problems and it has its risks. But the problems \nof nuclear power do not look so bad when compared with air pollution, \nglobal warming, and the supply limitations associated with fossil \nfuels. Besides, the major drawbacks of nuclear power from cost to waste \ndisposal are due more to institutional impediments than to \ntechnological difficulties. Considering the growth in energy demand and \nthe risks associated with other energy sources, the benefit-risk ratio \nfor nuclear power is very attractive.\n  We recall that peaceful nuclear power development started slowly in \nthe 1950's. But by the mid to late 1960's, commercial nuclear \npowerplant orders began to take off. And by the 1970's, 30 to 40 \nnuclear plants were being ordered each year. This outlook resulted from \nseveral factors. The first was that electric use was growing at a rate \nof about 7 percent per year, leading to a need for doubling of electric \ncapacity every 10 years.\n  Responding to some very negative public reactions to his company and \nthe company's announcement that it would be starting up a new coal-\nfired plant in 1961, McChesney Martin, chairman of Florida Power and \nLight, promised never to build another coal plant. Shortly thereafter, \nFlorida Power and Light submitted a plan to build a nuclear station in \nthe mid-1960's.\n  Mr. President, the Sierra Club became the major supporter of the \nDiablo Canyon nuclear plant in California. This period of rapid nuclear \nexpansion and environmental support of nuclear power ended in 1973 \nafter the Arab oil embargo and the boycott. As a consequence of that, \nthe rate of growth fell dramatically. As the years went by and the \ncosts of crude oil continued to increase, we found a change in \nattitude. The surplus of oil distorted the Nation's perspective on \nenergy in general and nuclear energy in particular.\n  A number of environmental organizations, such as Greenpeace and the \nSierra Club, insisted that the Nation should hold out for ideal or \nrisk-free sources, such as energy conservation, solar power, and wind \nenergy. No one suffered from a shortage of electricity as the \nconstruction time for nuclear powerplants expanded a full 6 years--to \n10 or 15 years, or even longer. These extended construction times have \nbeen ascribed to an even more complicated and inefficient regulatory \nsystem, and court delays resulting from suits brought by those opposed \nto nuclear power. In Japan and France, for example, where demand for \nelectric energy continued to grow rapidly, new nuclear energy plants of \nU.S. design are today still being licensed and built in 4 to 6 years.\n  First, I personally would question whether Congress would have \ntolerated the delays if the new electricity were truly needed. One of \nthe results of the delays, however, was that the cost of building a \nnuclear plant in the United States increased dramatically, making \nnuclear power uncompetitive and unattractive to many investors. But \nlet's look at the benefits.\n  Although the rate of growth of electricity use declined after 1973, \ndemand increased, as the economy expanded, to U.S. electric use, \nincreasing 70 percent between 1973 and 1994. Coal generation doubled \nbetween 1973 and 1994, and today coal provides over 50 percent of U.S. \nelectricity. The 74 nuclear energy plants that came on line in this \nperiod increased the nuclear share of electric generation from 4 \npercent in 1973 to more than 20 percent today, second only to coal.\n  The other sources, for the benefit of the Members, are natural gas at \n4 percent, hydropower at 9 percent, wood, wind, and solar 3 percent, \nand oil 3 percent.\n  The added nuclear capacity allowed for the shutdown of oil-fired \nplants and permitted the utilities to reduce oil imports by some 100 \nmillion barrels per year. The substitution of nuclear or fossil fuel \nplants has reduced the present CO2 atmospheric emissions by \n140 million metric tons of carbon per year--roughly 10 percent of the \ntotal U.S. CO2 production. Nevertheless, the United States \nstill needs to reduce carbon production by an additional 10 percent to \nreach its goal of returning to the 1990 production level. In addition, \nreplacement of fossil fuel plants with nuclear power has reduced nitric \noxide emissions to the air by over 2 million tons annually, meeting the \ngoal set by the Clean Air Act for the year 2000, and has reduced sulfur \ndioxide emissions by almost 5 million tons per year, half the goal for \nthe year 2000.\n\n  The dilemma that we are in is a real one, because we are not able to \nstore our waste that has accumulated as a consequence of our nuclear \npowerplants. As a consequence of that, we have not been able to move \nfrom a temporary storage to a safe, permanent storage. We have the \ntemporary storage in the areas, in the pools, next to our reactors. \nBut, as a consequence of that, we seem to face the situation where \nenvironmental Neros fiddle while Rome burns. The current generation of \nU.S. nuclear powerplants has performed remarkably well and an even \nbetter generation of new designs is ready. General Electric, in a \npartnership with Hitachi and Toshiba, has developed the advanced \nboiling water reactor. Construction of this reactor began in Japan in \n1991, and the plant is already operating at full power. The ability to \nbuild and begin operation of a new design in less than 5 years is a \ntestament to the quality of the firms that stand behind this.\n  Experience with the U.S. licensing and court review procedures \nsuggest that today it can take 2 to 4 times as long to construct a \nnuclear plant in the United States as it does abroad, with the \nexorbitant cost increases.\n  Mr. President, this brings me to the point in the debate where I \nthink it is appropriate to reflect on history. I am referring to an \narticle that appeared in Scientific American in July 1976.\n  Mr. President, let me just read an excerpt from that particular \narticle, because I think it reflects on something that has been \noverlooked. That is the natural element of nuclear fission as we know \nit today.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will my friend yield for a unanimous-consent \nrequest that will just take a second? I just want to get staff in here, \nis all.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Sure.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Bob Perret, a \nprofessional fellow, be granted the privilege of the floor during the \npendency of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think it will be of interest for my \ncolleagues to note that a high level radioactive waste experiment \noccurred some 1.8 million years ago in west Africa, in what is now the \nnation of Gabon, at a place called Oklo. The French were prospecting in \ntheir former colony for uranium for their developing nuclear program. \nSome 2 billion years ago, all the uranium on Earth contained some 3 to \n4 percent uranium 235, and the rest is the normal level of uranium 238. \nBut, because of natural radiation decay, all U-238 today contains only \nabout 0.7 percent of U-235. U-235 is fissionable, and at about 3 \npercent enrichment can sustain a chain reaction. That means it can \nundergo fission. That is just what happened to the uranium in Oklo, \napproximately 1.8 million years ago. Some water seeped into the vein \nand began a slow chain reaction which continued for some several \nhundred thousand years, generating some 10 tons of radioactive waste, \nincluding almost a\n\n[[Page S2768]]\n\nton of plutonium. The reactor became dormant and scientists have now \nmeasured all the minerals at that site and they have shown that all the \nplutonium created at the site has decayed and that all the original \nradiation decay products of fission were recovered, close to the \noriginal natural fission reactor. This, altogether, released only a few \nfeet from the surface.\n  It is interesting to note the plutonium did not migrate away, even \nthough there were no engineered barriers to prevent transport of the \nwaste product. This natural experiment shows that it is difficult, if \nnot impossible, for such waste to enter the biosphere. It clearly \ndemonstrates that geological repositories can successfully isolate \nradioactive waste from the biosphere. There is nothing unique about the \ngeology of Oklo. That occurred, as I have indicated, some 1.8 million \nyears ago.\n\n  As we enter the debate on a comprehensive plan for the Federal \nGovernment to meet its obligation to provide a safe place to store \nspent nuclear waste and nuclear fuel, I think it is important to refer \nto the historical natural occurrence that took place in Africa some 1.8 \nmillion years ago because it represents a phenomenon, if you will, that \nshows, indeed, a natural experimentation that resulted in no \nunfavorable outfall associated with the process.\n  Getting back to where we are today, our Government entered into a \ncontractual commitment to take the waste generated from our nuclear \npowerplants and provide a safe storage and disposition of that waste. \nThat was some years ago. That contract is now due, for the Government \nto initiate performance, in 1998. As a consequence of the recognition \nof the inability of the Government to take that waste, on March 13 my \ncommittee on Energy and Natural Resources reported Senate bill S. 104 \non a bipartisan vote of 15 to 5.\n  As you will recall, last year a similar bill passed the Senate by a \nbipartisan vote of 63 to 37. The bill would provide one safe, central, \ntemporary storage site at the Nevada test site or, if the Nevada test \nsite is found to be inadequate, another chosen by the President. At the \nsame time, S. 104 reaffirms our Nation's commitment to development of a \npermanent repository for nuclear waste. Why the Nevada site? We have \nbeen conducting nuclear detonations related to the weapons testing \nprogram in the Nevada desert for some 50 years. One can fairly conclude \nthat the area has radioactivity. The area has been, time and time \nagain, subject to underground explosions of various types. The area is \nwell established with an adequate security capability and an \nexperienced work force.\n  Furthermore, when we get right down to this issue, we have to come to \nthe conclusion that nobody wants the waste--not one of the 50 States. \nBut clearly the experience in Nevada at the test site suggests that it \nis the best site that has been examined so far, and as a consequence we \nare committed to proceed with the effort to establish a permanent \nrepository there.\n  What S. 104 further attempts to do is to reaffirm our Nation's \ncommitment to development of a permanent repository for nuclear waste, \nwhich is our ongoing objective. Over the past several weeks I have \nworked with many of my colleagues, notably Senator Bingaman from New \nMexico, to address concerns that he has with the bill and other \nconcerns. As a result of these discussions, I am prepared to offer an \namendment that makes significant changes to S. 104.\n  Let me comment a little further on this bill, because while this bill \nwas resolved with a tremendous amount of work by the staff, what it \nreally is is an effort to meet our obligation to take our nuclear waste \nin a timely manner and reduce the associated liability that is going to \ncome from suits brought to the Federal Government for nonperformance of \nthe contract. If someone has a better idea for this bill, or a better \nproposal to address the problem now, why, this Senator is certainly \nwilling to listen and very likely accommodate it.\n  But let me explain the amendment. The amendment, first of all, \nextends the schedule for siting and licensing an interim facility, \nspecifically siting and licensing an interim facility. This means we \ncan start the process that we have had underway for a long, long time. \nFurther, this allows even more time for the progress at Yucca Mountain \nto be taken into account in siting the interim facility. It would \nprovide that the interim facility will be licensed by existing NRC \nregulations with no exceptions. It shortens the licensing term of the \ninterim facility to 40 years, so it puts a limit on how long it can be \nused, and provides that its capacity will only be that needed to \nfulfill the Government's obligation until a permanent repository is \navailable. And it preempts only State laws that are inconsistent with \nthe provisions of the act. This language is virtually identical to that \nin the Hazardous Waste Materials Transportation Act.\n\n  These changes are significant, but do not harm the ability to reach \nthe ultimate goal. The ultimate goal is safe, central storage; safe, \ncentral storage of our Nation's spent nuclear fuels and waste. High \nlevel nuclear waste and highly radioactive used nuclear fuel is, today, \ncontinuing to pile up. It is piling up in 41 States at some 80 sites, \nand it is stored in areas that are populated; near neighborhoods, areas \nwhere schools are not too far away--you might say in the back yards of \npeople across America. One example that comes to mind is the Palisades \nplant in Michigan, which is within 100 feet of Lake Michigan. Another \nis the Haddam Neck plant in Connecticut. My colleague from that State \nhas observed that he can see the plant from his home.\n  I refer to an editorial from the Hartford Courant that observes, \n``With the closing of the Connecticut Yankee plant at Haddam Neck, the \nissue of what to do with the State's high level nuclear waste has moved \nfrom the theoretical to the here and now. Experts say that Connecticut \nYankee spent fuel could be stored at Haddam Neck for another 30 years, \n``another 30 years, Mr. President'' if Congress fails to approve a \ntemporary facility. Unfortunately, the hands of the clock cannot be \nturned back to a time when nuclear waste didn't exist. In terms of its \ndisposal, a remote desert site in Nevada is simply the lesser of two \nevils.''\n  (Mr. ENZI assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the waste was supposed to have been \ntaken by the Federal Government for safe, central storage by, as I said \nearlier, 1998. Will that happen, Mr. President? The answer is clearly \nno. No, because we have not addressed the problem; we simply put it \noff.\n  Even though this $12 billion collection from American ratepayers to \npay for this storage has gone into the Federal coffers, and even though \na Federal court has reaffirmed that the Government has a legal \nobligation to take the waste by 1998, still, today, there is no plan \nfor action.\n  By 1998, 23 reactors in 14 States are going to be full. What are we \ngoing to do then? Are we going to shift over to some other power? We \nare going to have to do something.\n  By the year 2010, 65 reactors in 29 States will be full. What are we \ngoing to do then?\n  The conservative estimate is that 25 percent of our nuclear plants \nwill not be able to build onsite storage and will be forced to shut \ndown. That would mean the loss of over 5 percent of our Nation's \nelectric generating capacity. When is Yucca Mountain going to be ready \nfor a permanent repository? Not until at least the year 2015. What do \nwe do in the meantime? Simply leave it there? Let the litigation mount \nup for our inability to honor a contractual commitment? How good is a \nGovernment contract if the Government can simply ignore it? Therefore, \nin the mind of this Senator, what this Nation needs and what S. 104 is \nall about is a temporary solution.\n  When S. 104 passed the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, it \npassed with a solid bipartisan vote of 15 to 5. Almost half of the \nmembers and all majority members voted in favor of the bill. Americans \nhave waited too long for a solution to this environmental and public \nsafety challenge, and there is absolutely no purpose to be served by \nwaiting any longer.\n  I am, of course, sensitive to the concerns of my colleagues from \nNevada, but this is a legacy of our generation, and we have an \nobligation to address that legacy. To put it off to somebody else's \nwatch, another Presidential administration, simply puts off a \nresponsibility and an obligation that we have.\n\n[[Page S2769]]\n\n We have an obligation to act, and to act in a timely manner, because \nwe are going to be in breach of our contract next year. So there is a \ncritical need to construct a safe, central storage facility to \neliminate the growing threat to the environment and to the American \npeople.\n  As I said earlier, I worked with Members on both sides of the aisle \nto attempt to solve the problems that they have with this bill. In the \nmarkup, we accepted several amendments from the Democratic side, and I \nam ready to work with other Senators on amendments they may have to \nimprove the bill, because our goal is a responsible one. It is safe, \ncentral storage as soon as reasonably possible after 1998. We have \noffered, time and time again, to work with the new Secretary of Energy, \nSecretary Pena, and the staff at the Energy Department. During his \nconfirmation, we pressed the White House to ensure that the Secretary \nhas the portfolio to respond to this pressing problem, and they \nindicated that he did have that portfolio.\n  Over the recess, the committee staff has worked on a proposed \ncompromise. Senator Bingaman's staff has been very constructive in this \nregard. Much of what Senator Bingaman has proposed appears acceptable. \nHowever, the bottom line is the need for a predictable path, with \ncertainty, to interim and permanent waste storage. We simply cannot \nleave trap doors that allow central storage to be delayed for decades.\n  I want to refer to a chart to identify just what we are talking about \nrelative to spent fuel and radioactive waste that is destined for \ngeologic disposal. This chart on my right shows the United States, and \nfor some reason or another they left Hawaii and Alaska off, but that is \nnot uncommon around here. The brown areas show commercial reactors, and \nthey are primarily in the Midwest--Illinois, Minnesota--and on the \neastern seaboard. Those are some 80 sites where we are generating \nnuclear power at the present time.\n\n  One of the things we have to keep in mind is, unless we find a way to \ntake care of this waste--we are still going to have reactors, some of \nwhich have already shut down and have spent fuel in onsite storage--we \nwill simply be storing spent fuel in shutdown reactors. Currently, we \nhave, designated by the blue little pyramids, a number of shutdown \nreactors in Oregon, California, and a few in the Midwest.\n  The next little block we have are the commercial spent nuclear fuel \nstorage facilities. We have fewer of those. We have a couple of them in \nthe Midwest. We have non-Department of Energy research reactors \nscattered all throughout the country, in blue. We have naval reactor \nfuel in Idaho, Washington, New Mexico, Georgia, and we have the \nDepartment of Energy spent fuel and high-level radioactive waste. I \ncould go on and on with a description of this chart.\n  One can quickly recognize that we have nuclear waste all over the \ncountry, and I am sure those in opposition to this bill will suggest \nthat the best thing we can do is simply leave it there. I do not know, \nMr. President, if that makes sense to you. It does not to me. Do we \nwant this scattered all over the country when it simply makes sense to \nput it in one area where we have had testing for some 50 years, where \nwe have an experienced work force, a security capability and the \nknowledge that we are proceeding with a permanent repository in that \narea of Yucca Mountain in Nevada?\n  The fact is, as we proceed with Yucca Mountain in Nevada and the \nrealization that might be completed by the year 2015, or thereabouts, \nthe question is, why not move it, move it now, transport it now to a \ninterim repository adjacent to the permanent site?\n  Then one might say, ``What happens if the permanent site does not \nbecome suitable?'' Let me tell you a couple things about that permanent \nsite, Mr. President. We have expended some $6 billion so far. It is \nestimated to cost some $30 billion by the time it is completed. So we \nare well on our way, assuming it is licensable and assuming that it \nreceives the certification necessary.\n  So you are going to hear the argument, if you move it out there and \nit is not suitable, then what are you going to do? Then you obviously \nare going to have to find someplace else to take it, and that is not \ngoing to be easy. By the same token, it has to go somewhere. There are \n48 States on that map. It has to go somewhere.\n  We have another chart that I want to bring up which shows what S. 104 \nis all about. If we look over at the lower left-hand corner, we find \nthat in 1998, if we accept the status quo, we have 81 sites in 40 \nStates. If we look over at the red arrow and find that Yucca Mountain \nis viable for a permanent repository, then we have achieved our \nobjective, we have one safe, central storage site.\n  What are we going to do if Yucca Mountain is not viable for a \npermanent repository? We are going to address our obligation. We are \ngoing to take that blue arrow right up to the top, and if Yucca \nMountain is not a viable site for a permanent repository, then it \nrequires the President to pick an alternate site. If the President \nrefuses, we are not going to let the President off the hook. The \nPresident still has an obligation. If the President does not select an \nalternate site, the site defaults back to the Nevada test site. If the \nPresident picks an alternate site and Congress ratifies the site, then \nwe have one safe, central storage site.\n  The point of this chart is to show where we are trying to go with \nthis bill, which is to address our responsibility and resolve this \nsituation. This Senator, the chairman of this committee, is not going \nto accept amendments that penetrate the objective of this legislation, \nwhich is to address it and resolve it and do it now. So we have \nalternatives framed in this debate.\n  The alternatives are a little more complicated, but we have the \nstatus quo, 81 sites in 40 States. That is a given. The red line says \nYucca Mountain is viable for a permanent repository. If that is fine, \nwe have one safe, central storage site. If the license application for \nYucca Mountain is not filed, then we go back, if you will, and take the \nblue line--Yucca Mountain is not viable for a permanent repository--the \nSecretary picks an alternative storage site. If no site is chosen, it \ngoes back to one central storage site.\n\n  So what we have attempted to do here is address concerns of Members \nand still get the job done, because if we do not get the job done, we \nare going to waste several hours in debate and find ourselves not \naddressing the obligation we have to take this waste under the \ncontractual commitment that we have.\n  I am willing to be flexible in the shape of either one of these \nboxes, but the result must always be the same. We now have an \nopportunity for bipartisan action, and I think that we must seize that \nopportunity. I know that my friends from Nevada will object to the \nbill. They consider it probably a political necessity to oppose it. I \ncan understand that. If it were not for Nevada, I am sure it might be \nVermont where they have a lot of marble, or it might be Montana, where \nthey have a lot of rock. The point is it has to go somewhere.\n  There are going to be allegations that there is some bad science \nhere. There are going to be efforts to try to scare us with references \nto ``mobile Chernobyl.'' That is an irresponsible statement, Mr. \nPresident. Everybody who has looked at Chernobyl knows it was not poor \nreactor design and human error that resulted in the accident. There was \nno containment building. The design was flawed, and not to United \nStates or western standards. The technicians bypassed the safety \nsystems, the reactor went critical, and we had a terrible accident.\n  But to suggest that our bill is mobile Chernobyl is just simply \nirresponsible. What we are trying to do is accept an obligation, a \nlegacy of our generation, and that is to properly dispose of this \nwaste, and properly disposing of it does not suggest leaving it where \nit is. Those nuclear reactors and those pools that are being filled now \nwere not designed for extended storage. They are reaching their \ncapacity.\n  Many in the environmental community see this as an opportunity to \nshut down a portion of the industry because any additional storage, \nonce the storage is filled, will require additional licensing. Some of \nthat licensing is going to be controlled by States. The States will \nattempt to block it by using various concerns, little of which have any \nscientific foundation. But nevertheless, they see this as a way to \nsubstantially reduce the contribution of nuclear energy to generate \npower in this country.\n\n[[Page S2770]]\n\n  Some will imply if this bill does not pass, nuclear waste will not be \ntransported through this country. Well, let us take a little look at \nthat.\n  I have another chart here, because if one looks at the record, there \nhave been 2,500 shipments of used fuel across this country in the last \n20 years. It is just not history, Mr. President, it is happening today. \nThe Department of Energy is transporting spent fuel from nuclear \nreactors all over the world into the United States virtually as we \nspeak, by truck, by train, by barge, by boat.\n  If you do not hear about this from the other side, there is probably \na reason. And that reason is because these shipments have been and \ncontinue to be completely uneventful. They are shipped in casks that \nhave been designed to address the emergencies forecast. In short, these \nspent fuel shipments, history shows, are safe. As a consequence, Mr. \nPresident, they are not news anymore.\n  At our hearing in February, all four members of the Nevada delegation \nacknowledged there was no process and no level of scientific proof that \nwould decrease their opposition. I understand that, Mr. President. I \nappreciate that. I know where they are coming from. They are coming \nfrom the reality that regardless of what State we are talking about, \nthere would be an objection. But we have a responsibility, Mr. \nPresident. The objections are based on politics, not science.\n  One of the Nevada Senators was in favor of sending high-level \nmaterials to the Nevada test site as a State legislator. He voted for \nA.J.R. 15 which was signed by the Nevada Governor in May 1975, which \nasked, in my opinion, the Federal Government to simply do just that. I \nthink he was right the first time. It is safer, smarter, and cheaper to \ncontain these materials at one location in the remote Nevada desert.\n  The Nevada test site was used, as stated, for decades to explore \ntesting of nuclear bombs and it helped win the cold war. And now it can \nhelp us win the war on radioactive waste disposal.\n  High-level nuclear waste, as I have stated time and time again, Mr. \nPresident, is our legacy, and it is our obligation to dispose of it. It \nis irresponsible to let this situation continue. It is unsafe to let \ndangerous radioactive materials pile up. Pile up where, Mr. President? \nBack in the 80 sites in 41 States. It is unwise to block safe storage \nin a remote area when the alternative is to simply leave it in the 41 \nStates.\n  Mr. President, this is a national problem. It requires a national \nsolution. We need to pass Senate bill 104.\n  I should comment briefly on the administration's attitude toward \nnuclear waste storage because it has been a rather interesting one. \nThey have been content to simply ignore the problem as though they did \nnot have one, as though there was no obligation to take the waste, and \nsimply disregard the Government's contractual obligations. The American \npeople, I think, deserve better.\n  Safe nuclear storage should not be a political issue. It is a \nscientific and legitimately environmental issue. We need a solution \nnow. And why I do not know, but the administration has again turned a \nblind eye and a deaf ear.\n  In addition to threats in the environment and safety, 22 percent of \nour electric capacity is at risk now by not taking decisive action on \nwhat to do with the waste generated by our nuclear powerplants.\n  Mr. President, starting in January 1998, taxpayers throughout the \nNation, whether you use nuclear power or not, are going to be subjected \nto claims of billions of dollars in liability payments because our \nGovernment has not met its obligation to take that waste.\n\n  There is a contractual commitment outstanding, Mr. President. The \nestimate of taxpayers' liability under a recent lawsuit blocked by \nStates are estimated to run as high as $80 billion. How much is that \nper family, Mr. President? That is about $1,300 per family. You may \nsay, what do you mean? Why are we subjected to liability if the \nGovernment does not take the waste?\n  There was a contractual commitment, Mr. President, to take the waste \nbeginning in 1998. The Government is not going to be able to take that \nwaste, so there are going to be claims filed and there is going to be \ninterest accrued. If they have to relocate it or expand facilities, \nthere are additional costs. The last estimate I saw was about $59.9 \nbillion. The estimate, as I indicated, could run as high as $80 \nbillion.\n  The cost of storage of spent nuclear fuel: That is about $19 to $20 \nbillion. Return of nuclear waste fees: About $8.5 billion. Interest on \nnuclear waste fees: $15 to $27 billion. Of course, depending on the \ninterest rate used. Remember the interest rate in December 1980? The \nprime rate was 20.5 percent. A lot of people have forgotten that, Mr. \nPresident. Consequential damages for shutdown of 25 percent of the \nnuclear plants due to insufficient storage, power replacement costs: \nSome $24 billion. I do not know what it is, but it is going to be full \nemployment for all the lawyers certainly.\n  Inaction is not an option. Inaction is simply irresponsible. That is \nwhy we have attempted to craft this legislation to address a reality \nthat we are not going to be able to take the waste in a permanent \nrepository until the year 2015. So this allows a temporary action to \nmove the waste out so it is retrievable for disposition when a \npermanent repository is constructed.\n  Mr. President, many of the opponents' claims, I think, have little \nfoundation. If we look back, interim storage at the Nevada test site \nwill not delay construction at Yucca Mountain. The type of construction \nwe anticipate would be a concrete pad with a cask designed to hold the \nwaste until a permanent repository is at hand. There will be a \nviability assessment that will occur before the interim site is built. \nThe President will have a choice of interim sites after the viability \nassessment.\n  This Nation faces a major decision, Mr. President: Either continue \nstoring high-level radioactive waste materials at these 80 locations in \n41 States indefinitely, for the next administration, for the next \nCongress, or the next Congress, and pay the claims and subject the \ntaxpayers to more litigation, or more safely contain them in one \ncentralized facility.\n  I am indeed sorry that facility has to be in one State, but it simply \nhas to be. So the option is clear and safer. It is safer and cheaper. \nAnd the time for action is now.\n  Mr. President, I would like to refer to another chart relative to a \nmisnomer that has been brought up time and time again. And it is a \nlegitimate concern but it escapes a reality, and that is the issue of \ntransportation.\n  There has been 2,500 shipments of used nuclear fuel over the past 20 \nyears. There has been no fatality, no injury, or no recorded \nenvironmental damage that has ever occurred because of radioactive \ncargo. I have a map here behind me that shows the routes for \ntransferring used fuel. And this took place from 1979 to 1995, the \nroutes used for 2,400 shipments.\n  They cover from Washington down through Oregon, close to California, \nMontana, Idaho, Salt Lake, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, \nWyoming, North Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, up and down \nthe entire east coast seaboard, Minneapolis, and Milwaukee. I could go \non and on but, Mr. President, I am sure that you will agree it is a \npretty impressive transportation route. The map shows roads, rail \nlines.\n  Some would say that they did not know these shipments took place. \nMaybe that is why they have become uneventful. There has been an \naccident with a truck carrying a cask, but the cask that contained the \nnuclear materials performed as designed. They have not broken open. \nThey were designed for an accident of that nature.\n\n  We currently have about 30,000 metric tons of spent fuel in the \nUnited States. The French alone have shipped that amount of spent fuel \nall over Europe, all over the world. The Japanese are moving spent fuel \nfrom Japan to France for reprocessing until they build their own \nreprocessing plant.\n  This is not history, Mr. President. This is happening today all over \nour country and all over the world. There seems to be somewhat of a \ndouble standard why the Department of Energy claims it cannot possibly \nfulfill its obligation to the U.S. electric ratepayers and the \nobligation to take spent nuclear fuel. The Department of Energy is \ndoing exactly that for foreign countries.\n\n[[Page S2771]]\n\n  Let me show you another map. Here are foreign research reactors \nthroughout the world--Canada, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, \nAustralia.\n  They may ask why American taxpayers are paying for the Department of \nEnergy to transport, store nuclear waste from foreign countries while \nAmerican ratepayers are subjected to a Government that refuses to honor \nits contractual commitments, refuses to take the waste.\n  All the countries in color ship fuel to the United States for storage \nat the Department of Energy facilities. It seems to be a mystery. There \nare a lot of mysteries around here. If they support taking fuel waste \nfrom overseas, then you wonder if the issue of safety is really an \nissue.\n  How can it be safe for the Department of Energy to ship spent fuel \nhalfway across the world but not across some of our States? Well, let \nus take a little closer look because this is going to be the crux of a \nlot of the arguments. Let us look at what the Department of Energy does \nto transport nuclear waste across the United States.\n  This map, Mr. President, shows America's research reactors. They are \nall over the place--all the red lines. Idaho National Engineering Lab \nin Idaho; University of Missouri, Missouri; University of Missouri, \nColumbia; Iowa State University; Purdue University; the University of \nMichigan; Ohio State University; Massachusetts, MIT; University of \nLowell, Maine; Rhode Island Nuclear Science Center; Brookhaven National \nLabs; University of Virginia; University of Florida; Georgia Institute \nof Technology; Oak Ridge; Sandia National Laboratory; Los Alamos, and \non and on and on, Mr. President. They are scattered all across the \ncountry. They move all over the country.\n\n  What we have here is a double standard. Why does the Department of \nEnergy pay to transport and store nuclear waste from foreign countries \nbut will not do its duty for U.S. power reactors that have paid for the \nservice? They do it for research reactors. The Department of Energy \nsays they may take foreign fuel to help with nonproliferation. That \nperhaps is all well and good, but spent nuclear fuel is spent nuclear \nfuel wherever it is. If transportation storage is safe for some, why \nshould it not be safe for all?\n  I think this proves my point that I mentioned earlier. The obstacles \nto moving our Nation's spent nuclear fuel are political; they are not \ntechnical. Senate bill 104 provides the authority to coordinate a \nsystematic, safe transportation network that requires the Department of \nEnergy to use NRC-certified transportation containers to transport fuel \nalong special routes. That transportation cannot occur until the \nDepartment of Energy has provided specific technical assistance to \nfunding, to States, and to Indian tribes for emergency response \nplanning across the transportation routes. The language builds on what \nis already a set system for spent fuel in the country.\n  It is further interesting to note with this volume of traffic, some \n2,400 shipments, the problem has never been exposure to radiation from \nspent fuel cargo, even in the fuel accidents between 1971 and 1989. The \nDepartment of Transportation tells us that only seven accidents \noccurred involving trucks carrying nuclear waste. There was no \nradioactivity released in any of these accidents. Why? Because \ntransportation containers were designed to maintain their integrity. At \none time they were designing transportation casks, and the objective \nwas to have it so they would withstand a free fall from 40,000 feet, \nassuming there was an accident, and they were anticipating moving it by \nairplane, and the engineers claimed they could do that.\n  Mr. President, we will have an extended debate on this issue in the \ncoming days. As a manager of the bill, I will be sharing time with my \ncolleagues on various statements, accommodating amendments and pursuing \nthe debate with my colleagues from the other side. I think it is \nimportant as we reflect on reality that there is no excuse for \ncontinuing to delay this obligation any further.\n  I have gone over the liability of the taxpayers. I have gone over the \ntransportation that is in existence where we have moved nuclear waste \naround this country safely. And to suggest that we are somehow going to \ngain some significant benefit by putting off the decision is not \nsupported by any logic or rationalization that would convince this \nSenator that there is any other action than moving forward on Senate \nbill 104, accommodating Members' amendments, with the idea of getting \nthe job done.\n  Getting the job done now is a responsibility for all of us for the \nfuture of nuclear energy in this country and the world. We simply \ncannot move forward in this regard, we cannot address our concerns over \ngreenhouse gasses, which are increasing, without looking toward relief. \nNuclear energy offers us that relief. We have the technology. We are \nseeing that technology move over to France and Japan. The bottom line \nis, unless we address the issue of a repository for waste that has been \ngenerated by the nuclear powerplants, we simply are going to be unable \nto meet our responsibility in this body relative to that contractual \ncommitment that we made several years ago. This bill provides a \nresponsible alternative. The time to do it clearly is now.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Nebraska [Mr. \nHagel] and the Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] be added as cosponsors \non Senate bill 104, to amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me say as we begin this debate in this Congress, it reminds me \nthat we are talking about old wine in a new bottle. These arguments \nhave been advanced for decades now, and the prime mover is the nuclear \nutility industry.\n  The fatal flaw in S. 104 is that it is unnecessary, unneeded, and bad \npolicy. That is not just the Senator from Nevada making that statement. \nLet me review for the record some of the statements made by various \nboards and commissions created by the Congress in terms of their \nresponse.\n  We have the 1989 MRS Commission review. The commission report found \nno safety advantage to centralizing the storage of spent fuel. In 1996, \nthe Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board analyzed the issue of interim \nstorage and concluded that there is no urgent technical need for \ncentralized storage of commercial spent fuel--no need, no compelling \nnecessity, no safety advantage to be achieved. That was 1996. Now, the \nNuclear Waste Technical Review Board underwent a change in the \ncomposition of the chairmanship, so in effect there was an opportunity \nfor essentially a new board composed of new members to review whether \nor not they would agree with the position taken by their predecessors \nin 1996. In testimony offered on February 5, 1997, by Dr. Jared L. \nCohen, the chairman of the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, Dr. \nCohen simply reaffirmed the position taken by his predecessors, that \nthere is no need, either for technical or safety reasons, to move spent \nfuel to a centralized storage facility for the next few years. He \nfurther maintains that to maintain the credibility of the site \ncollection process, any decision with respect to interim storage should \nbe deferred until a technologically defensible site-suitability \ndetermination can be made at Yucca Mountain.\n  Mr. President, that is what the scientists, the people who the \nCongress, through a series of legislative enactments, have asked to \ntake a look at that, that is what they say--no need, no safety reasons, \nno compelling necessity, bad policy. That is what the scientific \ncommunity says.\n  I said at the beginning this is old wine in new bottles. Indeed, Mr. \nPresident, it is very, very old wine. The driving policy here is not \nscience; it is the nuclear utilities. It is not a new car. If one looks \nback nearly two decades ago, on July 28, 1980, this issue was before \nthe Congress. This Senator was not a Member of the body at the time, \nbut the Congressional Record reflects debate on a proposed away-from-\nreactor concept, which is akin, if you will, to this interim nuclear \nwaste proposal.\n  At that time, the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Johnston, \naddressed himself to the issue, referring again to this need to move \nthis nuclear waste away from the reactor sites--the same issue, \nidentical to what is being debated today. This is what the Senator from \nLouisiana said nearly 17 years ago: ``Mr. President, this bill\n\n[[Page S2772]]\n\ndeals comprehensively with the problem of civilian nuclear waste. It is \nan urgent problem.'' Sound familiar? Urgent problem. Urgent problem. \n``Mr. President, for this Nation, it is urgent, first, because we are \nrunning out of reactor space at reactors for the storage of the fuel, \nand if we do not build what we call away-from-reactor storage and begin \nthat soon, we could begin shutting down civilian nuclear reactors in \nthis country as soon as 1983.'' That was 14 years ago. Not a single \nnuclear reactor in America has been closed or been forced to close \nbecause of this issue. Some have closed because of overriding safety \nconcerns about their operation and maintenance. That, Mr. President, is \na separate issue.\n  So here again we have the nuclear utility industry sounding the \ndrumbeat, issuing a clarion call, generating hysteria, that indeed \nthere will be brownouts across the country and reactors will have to \nclose unless we pass S. 104, the modern day equivalent to the \nlegislation that was before the Senate of the United States some 17 \nyears ago. The answer today is the same as the answer then. There is no \ncompelling necessity, no need, no rational policy to do so, and no \nsafety issue that makes that a compelling issue.\n  So we come back to a policy that is driven by the nuclear utilities \nand their desire, insatiable as it may be, to move the reactor storage \nfrom site, somewhere, anywhere, but in this particular piece of \nlegislation to a place at the Nevada Test Site or so-called interim \nstorage.\n  I want to take just a few minutes, Mr. President, and we will have an \nopportunity to debate this at some length, as the distinguished \nchairman indicated, but let me review the bill, because it is flawed \nnot only in its premise; it is flawed in its content. I want to talk \nfirst of all about the National Environmental Policy Act. The National \nEnvironmental Policy Act was enacted in 1969, enacted by bipartisan \nactions of this Congress, signed by a Republican President, and it was \ndesigned to do many things. But it was designed, first, to have an \nenvironmental impact addressed before, not after, the decisions are \nmade.\n  Now, what this legislation does--and I must give the nuclear \nutilities credit; their handsomely paid lawyers, legislative advocates, \nhave been skillful, if somewhat deceptive, in terms of what they have \ncrafted here. They say the National Environmental Policy Act, yes, it \nis applicable. But the Secretary--referring to the Secretary of \nEnergy--shall not prepare an environmental impact statement under this \nsection before conducting the activities that are authorized and \ncommanded by the bill. Yes, the act exists, but you may take no action \non it at this earlier phase. And then it goes on to say that the impact \nstatement of the commission, in terms of what it may not address, shall \nnot consider the need for interim storage.\n  Mr. President, this is the total antithesis of the underlying \npredicate of an environmental impact statement. In effect, this ties \none hand behind the back of those who would conduct such an \nenvironmental impact statement and, on the other hand, writes the \nscript as to its conclusion before any study is undertaken.\n  So the first thing they cannot do--Heaven forbid that they should \nexamine the need for interim storage. They can't do that. No, they \ncan't examine the time of the initial availability. They may not, \nHeaven forbid, consider any alternatives to the storage of spent \nnuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste in an interim storage. \nHeaven forbid that they would be able to consider any alternatives to \nthe site of the facility, or any alternatives to the design criteria, \nor the environmental impacts of storage of spent nuclear fuel at a \nhigh-level radioactive waste at the interim storage beyond the initial \nterm of the license.\n  Now, this is very good lawyering, but disastrous public policy, \nbecause the initial application calls for a licensure period of 20 \nyears. But when you look at the fine print, that can be extended for \nanother 100 years and can be renewed for 100 years thereafter. So any \nenvironmental impact evaluation would be limited to the initial term of \nthe license, 20 years. Why is that particularly significant? Mr. \nPresident, what we are dealing with is high-level nuclear waste. It is \ndeadly, not for 20 years, 100 years, or a thousand years, but for more \nthan 10,000 years. The National Academy of Sciences and other \ndistinguished groups that have looked at this have indicated that \nindeed the impacts must be considered, and they must be considered even \nbeyond the 10,000 years, they argue. This would say limit it to the \nfirst period of the initial term of the license, which is 10 years. \nAnd, oh, yes, we don't want to have the courts review what may happen. \nNo, that would certainly be contrary to our tradition, our history, our \nsociety, and our culture to have any kind of a timely judicial review. \nThis limits judicial review only to the time of licensing. So the \nimpacts, such as they may be, must be considered only at the time that \nthe commission makes a decision on licensing. ``No court shall have \njurisdiction''--we are talking about Federal court, not a State court. \n``No court shall have jurisdiction to enjoin the construction or \noperation of the interim storage facility prior to its final decision \non review of the commission's licensing action.''\n  It makes a mockery of the National Environmental Policy Act, an \nabsolute mockery. So indeed, that is the first thing it does that would \ndestroy a carefully framed set of legislative policies enacted by \nMembers of both political parties and a Republican President in 1969.\n  Now, let me also talk for a moment about a preemption section. This \nwas a subject of considerable debate in the last session of Congress \nwhen this virtually identical bill--now, the chairman made some \nreference to this fact--and I have not seen the language--that there \nmay be some changes in this section. But because we don't have them, \nlet me indicate that the bill as processed by the committee, in section \n501, reads as follows: ``If the requirements of any Federal, State, or \nlocal law, including a requirement imposed by regulation, or by any \nother means under such a law, are inconsistent with or duplicative of \nthe requirements of the Atomic Energy Act or of this act''--this \nspecific legislation--``the Secretary shall comply only with the \nrequirements of this act and the Atomic Energy Act.''\n\n  Mr. President, make no mistake as to what that means. That wipes out \nvirtually every environmental law passed in the last 25 years by this \nCongress--clean air, safe drinking water--it wipes them all out. That \nwas the posture of the bill when it was presented and acted upon in the \nlast Congress--preemption. That language remains in the committee \ndraft. If there are changes in that, we will comment at a later time.\n  Let me talk also about the standards. One may agree or disagree that \nnuclear energy is good or bad national policy. That is something that \nis reasonable to debate. But I want to speak specifically here to the \nstandards that are referenced in the act. Now, why are the standards--\nand the distinguished occupant of the chair is very much aware of the \nfact that our States are Western States with vast expanses of land, but \nwe are as concerned about the health and safety of our citizens as \nthose of our urban brethren who live along the eastern seaboard. So let \nus talk about what this legislation does with respect to the standards \nissue.\n  The first thing that it does is it seeks to impose a limitation on \nthe Environmental Protection Agency. Surely, one would agree that if we \nare to have a facility to store nuclear waste, we ought to have a safe \nstandard. Can there be any fundamental disagreement with that? Well, \nthe answer might appear to be yes. But, clearly, the legislative \nwordsmiths who have crafted this piece of legislation, much as they did \nin the last legislative session, have sought to handcuff and limit the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's ability to establish standards. It is \ncleverly done. Give a gold star for that. But here is what it says: \n``Such standards shall be consistent with the overall system \nperformance established by this subsection, unless the Administrator \ndetermines by rule that the overall system performance standard would \nconstitute an unreasonable risk to health and safety.'' Clearly, it \nshifts the burden of proof. It mandates a legislative standard, greatly \ndiminished, unless the Environmental Protection Agency can prove to the \ncontrary, that it would constitute an unreasonable risk to health and \nsafety.\n\n[[Page S2773]]\n\n  Now, why would it be unreasonable to say, look, if you are going to \nestablish this unnecessary, costly and, in my judgment, foolhardy \nventure, at least provide health and safety standards for the people \nwho are going to have to live with that for 10,000 years. It doesn't \nmean that that is unreasonable. It is not narrow or parochial. One \nwould think that every Member of this institution would feel that way. \nBut not here. Let me just say that that has been debated before in the \ncontext of the WIPP facility and with respect to the WIPP facility, the \ntwo able Senators from New Mexico took the floor and, at great length, \nadvocated very effectively that the standard for health and safety \nshould be the toughest standard possible. That occurred in debate in \nthis very Chamber in June 1996. The distinguished senior Senator, Mr. \nDomenici, said, ``What is most important to us and what is most \nimportant to the people of New Mexico is that, as this underground \nfacility * * *''--they were talking about the WIPP facility--``proceeds \nto the point where it may be opened, that it be subject to the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's most strict requirements with \nreference to health and safety. As a matter of fact, they must certify \nit before it can be opened.''\n  I applaud the senior Senator from New Mexico for his concern for his \nconstituents. I agree with him. I hope my colleague from Nevada and I \nwill be provided the same benefit that would be afforded to the New \nMexico Senators, as they expressed it. Mr. Bingaman expressed himself \neloquently to the issue on that same day, the foremost concern that I \nhave. What the junior Senator from New Mexico said is, ``Our concern \nfrom the beginning is whether or not we are adequately protecting the \nhealth and safety of our citizens.''\n  Mr. President, we may not agree on everything in terms of public \npolicy. There is certainly ample room for policy debate on a whole host \nof issues. I acknowledge that. But believe me, it seems to me that we \nought to be able to agree that health and safety is the most important \nthing that we ought to be about.\n\n  I want to return to the subject of additional standards, because what \nthis legislation does is quite manipulative. It limits the ability of \nthose that we have vested with the responsibility of protecting our \nhealth and safety, in my view, in a very, very sinister way. First of \nall, it establishes, by legislative fiat, a 100 millirem standard. We \nare talking about radioactive emission exposure. I freely acknowledge, \nMr. President, that I could not define a millirem with any degree of \nspecificity. But I do know that it is the scientific unit that is \naccepted as the standard by which emissions are to be measured. I \ninvite the attention of the body to the fact that for safe drinking \nwater, it is a four millirem standard. We have other standards that are \nset, such as the WIPP standards, which the distinguished Senators from \nNew Mexico addressed so eloquently last year as they were concerned \nabout the health and safety of New Mexicans, just as Senator Reid and I \nare concerned about the health and safety of Nevadans.\n  Let me suggest--it's perhaps wildly idealistic--shouldn't we all be \nconcerned about the health and safety of Americans? We are one country, \none nation. As I will point out in a minute, this is not just a Nevada \nissue. This affects tens of millions of people who would be affected by \nthe policy implications of this bill. Let me go on and say that if you \nare from the Nordic countries, it is 10 millirems. The upper range \nYucca Mountain study is 30 millirems. I cite this because it is so \nblatant. 100 millirems. That is a standard that is fixed not by \nscience--oh, no, the utility lawyers put that one in there for us to \ncontend with.\n  Now, the National Academy of Sciences is a highly respected body. \nWhat they have indicated would be appropriate is a risk-based standard. \nIt seems reasonable to me. I hasten to emphasize, Mr. President, there \nare no Nevadans that are on the National Academy of Sciences. They were \nnot selected by the Nevada delegation, Nevada's Governor, or the Nevada \nLegislature. They were created by an act of Congress--the National \nAcademy of Sciences. That is what they have recommended. Who is to be \nprotected? This gets a little technical. Under S. 104, the standard of \nprotection is greatly reduced. It is done in almost an arcane \nexpression, but, in effect, a person whose physiology, age, general \nhealth, agricultural practices, eating habits, and social behavior \nrepresent the average for persons living in the vicinity of the site--\nthe ``vicinity of the site''; we do not know what that means--extremes \nin social behavior, eating habits, or other relevant practices or \ncharacteristics, shall not be considered.\n  Has the National Academy of Sciences agreed with that standard? They \nhave not. They believe that it ought to be a critical group, a small, \nrelatively homogeneous group whose location and habits are \nrepresentative of those expected to receive the highest doses. Those \nexpected to receive the highest doses makes sense to me.\n  One of the other provisions in here is the application. In other \nwords, for what period of time must health and safety be considered? We \nare talking about an interim facility that could, under the terms of \nthis legislation, last for thousands and thousands and thousands of \nyears. There is a limitation again because the utilities don't want a \nscientific standard. They want something that they can lobby through \nthe Congress and get what they want.\n  So this legislation tells us that the commission shall issue the \nlicense--referring to the license to operate the interim facility--if \nit feels or finds reasonable assurance that for the first 1,000 years \nfollowing the commencement of the repository operations--1,000 years; \nthe recommendation by the National Academy of Sciences is that the \nrepository should be required to meet a standard during a period of \ngreatest risk and that there is no scientific basis for limiting the \ntime period to 10,000 years, or any other value. I hasten to note that \nthey believe that the standard should be considered even beyond the \n10,000 years.\n  There is another provision in here that again is arcane but \nparticularly significant. That is that the commission is mandated to \nassume no human intrusion--that is to say, in the next 10,000 years--if \nno human intrusion would be possible. The National Academy of Sciences \nconclude that there is no scientific basis for assuming there would be \nno human intrusion.\n\n       The performance of the repository . . . should be assessed \n     using the same analytical methods and assumptions, including \n     those by the biosphere, the critical groups used in the \n     assessment of the performance for the undisturbed case.\n\n  The National Academy of Sciences also recommends another very \nimportant provision. That is, that because these involve important \npolicy issues, opportunities for rulemaking necessitates wide-ranging \ninputs from all interested parties.\n  That simply means giving people an opportunity to be heard, to \nexpress themselves, to offer their own insights, and to allow those \nwith the technical background to offer the technical analyses. That \nshould be a matter of record before a decision. But not S. 104; these \nare set by statute with no public comment period allowed.\n  So, Mr. President, we have something that is fatally flawed because \nit is not needed. It makes no sense. We have something that currently \npreempts the environmental laws of this country, emasculates the \nNational Environmental Policy Act of 1969, and establishes standards \nwhich are arbitrary and not predicated upon science.\n  We will hear, as we have heard in previous debates, that this is all \nabout science, to let science prevail. This legislation makes a mockery \nof the scientific process. It seeks to impose by legislative fiat a \npolicy and a parameter limitation that is inconsistent with science.\n  So let no one take the floor and argue that this is science that is \nspeaking. This is nuclear utility politics speaking. That is the only \nthing that is being responded to.\n  We have all agreed--the White House, the Congress, Democrats and \nRepublicans--that we are going to balance the budget in the next 5 \nyears. I want to specifically reference some of the language as it \nrelates to the funding.\n  The General Accounting Office has indicated in a report that the \ncurrent fiscal condition of the nuclear waste fund will experience a \nshortfall of some $4 to $8 billion. That is to say that under its \ncurrent construction, without the changes that this legislation\n\n[[Page S2774]]\n\nmakes, there would be a shortfall of $4 billion to $8 billion. I think \nmany of my colleagues are aware that the nuclear waste trust fund is \nfunded by a mill tax, a mill tax that is assessed on each kilowatt-hour \nthat is generated. If we are currently underfunded, as the General \nAccounting Office has indicated, let me show you that the real \nsignificance of this legislation from a financial point of view is to \nshield the nuclear utilities from the liabilities that they agreed to \nundertake at the time the Nuclear Waste Policy Act was entered into and \nthe agreements were signed and to shift their responsibility in the \nfinancial sense to the American taxpayer.\n\n  This legislation provides that until the year 2002 the current 1 mill \nper kilowatt-hour will get capped. That is the maximum that can be \ncollected from the utilities. That is a cap, contrary to the existing \nlaw which presents no such cap.\n  In addition, this legislation provides that from the year 2003 the \naggregate amount of fees--I will read the specific language. Although \nit is written in bill-drafting legalese, I think it will be clear to \nall. ``The aggregate amount of fees collected during each fiscal year, \nor thereafter, shall be no greater than the annual level of \nappropriations for expenditures on those activities.''\n  If we put that in the context of what is being spent this year, it \nwould be roughly one-third of the mill, which would be the most that \ncould be assessed.\n  Why is that significant? That is significant because the last reactor \nlicense will expire sometime around the year 2033, and the \nresponsibility for maintaining a repository would go on, in an active \nsense, for at least, say, roughly another 40 years. So that means that \nthat kind of funded liability will be shifted from the nuclear \nutilities to the American taxpayer.\n  I say to my friends--and I was supportive of a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget, and I think that makes sense--that I \nbelieve one of the great legacies this Congress could leave to the \nAmerican people is to get our fiscal house in order, to do some \nresponsible things for the budget, and to reach that balanced budget \ngoal by the year 2002. But, Mr. President, there is no way that you can \ngive the utilities a bailout, a subsidy, if you will, a new corporate \nentitlement, to elevate corporate welfare to a high art form as this \npiece of legislation does. It caps their liability and says we will \ntake care of the rest contrary to existing law. Existing law does not \ncontemplate that that be true.\n  Moreover, this legislation, S. 104, contemplates that that would be \nan interim storage. That would still fund the site characterization and \nthe study activities of the permanent repository. But the estimate for \nfunding interim storage, as this bill constitutes--and that comes from \nthe Congressional Budget Office--in the first 5 years is $2.3 billion. \nIf you add that to the cost of what we are currently expending, an \namount of about $380 million a year--that is the total we are spending \nright now--in the next couple of years you are going to have to have $1 \nbillion by the fiscal year 1999--that is $1 billion--to fund the \ncurrent operation of an interim storage facility and the high-level \nnuclear waste repository proposed at Yucca Mountain.\n  It is pretty clear what this is all about. This is an interim \nstorage. This is a thinly disguised attempt to establish a permanent \nhigh-level dump without any of the safeguards that are provided in the \ncurrent legislation form for a permanent repository.\n  Mr. President, my colleague from Nevada has joined me. If I might \ninquire of him, I know that he might care to speak extensively on the \ntransportation issue. I am prepared to do so if he cares to address \nanother aspect of that. But I will invite his response.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Nevada that I appreciate that. I \nhave a few things to say. But I will not speak at length about the \ntransportation aspect. If my friend would allow me to speak for a few \nminutes at a time which he feels appropriate.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I yield to the senior Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the senior Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we need to understand what this debate is \nall about, and that is how powerful the nuclear lobby is. We \nacknowledge that it is pretty strong. They have gotten more out of a \nworthless piece of legislation than I could ever imagine. They \ncontinually are allowed to bring this up and continually talk about it.\n  Mr. President, my friend, the junior Senator from Alaska, said that \nnuclear waste is all over, that we need to put it in one spot. Nuclear \nwaste is all over, and it will stay all over for years to come no \nmatter what happens with this legislation; no matter what happens with \nthe legislation as it relates to the permanent repository, where my \nfriend is absolutely wrong. Nuclear waste is not in some States. \nCommercial nuclear waste is not in Nevada. We don't manufacture nuclear \nwaste. It is not in the Dakotas. It is not in Montana and a number of \nother States. So the statement was a little wrong.\n  Mr. President, this legislation, I repeat, is being driven by the \nnuclear lobby. As shown in the chart that the junior Senator from \nAlaska had, there are a number of nuclear generating plants around the \ncountry; a little over 100 generating facilities. The average lifespan \nof those facilities is about 15 years. Some will last 25 years. Some \nwill be out of business in 5 years.\n  The point is that nuclear waste manufactured by power companies \ngenerating electricity is in our lifetime going to be a thing of the \npast. It is not going to happen in the future. Generating electricity \nby nuclear power is no longer going to happen. It has been determined \nthat the environmental concerns are too much and the American public \nsimply won't stand for another nuclear power facility being built in \nthis country at any time.\n  The powerful nuclear lobby recognizes that they are going to be out \nof the business of generating electricity by nuclear power. So they \nwant to wash their hands of the mess they have created and shift the \nresponsibility to the Federal Government now. They don't want to wait, \nas the law now indicates, until someday a permanent repository is \nconstructed. They want to short-circuit the system. They want to change \nthe law, which now says you can't have a permanent repository and a \ntemporary repository in the same State. They want to eliminate that. \nThey want to also do an end run around all environmental law.\n  Mr. President, my friend, the junior Senator from Alaska, said that \nthey were working on amendments with the junior Senator from New \nMexico. Well, I would just alert everyone. Be very careful about the \namendments because, as we learned last year, amendments in name are not \namendments in fact. The fact is that they cannot make changes in this \nlegislation to any standard that will allow them to go forward with \nthis legislation. They are talking about changes in this legislation by \namendments just like they did last year. But when the facts come down, \nyou will find that their amendments mean virtually nothing. You had \nbetter read the amendments very carefully.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important to note that from 1982 to \ntoday, the scientific community has been working on methods of \ntransportation, as indicated on the chart that my friend, the Senator \nfrom Nevada had, showing the transportation routes around the country--\nthey, the scientists, have been working on a way to transport nuclear \nwaste. They have been working on it, now, for 15-plus years. \nInterestingly enough, they have not found a way to safely transport \nnuclear waste. The best they have been able to come up with is \nsomething called a dry-cask storage container, which is a canister, and \nin it would be placed spent fuel assemblies.\n  What they have come up with to this point is a dry-cask storage \ncontainer that is safe unless it is immersed in a fire that burns at \nmore than 1,400 degrees. Diesel fuel burns at 1,800 degrees. So these \ndry-cask storage containers are not safe because, of course, fires that \nare going to occur on a train or a truck are going to be of diesel \nfuel. These casks cannot withstand the intense heat of a diesel fire.\n  Second, the dry-cask storage containers have been made safe only to \ntransport nuclear waste if an accident occurs at less than 30 miles an \nhour. Trains and trucks in this modern day and age rarely travel less \nthan 30 miles\n\n[[Page S2775]]\n\nan hour. So a dry-cask storage container is basically worthless for \ntransporting nuclear waste around this country. Remember, most of the \nnuclear waste is produced in the eastern and southern parts of the \nUnited States. It would have to be hauled, sometimes, more than 3,000 \nmiles to an interim site at the Nevada test site. You cannot carry it \nsafely because the dry-cask storage containment does not allow it; \nbecause accidents occur at more than 30 miles an hour and fires occur \nat more than 1,400 degrees. In effect, that is why a number of \nentities, including entities in the State of Colorado, have said we \nwant no part of nuclear waste. And that is why the senior Senator from \nColorado has spoken out in committee on our behalf, saying interim \nstorage is not important and not necessary at this stage.\n  Yucca Mountain is being evaluated--it will be determined if that is a \nsite that can safely store nuclear waste for up to 10,000 years--\nremember, they are digging a hole inside that mountain. The cavern they \nare digging is more than 25 feet in diameter. It is a huge hole. You \ncan take a train through it easily. But I think it is interesting, and \nthat the taxpayers should know, that hole, piercing that mountain, is \ncosting $60,000 a foot. The cost now is approaching $2 billion. What \nthis legislation would do is say we will forget about that, the \nbillions of dollars spent there. We want to short circuit the system, \npour a big cement pad out there and dump the waste on top of the \nground.\n  Anyone who thinks that is temporary is temporarily insane. The \npurpose of that is to store it permanently at the so-called interim \nsite.\n  My friend, the junior Senator from Alaska said, and I was surprised \nto hear him say this, it is so absolutely true--he said this \nlegislation is little about science and a lot about politics. I could \nnot say it better myself. I agree with the junior Senator from Alaska. \nThis legislation deals totally with politics, nuclear politics. The \npowerful nuclear lobby is driving this legislation. They want to wash \ntheir hands of this. It appears that we are about to repeat last year's \nwasteful mistake. They tried all last year to get S. 1936 passed. What \nwas learned at that time was that the President was going to veto that. \nWe had enough votes at that time to sustain the President's veto. We \nstill have the same votes. Everyone knows that. This is a gesture in \nnuclear politics, to show the nuclear power lobby: ``We are doing \neverything we can to satisfy you. Please, accept our offering, that is \nthe taxpayers' time, energy and money, in this Senate Chamber. Do not \nbe upset with us, utilities. We are doing the best we can, even though \nwe all recognize this legislation is going down to defeat.''\n  Nothing has changed from last year that would make S. 104 any more \nattractive than S. 1936 was at the conclusion of the 104th Congress. In \nfact, we have another year of progress toward understanding the \nsuitability of Yucca Mountain. Hundreds of millions of dollars have \nbeen spent in this past year in Nevada, characterizing Yucca Mountain. \nI have been there within the past 2 months. I took a ride through that \nhuge hole that is being dug. They are trying--in fact, within weeks \nthey should be able to cut through the side of the mountain a tunnel 5 \nmiles long, $60,000 dollars, and after they do that they will start \nrunning shafts, adits and cross-cuts and drifts from that, for purposes \nof determining the suitability of this site.\n\n  We need to find out if Yucca Mountain is suitable. The interim \nstorage would vitiate all the time, energy, effort and money spent on \nthat facility. The President and this administration remain committed \nto the present law that prohibits siting an interim storage facility at \na site undergoing evaluation for permanent disposal of nuclear fuel or \nother high-level nuclear waste. This commitment is not political \nposturing, it is good government. And mostly, good science. It is only \nproper and responsible, given the importance and difficulty of managing \nthe most dangerous substance known to man, plutonium and nuclear waste \nin general.\n  As I have indicated, this Nation has already spent billions of \ndollars--I said $2 billion, it is approaching $3 billion--on the Yucca \nMountain evaluation. We have dug a very large tunnel through the \nmountain, as I have indicated. It is huge. It is more than 2 stories \nhigh. It is not easy or cheap to do these things, because something \nlike this has never been done before. Yet the proponents of this \nlegislation are saying we want to do it the easy way. We want to do it \nthe cheap way. We want to pour a cement pad out in the middle of the \ndesert and dump this stuff on top of the ground. That's it.\n  We all know, no matter what verbiage the junior Senator from Alaska \nuses--``we are going to limit the time to 40 years''--it doesn't matter \nif you limit the time to 20 years or 80 years, this interim site will \nbe the permanent site. That is why they want to change the law to say \nyou can have a permanent repository and a temporary repository in the \nsame place.\n  Time is what the proponents of S. 104 would take away from the \nscience. The scientists have said we are doing the best we can to make \na scientific determination as to whether geological burial at Yucca \nMountain is appropriate. Much of the money necessary to resolve \ncritical uncertainties would be spent unnecessarily on interim storage \nat Yucca Mountain and the money spent on the permanent repository would \nbe wasted, totally wasted.\n  We have heard talk here, by everyone, last year and this year, about \nthe Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board. They are a group of \nscientists chosen because they are scientists, first of all. The \nchairman of the board is a dean from Yale University. I do not think we \ncan quibble with his qualifications. But his expertise is only one of \nthe qualifications these scientists have. These are some of the most \nbrilliant scientists in the world, on the Nuclear Waste Technical \nReview Board.\n  They have told us a number of things. No. 1, what they told us is \n``Don't have an interim storage site.'' They have also said that:\n\n       The civilian radioactive waste management program will have \n     to sustain the support of the general public and the \n     scientific and technical community for generations. Such \n     support may be more difficult to maintain if the \n     determination of site suitability, perhaps the most critical \n     step in the entire process of developing a repository, is not \n     viewed as a technically objective evaluation by a very broad \n     segment of the population.\n\n  The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board opposes this S. 104. It is \nwrong. And for the reason, among others that I have just read, that it \nis not viewed as technically objective.\n  The board chairman went on to say, at a hearing on S. 104, Professor \nCohen:\n\n       Predicting the performance of a repository for thousands of \n     years involves inherently large uncertainties. The Board \n     believes that scientists and regulators can evaluate those \n     uncertainties. Ultimately, however, the public and its \n     representatives must have confidence that technical \n     analyses count; if the analyses are viewed as facades \n     serving only to justify foregone conclusions, public \n     confidence cannot be achieved.\n       A premature decision to store spent nuclear fuel near the \n     Yucca Mountain site could contribute to the perception that \n     the suitability of the site for development as a repository \n     has been prejudged and that the reviews by scientists and \n     regulators are meaningless.\n\n  I say to my friend, the junior Senator from Nevada, that Nuclear \nWaste Technical Review Board--would you acknowledge that they are some \nof the greatest scientists we have in America today?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. They are. They are not motivated by any political, \ngeographic, sectional, or partisan bias. They are chosen because they \nhave the preeminent qualifications. I believe the senior Senator was \noff the floor when I made the observation, we have had two successive \ntechnical review boards --the one that made its report in 1996, which \nthe Senator will recall was part of our debate. But a new board, \nconstituted under the distinguished chairmanship of the dean, as you \njust referenced, they have looked at the issue and have reached the \nsame conclusion.\n  So, here you have a board of preeminent scientists examining the \nissue in 1996 and they reached the conclusion which you have just \ndeclared, namely that it is unnecessary, there is no advantage to it, \nindeed it is bad public policy. And, now the 1997 board, essentially \nconsisting of new members, but equally eminent and distinguished \nscientists, has reached the same conclusion.\n  Mr. REID. I would also say to my friend, and ask his response to \nthis--\n\n[[Page S2776]]\n\nwould you agree with the board, the technical review board, that one of \nthe most important things to do, as it relates to nuclear waste, is \nhave public confidence?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I think that is absolutely essential. And that is one \nthing that has beleaguered this legislation, dating back to the 1982 \nact.\n  As the Senator from Nevada knows, because of the nuclear utilities' \nconstant driving, pushing, insisting upon unrealistic deadlines, trying \nto shortcut science, this act has faced a considerable series of \nfailures. And, as the board has pointed out from time to time, this is \nnot something that you can rush. Indeed, it is something that needs to \nbe very carefully reviewed. And because there is this constant pressure \nby the nuclear lobby to constrict the timelines, to shorten all of the \nopportunities for public comment, this legislation, and S. 104, would \ncertainly fit within the same category--is not going to enjoy public \nconfidence.\n  Indeed, the very point that the Senator has made on many occasions on \nthe floor is true, that the 1998 timeframe, which has been invoked by \nthe proponents of S. 104 as if it were a date carved in stone, attested \nto by all of the deities, is, in fact, a deadline which the scientific \ncommunity urged not to be placed in the legislation for the very reason \nthe Senator inquired of the junior Senator from Nevada, the timeline \nwas unrealistic.\n  So, now, in effect they are using their argument of 1998 to, in \neffect, bootstrap their argument that 1998 will come and there will be \nno permanent resolution to it, and, therefore, we need this ill-\nconceived proposal that is before us.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend another question. Eminent scientists have \nsaid S. 104 is bad. You agree?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Absolutely true.\n  Mr. REID. Can you think of a single environmental organization in the \nworld--well, let us limit it to the United States. Can you think of a \nsingle environmental organization, for-profit or nonprofit, that \nsupports this legislation?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I cannot, and, in point of fact, every nationally \nrecognized environmental group that I can think of has indicated its \nstrong opposition to this legislation as being unsound environmental \npolicy. I think the point that the Senator from Nevada makes is a good \npoint. Frequently, in what I would refer to most respectfully and \ncharitably as convoluted logic, I have heard S. 104 characterized as an \nimportant piece of environmental legislation. That would give new \nmeaning to environmental legislation. No environmental organization, as \nthe senior Senator points out, supports this legislation and, again, \nfor the basic reason that it is unnecessary and it is bad policy. It \nsimply is not good policy.\n  Mr. REID. If we change our course now, Madam President, there is no \ndoubt in my mind that a permanent repository will never be built and \nall the effort and all the money will just go down the drain as \nmisguided nuclear politics.\n  The work done at Yucca Mountain is an essential part of the program \nthat was promised to guarantee public health and safety at any site \nselected for a permanent repository. This guarantee was done in 1982 by \nChairman Udall and others who were prominent in pushing this \nlegislation through, the 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act.\n  Without their assurance, the Congress would never have supported the \npolicy amendment, would never have supported the underlying legislation \nand the policy amendment that designated Yucca Mountain in 1987 as the \nonly site to be characterized. The arguments then were, ``We'll do such \na grand job of scientific study and evaluation that there will be no \nquestion about Yucca Mountain suitability, reliability; we will never \ncompromise on safety, not where the American public is concerned; we \nwill do everything necessary to identify and resolve any concerns that \nYucca Mountain might not be a suitable repository site; we guarantee \nYucca Mountain will not become a storage site before all concerns have \nbeen satisfied.''\n  Madam President, that was then, and this is now. Then was a time for \npromises that they hope everybody has forgotten. Now is a time for \npolitical expediency and smoothing the ruffled feathers of the powerful \nnuclear power-generating lobby. Now is the time for pushing the waste \ninto Nevada before anything is ready, even without a repository site, \neven though the scientific community says no, even though the \nenvironmental community says no. Never mind repository reliability and \npermanent isolation from the environment. If anything happens, it will \nhappen on someone else's watch, in someone else's backyard. That, Madam \nPresident, is bait and switch if I ever saw it. It is a well known, but \nnot a highly respected way of doing business, and it should not be done \nhere.\n  I have talked about the independent reviews by competent Government-\nchartered experts. We have talked about the Nuclear Waste Technical \nReview Board. Here is a direct quote that you will hear from the two \nSenators from Nevada of what the chairman of the Nuclear Waste \nTechnical Review Board said:\n\n       . . . because there are no compelling technical or safety \n     reasons to move spent fuel to a centralized storage facility \n     for the next few years, siting a centralized facility near \n     Yucca Mountain can be deferred until a technically defensible \n     site-suitability determination is made. . . . Deferring the \n     siting of a storage facility until that time will help \n     maintain the credibility of the site-suitability decision.\n\n  Madam President, I hear people and I know my friend from Nevada has \nheard the same thing, ``Well, what are you going to do with the \nwaste?''\n  If I can call upon my friend from Nevada again for a question, he \nwill recall last year in the debate there were dire urgings that if \nsomething did not happen last year, powerplants would close down last \nyear. Do you recall in the early eighties statements similar to this \nbeing made?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I do, indeed. It was made in 1980. Neither the senior \nSenator from Nevada nor the junior Senator from Nevada were Members of \nthis body or of the other one at that time. But then, as now, the \nnuclear utilities were urging the Congress to adopt interim storage, \nthey then were called away from reactor storage. The statements were \nmade during the floor debate that if this were, in fact, not done, that \nwithin the next 3 years, by 1983, nuclear utilities would have to close \ndown and there would be brownouts.\n\n  As the senior Senator from Nevada knows, that was 1980. In a sense, \nif you took the date off that legislation and inserted the words \n``interim storage'' for ``AFR,'' it would be identical to the context \nof the debate.\n  If the senior Senator from Nevada will indulge me for a moment, this \nis what was said by the then chairman of the Energy Committee, Mr. \nJohnston, the distinguished Senator from Louisiana:\n\n       Mr. President, this bill--\n\n  Referring to the AFR legislation--\n\n     deals comprehensively with the problem of civilian nuclear \n     waste. It is an urgent problem--\n\n  Sounds somewhat familiar, does it not?\n\n     Mr. President, for this Nation. It is urgent, first, because \n     we are running out of reactor space at reactors for the \n     storage of the fuel, and if we do not build what we call \n     away-from-reactor storage and begin that soon, we could begin \n     shutting down civilian nuclear reactors in this country as \n     soon as 1983. . . .\n\n  I say to my friend from Nevada, that is, in essence, the debate that \nwe heard in 1996. Just substitute a date and put it 3 or 4 years into \nthe future. Those are the opening comments made by the chairman of the \nEnergy Committee that we just heard. This is the nuclear utility \nrefrain. It has become kind of a mantra, their Holy Grail, and, in \npoint of fact, as the senior Senator from Nevada well knows, that is \nsimply not the case. That is scare tactics; that is hysteria.\n  Mr. REID. I say also to my friend from Nevada, we established with \nthe dry cask storage containers I spoke of earlier that if they burn \nfrom diesel fuel, that is bad. If you are in an accident because of \ngoing fast, that is bad. I say to my friend from Nevada, we \nacknowledged what some of the scientists are saying: Leave it where it \nis. Put these spent-fuel rods in dry cask storage containers in onsite \nstorage. It would be safe, you would not have a diesel fire or accident \nfrom going fast. It would be safe and cheap. It would cost hardly \nanything to do that. There are utilities doing that right now, is that \nnot true?\n  Mr. BRYAN. That is absolutely correct. There are a number of \nutilities\n\n[[Page S2777]]\n\nthat do it. One is just about 40 miles from the Nation's Capital. It is \nauthorized by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. So this is not a \nproposal that originates from those of us in this body, it is a \nscientifically accepted alternative that is available onsite storage \nwhich provides a 100-year storage option without, as the senior Senator \nfrom Nevada correctly points out, the risk involved in transportation \nand handling.\n  I might just add parenthetically, with all the talk about the casks \nthat are going to be used to be shipped across the country, those casks \nhave not yet been designed and licensed.\n  Mr. REID. Even if they were, with the standards they have now been \nable to establish, it would be unsafe to transport them.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. REID. ``Deferring the siting of a storage facility until that \ntime will help to maintain the credibility of the site-suitability \ndecision.''\n  That is what was said by the chairman of the Nuclear Waste Technical \nReview Board, among other things.\n  These same reviews have cited the steady and productive progress \ntoward the objective--and I underline and underscore ``objective''--of \ndetermining Yucca Mountain's suitability for siting the Nation's \nrepository for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.\n  The powerful, aggressive, obsessive nuclear power lobby is not \nwilling to wait. They are not willing to wait. They do not care about \nthe credibility of the site-suitability decision. They are only \ninterested in getting it out of their pockets, out of their backyards \nand putting it someplace else. Their arguments, I say, are mindless and \nreckless. Their arguments are specious.\n\n  As we have indicated, spent fuel is safe right where it is. My \nfriend, the senior Senator from Colorado, stated during the committee \nhearing that if the waste is safe enough to ship, it is safe enough to \nleave in place. That says it all.\n  The arguments for consolidation are without substance because an \ninterim storage facility at Yucca Mountain will not reduce the number \nof storage sites. On the contrary, it will increase their number. This \nis fact, it is not supposition, it is not presumptive, it is not \nvulnerable to contradiction. Continuing operations will require onsite \nstorage of spent fuel in cooling ponds or in an onsite interim facility \nfor transportation staging.\n  Nuclear waste will always be stored temporarily at operating nuclear \npower-generating sites. For those generating sites that either have \nterminated operations or will terminate operations, preparation for \ntransportation will take far more time than is required for the 1998 \nviability decision for Yucca Mountain. They know that. Preparations to \nship this waste material across the country have hardly begun, and that \nis an understatement.\n  In his arguments against S. 104, the chairman of the Nuclear Waste \nTechnical Review Board pointed out:\n\n       The country currently has a capacity to transport only a \n     few hundred metric tons of spent fuel a year.\n\n  And, I might say as an aside, some people would agree we cannot even \nhaul that much. He went on to say:\n\n       Developing a transportation infrastructure necessary to \n     move significant amounts of waste, including the \n     transportation of casks and enhanced safety capabilities \n     along the routes, will take a few years longer than will be \n     needed to develop the simple centralized storage facility \n     currently envisioned by DOE. A site-suitability decision \n     could be made beginning the interim storage facility with no \n     lost time.\n\n  If transportation performance is not improved, there will be at least \n50 accidents involving spent fuel or high-level radioactive waste on \nour railroads and highways here. That is what the average would be \nunder the present statistics--50 accidents involving spent fuel or \nhigh-level nuclear waste. That is a lot of accidents, I must say.\n  Madam President, I want to close this part of my statement by \nreminding everyone why we are here. We are here because of the nuclear \npower lobby. There is no other reason. The President has said he is \ngoing to veto this legislation. The legislation will be vetoed. The \nPresident's veto will be sustained. There is no reason that we are \ndoing this other than because of the nuclear power lobby, and some are \ntrying to satisfy this lobby. We would be better off by dealing with \nthe budget, which, I say to my friend from Nevada, as I understand the \nlaw, were we not to have completed a budget before the April break when \nwe went home for Easter? Isn't that the law?\n  Mr. BRYAN. That is my understanding, that we are obligated to do so, \nbut we have not yet done so.\n  Mr. REID. I will also state that if we do not have a budget, we \ncannot deal with the 13 appropriations bills. I am a member of the \nAppropriations Committee, and we have done nothing, basically, on our \nappropriations legislation because we have not gotten our marks from \nthe Budget Committee. Thirteen appropriations bills and not a single \none has been marked up.\n  We are absolutely going nowhere. But what are we doing here? We are \nspending a week on legislation that the President said he is going to \nveto, which failed last year because of that. If there were ever a \ncolossal waste of legislative time, which means taxpayers' time, this \nis it. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Madam President, the junior Senator from Nevada has been \ncriticized and taken to task somewhat because he has referred to this \nlegislation as a ``mobile Chernobyl.'' In that criticism, it has been \nsaid, ``Look, what happened at Chernobyl is a different situation \nentirely. There you had a reactor explode. This is not going to \nexplode.'' I concede that there are differences in terms of causation, \nbut the results are equally devastating.\n  We are talking about the shipment of 85,000 metric tons of nuclear \nwaste. That would involve, as has been estimated, about 15,638 \nshipments--6,217 by truck, roughly 9,421 by rail. So we are looking at \nabout 15,638 to roughly 17,000 shipments.\n\n  Each of those truck casks would weigh 25 tons. Each rail cask would \nweigh 125 tons. One rail cask--one rail cask--carries the long-lived \nradiological equivalent of 200 Hiroshima bombs--200.\n  So when I use the ``mobile Chernobyl'' analogy, the risk to Nevadans, \nthe risk to Americans, if indeed a rail cask ruptured as a result of an \naccident and radiation was released, it would be a mobile Chernobyl \nbecause the spread of radioactivity and the resultant contamination \nthat results as a consequence could be widespread.\n  I would simply point out to those who are so sanguine about \ntransportation that we are daily reminded that human error--the \nchairman of the Energy Committee pointed out that Chernobyl was a \nproduct of human error. Indeed, Madam President, I suspect that a great \nmany of our accidents, maybe even a majority of them, are a product of \nhuman error. We see that every time there is a major rail collision or \na train that is derailed as a consequence of some neglect in trackage. \nWe have certainly seen it in the context of terrorist activities of \nlate.\n  But the National Environmental Law Center provides that EPA data \nanalysis shows that 7,959 accidents occurred during the transportation \nof toxic chemicals from 1988 to 1992. The American Petroleum Institute \ntells us that heavy truck accidents occur approximately six times for \neach million miles traveled with thousands of truck shipments. This \nmeans that at least 15 such accidents could be expected each year.\n  So the risks are considerable in terms of this transportation, all of \nwhich are unnecessary. It is not necessary or advisable or prudent or \nsound policy to do so.\n  This is frequently characterized as a Nevada battle. But let me just \nsay, fairly recently there has been a proposal to move the nuclear \nwaste from a port in Oakland through Nevada and into Idaho. It has \ngenerated a considerable amount of controversy, not only in my own \nState, but in California. I believe that those who are watching across \nthe Nation should be aware of the fact that Nevadans are not the only \nones who are placed at risk by this ill-conceived proposal.\n  The shipment routes involve 43 different States, and 51 million \nAmericans live within 1 mile of either the rail or highway corridor \nroutes.\n  On this chart that we are exhibiting, the highway corridors are \ndepicted in red, the rail routes are depicted in blue. With the kinds \nof massive shipments we are talking about--125 tons\n\n[[Page S2778]]\n\nby rail, 25 tons by each truck cask--you could only use the major \ncorridor routes. You would not use some back road or unimproved \nsurface. You would need a full-scale transportation route.\n  With all the potential for accident, with all the potential for some \nserious, unintended, unavoidable consequence, we risk the lives of 51 \nmillion Americans to satisfy the request of a single industry in \nAmerica--the nuclear utility industry. They are the only ones that \nbring us to the floor to debate this issue today. As my senior \ncolleague pointed out, they were the ones in 1980 that brought it to \nthe floor. They were the ones that brought it to the floor in 1996. And \nif we are successful, as I believe that we will be in 1997 in \npreventing this legislation from being enacted into law, based upon a \ncarefully considered Presidential position that he will veto such \nlegislation, I would predict that they will be back here in 1998, 1999, \nand the year 2000 because this is something that they covet and that is \na priority for them.\n  So the transportation issue, of which we will comment more during the \ncourse of the debate tomorrow, is a consideration that affects 51 \nmillion Americans in 43 different States. As they say, you cannot get \nthere from here. You have to take that lethal waste across the heart of \nAmerica. Most of this waste--most of this waste--being east of the \nMississippi River will involve transportation over literally thousands \nof rail or highway miles.\n  Let me briefly comment on a couple of other points. The chairman of \nthe Energy Committee pointed out that there is a lawsuit that was \nfiled. He said, as others have said, that it requires that the \nDepartment of Energy must take possession of nuclear waste that is \nstored throughout the reactor sites by 1998 and, if we do not do so, \nthat all kinds of horrendous consequences will occur.\n\n  First, let me point out that the lawsuit was decided last year prior \nto the vote that we took on S. 1936, which is the predecessor to S. 104 \nand essentially in the significant aspects is virtually identical. So \nthis is not a new development.\n  But I think it is important to comment because the utilities have \nsought to obfuscate the issue and have given the impression that, \nindeed, in 1998 there will be a series of Department of Energy trucks \nor vans or rail cars that must back up to every reactor site in America \nand begin to load those on board and that, lo and behold, if they do \nnot have an interim storage facility, these vehicles will be traveling \nendlessly for all time and in perpetuity.\n  Nonsense. The lawsuit did conclude that the Department of Energy has \nan obligation, a legal responsibility. And you look to what the remedy \nis in the contracts.\n  In 1982, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act was enacted by the Congress, \nsigned into law by President Reagan. In that act it required utilities \nto enter into contracts with the Department of Energy. And all the \nutilities that are part of this debate have done so.\n  When you look at the contract, there are two provisions, two \nprovisions that specifically deal with this issue.\n  I again remind my friends that 1998 was not a date sanctified by the \nscientific community. That was a date the utilities insisted upon. The \nDepartment of Energy and others argued that that date was unrealistic. \n``We're not going to be able to reach that date,'' they said. But the \nutilities said, ``No. 1998, we want that.'' That is what the law \nreflected.\n  But in the contract that was required to be entered into with each of \nthe utilities with the Department of Energy, there were two provisions. \nBoth of these provisions are contained in article 9.\n  What it said is this: In anticipation that the 1998 date may not be \nfulfilled, it indicated that if the delays were unavoidable by the \nDepartment of Energy, that is, if the delays were beyond their control, \nthat there was no culpability. Then the remedy that was provided was \nsimply to reschedule the delivery dates. It makes some sense.\n  The other provision that is applicable--and I am sure the utilities \nwill urge this point of view--is, indeed, there is culpability on the \npart of the Department of Energy. As a result of their culpability, it \nwould be classified under the provisions of the contract as an \n``avoidable'' delay. That, too, is part of article 9, section B.\n  The contract remedy is, in the event of any delay in the delivery, \nacceptance or transport caused by circumstances within the reasonable \ncontrol of the Department of Energy or their respective contractors or \nsuppliers, the charges and schedules specified by this contract will be \nequitably adjusted to reflect any estimated additional cost. That \nstrikes me as being reasonable.\n  I had occasion in many years past to practice law, not nuclear \nutility law or environmental law, but what this says is that, look, if \nthe Department of Energy is found to have been negligent in moving the \nprocess forward, the utility is entitled to an adjustment of what they \nare paying into the nuclear waste trust fund based upon additional \ncosts that are being incurred. Indeed, that is not a novel concept.\n  When this Senator first came to the Senate in 1989, and in each \nsession thereafter, joined by my senior colleague from Nevada, we have \noffered legislation that does indeed provide that the utilities would \nbe entitled to an offset or compensation for the additional expense \nthat they may incur as a result of this 1998 deadline being \nunattainable.\n\n  So there is no great mystery about the lawsuit. It changes nothing in \nthe debate that we have, nothing whatsoever, and should not be used as \na basis for supporting the legislation that is currently before us.\n  Finally, let me make just one additional comment that the senior \nSenator from Nevada addressed. That is that this legislation is not \ngoing to become law.\n  The President of the United States, as he did in 1996, indicated that \nthis is bad policy, and following the advice and counsel of the \nscientific community--the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board \nconcluded that it was unnecessary, unwise, and indeed there is no \nnecessity for this, no safety is to be gained by this massive shipment \nof 85,000 metric tons of waste. This is a scientific body that \nconcluded that in 1996, and although the board is newly constituted \nwith a new chairman and many new members, it reached the same \nconclusion in 1997, this very year, in testimony that verified that \ninterim storage is not necessary. So the President, following the wise \ncounsel of those who have examined this from a scientific and objective \npoint of view, has indicated, as shown in testimony before the Senate \nEnergy Committee, that this legislation will be vetoed if indeed it \nshould reach his desk.\n  We will have much more to say about this issue as we debate it during \nthe course of the next week or so. We will point out with greater \nparticularity a number of the issues that we have touched upon lightly \ntoday. I just hope, for my colleagues who are watching and their \nstaffs, that we not be misled. This is legislation that is a carbon \ncopy of the legislation that was debated in S. 1936 in the last session \nof the Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I see no one else is on the floor seeking \nrecognition. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for a period of about 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Madam President, let me begin by complimenting my distinguished \ncolleagues for their statements on the floor this afternoon. My \nintention is not necessarily to speak on that issue, but as I have in \nthe past, I am supportive of their efforts and commend them once more \nfor their concerted effort to bring some fairness to the issue that \nthey have addressed. This is a matter of great import to the State of \nNevada. No one has been more articulate, more aggressively persuasive \non the issue than have the two distinguished colleagues from Nevada. I \ncommend them and urge our colleagues to listen carefully to their \ncounsel and support their\n\n[[Page S2779]]\n\nefforts as we proceed for the remainder of this week on this very \nimportant issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/07/senate-section/article/S2766-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2779-S2781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CRITICAL ISSUES TO ADDRESS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, we have 7 weeks between now and the \nnext legislative recess, a period within which a great deal of work \nmust be done. This has not been our most productive Congress so far. \nThere are a lot of reasons why we have not been as productive as we \nwould like it to be. I hope now as we get into the very critical months \nof April and May that we spend as much effort as we can to bring about \nthe consensus we must have on a series of issues that this Congress \nmust address. Some of them have deadlines. Some of them do not. But all \nof them are of extraordinary importance to this body and to the \nAmerican people.\n  There are two with deadlines that I hope we can begin work on in \nearnest this week. First and foremost, the Chemical Weapons Convention. \nThere is no doubt we are facing the prospect that the United States \ncould miss its opportunity to become a full-fledged member of the \ninternational convention responsible for bringing about the elimination \nof chemical weapons. If we fail to ratify the convention by the 29th of \nApril, we will miss the opportunity to commit ourselves fully to the \nobligations of that convention and to the international community. We \nare told that enrollment of the convention requires at least 10 days, \nwhich means we only have until the 19th. In other words, we have fewer \nthan 14 days within which all of the ramifications of that important \nconvention can be addressed here on the Senate floor.\n  This has been the subject of extraordinary debate, countless \ndeliberations, numerous hearings, and efforts on both sides of the \naisle to resolve the differences that still exist.\n  It is my understanding that we are not that much closer today than we \nhave been for several weeks. If that understanding is inaccurate, then \nI hope someone will come to clarify the current set of circumstances.\n  Madam President, we simply cannot wait. We must deal with this \nconvention. Time is running out. We are not inclined to support any \nother legislation or the movement of any other bill until such time as \nwe have some appreciation of where we are with regard to this \nconvention and when we can expect it to come to the Senate floor. I \ngive great credit to the majority leader for his efforts in attempting \nto do that. He has been patient and diligent, but, so far, I think it \nis fair to say that none of us have been successful. So while our \napproach has always been to try to work through this and to give \neveryone the benefit of the doubt in the hopes that, ultimately, we can \ncome to a resolution, the bottom line is that time is quickly running \nout. When time has run out, the last laugh may be on us.\n  Madam President, the stakes are too high, the issue is too important, \nand the consequences are too severe for us to ignore this important \ndeadline. We must confront it and we must recognize that this must \noccur this week. Hopefully, tomorrow must be the day we finally come to \nthe conclusion about when it is this important treaty will come to the \nU.S. Senate for ratification. Anticipating failure, I don't think we \nhave any other choice but to do all that we can to hold off on taking \nany action on any other piece of legislation until such time as we can \nanticipate success.\n  So, Madam President, I am very hopeful that tomorrow we can resolve \nwhatever remaining procedural questions there may be in an effort to \ndeal with this issue directly.\n  Second, let me just say that we are also running up against another \ndeadline, and that deadline involves the budget. We already missed \nApril 1. That was the deadline that the Budget Committee was supposed \nto have reported out its budget resolution. Now we have the important \ndeadline of April 15. That is the deadline under the law for the Senate \nto pass a budget resolution.\n  I didn't hear the distinguished majority leader this morning, but I \nam told that he had indicated that they are waiting for the White House \nto take additional steps and to make an additional effort. I must say, \nMadam President, I have heard that excuse now for too long. The fact is \nthat the President has taken the action that is required of him under \nthe law. He has presented a budget on time. He has presented a budget, \nby the way, that balances by the year 2002, using CBO figures. So, \nMadam President, as far as I am concerned, the President has done what \nhe is required to do. The question now is, can we? And will our \nRepublican colleagues take the leadership that comes with being in the \nmajority and meet the April 15 deadline?\n  I hope that we will no longer rely on excuses. I hope that we can \ncome together, Republicans and Democrats, in the Budget Committee \nfirst, and second on the floor, and meet the obligations proposed by \nlaw, with no more excuses about who has acted under what circumstances. \nWhile the negotiations are not going well enough, the time has come to \nact now, and the time has come for us to come together, to work in the \nregular order under the budget process, through the Budget Committee, \nand get the job done.\n  So there is an array of pressing issues, Madam President. As I \nindicated, some have deadlines--the Chemical Weapons Convention and the \nbudget. Time is running out. Excuses are getting old. Let's get on with \nthe work and get the job done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I assumed the minority leader was speaking \non his own time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Apart from the debate on the nuclear waste bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the motion to proceed \non the bill.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, before I speak in relation to the motion to \nproceed on S. 104, let me only say to the minority leader of the \nSenate, with due respect to him--and I do respect Senator Daschle--the \nSenate and the leadership of the Senate and the House, for well over a \nmonth and a half, deferred to the President and the responsibility of \nthe President in submitting a budget to Congress. I sat on the floor of \nthe U.S. House of Representatives and listened to our President refer \nto the submitting of a balanced budget; 12 times in the State of the \nUnion address our President spoke of a balanced budget. We received \nthat budget. No one chose, in their own good form, to criticize it. In \nfact, we sent it off to be analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office. \nAnd it came back.\n  I must report to the minority leader that it was not a balanced \nbudget, and we all know that now. It was well out of balance by nearly \n$100 billion for the 4 years of this President, with the inclusion of a \nmajor tax increase and some tax cuts. And then, of course, the year \nafter this President leaves office, the tax cuts go away, the tax \nincreases stay, and a major cut in programs or a major increase in \nrevenue. That is why we haven't dealt with the budget, because we were \nwilling to give this President the benefit of the doubt. Certainly the \nSenator knows that, and it was a fair willingness on our part.\n  Now that that day has passed, the Senate is beginning to work its \nwill on the budget. We first wanted the President to have a fair and \nuncriticized opportunity, and that is exactly what he got. But in all \nfairness, the public now knows that this President's budget includes \nmajor spending increases and major new Federal programs and no real \ncommitment to balance, not in the context of the political reality that \ncertainly the minority leader operates in and that we operate in. No \nCongress has made those kinds of dramatic cuts, nor, frankly, have they \nraised that much revenue as the President is proposing, because while \nhe appears to give on one hand, he rapidly takes away on the other.\n  In all instances, his program spending wraps up, a major increase in \n1 year of $25 billion of new domestic spending in this country. That is \nwhat we are wrestling with. Certainly, this Senate is going to deal \nwith the budget, and they are going to deal with it in a very timely \nmanner. What I hope we can do is something that I know the minority \nleader will appreciate and that is to deal with it in a bipartisan\n\n[[Page S2780]]\n\nway. That we can accomplish and we should accomplish. Already, moderate \nand conservative Democrats are speaking up and saying they can't deal \nwith the President's budget, not in the context of our commitment. Our \ncommitment was that if we would not support a balanced budget amendment \nto the Constitution, we could produce a balanced budget without it.\n  Now, the Senator knows how disappointed I was that he worked so hard \nto destroy the vote on a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution, \nbecause I worked a long time to get that because I think that without \nit we won't get a balanced budget. But all the while he was working to \nchange that vote and worked with the administration to do so, there was \na constant drumbeat of promise to get us to a balanced budget by the \nyear 2002.\n  I know that the Senator was sincere in that commitment. We are \ncommitted to that commitment. But we cannot get there with the \nPresident's schedule of new spending, and we cannot get there with the \nPresident's new tax increases, and we cannot get there with doing all \nof the cuts and all of the changes in the fifth year after this \nPresident has left office. It must start now. It must ramp its way \ntoward the year 2002. Let it be said--and I think it is important that \nit be said--that for the last 2 weeks, with the President's commitment \nand with the leadership's commitment, meetings have gone on. I think \nthe only problem is that everybody has been sitting around at those \nmeetings talking about how delightful it is that they are meeting, \ninstead of time lines and commitments to the American people meeting \nwhat we have said to the American people we would give them, and that \nis, of course, a balanced budget by 2002.\n\n  We need to start this year, not 4 years out. We don't need major tax \nincreases to get there, and we can do so with reasonable responses to \nour domestic spending, not major new programs, but reprogramming, \ngiving the priorities where it ought to be. Many of those is where the \nPresident knows he wants them, and we are willing to participate in \nthat. So the budget process is now well underway. But it took a month's \ndetour, with the commitment that it would allow the time for the \nPresident's budget to play out. That has now played out. We now need to \nget on to the real budgeting that is the responsibility of the \nCongress.\n  I would be happy to let the minority leader comment, if he wishes, \nbefore I go on with my discussion on the nuclear waste bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank my colleague from Idaho for his comments. I \nappreciate very much having the opportunity to hear them just now.\n  Let me respond with four specific points. First of all, I don't know \nof a time when the Congress required the President to submit a budget \nthat we were in total agreement with. That isn't what we do here. We \nare not waiting for the perfect document to come from the White House. \nThat isn't what we did in past Congresses. It isn't what we did with \nRepublican or Democratic Presidents.\n  The President submits a vehicle, the President submits a budget, and \nwe either accept it as the vehicle and mark up the vehicle and provide \na budget that will allow the consensus to work its will, Republicans \nand Democrats, or we present an alternative. My argument this year is \nthat, so far, the Republicans have done neither. They have said we \ndon't like the Democratic budget, but they have not proposed one \neither.\n  As I said in my comments a moment ago, time is running out. April 15 \nis soon to be here. We don't have many more days, legally, for the \nRepublicans and the Democrats to do what my friend suggests we do--work \ntogether to come up with some resolution. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, June O'Neill, the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, \nsent a letter directly, I think, to all members of the Senate Budget \nCommittee reaffirming CBO's analysis of the President's budget, that \nindeed it does reach balance by the year 2002. Now, the Senator may not \nsubscribe to the triggers used by the President to assure that we reach \nCBO figures and balance the budget by the year 2002, but there is no \ndoubt whatsoever that the President did what he said he was going to \ndo--present a balanced budget--and he uses a mechanism that will allow \nus to do that, which has been embraced wholeheartedly by Republicans \nand Democrats in past budgets, including the Republican budget in the \nlast Congress.\n  No. 3, there will always be differences between Republicans and \nDemocrats on priorities. We have no doubt that, ultimately, whether or \nnot we get a resolution, our differences may or may not be bridgeable. \nWe feel very strongly about the need to commit resources to education \nbeyond that which was committed in the past. We feel that if we lose \nthe opportunity to educate the next generation, we lose the kind of \nfreedom and greatness this country aspires to.\n  So, Mr. President, there will be differences, and we will have our \ndebates about those. But that is really what the debates ought to be \nall about, those fundamental differences on our priorities. I will \nargue for whatever length of time we have that investments in \neducation, health care, housing, and investments in the people of this \ncountry in ways that will make them stronger and less relying upon \nFederal programs are in our long-term best interest regardless of what \nform they may take.\n  Mr. President, No. 4, I believe that all too often in this country we \nget hung up on whether or not a given budget is going to achieve \neverything that we had hoped it would. You know, the funny thing is \nthat we never find out, because the Congress, in all of its wisdom, \noftentimes never gets to that point where we can pass a budget \nagreement that allows us to move on through the process of \nreconciliation and appropriation and the whole process here.\n  I want to say that I think there are Republicans and Democrats who \nhave come to a point of asking whether or not an annual budget \nresolution makes a lot of sense. That is a debate for another day. \nSomeday I hope that we can have a good debate about whether annual \nbudget resolutions make sense. My personal preference is to have a \nbiannual budget resolution because I think it would allow us a lot more \nopportunities to cope with all of the circumstances involving the $1.5 \ntrillion budget that we have to consider on an annual budget today. But \nthat is the law right now, which takes me back to the first point. The \nlaw says that regardless of how we may feel about biannual budgets in \nthe future the law requires an annual budget today. The President has \nfulfilled his obligations under that law. Now it is time to fulfill \nours, working together to meet that April 15th deadline to do exactly \nwhat the President proposed that we do--balance the budget by the year \n2002.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I do not have the floor. The Senator from Idaho yielded \nto me.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I would be happy to yield briefly to the Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Democratic leader, is it not true that last year \nwas the fourth year in a row in which we had a declining deficit, and \nthe first time in a row since before the Civil War?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from Nevada, \nthe answer to that is yes. We have made great progress to reduce the \ndeficit by 60 percent. OMB and the Congressional Budget Office fought \naggressively over past budget projections. But OMB has been more \naccurate than the Congressional Budget Office in the last 4 years. That \nhas brought about economic strength that we didn't anticipate as we \nwrote this budget. So we have exceeded our target. We ought to continue \nto do that. We are prepared to use the Congressional Budget Office \nfigures even though OMB is more accurate because the Congressional \nBudget Office tends to be more conservative, and that is fine when it \ncomes to economic projections. But the bottom line is that we have come \nmore than halfway already. Now it is time for us to complete the job.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I also ask my friend, the Democratic leader, \nis it not true that inflation and unemployment have been at a 40-year \nlow, and economic growth is at a 40-year high, and we have 300,000 \nfewer Federal employees than we had 4 years ago?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is correct. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Have they led to a general surge in economic viability of \nthis country?\n\n[[Page S2781]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. There is no question about it.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, regaining my time, we are certainly going \nto have ample time to debate the budget and budget issues. But I did \nthink it was important to respond to the minority leader as it relates \nto his overall statement today and what we have done here in the last \nmonth that I think was an effort to accommodate this President. Now it \nis the job of the Congress to get on with their business, and they \nwill, and those priorities will be well spelled out, and we will \ncontinue our efforts toward a balanced budget and a reduced deficit \nwhich the President did not honor in his commitment of his new budget, \nalthough what the Senator from Nevada has said certainly is a valid \nstatement. The Congress has participated jointly in that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/07/senate-section/article/S2779-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2781-S2786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY ACT AMENDMENTS--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, when it comes to establishing national \npriorities--and I know what our President is doing in the area that I \nam about to discuss now--it is a great frustration to many States \nacross our Nation because this President refuses--I repeat, refuses--to \ntake a firm position and establish as a national priority in this \ncountry the appropriate handling of spent nuclear fuel and high-level \nnuclear waste in a way that is acceptable to the American people and \ncommensurate with the public law.\n\n  So what I am about to speak to is a piece of Senate legislation that \nI and the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nintroduced on this floor last year, and that we passed last year in the \nU.S. Senate with 63 votes--63 bipartisan voices that said that this \nadministration was wrong with their policy, and wrong with their \npriorities when it came to honoring public law and the 42 States that \nfelt it necessary that this President honor public law. I am talking \nabout the expeditious and timely management of high-level nuclear waste \nand spent nuclear fuel.\n  For all the right reasons, our Nation has spent a long time \ngenerating radioactive materials--nearly five decades. Most of this \nmaterial is the byproduct of two principal activities: National defense \noperations, and commercial nuclear power plants. While it was our \nnational policy for well over five decades that the Federal Government \nhave oversight and primacy in the area of management and control of \nnuclear materials, it is no longer, tragically enough, a high-level \npolicy of this country that is discernible by administrative position \nand by the clearness of administrative leadership. That is why we are \nhere today on the floor of the U.S. Senate debating a timely action \nthat this country must take to be responsible for the five decades of \nactivity in the generation of high-level radioactive waste.\n  What I am talking about clearly is a national concern. To ignore this \nresponsibility would be unwise, irresponsible, and in some instances, \nwith regard to taking timely action, unsafe.\n  I am pleased now to rise in support of Senate bill 104, the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act of 1997. As I mentioned, last year I and the Senator \nfrom Alaska were here on the floor with the Senators from Nevada \ndebating a similar bill, although this year we have changed the bill \nsome by actions in the committee itself and by possible amendments that \nwill be made here on the floor during the course of the debate and the \nfinal vote on this legislation.\n  What we are talking about is the timely storage and disposal of spent \nnuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste from our Nation's defense \nprogram and from, of course, the commercial nuclear power plants. \nSenate bill 104 creates an integrated system that will ensure \nconstruction of an interim storage facility and permanent repository to \nmanage spent fuel and high-level waste that is currently stored in over \n80 sites in 41 States across this country.\n  I have in the backdrop a map of our country that demonstrates the \nlocations of reactors and storage sites, 80 sites in 41 States. Yet our \nadministration basically has had no policy for nearly two decades on \nthis issue.\n  We spoke as a Congress and we spoke as a people in 1982: That there \nneeded to be a national policy and a national program. The legislation \nthat we have before us, in my opinion, demonstrates that kind of \ncritical need, and the need also to operate and respond in a timely \nfashion.\n  Transferring nuclear waste from the many defense and commercial \nnuclear sites to a single Federal facility beginning in 1998 was the \nintent of the Congress and the President of the United States when the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act passed in 1982.\n  It became law. It was signed by the President. It was a national \ncommitment. It was this Nation speaking to the need to handle the kind \nof waste that I am talking about and to do so in a safe and responsible \nfashion.\n  Unbelievably, we are less than one year away--just 9 months--from the \ndate when the Department of Energy is obligated by the law that was \npassed in 1982 and is obligated under contract, in response to the law \nsigned and honored by our Government, to accept the waste. Now we have \nto come to the floor in the 11th hour and plead with this \nadministration to come with us in the shaping of national policy to \ndeal with this issue. Just last year the U.S. Court of Appeals \nreaffirmed the Federal obligation.\n\n  The Nevada test site was selected in the early 1970's as one of the \nsites under consideration for a geologic repository. This site has been \nunder study for now over two decades by scientists and engineers. Here \nis a photograph of the Nevada test site where the interim storage \nfacility would be located. Scientists and engineers at Yucca Mountain \nnear this site where a permanent geologic repository for these high-\nlevel wastes would be placed have conducted the most thorough and \ncomprehensive geological survey ever undertaken on any piece of \nproperty on the face of the Earth.\n  Let me repeat that claim because I believe it to be valid. The site \nthat we are looking at, the Yucca Mountain deep geologic repository, \nhas been studied more thoroughly, more comprehensively, both from a \ngeologic point of view, from a seismic point of view, and from the \noverall need to meet the certification process for it to be a \npermanent, safe, high-level waste repository--that site has been more \ncomprehensively studied than any piece of real estate on the face of \nthe Earth. During all of this time and all of the studies, nothing has \nbeen discovered which would indicate that this site is unsuitable for \nuse as a repository.\n  Because of the endless bureaucratic delays that have plagued the \nprogram, the Federal Government now says it will not have a repository \noperating until the year 2010 at the earliest. Remember, this was a \nFederal Government that in 1982 signed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act \ncommitting by contract to take the waste by 1998, 9 months from now. \nYet this administration and their representatives at the Department of \nEnergy shrugged their shoulders and said, ``Well, gee, the year 2010 \nwill have to do because we just can't get there.'' Yet the courts last \nyear said ``Wrong. Foul ball. Go back to home plate. You have to abide \nby the law.'' And the Department of Energy said, ``Yes. You are right. \nWe do have to do that. We recognized that.''\n  This is 12 years after the Federal Government is contractually \nobligated to take title to and remove spent fuel from civilian power \nplants. Electric consumers and taxpayers have committed approximately \n$12 billion solely to study, test and build a radioactive waste \nmanagement system. So when the Federal Government made its obligation \nin 1982 to the taxpayer, but most importantly the ratepayer of the \nutilities that were generating electricity through nuclear power, and \nthe Government owed this commitment by paying out money to build the \nfacility, to do the siting, to do the studies, to do all of the test \nwork and to have a facility ready to operate and receive by 1998. That \nwas a $12 billion commitment and $4.5 billion of that money has already \nbeen spent. This chart will give you an idea of where the moneys come \nfrom.\n  So, in other words, these were the folks that made the commitments.\n\n[[Page S2782]]\n\n These were the folks that signed the contracts. These were the folks \nthat believed that the Federal Government was an honorable agent that \nwould honor those contracts. And the courts just this past year said, \n``You are right. The Federal Government has to do it.'' And the \nadministration says, ``Well, we can't do it. In fact, we probably won't \nbe able to do it until 2010, or sometime beyond.''\n  We enjoy the benefits of having the world's most reliable and \npowerful electricity supplies to drive our economy. In supplying more \nthan 20 percent of the Nation's electricity, nuclear energy is part of \nthe foundation of our Nation's high standard of living and economic \ngrowth. Twenty percent of the lights in our country, of the industry in \nour country, of the economy of our country, is fueled by nuclear power \nplants.\n  Mr. President, here is the thing that frustrates me most. I am going \nto quote from the President of the United States, this President. This \nis the President who doesn't have any idea how he will honor the \ncommitment that the courts said just this last year he has to honor. \nThis is the President who, in my opinion, has established the most \nantinuclear policy and attitude of any President since Harry Truman. \nYet, this President this year in his fiscal 1998 budget request for the \nDepartment of Energy includes the following statement.\n  He says, or the Department of Energy says, this President's \nDepartment of Energy:\n\n       [Nuclear power] plants represent a $200 billion investment \n     by electric ratepayers and provide reliable baseload power \n     without emitting harmful pollutants such as those associated \n     with global climate change.\n\n  In other words, it is this President who recognizes that nuclear \npower or electrical power generated by nuclear energy is the safest, \nthe cleanest, and provides a huge investment of $200 billion. Yet, this \nis the President who shrugs his shoulders and says, ``But we don't know \nwhat to do with the waste. We do not have a policy. We cannot react.''\n  I agree with the statement that I just quoted from the Department of \nEnergy's fiscal year 1998 budget. Nuclear power is a major generator. \nNuclear power is safe. Nuclear power is clean. Responsible management \nand disposal of spent fuel from these plants is a vital component of \nthe energy security of this country and is, in my opinion, the No. 1 \nenvironmental issue that we face. Managing the waste stream safely and \nsoundly is the No. 1 environmental issue in 41 States at 81 sites \nacross this country.\n  S. 104 authorizes construction of an interim storage facility on the \nNevada test site near Yucca Mountain. This facility will be constructed \nin full compliance with the regulations of, and will be licensed by, \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission. It is an interesting drawing we have \nup here on this chart that shows how simple the technology to store \nthis fuel is, but what is important to understand is that you do it by \nthe rules and you do it by the science, the technology, and the \nengineering of the day.\n  The interim storage capacity provided for in the legislation would \nstem the Government's looming financial liability in its current \nlawsuit with utilities. In other words, I have just entered into a new \ndimension in this battle that we now have going over--how to be \nresponsible and where to be responsible and when to be responsible as \nit relates to the appropriate management of spent fuel and high-level \nnuclear waste.\n  On January 31 of this year, 46 State agencies and 36 utility \ncompanies filed suit against the Department of Energy in Federal court. \nThe lawsuit asks the court to order immediate action by the Department \nof Energy to comply with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 by \nbeginning to remove spent nuclear fuel from reactor sites by January \n31, 1998, as specified under the act. The Department of Energy not only \nhas failed to take any steps to fulfill this obligation, as I have \nspoken to earlier, but, rather, it has acknowledged it will not begin \nwaste acceptance in 1998 and has solicited suggestions on what it might \ndo in light of this failure.\n  Let me repeat. Here is the Department of Energy that has basically \nsaid: We cannot do it, so tell us how to do it. Give us some ideas of \nhow we, as Government, can honor the commitment that we have made under \nthe law.\n  Let me suggest to our Secretary of Energy and to the President that \nthe way you honor the commitment is S. 104. Don't fight the Congress. \nDon't fight a majority bipartisan effort here. Come with us, work with \nus in solving this problem as S. 104 provides. Not only does it \nrecognize the commitment by law, but it recognizes the need to respond \nin a timely fashion.\n  Just last week our new Secretary of Energy, Federico Pena, met with \nnuclear energy executives. Despite the potential for billions of \ndollars of liability judgments against his Department, Secretary Pena \nand the administration again failed to offer any concrete solution to \nthis issue. Why did they fail to offer it? Because they do not want to \nrecognize the need for S. 104. They do not want to recognize the \ncommitment they have made, or at least are responsible for under the \nlaw.\n  In the course of this debate, you will hear and you have already \nheard the two Senators from the State of Nevada talk about the issue of \ntransportation. Our opponents will raise the specter of a mobile \nChernobyl. This fear-mongering is simply not supported by facts.\n  Let me digress here to talk about the safety of transportation for a \nmoment. In doing so, let me make this statement. I have had the \nprivilege over the course of my time in service in the U.S. Congress \nfrom the State of Idaho to deal with a lot of issues, all of them or \nmost all of them were political, but 99 percent of them are not just \npolitical. Some of them deal with economics. Some of them had differing \nopinions as to the engineering or the science or the technology \ninvolved in a given issue. But never have I dealt with an issue that, \nin my opinion, is exclusively political--not scientific, not \nengineering, not mechanical in any way. Because when it comes to the \nmanagement of nuclear waste, none of those charges have any base to \nthem. The only dynamics in this debate is politics. Where do you want \nto put the waste? Because, once that decision is made, our science, our \nengineering, and our technology knows without question that it can be \neffectively and responsibly stored and safely stored in an \nenvironmentally sound way.\n  Those decisions were made--that it be a deep geologic repository. So, \nwhen it comes to the movement of that waste to that repository, the \nsame argument holds true. The fact is, there have been over 2,500 \ncommercial shipments of spent fuel in the United States in the \ntimeframe that I have talked about; the same timeframe we have dealt \nwith the management and the handling of nuclear waste. There has not \nbeen a single death or injury from the radioactive nature of the cargo.\n  Let me repeat. There has never been a single death or injury from the \nradioactive nature of the cargo.\n  What am I saying when I say that? I am saying that the integrity of \nthe shipment vessel in which high-level nuclear waste or nuclear fuel \nwas transported was never breached, even though there were some \naccidents. There is no other product or waste material transportation \nin our country today that can make that claim--none, except nuclear \nwaste. It has been transported more safely with no escape of \nradioactivity, and therefore no human injury resulting from it, and \ntransported more safely than any other waste, toxic substance, or \nhuman-harming substance in the United States. That is a unique claim.\n  The reason that claim can be made was the understanding at the front \nend of the need to transport this waste in a safe manner and the \nimportance of the vessel in which it was transported in accomplishing \nthis.\n  Let me add to these national statistics by describing the experience \nof my State, because my State receives high-level nuclear waste \nshipments. There have been over 600 shipments of Navy fuel and over \n4,000 other shipments of radioactive material to my State. I will say \nthat while some Idahoans resist and speak out about these shipments, \nnone of them have been harmed. There has never been a spill. There has \nnever been an accident that resulted in the radioactivity of the cargo \nbeing released. There have never been--let me repeat once more, for the \nrecord--injuries related to the radioactive nature of shipments.\n\n[[Page S2783]]\n\n  Why? Why the great record? Well, largely because of what I just said, \nbecause there was rigorous attention paid in the very early days, \nrecognizing the need for safe transportation of these materials. In \nfact, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ``The safety \nrecord for spent fuel shipments in the United States and in other \nindustrialized nations is enviable. Of the thousands of shipments \ncompleted over the last 30 years, none have resulted in an identifiable \ninjury through a release of radioactive material.''\n  An example of this care and handling is the testing sequence to which \nspent fuel packages must be subjected. Once again, we have talked about \nthe routes. You have seen the picture. Here are some examples of the \nkind of testing that has gone on to create the integrity of the \nshipping vessel that allows me to make the claims on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate that I have just made. For a spent fuel package design to \nreceive a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, it must be \ndemonstrated that the cask can survive the following tests, in \nsequence: A 30-foot drop onto an unyielding surface. In other words, I \nam talking about a concrete slab; then, a shorter drop onto a vertical \nsteel punch bar. In other words, dropping a vessel onto a steel spike, \nif you will, of the size that could fully penetrate the vessel; that it \nbe engulfed in fire for 30 minutes; finally, submerged in 3 feet of \nwater; and separately, that the cask must not leak for 1 hour under 200 \nmeters of water. That is the rigorousness of the testing and that is \nwhy, of course, I can make the claims I made, that no spills have \nresulted.\n\n  To further ensure that this care and caution be continued, we have \nsupported an amendment offered in the committee by our colleague from \nOregon, Senator Wyden. All shipments pursuant to S. 104 will be \nconducted in full compliance with all relevant Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission and Department of Transportation regulations, in addition to \ncomplying with the Department of Energy's requirements for advance \nnotification and emergency response.\n  My colleagues from Nevada have been very vocal on this issue of \ntransportation. I would like to quote from a letter dated March 11, \n1997, sent by the Western Governors' Association, of which Nevada is a \nmember. This letter went to Senator Wyden, giving the Western \nGovernors' Association response to Senator Wyden's transportation \namendment that our committee accepted, that is now within S. 104. The \nletter reads:\n\n       [Y]our transportation amendments to S. 104, dated March 11, \n     are generally consistent with the WGA's adopted policies for \n     the safe and uneventful transport of radioactive waste \n     through western States.\n\n  We feel that the committee action has strengthened the already \nsubstantial transportation safeguards of S. 104, as introduced.\n  The point of this whole comment was that not only had we made \nsignificant strides to ensure questions about transportation, because \nthe vessel itself is not of issue, in my opinion, nor are there \nscientists or engineers that would argue it.\n  The other question happens to deal with the general nature of \nexposure, and what is 100 millirems. We are going to talk about this in \nthe debate. Already the Senators from Nevada have had this issue on the \ncharts before us. I think it is important that we set radiation \nexposure levels in context, so that we can compare them to exposures \nthat we assume routinely in our day-to-day living.\n  Mr. President, it is something that not all of us recognize or \nunderstand, but the fact is that we receive radiation by just being \nalive under natural environments, whether it is your relationship in \naltitude and exposure to the Sun or whether it is the fact that you are \nencased in granite or marble. For example, we receive 80 millirems \ndosage on an annual basis by merely serving in the U.S. Senate. Why? \nBecause of the general radioactive nature of granite and marble. That \nis the way our world is made up.\n  In your State of Colorado, and in your city of Denver, residents \nreceive approximately a 53-millirem annual dose because you live in a \nmile-high city where the air is thinner and your exposure to solar \nradiation is simply higher. It is the character of the environment we \nlive in.\n\n  When I hear suggestions that we set exposure levels at 4 millirems \nfor groundwater or setting a level of 15 millirems, I am reminded of \nthe quote I heard when this debate occurred earlier. It talked about \nthe differences of exposure in, again, Denver--and I do not know why \nthey like to use Denver, CO, as an example--the difference between 4 \nmillirems exposure for groundwater and setting it at 15 millirems is a \ndifference of standing up or sitting down in Denver, CO, as it relates \nto your relative exposure to radiation and the Sun. I doubt that \nanybody in the State of Colorado, or in the city of Denver, thinks that \nthey are more exposed standing or less exposed seated, to the natural \nenvironmental radiation that occurs there and has always occurred there \nbecause of the altitude and the atmosphere.\n  What I am trying to make here is a point that if you want to stand on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate and debate millirems in the 15 or the 4 \ncontext, you do not have a point. It cannot be made. It does not make \nsense, because you receive them in the natural environment of Denver or \nyou receive them in the natural environment by being encased in a \nbuilding of sandstone and marble and granite right here in the U.S. \nSenate. That is the reality of what we have. That is the situation that \nwe face.\n  Support of S. 104 is coming from all quarters, including State and \nlocal government officials, public utility commissioners, newspapers, \neditorial boards, labor unions, chambers of commerce, national trade \nassociations, the electric utilities, just to name a few. A similar \nmeasure, as I have mentioned, S. 1936, passed this body last year with \nstrong bipartisan support.\n  I know that many people would prefer not to address the problem of \nspent nuclear fuel disposal. For this Congress not to address this \nproblem, in my opinion, would just be irresponsible. We cannot let the \nsource of 20 percent of our country's electricity drown in waste, nor \ncan we allow our Government to default on contractual obligations that \nit has made. This Government's default would leave the taxpayers of \nthis country vulnerable to a financial liability as high as $80 \nbillion.\n  As I close, let me use these examples. The minority leader and I were \njust discussing budgets and who is on first and who is on second and \nwho proposed and who has not proposed. The bottom line is we are all \nconcerned about the budget and, most importantly, we are all concerned \nabout getting it to balance in a responsible fashion and not doing so \nwith major tax increases.\n  Yet, if this Government walks away from its commitment under the law, \nit may well be placing itself in a liability environment that could \nequal upwards of $80 billion. How does that translate? That translates \nto an additional $1,300 per family in the United States. On the dollar \nand cents costs, let me relate them to you as I understand them.\n  If we do not assume the responsibility and deal in a timely fashion, \nthe cost of storage of spent fuel, because the courts have said to the \nFederal Government, ``You will take charge of it. It will become your \nobligation,'' it will start costing the taxpayers money. That cost \ncould go as high as $19.6 billion. Return of nuclear waste fees could \nbe $8.5 billion. Interest on nuclear waste fees, $15 to $27.8 billion, \ndepending on the interest rates used, and consequential damage for \nshutdown of potential nuclear powerplants that would lose their storage \ncapability and would not be allowed to license new storage capability \ncould be upwards of $24 billion.\n  When the bipartisan leadership of the House and Senate met with the \nPresident and the Vice President some weeks ago, our leader, Trent \nLott, said to the President, ``It is our priority to deal with the \nnuclear waste issue.'' The President deferred to Al Gore and said, ``It \nis not ours,'' and the Vice President largely said, ``Leave it where it \nis until the year 2010.''\n  Eighty billion dollars and 2010? Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, \nwake up. Not only will the taxpayers not allow that, but the politics \nof this country will not tolerate that. We must deal with this issue, \nand S. 104 is clearly a way of dealing with it.\n\n  The United States has benefited from the many uses of nuclear \nmaterials which have deterred a global conflict.\n\n[[Page S2784]]\n\n Our nuclear fuels now generate electricity in a clean, non-air-\npolluting way. Our generation now must take the responsibility that it \nhas to properly manage spent nuclear fuels for the defense program of \nour country and for the 110 commercial powerplants that it obligated \nitself to do so in 1982.\n  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997, the legislation that we are now \nasking for the right to proceed with on the floor and deal with in a \ntimely fashion, S. 104, is the proper way to move. It allows our \ncitizens the comfort of knowing that our Government has acted \nresponsibly to assure environmentally safe long-term storage and \ndisposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive material. I \nhope that tomorrow evening, when we vote cloture that would give the \nSenate the right to proceed to debate on the legislation, that we can \nhave the kind of overwhelming, bipartisan support of the type that we \nhave received in the past.\n  Mr. President, I believe we will get that support. I believe it \nbecause it is now time to deal with this issue. I hope that during the \ncourse of the debate on the floor of the Senate and action that will \nfollow in the House, that somehow and in some way we can catch the \nattention of this administration, to do what they are legally and \ncontractually obligated to do, so that we can stand bipartisan, \nshoulder to shoulder, in a national policy that deals with this issue \nin a way that we can all be proud of. Then we can say to our fellow \ncitizens, ``Yes, when the Government makes a commitment, when the \nGovernment signs a contract, when the Government obligates resources \nand taxes it citizenry for a dedicated cause, that cause can be \nresponded to in a timely fashion.'' S. 104 allows us to do so, and I \nhope that by tomorrow evening we will have the support to vote cloture. \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I can ask the Chair, after we finish \ndebate on this matter today, it is my understanding that, again, this \nmatter will be taken up at 2:30 tomorrow afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. And there will be a vote at 5:30 or 5:15?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I believe it is scheduled for 5:15.\n  Mr. REID. And the debate between 2:30 and 5:15 is equally divided \nbetween the----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is equally divided between 2:15 and 5:15.\n  Mr. REID. I recognize that my friend from Minnesota has been on the \nfloor, and I will just take a few minutes because there are many things \nwe can talk about during the time tomorrow. I will just say, so I do \nnot have to answer today everything that my friend from Idaho \npropounded, that the $80 billion figure that my friend has brought up \nis, I suggest, maybe not modern math. It simply does not make sense. If \nin fact we are talking about saving money, the thing to do would be to \nleave it where it is. We would save not only the cost of the site of \nconstruction at Yucca Mountain and the proposed interim storage site of \nbillions of dollars, maybe as much as $10 billion, but we would also \nnot have the American public frightened and concerned about the \ntransportation of nuclear waste. We will talk about that more tomorrow.\n  I will also say, tomorrow we will discuss in some detail the argument \nthat because there has been nuclear testing there, we should also have \nnuclear waste; we will establish that is a clearly erroneous and \nfallacious reason.\n  Also, we will spend time tomorrow indicating how this legislation \nwould wipe out environmental laws in this country, and that is the \nreason all environmental organizations in this country vehemently \noppose this legislation.\n  Mr. President, there is a lot that we need to talk about with this \nlegislation. As indicated, however, my friend from Minnesota has been \nwaiting all afternoon. My friend from Idaho, my friend from Alaska and \nthe two Senators from Nevada will discuss this in more detail tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not under controlled time.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Before I begin, I yield a few moments to the Senator from \nIdaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Kristine \nSvinicki, a legislative fellow who works with my office, be granted the \nprivilege of the floor for the duration of the debate on S. 104.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. 104, \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. This much-needed legislation, as \nhas been outlined today, will help resolve our Nation's nuclear waste \nstorage crisis, help restore the commitments to our Nation's \nratepayers, and ultimately to save taxpayer dollars from the Department \nof Energy's failed policies of the past.\n  Again, I applaud the majority leader and Energy and Natural Resources \nChairman Murkowski and Senator Craig of Idaho, for their leadership in \nmoving this bill.\n  Again, bottom line, our Nation cannot afford further delay, and the \ntime to act on this commonsense legislation is now. But for the Senate \nto fully appreciate the gravity of the situation, I believe a brief \nsummary of its history is in order. Since 1982, utility ratepayers have \nbeen required to pay the Federal Government nearly $13 billion of their \nhard-earned money in exchange for the promise that the Department of \nEnergy would transport and store commercially generated nuclear waste \nin a centralized facility by January 31, 1998. However, with this \ndeadline less than a year away and with over $6 billion already spent \nby the Department of Energy, there has been little progress toward \nkeeping this 15-year-old promise of establishing a centralized Federal \nstorage facility. In fact, though there has been measurable progress at \nthe Yucca Mountain, NV, facility, a permanent repository will not be \ncompleted until well into the next century. As of today, nuclear waste \nis piling up at more than 80 sites due to the DOE's failure to live up \nto is commitment.\n  Clearly, if the DOE is to meet the January 31, 1998 deadline, it must \nbegin accepting nuclear waste at an interim storage facility--that, \nhowever, has not yet happened. In fact, the DOE recently notified \nStates and utilities that it would not accept their commercial nuclear \nwaste despite the law and the Federal court's effort to enforce it. \nMeanwhile, utility ratepayers are still being required to pay for a \nmismanaged program. In fact, over $630 million from the ratepayers go \ninto the nuclear waste fund each year--without any tangible benefits or \nresults to show for them.\n  Our Nation's utility consumers and their pocketbooks aren't just hit \nonce, either. Because of the DOE's failure to act, ratepayers are \ncurrently being forced to pay their hard-earned dollars to store waste \non-site at commercial utility plants--a burden that would not be \nnecessary had the Energy Department lived up to its legal obligation. \nTake, for example, the situation facing ratepayers in my home State of \nMinnesota. Since 1982, Minnesota's nuclear energy consumers have paid \nover $250 million into the nuclear waste fund believing that the \nFederal Government would fulfill its obligation to transport nuclear \nwaste out of Minnesota. But as time went on and the DOE continued to \nignore their responsibilities, utilities in Minnesota and around the \ncountry were forced to temporarily store their waste within the \nconfines of their own facilities. When it became clear to many \nutilities that storage space was running out and the Department of \nEnergy would not accept waste by the established deadline, utilities \nthen had to go to their States to ask for additional on-site storage or \nelse be forced to shutdown their operations.\n\n  For example, ratepayers in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and \nWisconsin were forced to pay for on-site storage in cooling pools at \nPrairie Island in southeastern Minnesota. In 1994, with storage space \nrunning out, the Minnesota Legislature--after a bruising battle--voted \nto allow for limited on-site dry-cask storage until the year 2004.\n  Mr. President, the cost associated with this on-site storage is \nstaggering.\n\n[[Page S2785]]\n\nRatepayers in the Midwestern service area alone have paid over $25 \nmillion in storage costs and will pay an estimated $100 million more by \nthe year 2015, and that is in addition to the required payments to the \nFederal Government.\n  To make matters even worse, storage space will run out at Prairie \nIsland just after the turn of the century, forcing the plant to close \nunless the State legislature once again makes up for the DOE's \ninaction. This will threaten over 30 percent of Minnesota's overall \nenergy resources and will likely lead to even higher costs for \nMinnesota's ratepayers.\n  In fact, the Minnesota Department of Public Service estimates that \nthe increase in costs could reach as high as 17 percent, forcing \nratepayers to eventually pay three times: once to the nuclear waste \nfund, again for onsite storage, and yet again for increased energy \ncosts.\n  And Minnesota is not alone in facing this unacceptable situation. \nThirty-six other States across the Nation are facing similar \ncircumstances of either shutting down and losing their energy-\ngenerating capacity or continuing to bail out the Federal Government \nfor its failure to act.\n  Ratepayers are not the only ones who face serious consequences \nbecause of inaction by the DOE. The taxpayers are threatened too. Last \nyear, the Federal courts ruled that the DOE will be liable for damages \nif it does not accept commercial nuclear waste by January 31, 1998.\n  Under current law, no one at the DOE will be held personally liable \nfor any assessed damages; the bill will go to the American taxpayers at \nan estimated cost between $40 to $80 billion. Such a tremendous \nliability burden on taxpayers would make the public bailout of the \nsavings and loan collapse seem small in comparison.\n  What is worse is that while our States, our utility ratepayers, and \nthe taxpayers are being unfairly punished by the Department of Energy's \ninaction, the Federal Government has been active in meeting the interim \nnuclear waste storage needs of foreign countries.\n  Under the Atoms for Peace Program, the DOE has resumed collecting \nspent nuclear fuel from a total of 41 countries. Last year, the DOE \ncompleted urgent relief shipments of 252 spent nuclear fuel assemblies \nfrom European nations to the agency's facility at Savannah River. It \nhas also accepted nuclear spent fuel from Latin American countries.\n  Ultimately, as I learned during a recent trip to the Savannah River \nsite, which is down in South Carolina, up to 890 foreign research \nreactor cores will be accepted by the DOE over a 13-year period. Again, \nup to 890 foreign research reactor cores will be accepted by the DOE \nover a 13-year period.\n\n  In addition, our Government is actively helping other countries \nreduce their nuclear waste stockpiles. With the Department of Defense \nspending up to $400 million on designing and constructing an interim \nnuclear waste storage facility in Russia to help dismantle the cold war \nthreat, the world will certainly be a safer place, if that happens.\n  But, again, our Defense Department is spending $400 million to help \nRussia design, construct, and facilitate an interim waste storage \nfacility, but yet cannot do it in this country.\n  Now, Mr. President, as a Senator who is concerned about our national \nsecurity needs, I understand the rationale behind reducing our \ninternational nuclear dangers. But what I and many others cannot \ncomprehend is how our Government has made it a priority to help foreign \ncountries with their nuclear waste problems while simultaneously \nignoring the concerns right here in our own country.\n  It seems clear to me that while States, utilities, and ratepayers \nhave kept their end of the bargain, the DOE has not done its part. That \nsends the wrong message to the American people about trusting the \npromises of the Federal Government. Maybe that is why the National \nAssociation of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, 48 State agencies and \n36 utilities have now all joined together in a lawsuit to stop \nratepayers' payments into the nuclear waste fund and to escrow $600 \nmillion that will soon go into that fund this year. Because too long, \nour States, utilities, and ratepayers have acted in good faith and \nrelied upon the Federal Government to live up to its obligations. \nEvidently, they have had enough of the DOE's excuses for inaction and \nhave proposed their own recourse.\n  This issue has created strange bedfellows as well. In a recent \ninterview, former DOE Secretary Hazel O'Leary agreed that action on an \ninterim site is needed as soon as possible. It is unfortunate that \nSecretary O'Leary waited until she was free from the administration to \nopenly support interim storage, but I think her comments are important \nto remember as we attempt to protect our Nation's ratepayers and \ntaxpayers.\n  In addition, Mr. President, the former head of the Office of Civilian \nRadioactive Waste Management under the Clinton administration, Daniel \nDreyfus, also said that he believes the DOE must move to meet the \nJanuary 31, 1998, deadline. Key labor unions have even joined the fight \nto restore the DOE's promises. J.J. Barry, president of the \nInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, recently wrote me, and \nhe said, ``I am calling on you and your colleagues to put partisan \npolitics aside for the good of our Nation and America's workers and \ntheir families. We must address this problem now or else face serious \neconomic and environmental consequences later.'' He went on to say, \n``Please support passage of S. 104.''\n  Despite this widespread support, the DOE has failed to offer an \nalternative to our legislation.\n  Although the Department's new Secretary now admits that a Federal \nsolution is needed to resolve our interim storage problems, he recently \nindicted in a meeting with nuclear utility executives that the DOE is \nstill unwilling to move commercial spent fuel. Instead, the DOE offered \na proposal to compensate utilities for onsite storage.\n  Unfortunately, this proposed compensation scheme does little but \nneedlessly spend the taxpayers' money while continuing the failed \nstatus quo. It signals to the ratepayers that the Federal Government \nhas no intention of moving commercial nuclear waste in the near future, \ndespite a Federal court mandate that it does.\n  So again, who will pay for this? It will not be the new Secretary, \nMr. Pena. It will not be the Department of Energy or out of its budget. \nIt will gladly pay the fines, but it will come out of the ratepayers' \nand the taxpayers' pockets in order to do this. So they are playing \nfast and loose with the taxpayers' money once again.\n  Moreover, continuing the policy of noncentralized storage facilities \nmay lead to the premature shutdown of one nuclear plant in Minnesota--\ncompromising 30 percent of the State's energy needs and increasing \nratepayer costs.\n  So again, clearly, leadership is needed to restore the promises made \nto the American people. If such leadership will not come from the \nClinton-Gore administration, then it will have to come from Congress. \nSenate Energy and Natural Resoruces Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski, \nSenator Larry Craig, and I crafted a bipartisan proposal, again, S. \n104, identical to legislation supported last year by 63 Senators.\n  We have put this proposal forward as a good-faith effort to help \nresolve this situation for the sake of protecting the legitimate \ninterests of our ratepayers and taxpayers, as well as protecting \nnational security and protecting the environment. Last month, the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee passed this bipartisan \nlegislation on a 15 to 5 vote.\n  Mr. President, Congress has an obligation to protect the American \npublic also from the estimated $40 to $80 billion that they face in \nliability expenses, because the DOE has refused to act.\n  Our bill will reform our current civilian nuclear waste program to \navoid the squandering of billions of dollars of ratepayers' and \ntaxpayers' money. It will eliminate the current need for onsite storage \nat our Nation's nuclear plants and keep plants from shutting down \nprematurely due to the lack of storage space. And it will also help to \nmaintain stable energy prices.\n  Our legislation also assures that transportation of nuclear waste \nwill continue to be conducted in a safe manner.\n  For the interests of my colleagues, there have already been 2,400 \nshipments of high-level nuclear waste in\n\n[[Page S2786]]\n\nour Nation, including numerous shipments of naval spent fuel and \nforeign research reactor fuel.\n  In fact, in these pictures behind me it illustrates the means by \nwhich shipments of foreign-generated fuel are being transported to the \nDepartment of Energy's Savannah River facility. The safety record of \nthese shipments speaks for itself.\n  They come into the Port of Charleston, SC. They are loaded off the \nships and on to rail cars, and then transported to Savannah River. That \nis 2,400 shipments. And they have all been completed safely. And I \nthink, again, the safety record of these shipments speaks for itself.\n  Again, this is spent fuel that is already being shipped across the \nUnited States, so it is no longer a question of technology but becomes \none of politics.\n  Even so, modifications have been made to this legislation to further \nensure that all spent fuel will be transported safely.\n  Mr. President, for too long our States, our ratepayers and taxpayers, \nhave been threatened by a policy, again, one of inaction. As passed out \nof the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, this legislation sets up \na reasonable deadline for the DOE to finally live up to its promises. \nWe cannot, in good conscience, delay that deadline any further. It is \nunreasonable to ask the taxpayers to sacrifice any further for a \ndepartment that has failed--a department that has failed--to do its \njob.\n  So I am here today also to urge my colleagues to take a giant step \nforward in moving this legislation closer to Senate passage by voting \nfor cloture and allowing the bill to be debated.\n  Again, this is not a question of science. It is not a question of \ntechnology. And I do not believe it is a question of safety in \ntransportation. But it has become a plain question of politics. Will \nthe political decisions be made to allow this bill and the solving of \nthis problem to go forward? I think this bill is the first step in that \ndirection. As I said, I urge my colleagues to support this.\n  I want to thank you, Mr. President, very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BRYAN.

Mr. President, as a result of the recent recess of the U.S. \nSenate, I did not get the opportunity to come to the Senate floor and \nrecognize Sunday, April 6, 1997, as Tartan Day. This day is set aside \nto honor the millions of Scottish-Americans who have made outstanding \ncontributions to our great country.\n  This date has a special significance for all those of Scottish \nheritage. It is the 677th anniversary of the Declaration of Arbroath--\nthe Scottish Declaration of Independence which was signed on April 6, \n1320.\n  This declaration of independence includes these inspirational lines: \n``* * * we fight not for glory, nor riches, nor honors, but for freedom \nalone, which no good man gives up, except with his life.''\n   Mr. President, Scottish-Americans have left their mark as pioneers \nand innovators in the fields of science, technology, medicine, \ngovernment, politics, economics, architecture, literature, the media, \nand the visual and performing arts. Their contributions to the history \nand development of the United States are invaluable.\n  Some of these great past and present Scottish-Americans include: Neil \nArmstrong, Alexander Graham Bell, Andrew Carnegie, Julia Child, Hugh \nDowns, Thomas Alva Edison, Malcom S. Forbes, Katherine Hepburn, Billy \nGraham, Brit Hume, Washington Irving, Robert MacNeil, William Holmes \nMcGuffey, Andrew Mellon, Samuel B. Morse, Grandma Moses, James \nNaismith, Edgar Allen Poe, Willard Scott, Robert Louis Stevenson, \nGilbert Stuart, Elizabeth Taylor, and James McNeil Whistler just to \nmention a few.\n   Mr. President. Almost 11 percent of all the Nobel Prizes awarded \nhave gone to people of Scottish ancestry.\n   Mr. President. A Tartan provides an instant recognition of a family \nand its kinship.\n  By recognizing Tartan Day we are commemorating all that is best in \nScottish heritage. I believe it is important for the Senate to pause, \neven if it is belated, and to recognize Tartan Day. I firmly believe it \nwill further emphasize the many Scottish contributions to the growth \nand development of the United States.\n   Mr. President. As I look around the Senate Chamber I see many who \ncan claim Scottish ancestry. I see my colleague and friend, John \nMcCain. His family ancestry and my mother's actually goes back to four \nScottish families who migrated to Carroll County, MS, back in the \n1830's. I see others in this Chamber--Judd Gregg and Kay Bailey \nHutchison, and there are many more. Every day the Scottish in this \nChamber live by the words in the Declaration of Arbroath that I \nquoted--they are here to advance freedom.\n   Mr. President. When our Nation was founded, almost half of the \nsigners of America's Declaration of Independence were of Scottish \ndescent. Throughout the history of our country three-fourths of our \nPresidents have been of Scottish ancestry. This tells me that despite \nthe fact they are few in number, Scots tend to take seriously the word \nfrom the Declaration of Arbroath.\n  Many organizations were involved in making the observance of Tartan \nDay on April 6 a success. There are clan societies, clubs, and \nfraternal associations and individual Scots-Americans representing \nliterally millions of\n\n[[Page S2787]]\n\nAmericans nationwide that participated. They include the Scots' \nCharitable Society (the oldest charitable society in the United \nStates), the St. Andrew's Society of the City of Charleston, SC (the \nfirst St. Andrew's Society in the United States), the Saint Andrew's \nSociety of New York, (the second oldest society in the United States); \nScottish Society of Martha's Vineyard, MA; the American-Scottish \nFoundation, Inc.; the Association of Scottish Games and Festivals; the \nCaledonian Foundation, Inc.; the Clans of Scotland, USA; Council of \nScottish Clans and Associations; Scottish Heritage USA, Inc.; the \nIllinois St. Andrew's Society; the Tartan Education and Cultural \nAssociation, Inc.; Highland Light Scottish Society, Massachusetts; \nScottish Historic and Research Society of the Delaware Valley, PA, and \nnumerous individual Scottish Americans including those from my own \nState of Mississippi.\n   Mr. President. I am proud to declare my Scottish-American ancestry \nand it is an honor to recognize the 677th anniversary of the \nDeclaration of Arbroath. Tartan Day is indeed a significant day for all \nAmericans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/07/senate-section/article/S2786-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, in his ``Democracy in America,'' Alexis \nde Tocqueville observed ``Americans of all ages, all stations in life * \n* * are forever forming associations.'' Be it to repair a public \nthoroughfare or to promote temperance, de Tocqueville noted volunteer \nassociations were Americans' best response to community needs and to \ncultural pathologies.\n  This observation, made over 150 years ago, certainly has been the \ncase until a little over a decade ago. Volunteers have nurtured the \nelderly, they have coached generations of children, they have cleaned \nup our communities, they have supported and counseled those in need \nthroughout American history.\n  I look back at my time as Governor of the State of Missouri when we \nstarted the Clean the Highways Program using volunteers. We had 5,000 \ngroups of volunteers--5,000 groups, not 5,000 volunteers--who accepted \nresponsibility. It is a sort of fulfillment of de Tocqueville's \nobservation about America, that Americans of all ages, of all stations \nin life are forming associations to do good things.\n  These groups have been catalysts that interact with all elements of \nour culture. It is to volunteers that we owe a great deal of gratitude \nfor our social cohesion--our sense of community in America. When things \nare done from the perspective of government, people view them as \nentitlements. When things are done by individuals because they \nvolunteer, people know that we love one another. Basically, it is in \nour care and regard for each other--expressed when we do things on a \nvoluntary basis--that is the real glue that binds us together as \ncommunities and holds us together as a culture.\n  It was in 1982 that the first warning signs went out that our \nintricate system of volunteers fulfilling social work was under attack. \nIn Runnemede, NJ, a Little League coach volunteer was sued because he \nrepositioned his Little League shortstop to the outfield, and in the \noutfield the Little League shortstop then misjudged a flyball and \nsustained an eye injury. A suit was filed on the allegation that the \n10-year-old youngster was a born shortstop, but not an outfielder, and \nthe courts found the volunteer coach negligent.\n  Over the next 5 years, liability rates for Little League baseball \nshort up from $75 to $795 forcing many leagues to stop playing.\n  In another example, a boy in a Scouting unit with the Boy Scouts of \nthe Cascade Pacific Council suffered a paralyzing injury in a game of \ntouch football. Several adults volunteered to supervise the trip. The \nyouth filed a personal injury suit alleging that the Boy Scouts and the \nvolunteers were negligent for failing to supervise him adequately.\n  I remember playing aggressive games as a Boy Scout. I remember \nplaying a game we called fox over the hill. One group was supposed to \nrun from one line to the other line without getting tackled, pummeled, \nand roughed up. That is the way boys operate. That is part of boyhood. \nBut the jury found that the volunteers were personally liable for some \n$7 million. Oregon law caused the judgment to be reduced to around $4 \nmillion, but few Boy Scout volunteers can afford that kind of a \njudgment.\n  The jury held the volunteers to a heightened standard of care, \ncharging them with a meticulous constant supervision level of care in \ntheir supervision over activities that routinely have been permitted \nwithout oversight. Such a standard is impossible to uphold. Anyone who \nhas been a Boy Scout or certainly tried to supervise Boy Scouts knows \nthat such a standard would be very difficult, and such an impossible \nstandard has basically caused a marked drop off in voluntarism across \nthe country.\n  In fact, the Gallup organization studied voluntarism and, in a study \ntitled the ``Liability Crisis and the Use of Volunteers of Nonprofit \nAssociations,'' the Gallup organization found that approximately 1 in \n10 nonprofit organizations has experienced the resignation of a \nvolunteer due to liability concerns and that 1 in 6 volunteers reported \nwithholding services due to a fear of exposure to liability suits.\n\n  What we have basically done in the last two decades is to send a \nsignal to people: If you volunteer to be helpful, you could jeopardize \nthe well-being of your own family; you could make it very difficult to \nmaintain the home and lifestyle to which you have become accustomed; in \ntrying to help others, you might, as a matter of fact, hurt yourself. I \nthink that is sad because it has reduced this good impulse of \nAmericans.\n  The study also found that 1 of 7 nonprofit agencies had eliminated \none or more of their valuable programs because of exposure to lawsuits. \nSo, instead of having more programs to help more people, we have \nnarrowed that because of the threat of lawsuits and the potential of \nliability. Sixteen percent of volunteer board members surveyed reported \nwithholding their services to an organization out of fear of \nliability--16 percent. That is almost 1 out of every 6 volunteer board \nmembers said, ``No, I'm going to think carefully about whether I'm \ngoing to be on the board, because I don't want to get sued, and I don't \nwant to ruin the chances of my family to live properly just because \nsome mistake is made somewhere.\n  The average reported increase for insurance premiums for nonprofits \nover the previous 3 years, from 1985 to 1988, was 155 percent. That was \nover the years prior to the study, a 155 percent increase in insurance. \nAnd one in eight organizations reported an increase of over 300 \npercent. So, nonprofits found an increase in their insurance premiums. \nThese numbers demonstrate rather clearly that the cost of lawsuits and \nthe excessive unpredictable and often arbitrary nature of damage awards \nhave a direct and a chilling effect on the spirit of voluntarism and on \nthe nature of our communities.\n  I do not want to wring from the fabric of American society that \nhealthy component that lubricates our social exchanges, the component \nof caring and loving and dealing with and helping each other, but if \nour legal system makes it dangerous to help each other and dangerous to \ncare and dangerous to volunteer, we will have done this great country a \ntremendous disservice. Voluntarism is one of these defining \ncharacteristics of American culture. The understanding that people have \nbeen historically willing to help one another is a mainstay of who we \nare as Americans.\n  The hyperlitigious nature of the civil justice system is creating a \nbarrier between the desire of Americans to help others and their \nability to do so. So, Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill \nthat will offer a new level of protection to volunteers who give \nselflessly of themselves to help others. The Liability Reform for \nVolunteer Services Act will reinstate reason, it will reinstate \nrationality, it will reinstate certainly and fairness to a judicial \nsystem with regard to voluntarism.\n  The Liability Reform for Volunteer Services Act covers volunteer \nservices organizations which are defined as nonprofit organizations \nthat are organized for the public benefit and operated primarily for \ncharitable, civic, educational, religious, welfare, or health purposes. \nHealth care providers, however, specifically are excluded from \ncoverage. Many of them fly under the banner or nonprofit, but we all \nknow that they are anything but volunteer organizations, and they are \nnot, in many respects, charitable. Persons volunteering for service \norganizations or governmental entities are covered by the bill if they \nare acting in good faith, within the scope of their official duties, \nand not being compensated for their services. This really is an effort \nto say to that person that volunteers, ``We are going to give you a \nfair situation in which to volunteer, and if you are not being \ncompensated, we are still going to hold you to the standard which \nrequires you to have good behavior, but we are not going to expose you \nto tremendous liability.''\n  The bill establishes a standard for awarding punitive damages. It is \na rather high standard for awarding punitive damages which is designed \nto punish defendants or defer others from engaging in the same activity \nagainst the volunteer services organization or the volunteer. An \ninjured party would be required to establish by ``clear and convincing \nevidence'' that a volunteer organization or its volunteers acted with a \n``conscious and flagrant indifference'' to the rights or safety of \nothers and this conduct caused the harm for which the volunteer is \nbeing sued.\n\n  The clear and convincing standard is greater than the standard for \nmost\n\n[[Page S2789]]\n\ncivil cases, which is merely the preponderance of the evidence, but it \nis less than the criminal standard which is beyond a reasonable doubt. \nThe clear and convincing standard is a higher standard than the more-\nlikely-than-not or preponderance of the evidence standard, but, \nobviously, it is less than the criminal standard of beyond a reasonable \ndoubt.\n  Punitive damages would be capped so that punitive damages could not \nexceed $250,000, or twice the economic and noneconomic losses. So, \nactual damages would not be affected here. If there were real damages, \nthey would be recoverable, but punitive damages would be capped. In \nother words, if there were to be punitive damages, not only would they \nbe capped at a maximum of $250,000, or twice the economic damages, you \nwould have to be able to provide that there was clear and convincing \nevidence that there was a conscious and flagrant indifference to the \nrights or safety of others.\n  Given either party the right to separate any court's proceeding \ncovered by the act into two parts, the first would determine whether \nthe volunteer or service organization is liable to the injured party, \nand the second would be to determine whether punitive damages should be \nawarded.\n  A volunteer services organization or volunteer would only be \nresponsible in proportion to its degree of fault. That would mean that \nthere would not be the kind of joint liability. If the Salvation Army \nwere 10 percent responsible and some other organization 90 percent \nresponsible, and the organization that was 90 percent responsible did \nnot cover all of their 90 percent in the case, the Salvation Army would \nnot be asked to pick up the tab for the other organization. It would \nonly be responsible for that damage that it had been found to have \ncaused.\n  I do not single out one of the most virtuous organizations in \nAmerica, suggesting that they might ever be liable, but if there were a \ncase against a charitable organization like that, that would be the \nframework for adjudicating and awarding damages. A volunteer services \norganization or volunteer only would be responsible for damages in \nproportion to the degree of fault that was found on their part.\n  The protections provided for in this Bill would not apply if the \nactivity for which damages were awarded constitutes a crime of violence \nor terrorism. If the volunteer commits a hate crime or is convicted of \na civil rights violation these protections would not apply. If a \nvolunteer is convicted of a sexual offense under State law, these \nprotections would not apply. In addition, if a volunteer is found to \nhave been under the influence of alcohol or drugs when the incident \ngiving rise to the litigation occurs and that influence caused the \nharm, these protections would not apply. This is not a bill designed to \nauthorize people to be high on drugs or alcohol or to commit crimes \nwhen they are volunteering. In those instances, the sky would be the \nlimit. We would be under the old system.\n  Let me just say that volunteers do play an integral part in America, \nin community service. They should not have to fear litigation. They \nshould not have to withdraw from giving themselves to those in need. \nThe Gallup study shows we have had a withdrawal of talent from the \nvolunteer pool. This is the time when we need more Americans being \ninvolved in community in a sense of helping each other, not less.\n  In conclusion, let me just make the following observations. The basis \nfor the American community and culture is, in large measure, the result \nof voluntarism. Alexis de Tocqueville said this is what makes America \n``America.'' America is great because America is benevolent--this \ngoodness is the impetus within us to help each other.\n\n  We have had a development of a legal system which has made that very \ndifficult and costly for volunteers. In a very focused and balanced \nway, we are trying to say to people that their liability for acts in \nthe volunteer community should be limited only to economic damages \nunless there is a very flagrant disregard for the rights of others and, \nin those events, punitive damages should be limited.\n  I believe that this measure will help restore to the American people \nthe capacity to be caring and giving people, to live with each other in \na sense of community--bound together by the glue of mutual concern--in \nservice to one another in valuable and selfless ways.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 514\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Liability Reform for \n     Volunteer Services Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the increasingly litigious nature of the legal \n     profession in the United States has created an unnecessary \n     and ultimately harmful barrier between the traditional desire \n     of individuals to help other individuals and their ability to \n     act on those desires;\n       (2) the cost of lawsuits, excessive, unpredictable, and \n     often arbitrary damage awards, and unfair allocations of \n     liability have a direct and chilling effect on the spirit of \n     volunteerism and the provision of charitable service in the \n     United States;\n       (3) arbitrary and capricious damage awards against \n     volunteers and charitable institutions have contributed \n     considerably to the high cost of liability insurance, making \n     it difficult and often impossible for volunteers and \n     volunteer service organizations to be protected from \n     liability as those volunteers and many volunteer service \n     organizations serve the public without regard to receiving \n     any personal or institutional economic benefits from that \n     service;\n       (4) as a result, volunteer service organizations throughout \n     the United States have been adversely affected and often \n     debilitated as volunteers have refused to help because of a \n     fear of frivolous lawsuits;\n       (5) without a resurgence in volunteerism, the essential \n     services that volunteer service organizations provide, \n     including crisis counseling, volunteer rescue services, \n     coaches and referees for sports activities of children, and \n     support for the elderly, will continue to diminish;\n       (6) clarifying and limiting the personal liability risks \n     assumed by individuals and institutions who volunteer to help \n     others without benefit to themselves is an appropriate \n     subject for Federal legislation because--\n       (A) of the national scope of the problems created by the \n     legitimate fears of volunteers about frivolous, arbitrary, or \n     capricious lawsuits; and\n       (B) the citizens of the United States depend on, and the \n     Federal Government expends funds on, numerous social programs \n     that depend on the services of volunteers; and\n       (C) it is in the interest of the Federal Government to \n     encourage the continued operation of volunteer service \n     organizations and contributions of volunteers because the \n     Federal Government lacks the capacity to carry out all of the \n     services provided by such organizations and volunteers; and\n       (7) liability reform for volunteer service organizations \n     will promote the free flow of goods and services, lessen \n     burdens on interstate commerce and uphold constitutionally \n     protected due process rights and that liability reform is \n     thus an appropriate use of the powers contained in Article I, \n     Section 8, Clause 3 of the United States Constitution, and \n     the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to provide \n     protection from personal financial liability for volunteers \n     and volunteer service organizations that provide volunteer \n     services that are conducted in good faith--\n       (1) to promote the interests of social service program \n     beneficiaries and taxpayers; and\n       (2) to sustain the availability of programs, volunteer \n     service organizations, and governmental entities that depend \n     on volunteer contributions and services; and\n       (3) to provide the protection by--\n       (A) placing reasonable limits on punitive damages;\n       (B) ensuring the fair allocation of liability in certain \n     civil actions; and\n       (C) establishing greater fairness, rationality, and \n     predictability in the civil justice system of the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

UNIFORM STANDARD FOR AWARD OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES.\n\n       Punitive damages may, to the extent permitted by applicable \n     State or Federal law, be awarded against a defendant if the \n     claimant establishes by clear and convincing evidence that \n     conduct carried out by the defendant with a conscious, \n     flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of others was \n     the proximate cause of the harm that is the subject of the \n     action in any civil action for a claim described in \n     subparagraph (A) or (B) of section 4(a)(1).\n\n     SEC. 6.

PREEMPTION.\n\n       (a) In General.--This Act does not--\n       (1) create a cause of action for punitive or compensatory \n     damages; or\n       (2) preempt or supersede any State or Federal law to the \n     extent that such law further limits the amount of an award of \n     punitive or compensatory damages.\n       (b) Remittitur.--Nothing in this section shall modify or \n     reduce the ability of courts to grant a remittitur.\n\n     SEC. 8. APPLICATION BY COURT.\n\n       The application of the limitation imposed by section 6 may \n     not be disclosed to a jury by a court.

BIFURCATION AT REQUEST OF ANY PARTY.\n\n       (a) In General.--At the request of any party the trier of \n     fact, in any action for punitive damages that is subject to \n     this Act, shall consider in a separate proceeding, held \n     subsequent to the determination of the amount of compensatory \n     damages, whether punitive damages are to be awarded for the \n     harm that is the subject of the action and the amount of the \n     award.\n       (b) Inadmissibility of Evidence Relevant Only to a Claim of \n     Punitive Damages in a Proceeding Concerning Compensatory \n     Damages.--If any party requests a separate proceeding under \n     subsection (a), in a proceeding to determine whether the \n     claimant may be awarded compensatory damages, any evidence, \n     argument, or contention that is relevant only to the claim of \n     punitive damages, as determined by applicable State law, \n     shall be inadmissible.\n\n     SEC. 10. LIABILITY FOR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--In any action described in subparagraph \n     (A) or (B) of section 4(a)(1) brought against more than one \n     defendant, the liability of each defendant for compensatory \n     damages shall be determined in accordance with this section.\n       (b) Amount of Liability for Compensatory Damages.--\n       (1) In general.--Each defendant shall be liable only for \n     the amount of compensatory damages allocated by the trier of \n     fact to the defendant in direct proportion to the percentage \n     of responsibility of the defendant (determined in accordance \n     with paragraph (2)) for the harm to the claimant with respect \n     to which the defendant is found to be liable. The court shall \n     render a separate judgment against each defendant in an \n     amount determined pursuant to the preceding sentence.\n       (2) Percentage of responsibility.--For purposes of \n     determining the amount of compensatory damages allocated to a \n     defendant under this section, the trier of fact in an action \n     described in subsection (a) shall determine the percentage of \n     responsibility of each person responsible for the harm to the \n     claimant, without regard to whether that person is party to \n     the action.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Akaka, Mr. \n        Inouye, Mr. Robb, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Moynihan, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n        Wellstone, Ms. Moseley-\n\n[[Page S2791]]\n\n        Braun, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Feingold, and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 516. A bill to amend section 1977A of the Revised Statutes to \nequalize the remedies available to all victims of intentional \nemployment discrimination, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                     The Equal Remedies Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce the Equal \nRemedies Act of 1997, for myself and 13 other sponsors. The purpose of \nour legislation is to end a glaring inequality in the current Federal \nantidiscrimination laws.\n  The Civil Rights Act of 1991 gave women, religious minorities, and \ndisabled persons the right to recover compensatory and punitive damages \nfor intentional employment discrimination, but only up to specified \nmonetary limits. By contrast, victims of such discrimination on the \nbasis of race or national origin can recover damages without such \nlimitations.\n  The Equal Remedies Act of 1997 will end this double standard by \nremoving the caps on damages for victims of intentional job \ndiscrimination on the basis of sex, religion, or disability. No one \nshould be subject to second-class remedies under our civil rights laws. \nVictims of discrimination who suffer injuries deserve a full remedy for \nthose injuries, without arbitrary limits.\n  The caps serve no justifiable purpose. The standard of proof and the \ndefinition of intentional discrimination are identical under the Civil \nRights Act of 1991 and the longstanding race discrimination statute. \nThere is no reason to expect significantly more litigation, or \nsignificantly larger jury awards if the caps are removed.\n  For the vast majority of victims of intentional discrimination, the \ncaps do not affect the amount of damages. But, for others--victims with \nthe most serious injuries from intentional discrimination--the caps are \nan unfair barrier to recovering full damages for their injuries. \nEmployers who have committed the most outrageous acts of discrimination \nwill no longer be shielded from full responsibility.\n  The double standard in current law protects the worst lawbreakers and \ndenies relief to those who have been harmed the most. By enacting the \nEqual Remedies Act of 1997, Congress will be affirming the basic \nprinciple of equal justice for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 516\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Equal Remedies Act of \n     1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EQUALIZATION OF REMEDIES.\n\n       Section 1977A of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1981a) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (b)--\n       (A) by striking paragraph (3); and\n       (B) by redesignating paragraph (4) as paragraph (3); and\n       (2) in subsection (c), by striking ``section--'' and all \n     that follows through the period and inserting ``section, any \n     party may demand a jury trial.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/07/senate-section/article/S2787-10", "month":

STASSEN CELEBRATES HIS 90TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Harold \nEdward Stassen who will be celebrating his 90th birthday on April 13, \n1997. Harold Stassen has an outstanding record of public and military \nservice to America. There is no question that his unique contributions \nhave left a lasting impression on not only the history of his home \nState and his country, but at an international level as well.\n\n[[Page S2793]]\n\n  In 1938, at the age of 31, Harold Stassen was elected Governor of \nMinnesota and remained our Nation's youngest Governor until 1943. He \nthen resigned to accept a commission in the U.S. Navy where he attained \nthe rank of captain during World War II. He also won the Legion of \nMerit, three other decorations, and was awarded six major battle stars. \nMoreover, he was personally responsible for freeing thousands of \nAmerican prisoners of war in Japan shortly before that country's \nsurrender.\n  Although Mr. Stassen also served as a key adviser in a variety of \ninfluential posts throughout the Eisenhower administration, he will be \nbest remembered for his service under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. \nAt the President's personal request, Harold Stassen served on the \nAmerican delegation to the 1945 San Francisco Conference that founded \nthe United Nations. Indeed, he is now the only living American who \ndrafted, negotiated, and signed the original U.N. Charter. Moreover, \nMr. Stassen has maintained a dedicated, passionate interest in the U.N. \nsince its founding--educating the American public about the United \nNations, and striving to make the organization more effective.\n  Harold Stassen is celebrating his 90th birthday just 2 years after we \ncelebrated the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. On April 13, \nnumerous national and State officials, including former Vice President \nand United States Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale, will come to St. \nPaul, MN, to honor Mr. Stassen.\n  As Harold Stassen commemorates this significant milestone it is \nindeed an honor for me to join with his family, friends, and colleagues \nin conveying my warmest birthday wishes to this remarkable American and \nfellow Minnesotan who has such a proud and exceptional record of \ndistinguished public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/07/senate-section/article/S2792-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO GEORGE R.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to George Roorbach of Franconia, NH, former president of Crown \nWorsted Mills, for his outstanding service as a volunteer executive in \nKrasnodar, Russia.\n  George worked on a volunteer mission with the International Executive \nService Corps, a nonprofit organization which sends retired Americans \nto assist businesses and private enterprises in the developing \ncountries and the new emerging democracies of Central and Eastern \nEurope and the former Soviet Union.\n  George helped provide managerial and technical assistance to improve \nthe lives of people in Krasnodar, Russia. He assisted Kubantex, a wool \nfabric manufacturer, to set up a business, marketing and financial \nplan. George was ambassador for our country and has represented our \ndemocratic believes and methods of a free market economy.\n  His outstanding patriotic engagement provides active assistance for \npeople in need and helps build strong ties of trust and respect between \nRussia and America. George's mission aids to end the cycle of \ndependency on foreign assistance.\n  I commend George for his dedicated service and I am proud to \nrepresent him in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/07/senate-section/article/S2793-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO ROLLAND LOWE, M.D.\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nRolland Lowe, M.D., who was installed on March 24 as the 132d president \nof the California Medical Association, the largest State medical \nassociation.

He currently holds a position as \na member on the board of trustees for the hospital and is the former \nchair.\n  Dr. Lowe has served as president of the San Francisco Medical Society \nin addition to serving on the California Medical Association's board of \ntrustees since 1987.\n  In addition to distinguishing himself in his career, Dr. Lowe has \nbeen a role model for the community through his philanthropic work and \ncommunity activism. He serves on dozens of the boards of organizations. \nHe also has founded and currently is the chair of the Lawrence Choy \nLowe Memorial Fund in Chinatown.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Dr. Lowe for his \ncommitment to the people of San Francisco and congratulating him on \nthis achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/07/senate-section/article/S2793-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2793-S2794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JAMES D. BOND\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today, it is with great pleasure \nand appreciation, mixed with a certain measure of sadness, that I rise \nto recognize and pay tribute to Mr. James D. Bond on the occasion of \nhis retirement from a long and distinguished career on the staff of the \nSenate Committee on Appropriations.\n  For the past 20 years, Mr. Bond has served the Senate on the staff of \nthe Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related \nAgencies as either the clerk or the minority staff director. Throughout \nthis time, his expertise and leadership have proven invaluable to the \ncommittee's work on appropriations and oversight of the economic and \nmilitary assistance programs of the United States. Senators on both \nsides of the aisle are indebted to him for his sage advice, honest \ncounsel, and tireless effort. His contributions to legislation on \nAmerican foreign policy have been numerous, including his original \ndrafts of laws ranging from Israeli loan guarantees to the creation of \nthe Development Fund for Africa. On foreign operations matters, Jim \nBond has been the key liaison with Members of the House of \nRepresentatives; officials within the Department of State, the Agency \nfor International Development, the Export-Import Bank, the Overseas \nPrivate Investment Corporation, the Trade and Development Agency, and \nother agencies of the U.S. Government; as well as international \norganizations, including multilateral development banks and U.N. \nagencies; and public interest groups. Mr. President, the breadth of his \ngrasp and the depth of his understanding of the process and the issues \nis unparalleled; he will be sorely missed.\n  Prior to his service with the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Mr. \nBond worked as the minority staff director for the Subcommittee on HUD \nand Space Science, Subcommittee on Agriculture, Subcommittee on Public \nWorks, and the Subcommittee on the Interior. He also served on the \nstaff of our former colleague, Milton Young, as a legislative \nassistant. After 25 years of work in the Senate, I know that he is \nhighly respected by staff and Senators alike. I and many of my \ncolleagues are proud to call him our friend. Mr. President, a man who \nis called friend by Pat Leahy and Jake Garn, by Mitch McConnell and Mac \nMathias, by Ted Stevens and Howard Metzenbaum--such a man is remarkable \nindeed.\n  Mr. Bond's public service is not limited to his work with the Senate. \nFor several years, he has been an adjunct professor at Georgetown \nUniversity, teaching a course on the appropriations process in the \nGraduate Public Policy Program, as well as lecturing at Marquette \nUniversity's Les Aspin center and the American University's Washington \nSemester. Through his teaching, Mr. Bond shares his knowledge and \nexperience with America's future leaders.\n  Jim Bond began his service to our country during the Vietnam war, \nwhen he served in the infantry with the 101st Airborne Division, 327th \nInfantry Battalion. For his service and heroism, he was awarded the \nBronze Star and Combat Infantryman's Badge.\n  Mr. President, Jim Bond has served this institution with honor and \nconviction. He has served the citizens for whom we all work in an \nexemplary fashion. Our work has been enhanced by his contributions. I \nam confident that Mr. Bond will continue his commitment to American \ngovernment and will utilize his knowledge and experience toward the \nbetterment of our foreign policy and trade relations. I am sure he will \ncontinue his humanitarian work for the poor of the world. I know he \nwill continue his efforts to sustain American prosperity in an era of \nincreased competition.\n\n[[Page S2794]]\n\n  Mr. President, I wish Jim Bond well as he leaves the Senate. I know \nour paths will cross again and I will welcome him. I ask my colleagues \nto join me in honoring Mr. Bond for his service and congratulating him \non his retirement from the staff of the U.S. Senate.\n  Aloha Jim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/07/senate-section/article/S2793-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO THE 16 DEDICATED NEW HAMPSHIRE VOLUNTEERS OF THE DOMINICAN \n                     REPUBLIC MEDICAL MISSION TEAM\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to 16 dedicated volunteers from New Hampshire who willingly \ndevoted countless hours and tremendous energy to provide free medical \nand dental care to the people of the Dominican Republic. Last month, \nthe volunteers of the Medical Mission Team traveled to the Dominican \nRepublic where they operated free medical and dental clinics for a week \nand treated numerous people who normally cannot afford medical care. I \ncommend all 16 volunteers for their genuine concern and true commitment \nto such an honorable cause. I am very proud of their unending support \nfor the needy people of the Dominican Republic.\n  Months of careful planning and preparation allowed the Medical \nMission Team to venture into different areas of the Dominican Republic \nto treat a variety of patients. The team members included: Dr. Mark \nMcDonald; his wife, Ruth; and daughter, Jill; Jack Meibaum; his wife, \nJoanne Parkington; and son, David Parkington; Dr. Marianne Hopkins; and \nher husband, Dr. Andrew Hopkins; Werner Muller; and David Gabrielli, \nall from Concord; Claire Roberge, of Epsom; Don Gagne, of Penacook; \nDoug Tabor, of Boscawen; Gordon Barrett, of West Swanzey; and Lisa Ann \nWiener and George Rogers, both from Bow.\n  Prior to the February mission trip, the volunteers met regularly in \nthe evenings to learn minor medical care, repair pieces of dental \nequipment, build specially designed dental units, and plan the details \nof the clinics. Jack Meibaum, a contractor; Dr. Mark McDonald, a \nConcord dentist; and others salvaged old dental equipment and spent \nmany hours in their basements updating and improving the equipment for \nthe medical work they would perform.\n  After discussing the trip with New Hampshire businesses and \norganizations, and several pharmaceutical companies, Jack and Mark \nsolicited critical donations for the trip. The Bow Rotary Club donated \nfunds for a dental equipment compressor, A & B Lumber in Concord sold \nthe compressor to the team at cost, and the Concord Tire Co. generously \ngave donated money for medical and dental supplies. Siemens X-ray Co. \nalso donated a portable dental x-ray machine and numerous national \npharmaceutical companies provided free or discounted medical and dental \nsupplies. In the end, the team had so many supplies that they even had \ndifficulty getting the large, overstuffed suitcases of supplies through \ncustoms with the local officials at the Puerta Plata Airport in the \nDominican Republic.\n  Five of the volunteers--Mark, Jack, Doug Tabor, Don Gagne, and Claire \nRoberge--made up the first team to arrive. During their first 3 days, \nthe team made daily trips to a small church in Moca where they worked \ntirelessly unpacking bulky dental equipment that had been shipped \nseparately in a crate from New Hampshire. I was honored to have helped \nget this crate shipped to the Dominican Republic after the team asked \nfor my assistance.\n  In addition to numerous other tasks, Jack and Mark set up the \nportable dental units making certain the air and water pumps worked on \nthe dental units while Don, Claire, and Doug constructed a stand for \nthe indispensable dental light. Doug's construction expertise was very \nhelpful, Jack and Mark demonstrated their engineering brilliance in \nbuilding equipment, and Claire and Don were energetic and happy to do \neven the most mundane tasks. All five volunteers worked until they were \nexhausted to ensure the equipment would run efficiently when used for \nthe clinics the following week.\n\n  The remaining team members arrived on Friday, February 21, bringing \nmore medical supplies, and helped make the final preparations for the \nlong-awaited clinics.\n  For an entire week, the medical and dental teams treated the needs of \nnumerous Dominican patients. Jack cleaned teeth for hours, Mark and Don \nfilled cavities, and Jill, Lisa, and David sterilized dental equipment \nand developed dental x rays. At the medical clinic locations, Marianne, \na pediatrician, and her husband, Andrew, who is also a doctor, treated \nendless lines of needy patients rarely taking a break even for lunch. \nMothers came in with babies that had parasites, an elderly man \ncomplained of arthritis, a young boy's cut and infected feet were \ncleaned, two little girls were treated for asthma, and other sick \nDominicans asked for assistance. Joanne, Claire, Werner, and George \nworked quickly to compile each patient's medical history and check \ntheir temperature and blood pressure. The medical team had prepared so \nthoroughly that they even brought preprinted medical charts. Lisa, \nJill, David, and Ruth performed a puppet show for the waiting children \nand Gordon, a professional photographer, documented everyone's efforts. \nThe demand for dental and medical care was truly overwhelming. The team \nworked long hours each day to ease the pain and anxiety of so many \npeople.\n  On the first day of the medical clinic, a young woman came in with \nher very sick 2-year-old boy. According to his mother, the little boy \nhad cut his head while playing in one of the typically filthy ditches \nthat carried trash and sewage. He was sick from an infection. Twice \nduring the next 2 days, Marianne treated the little boy for the \nterrible infection that had spread through his body. The medical team \nwas very concerned that he would not be able to fight off the infection \nuntil Tuesday morning when Marianne could hook him up to an IV. They \nhad witnessed their worst fear--a dying child.\n  Just 2 days later in the morning, as the medical team had just set up \na second clinic in Moca, the little boy made an appearance. He walked \ninto the clinic with his mother following behind. Upon seeing the \nphenomenal progress the little boy had made, the entire medical team \nbegan clapping exuberantly. Soon the clapping changed to cheers and \nwords of relief that echoed their greatest feeling of accomplishment--\nsaving a life. I was very impressed with this story, relayed to me by \none of my staffers, Anna Matz, who volunteered her time to participate \nin the mission.\n  For a over a week, these New Hampshire volunteers poured endless \nenergy into helping the many Dominicans that ventured into the clinics. \nTheir work was exhausting but very fulfilling. Toward the end of the \nweek, the dental and medical clinics became mobile and operated in \nneighborhoods where children and families were the most sick. At one \npoint, the medical team went into a barrio, a very poor neighborhood, \nand knocked on each door asking if any family members needed medical \ncare.\n  While the 16 New Hampshire volunteers worked day after day, several \nAmerican missionaries and a few native Dominicans provided support and \nassistance. Paul and Eileen Allyn, American missionaries in Santa \nDomingo, oversaw the teams' every need with Marge and John Gudmunsun, \nother missionaries.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a true \npublic servant and a dear friend, Bernard Neville of Cromwell, CT.\n  Bernie was honored this past Saturday as the Democrat of the Year by \nthe Cromwell Democratic Town Committee, for his nearly 25 years of \nservice as Cromwell's town clerk and treasurer. I join all the \nresidents of Cromwell in congratulating and honoring Bernie on his \nimpressive record of achievement.\n\n[[Page S2795]]\n\n  Over the past 30 years, Bernie has also been a loyal and faithful \nDemocrat. He's not only served as chairman of the town committee, but \nseveral times worked as cocoordinator of Congresswoman Barbara \nKennelly's election campaign. Most of all, he s been an invaluable \nasset in energizing and registering Democratic voters.\n  The fact is, public servants like Bernard Neville serve as the \nbackbone of our democracy. They don't receive much attention, but they \nare truly an essential element of our representative government.\n  You don't often see them on Sunday talk shows or on the front page of \nthe New York Times, Washington Post, or Hartford Courant. They're not \nmuch interested in partisanship or political maneuvering. But, on a \nlocal level they ensure that public services are provided and local tax \ndollars are spent wisely.\n  For the past 25 years, Bernie ensured that town elections ran \nsmoothly, citizen petitions and lawsuits were filed correctly, local \nfunds were shrewdly invested and Cromwell's government was working for \nthe benefit of its citizens. In that time, he's done his job with \nprofessionalism, integrity, and a strong commitment to serving the \npeople of Cromwell.\n  I congratulate and thank him for his efforts.\n  I am also pleased to note that even at 83 years young, he plans to \ncontinue working toward his degree at Trinity College, where he is \nmajoring in history. I wish Bernie the best of luck in all his future \nendeavors and congratulate him again on this wonderful honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/07/senate-section/article/S2794-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO GERALDINE DEFANT\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my good friend \nGeraldine DeFant, a visionary leader, who recently passed away. In her \n79 years, she worked tirelessly to help others, especially her fellow \ncitizens of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Her accomplishments have \nestablished her as a legend among Upper Peninsula labor, political, and \nsocial leaders. She came to Marquette County in 1949 to organize the \nemployees of the H.W. Gossard factory in Ishpeming for the \nInternational Ladies Garment Workers Union. She guided the women \nemployees of the factory through a landmark strike that energized the \nlocal labor movement and was the first strike in the Upper Peninsula at \na plant with primarily women workers. The organization of this plant \nhad wage implications for union plants throughout the Nation. In \naddition to organizing the union at this plant, she established a \nkitchen and strike fund for them and classes on labor history. This was \nonly the beginning of her efforts to improve the lives of workers and \ntheir families in the area.\n  Geri was also a longtime activist in the Democratic party, serving as \ndistrict chair, and coordinating campaigns from the local to the \nnational levels. One of her proudest achievements was serving as Upper \nPeninsula Representative for U.S. Senator Phil Hart, who was renowned \nas the ``conscience of the Senate.'' She continued her service in \nSenator Don Riegle's U.P. office. From 1982 to 1991 she served on the \nMarquette County Board of Commissioners where she fought for economic \ndevelopment, mental health and services for seniors. She served on the \nMichigan Women's Commission for 6 years, during which time she \npioneered legislation that allowed the Friend of the Court's office to \ngarnish wages for child support. Most of our Nation now has similar \nlegislation.\n  Geri was a founder and longtime board member of the Marquette Women's \nCenter. She continued her interest in and support of labor issues and \nwas inducted into the U.P. Labor Hall of Fame this past September for \nher many efforts. She was deeply committed to equality and justice. \nGeri was also a friend, mentor, and role-model to countless people over \nthe years.\n  Geri's family was always very important to her and a source of joy \nand pride. She was married to Probate Judge Michael DeFant from 1952 \nuntil his death. They had three children, David, Dan, and Miriam, who \nsurvive her. Her warmth, humor, and dedication will be greatly missed \nby those of us who had the privilege to know Geri. I know my Senate \ncolleagues join me in honoring this exceptional woman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/07/senate-section/article/S2795-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2795-S2796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ``DISECTING THE JONES ACT''\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to call the attention \nof my colleagues to an excellent article by Warren Dean that appeared \nin the March 11, 1997 edition of the Journal of Commerce, which so \neloquently states the reasons why it would be foolish to weaken or \nrepeal the Jones Act.\n  I am a longstanding supporter of the Jones Act and of the American-\nflag Merchant Marine. But it is important for those Members who are \nless familiar with the Merchant Marine to consider Mr. Dean's article. \nMr. Dean is a senior partner in a Washington law firm, and an adjunct \nprofessor of transportation law at Georgetown University Law Center.\n  In his column, Mr. Dean spells out clearly and succinctly the reasons \nAmerica stands to lose if foreign-flag ships and foreign crews are \nallowed to take over our domestic waterborne commerce, and why it would \nbe unfair not only to America's maritime industry but also to our \ntrucking, rail, and pipeline industries as well. If the Jones Act is \neliminated, all these industries would have to abide by U.S. laws and \nregulations, and pay U.S. taxes, while their foreign competitors in our \nNation's domestic market would not. Those who claim they want to \nderegulate domestic shipping and reform the Jones Act would do well to \nread this article. It explains just how poorly thought out and unfair \nsuch actions would be.\n  Mr. President, I request that the full text of the article be printed \nin the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                        Dissecting the Jones Act\n\n                          (By Warren L. Dean)\n\n       Congress is facing an old and tired issue this year--the \n     Jones Act Reform Coalition's clamor to ``deregulate'' \n     domestic deep-water transportation services by repealing the \n     Jones Act. This putative controversy speaks volumes about how \n     poorly Washington understands what it is doing.\n       The Jones Act reserves for qualified U.S. corporations the \n     right to carry domestic waterborne cargoes of the United \n     States. The coalition wants to allow foreign-flag vessels to \n     carry cargoes between points in the United States, such as \n     New York and Miami. Those vessels, however, do not operate \n     subject to U.S. law--and would not, under the coalition's \n     proposals.\n       In an effort to keep the Jones Act Reform Coalition from \n     wasting its members' money, and to help the U.S. government \n     understand the difference between trade in goods and trade in \n     services, I will offer a few thoughts.\n       First, the Jones Act regulates domestic transportation \n     services. Companies in those industries pay U.S. income and \n     excise taxes, employ workers who pay taxes, comply with fair \n     labor standards and other employment laws, meet environmental \n     and safety requirements and face tort and other liabilities.\n       Foreign companies that get involved in U.S. markets usually \n     do so through U.S. affiliates established for that purpose. \n     What the reform coalition is pushing, however, is permission \n     for foreign flag-of-convenience operators to participate in \n     domestic interstate commerce, while taking a pass on as many \n     of the laws applicable to domestic commerce as possible.\n       Just repealing the Jones Act won't do the job, however. \n     What the Jones Act reform coalition is really advocating is a \n     repeal of a variety of U.S. tax and labor laws that are at \n     the heart of the U.S. economy.\n       Under international law, the applicable law on a vessel is \n     that of the ship's registry. So, for example, to allow \n     foreign seamen working for foreign-flag operators to work in \n     U.S. interstate transportation, we would have to waive our \n     tax, immigration, minimum wage, collective bargaining, \n     workplace safety and unemployment laws, among others. We \n     would have to pre-empt state laws in these areas as well.\n       Admittedly, some laws--particularly in the environmental \n     area--currently apply to both U.S. and foreign-flag vessels, \n     and would continue to do so under the coalition's proposal. \n     But what's really going on here is that the coalition is out \n     to create a whole new list of economic preferences--in \n     effect, subsidies--for foreign-flag vessels to ``compete'' in \n     our domestic commerce.\n       The only reason that other domestic transportation \n     industries have not yet objected to this nonsense is that \n     they aren't persuaded that anyone in Washington is that \n     stupid.\n       Their confidence may be misplaced. There actually is a \n     federal agency that spent taxpayer's money to publish a \n     report in 1993 proving that it doesn't have the foggiest idea \n     where its money comes from. It's the U.S. International Trade \n     Commission, which investigates allegations of damage to U.S. \n     industries caused by trade.\n       The ITC report estimated that ``the economy-wide effect of \n     removing the Jones Act is an economic welfare gain to the \n     economy of\n\n[[Page S2796]]\n\n     approximately $3.1 billion.'' The ITC's main source for this \n     conclusion was its own 1991 study that found the 1989 cost to \n     the economy of the Jones Act ranged from $3.6 billion to $9.8 \n     billion.\n       The ITC staff developed these estimates by figuring the \n     difference between U.S. and world shipping rates, and saying \n     the higher U.S. costs are a sort of ``tariff'' charged to \n     shippers using Jones Act vessels.\n       But the flaw in the ITC's analysis is that it took the \n     rates charged by foreign-flag operators using ``flag of \n     convenience'' registry in countries such as Panama, Liberia \n     or the Bahamas. Those nations have either nonexistent or very \n     low rates of taxation and regulation.\n       The ITC then concluded that shippers could obtain world-\n     rate savings in the waterborne domestic commerce of the \n     United States by allowing in competitors who are free of the \n     burdens of U.S. taxation and regulation, and who could \n     compete with land and air modes of transportation that are \n     subject to U.S. regulation and taxation. That premise is, of \n     course, fatally flawed as a matter of law and policy.\n       The ITC doesn't understand the difference between importing \n     shoes and importing transportation services. With shoes, the \n     producer's costs, including associated tax and regulatory \n     burdens, are incurred in the exporting state.\n       With most services, the producer's costs, including \n     associated tax and regulatory burdens, are incurred in the \n     importing state. But the reform coalition wants to change \n     that with respect to domestic maritime transportation, and \n     preserve the law of the flag of registry.\n       The reason is simple: If U.S. tax and regulatory costs were \n     extended to all competitors in domestic trades, whether U.S. \n     or foreign flag, then the savings to shippers from repealing \n     the Jones Act would range from $0 to nearly $0--setting aside \n     the separate cost of building vessels in U.S. yards.\n       There's not much fuel for reform there.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/07/senate-section/article/S2795-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO RICHARD MORGAN ON BEING NAMED THE CENTER OSSIPEE CITIZEN OF \n                                THE YEAR\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nconstituent, a friend, a leader, and a great American. Jack Thompson \nrecently retired from the Monroe Auto Equipment Co. in Michigan after a \nlong and legendary career that is the embodiment of the American dream.\n  Jack started working at Ford Motor Co. in 1957. He later rose from \nthe factory floor to lead a billion-dollar automotive supply company. \nAlong the way, Jack demonstrated what it is to be not only a great \nleader, but a great human being. Jack's respect for the people working \nthe floor drove his manufacturing philosophy throughout his career. His \nexperiences gave him a lifelong respect and admiration for these \nworkers, who are the keystone of success for any company.\n  Jack never measured success by a better title, a bigger office, or \nhigher profits. Jack's success was measured by the success of his \nworkers, whom he continuously cheered on and challenged. He has always \nbeen his workers biggest champion. A telling example of Jack's \nleadership qualities came in 1986 when Jack received the Monroe \nManagement Club's first Manager of the Year Award. Voted by Jack's \nsubordinates, peers, and superiors, the award recognized his excellence \nin not only what he accomplished, but also how he accomplished it.\n  Twenty years ago, Jack put together a 10-point operating philosophy \nthat he used and taught others. The first point on that list says a lot \nabout how Jack approached business and life. It simply said, ``be \ncompletely honest.'' That's just one of the qualities that have made \nJack a shining example to his workers, friends, and neighbors.\n  I know my Senate colleagues join me in honoring Jack Thompson on his \noutstanding career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/07/senate-section/article/S2796-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2796-S2797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY\n\n   Mr. LEVIN. Mr President, I would like to make my colleagues \naware of an important event taking place in my home city of Detroit, \nMI--the opening of the new Museum of African-American History. The \nmuseum is unique in its size, scope and mission.\n  Located in Detroit's Cultural Center, the 120,000 square foot Museum \nof African-American History is the largest museum in the Nation \ndedicated to documenting and celebrating the African-American \nexperience. It is led by Kimberley Camp, who was the first African-\nAmerican gallery director in the history of the Smithsonian Institute. \nUnder Dr. Camp's leadership, the museum is poised to become a \ndestination for tourists and researchers from around the country. The \nDetroit News recently reported that, ``Camp wants every visitor's \nexperience to be personal. Some may be moved by the reality of slave \nsleeping quarters and pieces of a slave ship. Others may be enchanted \nby an exhibit on quilting, an African-American tradition. Still others \nmay appreciate an Africa exhibit that opens in June, exploring the \ncontinent's diversity.''\n  The museum was designed by prominent Detroit architects Howard Sims \nand Harold Varner, of Sims-Varner and Associates, Inc. Using \ncontemporary building materials, Mr. Sims and Mr. Varner created a \nbuilding thoroughly American in design, but with significant accents \nwhich evoke African culture and traditions. Two Detroit artists, \nRichard Bennett and Hubert Massey, created the most striking of these \naccents. Mr. Bennett's massive African-style masks adorn the facade \nabove the bronze front doors, which he also created. Mr. Massey's \nterrazzo tile mosaic, ``Genealogy,'' is interwoven with the floor in \nthe rotunda. Crowning the rotunda is a glass and steel dome, the \nlargest dome in southeastern Michigan.\n  The central display in the museum will be the core exhibition, ``Of \nthe people: An African-American experience.'' This exhibition will use \nhistorical artifacts, audio recordings, documents, and three-\ndimensional displays to take visitors through the totality of the \nAfrican-American experience, from the first slave ships through the \npresent day. Displays will also put into context the importance of \nAfrican traditions in historical and modern American culture. Two \nadditional galleries will be used for new and changing exhibits.\n  The men and women of the new Museum of African-American History are \ncommitted to creating an institution which is truly a partner in the \ncommunity. To that end, the museum will offer a lecture series, after-\nschool programs for Detroit children, weekend workshops for children \nand adults and theatrical arts programs.\n  The Museum never would have been built without the leadership of two \nremarkable mayors, Coleman Young and Dennis Archer, and without the \nfinancial support of the residents of Detroit and the corporate \ncommunity. All of them came together and pledged their support for what \nwill be the finest institution of its kind in the country.\n  At the museum's grand opening on April 12, the U.S. Postal Service \nwill unveil the winning design for the first stamp celebrating Kwanzaa. \nThe Kwanzaa stamp, which has been designed by the internationally \nacclaimed artist Synthia Saint James,\n\n[[Page S2797]]\n\nwill highlight the importance of African traditions in the lives of so \nmany Americans. Ms. Saint James is an accomplished author, poet, and \naward-winning illustrator of books for children and adults. She has \npreviously been commissioned to create works of art for organizations \nlike UNICEF, Dance Africa and the Girl Scouts of America.\n  Mr. President, it is important that we recognize the incredible \ncontributions African-Americans have made to our nation's cultural \nheritage. People of all races will learn and be touched by their \nexperience at Detroit's Museum of African-American History. On the \noccasion of the museum's grand opening, I know my colleagues join me in \ncongratulating the men and women who helped make this remarkable \ninstitution a reality. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/07/senate-section/article/S2796-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ARLYNE BOCHNEK\n\n Mr. LEVIN.

She planned activities that \nencouraged young people to put their religious faith into action by \ngiving back to their communities. Under her direction, teenagers \nthroughout the Midwest have painted inner-city churches, volunteered at \nschools for the blind and homes for the elderly, and spent days \ncleaning up the environment. In addition, central region USY raises \nmoney to support charities in the United States, Europe, and Israel. \nThis year, with Mrs. Bochnek's guidance, the teenagers of central \nregion USY expect to raise $17,000.\n  Arlyne Bochnek has been a powerful, positive influence in the lives \nof so many young people over the past 9 years.

The bill \n     would direct DOE to continue site characterization activities \n     at the proposed permanent repository site at Yucca Mountain, \n     also in Nevada. Title IV would modify how the nuclear waste \n     program is funded after 2002.\n       Assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts, CBO \n     estimates that implementing S. 104 would cost about $4 \n     billion over the 1997-2002 period. (The increase in 1997 \n     spending only would be about $15 million.) In addition, \n     enacting the bill would affect direct spending--but not until \n     2002. Because S. 104 would not affect direct spending or \n     receipts in either 1997 or 1998, pay-as-you-go procedures \n     would not apply.\n       The state of Nevada and localities in the state would incur \n     some additional costs as a result of this bill, but CBO is \n     unsure whether the provisions causing those costs would be \n     considered intergovernmental mandates, as defined in the \n     Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA). We estimate that \n     the costs incurred by state and local governments would total \n     significantly less than the threshold established in the law. \n     (UMRA set a threshold of $50 million for 1996, adjusted \n     annually for inflation).\n       CBO estimates that S. 104 contains private-sector mandates \n     that exceed the $100 million threshold identified in UMRA.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of S. 104 over the next five years is shown \n     in the table below. CBO estimates that building and operating \n     an interim storage facility and continuing the study of the \n     Yucca Mountain site as authorized by the bill would require \n     appropriations of about $4 billion over the 1998-2002 period, \n     resulting in outlays of about $3.8 billion over that period. \n     In addition, section 401 would result in an increase in \n     offsetting receipts in 2002 because it would require certain \n     utilities to make a one-time payment of nuclear waste fees to \n     the government of about $2.7 billion before the end of fiscal \n     year 2002. Under current law, this payment is not expected to \n     be made until 2010 or later.\n       S. 104 also would affect direct spending in later years by \n     ending the current mandatory nuclear waste fee. Lost receipts \n     would total about $630 million annually beginning in 2004.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                     By fiscal years, in millions of dollars\n                                                               -------------------------------------------------\n                                                                 1997    1998    1999    2000    2001     2002\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\n \nSpending Under Current Law:\n  Budget authority \\1\\........................................     382       0       0       0       0         0\n  Estimated outlays...........................................     375      38       0       0       0         0\nProposed Changes:\n  Authorization level.........................................       0     555   1,000     940     855       640\n  Estimated outlays...........................................      15     490     782     894     917       751\nSpending Under S. 104:\n  Authorization Level \\1\\.....................................     382     555   1,000     940     855       640\n  Estimated Outlays...........................................     390     528     782     894     917       751\n \n                                           CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING\n \nEstimated budget authority....................................       0       0       0       0       0    -2,700\nEstimated outlays.............................................       0       0       0       0       0    -2,700\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The 1997 level is the amount appropriated for that year.\n\n       The costs of this legislation fall within budget functions \n     050 (defense) and 270 (energy).\n       Basis of estimate: This estimate is based on DOE's program \n     plan issued on May 6, 1996, and on information from the \n     department concerning the costs of an interim storage \n     facility. For purposes of the estimate, CBO assumes that S. \n     104 will be enacted by July 1, 1997, and that the department \n     will proceed to develop an interim storage facility in Nevada \n     to accept waste beginning in fiscal year 2000, as authorized \n     by the bill. We assume that following the assessment of the \n     viability of the Yucca Mountain site as a permanent waste \n     repository, DOE would apply for a license from the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission (NRC) to construct a permanent nuclear \n     waste repository there in 2002, as detailed in the May 6, \n     1996, nuclear waste program plan.\n     Spending subject to appropriation\n       Yucca Mountain. S. 104 would direct DOE to proceed with its \n     Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program Plan of May \n     1996. This plan calls for continuing with the evaluation of \n     the Yucca Mountain, Nevada site as a permanent repository for \n     nuclear waste, and applying for a license from the NRC to \n     construct a repository in 2002, if the site appears to be \n     viable for this use. Based on information from DOE, we \n     estimate this effort would cost about $330 million annually \n     over the 1998-2002 period.\n       Interim Storage Facility. The bill would require DOE to \n     design and develop an interim nuclear waste storage facility \n     at the Nevada test site. Based on information from DOE, we \n     estimate the total costs of building, operating, and \n     transporting nuclear waste to the Nevada facility would be \n     about $2.3 billion over the 1997-2002 period, including $85 \n     million appropriated in 1996. Spending from the existing $85 \n     million appropriation was made contingent upon enactment of \n     an authorization of an interim nuclear waste repository, such \n     as S. 104.\n       The facility would be built in two phases and designed to \n     accept 55,000 metric tons of uranium (MTU). Initially, the \n     facility would be designed to accept nuclear waste in special \n     storage canisters; later it would accept fuel without \n     canisters. If DOE does not apply for a license to construct a \n     permanent repository in 2002, or if DOE does not begin to \n     operate a permanent repository in 2010, the capacity could be \n     increased to 75,000 MTU. Based on information from DOE, CBO \n     estimates that the interim storage facility would initially \n     cost about $940 million to design, construct, and operate \n     over the 1997-2002 period. This amount includes annual \n     payments to Lincoln County, Nevada, of $2.5 million before \n     the first shipment of waste,\n\n[[Page S2798]]\n\n     and $5 million after waste shipments begin, as authorized by \n     section 201.\n       The federal government would be responsible for all \n     transportation costs for shipping nuclear waste from nuclear \n     reactors to the interim storage facility by rail and heavy-\n     haul trucks. Procurement of special shipping casts and waste \n     storage canisters would account for most of the initial \n     transportation costs. Based on information from DOE, we \n     estimate that waste transportation costs would total $1.4 \n     billion over the 1997-2002 period. This amount includes $10 \n     million annually over the 1997-1999 period for grants to \n     state, local, and tribal governments for emergency \n     transportation planning and training of public safety \n     personnel along routes used to ship waste to the Nevada \n     facility.\n       Other Authorizations. Section 506 would direct the NRC to \n     establish regulatory guidance for the training and \n     qualifications of nuclear powerplant personnel. This \n     authorization could result in an increase in the NRC \n     workload, but would not result in a net cost to the \n     government because the NRC recovers all costs of regulating \n     the nuclear industry through user fees.\n       Section 508 would authorize DOE to compensate the Dairyland \n     Power Cooperative for any cost related to the storage of \n     nuclear waste at the cooperative's La Crosse reactor site, \n     until this waste is removed for temporary storage or \n     disposal. Based on information from DOE, CBO estimates that \n     these storage costs would be $1 million to $2 million \n     annually over the 1998-2002 period.\n       Section 509 would authorize such sums as are necessary to \n     establish a decommissioning pilot program to decommission and \n     decontaminate a sodium-cooled fast breeder experimental test-\n     site reactor acquired by the University of Arkansas in 1976. \n     Based on information from the university, this activity could \n     cost $20 million and take about four years to complete, \n     assuming that all fuel has already been removed from the \n     facility.\n       Section 602 would authorize continuation of the oversight \n     activities of the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board. Based \n     on the board's ongoing work, CBO estimates this agency would \n     spend about $3 million annually over the 1998-2002 period, \n     assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts.\n     Direct Spending\n       Section 401(a)(3) would result in an earlier payment by \n     utilities to the government of about $2.7 billion in one-time \n     nuclear waste disposal fees. The bill would require these \n     fees to be paid no later than the end of fiscal year 2002. \n     Utilities that fail to make these payments in 2002 would have \n     their nuclear operating permits suspended by the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission. Under current law, these one-time fee \n     payments, along with accrued interest, are due prior to \n     the delivery of nuclear waste to a government storage or \n     disposal facility. Currently, DOE does not expect such a \n     facility to be available until 2010 or later. Thus, the \n     bill would accelerate the payment of these one-time fees \n     by at least 8 years. While this change would result in \n     budgetary savings in 2002, the government would derive no \n     significant benefit over the long run because it would \n     otherwise receive the same amount later, with interest.\n       Starting in fiscal year 2004, section 401(a)(2) would limit \n     the aggregate fees the government charges each year to \n     electric utilities for disposal of nuclear waste to no more \n     than the amount appropriated from the nuclear waste fund that \n     year. CBO estimates that, under current law, income from \n     these fees would total $630 million annually over the 2004-\n     2007 period and would decline in subsequent years as nuclear \n     power plants are decommissioned. Because S. 104 would make \n     annual fees dependent on future appropriations action after \n     2003, CBO cannot assume their collection for the purpose of \n     estimating the budgetary impact of the bill. Therefore, we \n     estimate that the bill would cause a loss of offsetting \n     receipts (that is, an increase in direct spending) of $630 \n     million a year from 2004 to 2007 and of smaller amount in \n     subsequent years.\n       In sum, CBO estimates that enacting the bill would decrease \n     direct spending by $2.7 billion in 2002, but would increase \n     direct spending by $2.5 billion over the following five \n     years.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: None.\n       Estimated impact on state, local, and tribal governments: \n     Mandates. CBO is unsure whether the bill contains \n     intergovernmental mandates, as defined in UMRA, but we \n     estimate that costs incurred by state, local, and tribal \n     governments as a result of the bill would total significantly \n     less than the threshold established in the law. (UMRA \n     established a threshold of $50 million for 1996, adjusted \n     annually for inflation.)\n       While S. 104 would, by itself, establish no new enforceable \n     duties on state, local, or tribal governments, constructing \n     and operating an interim storage facility, as required by the \n     bill, probably would increase the cost to the state of Nevada \n     of complying with existing federal requirements. CBO cannot \n     determine whether these costs would be considered the \n     direct costs of a mandate as defined by UMRA.\n       Based on information provided by state officials, CBO \n     expects that state spending would increase by as much as $30 \n     million per year until shipments to the facility begin \n     (assuming that they begin in fiscal year 2000) and $5 million \n     per year between that time and the time that the permanent \n     facility at Yucca Mountain begins operations. This additional \n     spending would support a number of activities, including \n     emergency response planning and training, escort of waste \n     shipment, and environmental monitoring. In addition, spending \n     by Nevada counties for similar activities would probably \n     increase, but by much smaller amounts. Not all of this \n     spending would be for the purpose of complying with federal \n     requirements.\n       These costs are similar to those that the state would \n     eventually incur under current law as a result of the \n     permanent repository planned for Yucca Mountain. DOE \n     currently does not expect to begin receiving material at a \n     permanent repository until at least 2010, while S. 104 would \n     require that it begin to receive material at an interim \n     facility in fiscal year 2000. As a result, the state would \n     have to respond to the shipment and storage of waste at least \n     ten years sooner than under current law. Further, the state's \n     costs would increase because it would have to plan for two \n     facilities.\n     Other impacts\n       Federal Payments to State and Local Governments. S. 104 \n     would authorize payments to Lincoln County, Nevada, of $2.5 \n     million in each year before waste is shipped to the interim \n     facility and $5 million annual after shipments begin. In \n     addition, the bill identifies several parcels of land that \n     would be conveyed to Lincoln County and Nye County, Nevada by \n     the federal government.\n       The state of Nevada might lose payments from the federal \n     government if S. 104 is enacted, while Indian tribes might \n     receive payments. The bill would amend section 116 of the \n     Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which authorizes payments to the \n     state of Nevada and to local governments within the state. \n     Section 116 currently authorizes DOE to make grants to these \n     governments to enable them to participate in evaluating and \n     developing a site for a permanent repository and to offset \n     any negative impacts of such a site. S. 104 would authorize \n     such payments only to affected local governments and Indian \n     tribes, not to the state.\n       In recent years, Congress has appropriated amounts ranging \n     from $12 million to $15 million per year under this section \n     for Nevada and for local governments in the state. For the \n     current fiscal year, however, the Energy and Water \n     Development Appropriations Act, 1997 (Public Law 104-206) \n     prohibits DOE from making any such payments to the state \n     or to local governments.\n       Transportaton. S. 104 would also amend the provision in \n     current law that directs DOE to provide technical assistance \n     and funds for training of public safety officials to state \n     and local governments and Indian tribes through whose \n     jurisdictions radioactive material would be transported. This \n     bill would specifically authorize planning grants of $150,000 \n     for each such state and Indian tribe as well as annual \n     implementation grants. CBO estimates that these grants would \n     total about $10 million per year over the 1997-1999 period. \n     Further, the bill would prohibit shipments through the \n     jurisdiction of any state or tribe that has not received \n     technical assistance and funds for at least two years.\n       The state of Nevada could incur substantial additional \n     costs relating to road construction and maintenance as a \n     result of the shipment of waste by heavy-haul truck from the \n     transfer facility in Caliente to the interim storage \n     facility. Based on information provided by DOE, however, CBO \n     expects that the federal government would pay most of these \n     costs.\n       Estimated impact on the private sector: CBO has identified \n     private-sector mandates in the bill that would accelerate the \n     payment of certain fees by private nuclear utilities and \n     impose new training standards and requirements on workers. \n     CBO estimates that the direct costs of these private-sector \n     mandates would exceed the statutory threshold established in \n     UMRA ($100 million in 1996, adjusted annually for inflation) \n     in 2002. Because the bill would direct the federal government \n     to begin storing nuclear waste at an earlier date than is now \n     anticipated, the direct costs of these new mandates could be \n     at least partially offset by savings to private nuclear \n     utilities that would no longer have to pay for this storage.\n       Fourteen nuclear utilities have chosen the option, \n     available to them under current law, to delay payment of \n     certain one-time disposal fees and to pay the federal \n     government the required additional interest. S. 104 would \n     require nuclear utilities to accelerate payment of those fees \n     to the government. CBO assumes that nuclear utilities would \n     make the required payment of about $2.7 billion to the \n     government in 2002, which would be considered the direct cost \n     of a private-sector mandate, as defined in UMRA. Under \n     current law, such payments would be paid in 2010 or later, \n     when DOE opens a permanent storage facility to accept nuclear \n     waste.\n       Acceleration of these payments would likely result in a \n     real economic loss to the utilities over the long run because \n     interest on the payments is accruing at the rate paid on \n     Treasury bills, which is lower than the market rate of \n     interest. The industry does, however, expect to experience \n     significant savings under S. 104 if interim storage \n     facilities begin to accept nuclear waste in fiscal year 2000. \n     Currently, spent nuclear fuel is stored at nuclear reactor \n     sites around the country. Thus, nuclear utilities would save \n     storage costs upon transfer of the nuclear waste to a federal \n     facility.\n       S. 104 would also impose a mandate by requiring that the \n     Secretary of Transportation\n\n[[Page S2799]]\n\n     establish training standards applicable to workers directly \n     involved in the removal, transportation, interim storage, and \n     permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level \n     radioactive waste. These workers, under current law, are \n     already required to undertake extensive training. Based on \n     information provided by industry experts, CBO estimates that \n     the added costs of this mandate would be minimal. In \n     addition, these costs could be partially offset by \n     appropriated funds designated to cover training costs. \n     Section 203(c) would direct the Secretary of Energy to \n     provide technical assistance and funds for training directly \n     to nonprofit employee organizations and joint labor-\n     management organizations that implement safety and training \n     requirements under this bill.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Cost: Kim Cawley.

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following \ntreaty transmitted to the Senate on April 7, 1997, by the President of \nthe United States: The Flank Document Agreement to the CFE Treaty, \nTreaty Document No. 105-5.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the treaty be considered as \nhaving been read for the first time; that it be referred, with \naccompanying papers, to the Committee on Foreign Relations and ordered \nto be printed; and that the President's message be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate, the \nDocument Agreed Among the States Parties to the Treaty on Conventional \nArmed Forces in Europe (CFE) of November 19, 1990, which was adopted at \nVienna on May 31, 1996 (``the Flank Document''). The Flank Document is \nAnnex A of the Final Document of the first CFE Review Conference.\n  I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the \nDepartment of State on the Flank Document, together with a section-by-\nsection analysis of the Flank Document and three documents associated \nwith it that are relevant to the Senate's consideration: the \nUnderstanding on Details of the Flank Document of 31 May 1996 in Order \nto Facilitate its Implementation; the Exchange of Letters between the \nU.S. Chief Delegate to the CFE Joint Consultative Group and the Head of \nthe Delegation of the Russian Federation to the Joint Consultative \nGroup, dated 25 July 1996; and the Extension of Provisional Application \nof the Document until May 15, 1997. I take this step as a matter of \naccommodation to the desires of the Senate and without prejudice to the \nallocation of rights and duties under the Constitution.\n  In transmitting the original CFE Treaty to the Senate in 1991, \nPresident Bush said that the CFE Treaty was ``the most ambitious arms \ncontrol agreement ever concluded.'' This landmark treaty has been a \nsource of stability, predictability, and confidence during a period of \nhistoric change in Europe. In the years since the CFE Treaty was \nsigned, the Soviet Union has dissolved, the Warsaw Pact has \ndisappeared, and the North Atlantic Alliance has been transformed. The \nTreaty has not been unaffected by these changes--for example, there are \n30 CFE States Parties now, not 22--but the dedication of all Treaty \npartners to achieving its full promise is undiminished.\n  The CFE Treaty has resulted in the verified reduction of more than \n50,000 pieces of heavy military equipment, including tanks, armored \ncombat vehicles, artillery pieces, combat aircraft, and attack \nhelicopters. By the end of 1996, CFE states had accepted and conducted \nmore than 2,700 intrusive, on-site inspections. Contacts between the \nmilitary organizations charged with implementing CFE are cooperative \nand extensive. The CFE Treaty has helped to transform a world of two \narmed camps into a Europe where dividing lines no longer hold.\n  The Flank Document is part of that process. It is the culmination of \nover 2 years of negotiations and months of intensive discussions with \nthe Russian Federation, Ukraine, our NATO Allies, and our other CFE \nTreaty partners. The Flank Document resolves in a cooperative way the \nmost difficult problem that arose during the Treaty's first 5 years of \nimplementation: Russian and Ukrainian concerns about the impact of the \nTreaty's equipment limits in the flank zone on their security and \nmilitary flexibility. The other Treaty states--including all NATO \nAllies--agreed that some of those concerns were reasonable and ought to \nbe addressed.\n  The Flank Document is the result of a painstaking multilateral \ndiplomatic effort that had as its main goal the preservation of the \nintegrity of the CFE Treaty and achievement of the goals of its \nmandate. It is a crucial step in adaptation of the CFE Treaty to the \ndramatic political changes that have occurred in Europe since the \nTreaty was signed. The Flank Document confirms the importance of \nsubregional constraints on heavy military equipment. More specifically, \nit revalidates the idea, unique to CFE, of limits on the amount of \nequipment particular nations in the Treaty area can locate on certain \nportions of their own national territory. Timely entry into force of \nthe Flank Document will ensure that these key principles are not a \nmatter of debate in the negotiations we have just begun in Vienna to \nadapt the CFE Treaty to new political realities, including the prospect \nof the enlarged NATO.\n  I believe that entry into force of the CFE Flank Document is in the \nbest interests of the United States and will\n\n[[Page S2800]]\n\ncontribute to our broader efforts to establish a new European security \norder based on cooperation and shared goals. By maintaining the \nintegrity of the CFE flank regime, we take a key step toward our goal \nof ensuring that the CFE Treaty continues to play a key role in \nenhancing military stability into the 21st century. Therefore, I urge \nthe Senate to give early and favorable consideration to the Flank \nDocument and to give advice and consent prior to May 15, 1997.\n                                                  William J.
