I see that Senator \nHutchinson is on the floor and prepared to go forward and already has \nhis charts on display here. I appreciate the work that he has done in \nthis area.\n  At 1 p.m. the Senate will resume consideration of the Interior \nappropriations bill. It is the majority leader's hope that the Interior \nbill will be finished the first part of this week. Last week there were \nother issues that were debated, that were attached to the Interior \nappropriations bill, and cloture votes that were also voted on. But I \nthink this week it is important that we stay focused on the Interior \nappropriations bill, this afternoon and Tuesday and Wednesday, if \nnecessary, to try to get it completed. That is an important part of us \ndoing the people's business.\n  Yes, there are a lot of distractions, but in the meantime the Senate \nmust continue to go forward with the things that have to be done before \nwe can go out at the end of this session so that our Members can go \nhome and be with their constituents. So the Interior bill will be our \nprincipal focus this week. Senators who have amendments are encouraged \nto come to the floor. Don't keep shoving them off and saying, ``I will \noffer them later,'' ``I will offer them Tuesday,'' ``I will offer them \nWednesday.'' You will wind up being here at 10 o'clock Wednesday night \nhaving to offer and debate your amendments. I hope that Senators will \ncome forward and offer amendments if they have them.\n  At 5 p.m., under a previous order, the Senate will resume debate in \nrelation to the Truth in Employment Act until 5:30. At that time the \nSenate will proceed to a vote on cloture on a motion to proceed to the \nemployment bill.\n  Also at that time there could be a vote or votes on or in relation to \namendments on the Interior appropriations bill. We do not have that \nlocked in yet, but we would like to get some work done, and there is a \nlikelihood that there will be a second vote following the vote that is \nalready scheduled at 5:30. Further votes could occur, as I said, during \nthis evening. And Members should expect that we will have to go into \nthe evening almost every night this week.\n  In addition, on Friday we did get a unanimous consent agreement with \nregard to how we would bring up and debate and vote on the bankruptcy \nreform bill. I thank Senators on both sides for working late into the \nnight Thursday night and during the morning Friday, that allowed us to \ncraft this unanimous consent agreement. We will bring that up the first \nopportunity we have--certainly only after consultation with the \nDemocratic leader. But if we could finish the Interior bill at a \nreasonable time Wednesday, we could very well go to the bankruptcy bill \neither Wednesday night or Thursday, but it will depend on how things go \nbetween now and then.\n  Also, I understand that the Banking Committee did report out, by a \nwide margin, the Financial Services Act last week. I had indicated to \nthe chairman, Chairman D'Amato, that if they reported it out on a broad \nbipartisan vote, we would look for an opportunity to have a vote on \nthat also. I don't know if that would come before next week or even the \nnext week, but bankruptcy reform and the Financial Services Act would \nbe two very large accomplishments, if we could get these done before we \ngo out at the end of the session.\n  So, again, I hope Senators will be prepared to work hard, offer their \namendments, let us have our votes, and let us make some progress so we \ncan show the American people, despite the distractions, we are doing \nour work.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S10270]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/14/senate-section/article/S10269-4", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10269-S10270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Under the previous order, the \ntime until 1 p.m. shall be equally divided between the Senator from \nArkansas, Mr. Hutchinson, and the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKennedy, or his designee, for debate relating to the Motion to Proceed \nto S. 1981.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the S. 1981 \nlegislation. This legislation will enable thousands of businesses in \nArkansas and across the Nation to avoid the insidious and unscrupulous \npractice known as salting which is literally crippling thousands of \nsmall businesses across this country.\n  The Truth in Employment Act inserts a provision in the National Labor \nRelations Act establishing that an employer is not required to hire a \nperson seeking employment for the primary purpose of furthering the \nobjectives of an organization other than that of the employer. This \nmeasure is not intended to undermine the legitimate rights or \nprotections currently in law for workers in this country enabling them \nto organize. Employers will gain no ability to discriminate against \nunion membership or activities. This bill only seeks to stop the \ndestructive practice of salting. In fact, I will just read the last \nprovision in the bill itself, which guarantees the protections for \nworkers to organize, because the argument will be made, opponents of \nthis legislation will say, that this is somehow trying to undermine the \nright of workers to organize.\n  So this provision says:\n\n       Nothing in the bill shall affect the rights and \n     responsibilities under this Act of any employee who is or was \n     a bona fide employee applicant, including the right to self-\n     organization, to form, join or assist labor organizations, to \n     bargain collectively through representatives of their own \n     choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the \n     purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid \n     protection.\n\n  So this bill is clearly not designed to harm workers or to undermine \ntheir ability to organize. That provision passed the House of \nRepresentatives unanimously, incidentally. I believe it has broad \nsupport in the Senate as well. But there is a practice that is becoming \nall too common across this country, that is both immoral and insidious \nand is not a legitimate organizing tactic, and it needs to be outlawed. \nThe bill does not change the definition of ``employee.'' It does not \noverturn the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an issue that I think is of \ncommon sense and fairness. Would any person intentionally bring wanton \ndestruction upon his or her own home? Would a homeowner spend hard-\nearned money for a colony of termites and let them loose in his or her \nhouse, leaving them free to gnaw away at the equity he or she had spent \nyears building up in a home or property? Certainly no one would commit \nsuch an irrational attack of self-destruction. No one would willfully \nand deliberately bring thousands of dollars of damage on himself. \nInstead, the homeowner would take every precaution to preserve the \nstructure of his home, keeping out ruinous influences. Yet, today, in a \nsimilar situation, small business owners nationwide are prevented from \ndefending their own companies from pernicious attacks known as salting.\n  What is salting? Paid and unpaid union agents infiltrate nonunion \nbusinesses under the pretense--the pretense of seeking employment. And \nthen, at that point, employers are caught in a dilemma, facing charges \nif they refuse union labor and facing charges if they hire these salts. \nSo if they don't hire, unfair labor practices are filed, discrimination \nclaims are filed against the employer. If they do hire them, they then \nface, in effect, termites in their own business, eating away at the \nsolvency of their own enterprise. Once on the job, these salts set \nabout sabotaging the company through workplace disruptions and a \nbattery of frivolous charges to the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission, the National Labor Relations Board, or by creating OSHA \nviolations and then reporting those violations to OSHA.\n\n  Employers who try to fire them face yet another litany of false \ncharges. Defending against these charges costs money in legal fees, \ncosts time in lost productivity and costs a company's reputation \nthrough negative publicity. Yet, to add insult to injury, employers are \noften forced to pay large damage awards or settlements because they \ncannot afford the high legal fees needed for justice to be served.\n  Employers have little or no defense against these relentless--\nrelentless--assaults. Instead, they are forced to invite destruction \ninto their companies and can only stand by, it seems, helplessly as \nyears of hard work and investment are devoured before their eyes.\n  In my home State of Arkansas, George Smith, the president of Little \nRock Electrical Contractors, has been the victim of salting campaigns. \nLet me just tell you his story.\n  It is a family-owned business and a merit shop contractor, hiring \nboth union and nonunion labor. Mr. Smith never expected to face charges \nof unfair labor practices from people he didn't even hire.\n  At a company site in Louisiana, two men drove up to Little Rock and \nasked if the company was taking applications. They were told no, and \nthey drove off. Five months later, Mr. Smith was notified that charges \nof discrimination had been filed against him by the NLRB. He \nsubsequently hired a labor attorney who assured him that he could win, \nas the charges had no merit whatsoever, that justice would be served.\n  Unfortunately, the cost of the 2-day hearing would be $15,000 in \norder to have justice served. And since the unions would appeal if Mr. \nSmith won, additional costs of up to $8,000 could be almost guaranteed.\n  On the other hand, the cost of settlement with these two nonemployees \nwho had filed the claim was $3,000 for each man. So, in the end, Mr. \nSmith chose the less expensive option. I quote what he said:\n\n       The reason that we paid was real simple. It was pure \n     mathematics. [If] it cost me $23,000 to win and $6,000 to \n     lose: I can't afford to win.\n\n  To rub salt into the wounds, so to speak, copies of these settlement \nchecks appeared on one of his worksites in North Carolina with the \nstatement saying that this was the result of employer interference with \nemployee rights.\n  Mr. Smith, a hard-working American trying to run an honest business, \nlost both money and company stature. But this assault was not unique. \nIn 1 year, Little Rock Electrical has faced 72 such charges to the tune \nof $80,000 in legal fees.\n  Mr. President, that is wrong. That is not justice, it is an \ninjustice. This problem is not unique to Arkansas companies. It is \nhappening all across America, from Cape Elizabeth, ME, where Cindy and \nDon Mailman, owners of Bay Electric Company, suffered 14 erroneous, \nmeritless charges, and $100,000 in legal fees over 4 years; to Modesto, \nCA, where Jim Blayblock of Blayblock Electric faced an intense barrage \nof salting; to Delano, MN, where Terrance Korthof of Wright Electric \nhas lost $150,000 in legal fees and $200,000 to $300,000 in wasted time \nfor 15 baseless charges; to Austin, TX, where Randy Pomikahl's company, \nRandall Electric, has been targeted.\n  My point is, from the East Coast to the West Coast, from the Canadian \nborder to Texas in the South we see these salting campaigns. Salts are \noperating across the country not only in electrical companies, but in \nsteel companies, mechanical companies, building companies, and I \npredict it is going to be expanded and proliferate. We are going to see \nit targeting small business in every industry unless we address it \nlegislatively. Mr. President, it is very much a national problem.\n\n  I have on the floor of the Senate this morning a chart that \nillustrates how this is a national problem. Here are some examples of \nsalting cases around the country. Carmel, IN, Gaylor Electric faced 96 \ncharges. Ultimately, the courts dismissed all 96. All 96 of these \ncharges were dismissed without merit, but it cost Gaylor Electric \n$250,000 annually to defend themselves against this salting campaign.\n  Union, MO, 48 charges were filed, 47 were dismissed, one was settled \nfor $200. But in legal fees, $150,000 to defend their company against \nthese frivolous charges.\n  In Clearfield, PA, the R.D. Goss Company had 15 to 20 charges. All \nbut one of those charges were dismissed, but it\n\n[[Page S10271]]\n\ncost that company $75,000 in legal fees plus lost time, and they \nultimately were forced out of business, an example of many businesses \nthat have been forced to close their doors because of their inability \nto pay for the legal help to defend themselves against these kinds of \ncampaigns. This small businessman in Clearfield, PA, had operated for \n38 years until finally having to close their doors because of the \nsalting campaign against them.\n  These travesties of justice are not simply random acts by a small \nsubversive group. Instead, they are calculated attacks on nonunion \ncompanies often, unfortunately, with NLRB complicity. In its most \ninnocuous form, salting consists of gaining employment, not to work, \nbut solely for the purpose of organizing labor. A person has a right, \nthe courts have said and legitimately so, to apply for a job even \nthough they want to go in and help organize for union activity. They \ndon't have a right, I believe, legitimately, morally, or ethically, \nthough it is still illegal, to go in, apply for a job, never intending \nto work, but simply for the purpose of filing these kinds of frivolous \nclaims. That is in its most innocuous form. The common and prescribed \npractice is to strike economic pressure points in a company, leaving \nthat company virtually paralyzed.\n  In their own words, from the IEBW organizing manual, this is what \nthey say:\n\n       [The goal of salting is to] threaten or actually apply the \n     economic pressure necessary to cause the employer to . . . \n     raise his prices to recoup additional costs, scale back his \n     business activities, leave the union's jurisdiction, and go \n     out of business.\n\n  That is not where the effort is to go in and organize. That is where \nthe effort is to go in, hit the economic pressure points and destroy \nthe company. The international vice president of the United Food and \nCommercial Workers Union, Tom McNutt, has been quoted as saying:\n\n       If we can't organize them, the best thing to do is to erode \n     their business as much as possible.\n\n  The goal is not to organize. ``If we can't organize, let's destroy \nthe company.''\n  I have another chart that I think will illustrate this very point, \nand that is that the procedures for salting are not left to chance, \nthat unions very carefully instruct members how they ought to go about \nsalting. This is a sample checklist for salts put out by the \nInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 1547 in \nAnchorage, AK. If you will notice, and we will read some of these \npoints, this is their initial contact, when they make contact with a \nselected target; in other words, the business that is the target of the \ncampaign:\n       If the target doesn't have reason to know that you are a \n     union member you do not want to reflect that on your \n     application. You can change the status of your prior \n     employment to reflect past non-union employment * * *\n\n  Then they actually counsel their salts to lie on their employment \napplication.\n\n       * * * reduce the rate of [your former] pay [your hourly \n     wage] to $12.00 or $13.00 with no benefits [because] if you \n     show a high rate of pay and benefits * * * the target will * \n     * * become suspicious.\n\n  So all through the various points that they make, all through their \nrecommendations, they are urging deception when these salts go in.\n\n       List jobs other than heavy industrial sites such as TVA \n     jobs, government jobs, or jobs known to be union in union \n     areas.\n\n  Deceive the potential employer.\n\n       In listing your electrical education we recommend that you \n     do not list JATC or IBEW.\n\n  Just do not tell them of any kind of--on and on you find this effort \nto simply deceive in order to get in and perform the insidious and \npernicious activity, not of organizing, but of destroying the economic \nviability of the company.\n  There are more union tactics that are described by local 1547: \nFabricating employment history and so forth. These tactics are not \novert methods of organizing, but rather they are covert methods of \ndeceiving and sabotaging the targeted company. Unfortunately, the NLRB \nand other Government entities have unwittingly become an accomplice in \nthese salting campaigns, because the charges are brought before them, \nand Government lawyers defend the salts.\n  So we talk about the price tag. It is not just the price tag of legal \nfees for these companies. It is not just the price tag of lost time and \nproductivity. It is not just the price tag of losing a company's \nreputation. It is also the price tag that is imposed upon the American \ntaxpayer, because we pay for the lawyers that are defending these salts \nwhen it goes before the NLRB. So by extension, the American taxpayers \nhave been made a participant in these guerrilla warfare operations, \nsince who but the American taxpayer pays the salaries of these \nGovernment lawyers.\n  Mr. President, I think that it is absurd. And in return for their \nmoney, the American taxpayers get a return on their investment; and \nthat return is in higher consumer prices for products and services, the \ncosts of which have been driven up by higher operating expenses due to \nnone other than these kinds of salting campaigns and those abuses. Not \nthe legitimate right to organize, but it is these abuses that we have \nan opportunity to bring a halt to.\n  Under current law, employers are fully exposed to the corrosive \neffects of salting. Mr. President, I emphasize again, I am not opposed \nto labor organizing. It is, in fact, one of the rights of workers under \nthe law. But I am against the abuse of the system, the abuse of small \nbusiness owners and the abuse of the American taxpayers.\n  The Truth in Employment Act preserves the rights of employees and \nemployers. The provisions are very simple. The Truth in Employment Act \namends the National Labor Relations Act so that an employer is not \nrequired to employ any person who is not a bona fide employee \napplicant, meaning that this person wants to be employed with the \nprimary purpose of furthering another employment or agency status. In \nother words, when they are coming in to apply, they are not coming in \nprimarily because they want a job and they want a paycheck and they \nwant to perform productive labor. They are coming in primarily for the \npurpose of furthering the goals and objectives of another organization, \nwhether they are paid or unpaid. I think that that is what we must \nguard against--no destructive salting.\n  The bill also specifically protects the rights of bona fide employees \nto self-organization, labor organization membership, and collective \nbargaining. It does not change the definition of the employee, and it \ndoes not overturn the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  The Truth in Employment Act begins, a little bit, to put some balance \nback into management-labor relations. And it begins to level the \nplaying field of labor relations, protecting the rights of employers \nand employees while promoting the honest and harmonious hiring of \nemployees.\n  I think, Mr. President, the House took a very positive step for the \nbenefit of all Americans by passing their version of this bill on March \n26, 1998. This evening we will have a chance to do the same. And the \nlanguage in the Truth in Employment Act that we will be voting on today \nis precisely the language passed by the U.S. House of Representatives.\n  The question arises, though--I am sure we are going to hear this \nduring the course of debate today--if salts enter into jobs \nsurreptitiously, how can this legislation work? How can salts be \ndetected? Under the Truth in Employment Act, the act of seeking \nemployment in the furtherance of another employment or agency status no \nlonger is a ``protected activity.'' Salting will not be a protected \naction. In the case against the employer, the general counsel of the \nNLRB will have to show that the employee is, in fact, bona fide, that \nthe employee did not seek employment for the purpose of salting. In \nthis demonstration, the general counsel will prove that the employee \nwould have sought employment even in the absence of his desire to \nconduct a salting campaign.\n\n  The employers will have the opportunity to present contrary evidence. \nEmployers will no longer be squeezed in the vices of the law. They will \nno longer be forced to hire salts or fear dismissing salts for their \ndisruptive actions. Employers will be able to hire job applicants who \nare actually interested in working and contributing do the company for \nthe salary they receive.\n  I know that some of my colleagues do not support this legislation and \nwill try to frame this legislation as being antilabor. It is not. As I \nmentioned, the\n\n[[Page S10272]]\n\nTruth in Employment Act specifically protects the rights of bona fide \nemployees to self-organization, labor organization membership, and \ncollective bargaining. It does not in any way undermine that right. But \nit will stop the proliferation of salting campaigns that have \nprecipitated the need for the legislation. This, frankly, has become \nthe new tactic of choice.\n  Others may suggest these unions would not undertake these tactics \nunless there were something seriously wrong with the system and that \nsalting is like the last gasp of breath from the sea of desperation. \nBut I think if you look at the economy, you find the real answer.\n  Apart from the recent ups and downs and antics of the stock market, \nour economy has been doing very well. Over 13 million new jobs have \nbeen created in the last 5 years. Unemployment is at a 24-year low--4.5 \npercent. The economy is growing. And while the economy is growing, \nunion membership is declining; in fact, it is even plummeting.\n  The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported recently that unions lost \n159,000 members in 1997 alone. So as a result of strong employment \nconditions and job satisfaction, labor unions are finding it \nincreasingly difficult to identify workplaces that need and want labor \nrepresentation. So in that circumstance, in that economic environment, \nit is regrettable that some labor unions have resorted to disingenuous \ntechniques to cope with their situation.\n  Mr. President, in this country we often speak of rights--the right to \nfree speech, the right to free assembly, the right to bear arms, the \nright to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. But with \neach right that we enjoy in this great country, we also face some \nresponsibilities. People who assemble for a cause have the \nresponsibility not to be violent or to be destructive. Journalists have \na responsibility to print what is true and newsworthy.\n  When a parent grants a child the freedom to use the phone or to use \nthe car, he expects the child not to make lengthy long distance calls \nto far out-of-the-way places, or to drive the car at high speeds or \nunder the influence of alcohol. It is this responsibility that we \nexercise with each freedom, with each right that allows us to have \nthese very same freedoms. Mr. President, the right of laborers to \norganize must not be abused.\n  Salting is a costly--costly--abuse of legal technicalities. It rarely \never results in actual organization. Instead, it costs small business \nowners time, money and oftentimes its reputation that has been built \nand earned through a whole lifetime. It costs American taxpayers money \nin legal costs and higher consumer prices. It is dishonest. It is \nunjust, and it penalizes the innocent.\n  Mr. President, the Truth in Employment Act calls for just that--truth \nin employment. It calls for common sense and honesty in labor \nrelations. It calls for job applicants to be honest about their \nintentions and to apply only if they actually want to work for the \ncompany. It stops only dishonesty. It stops only injustice. It stops \nonly destructive and unethical practices. It calls for a simple change \nin the law so that small business owners do not have to shoot \nthemselves in the foot. It calls for fairness. I ask my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation when we have the opportunity to vote on it \nlater today.\n  Mr. President, 32 different trade associations have endorsed the \nTruth in Employment Act. I will not read them all, but some of the \nmajor trade associations supporting this legislation include the \nAmerican Trucking Association, the Associated Builders and Contractors, \nInternational Mass Retail Association, the National Association of \nConvenience Stores, the National Association of Home Builders, the \nNational Association of Manufacturers support this, as well as the \nNFIB, National Federation of Independent Business, the National Grocers \nAssociation, the National Mining Association, the National Restaurant \nAssociation, the National Retail Federation and the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce--32 different associations have said, ``We realize this is an \ninsidious, unscrupulous practice that will proliferate unless we stop \nit legislatively now.''\n  While it may now be electrical contractors, small builders and small \nbusinesses facing this, unless the insidious practice is stopped, we \nwill see it used in a calculating way against targeted industries and \ntargeted businesses across the economic spectrum.\n  This is a great opportunity for us, as we seek to invoke cloture on \nthis, this evening. We need 60 votes. I ask all of my colleagues in the \nU.S. Senate to carefully consider the simple change that this will make \nin the law, but the profound change it would have in restoring fairness \nin the workplace.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-two minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I ask unanimous consent, as I request a quorum call, \nthat the quorum call time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, while the clock is burning, I think it \nis an appropriate time for me to take a few moments here and relate and \ninclude in the Record some of the correspondence I have been privy to \nconcerning what small businesses are facing under the salting campaigns \naimed against them and targeting them. These are only samples, but I \nthink they are good samples of businesses across the country. I hope \nthe Senators from these various States we are looking at will think \nseriously about what their constituents are facing in these targeting \ncampaigns.\n  This particular letter is from Kenny Electric Service and was \naddressed to the Honorable Dan Schaefer in the State of Colorado. \nColorado, of course, like all States across the country, is facing \nthese kinds of campaigns. And because of the building movement in \nColorado, I think they have been a particular target. They have many \nelectrical contractors, building contractors, and small business people \nof various sorts who are facing this and are involved in the building \ntrades industry.\n  I will read the last paragraph in which the letter states:\n\n       Kenny Electric Service, Inc. has experienced financial \n     losses of over $1 million as a result of union tactics and \n     harassment. Attached are examples of harassment which caused \n     these losses. Your help with the legislation will sincerely \n     be appreciated.\n\n  Then they stipulate some of the expenses that they have incurred. He \nsaid:\n\n       We had a van with 7 union members arrive at our office to \n     respond to an ad that we ran for an electrician. They were \n     followed by the director of organizing, who was video taping \n     the whole process.\n       The above resulted in an NLRB charge, even though some of \n     them were indeed hired. The NLRB charge was ultimately \n     removed [and dropped] by the union [itself].\n       The union members filed frivolous and sometimes false OSHA \n     claims. For instance, one day the contractor's office trailer \n     was locked up at 7 a.m. The trailer had the drinking water in \n     it for the job. The contractor arrived at 7:15 a.m. and \n     opened the trailer. The union member had already called OSHA \n     and filed the complaint because water was not available for \n     15 minutes. It took me 3 hours to file the appropriate OSHA \n     report to avoid a fine and a claim.\n\n  Then he goes on with another full page of similar examples of the \nfrivolous claims that were filed against their company and the over $1 \nmillion in costs that were incurred.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                        Kenny Electric Service\n\n                                    Englewood CO, October 8, 1997.\n     Hon. Dan Schaefer,\n     Englewood, CO.\n       Dear Congressman Schaefer: I apologize for not being able \n     to meet with you next Monday to discuss the issue of Salting \n     Abuse. Salting Abuse is the placing of union members of \n     agents in a nonunion facility to harass or disrupt company \n     operations, apply economic pressure, increase operating and \n     legal costs, scale back business activities, or even put the \n     company out of business. Salting is being used in bad faith \n     as a harassment technique, largely by filing numerous\n\n[[Page S10273]]\n\n     frivolous NLRB complaints against open shop contractors. This \n     causes the contractor delays and expenses in legal fees to \n     contest these charges, and may jeopardize their work on a \n     project through delays and excessive problems that the owner \n     may not be able to endure.\n       I understand there is legislation in both houses of \n     Congress to address this situation. H.R. 3211, the Truth in \n     Employment Act, was introduced by Harris Fawell. Senator \n     Slade Gorton has also introduced S. 1025 which is similar to \n     H.R. 3211.\n       There has been compelling testimony regarding these salting \n     abuses in three hearings held in the 104th Congress by the \n     Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee. Several \n     witnesses illustrated that these union agents hide behind the \n     shield of the National Labor Relations Act, trying to destroy \n     their employers or deliberately increase costs through \n     various actions including sabotage and filing frivolous \n     complaints with various federal agencies. For most of these \n     companies, many of which were smaller businesses, the \n     economic harm inflicted by the union's salting campaigns was \n     devastating.\n       Kenny Electric Service, Inc. has experienced financial \n     losses over $1,000,000.00 as a result of union tactics and \n     harassment's. Attached are examples of harassment which \n     caused these losses. Your help with legislation will \n     sincerely be appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Rick L. Ellis,\n                                                        President.\n\n\n                                examples\n\n       We had a van with 7 union members arrive at our office to \n     respond to an ad we ran for an electrician. They were \n     followed by the director of organizing who was video taping \n     the whole process.\n       The above resulted in an N.L.R.B. charge even though some \n     of them were indeed hired. The N.L.R.B. charge was ultimately \n     removed by the union.\n       The union members hired salted our projects and tried to \n     promote the union.\n       The union members filed frivolous and sometimes false \n     O.S.H.A. claims. For instance, one day the contractors office \n     trailer was locked up at 7:00 a.m. This trailer had the \n     drinking water in it for the job. The contractor arrived at \n     7:15 a.m. and opened the trailer. The union member had \n     already called O.S.H.A. and filed a complaint because water \n     was not available for 15 minutes. It took me 3 hours to file \n     the appropriate O.S.H.A. report to avoid a fine and claim.\n       One union member filed a claim because he wasn't placed on \n     a project with a large number of electricians. He was placed \n     on the project closest to his house.\n       Two union members left work and are on economic strike.\n       We have had to date approximately 19 N.L.R.B. charges filed \n     against us. A settlement was negotiated with the N.L.R.B. for \n     dismissal of all charges.\n       The above items have taken over 500 hours of management to \n     handle and deal with.\n       The above have effected our ability to advertise for and \n     hire personnel that would have the company's interest and \n     future in mind.\n       The union does not want to organize our company, they want \n     to destroy our company.\n       We have continually trained and retrained our field \n     personnel on the legal do's and don'ts of the salting issues. \n     This takes away from their abilities to control and manage \n     their projects in a manner that is in the best interest of \n     the company.\n       We can no longer advertise using our company name without \n     the threat of being harassed and salted again and again. This \n     would only result in more N.L.R.B. charges.\n       The fact that we cannot actively hire new employees has \n     effected our ability to man our projects and has ultimately \n     stopped our ability to obtain new work.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I have a letter from Manno Electric, Inc., from the \npresident of that company to his Congressman, regarding forced \nunionism, or salting. I will read only one paragraph:\n\n       My company, Manno Electric, Inc., became a target for \n     salting in July 1992. We are a small firm, founded in 1972, \n     and based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Our business has been \n     family-owned and operated for the past 24 years and now has \n     annual sales of approximately $1 million and an average work \n     force of 25 employees.\n       In July 1992, I hired five union members during a peak work \n     time and laid them off when their jobs were completed in mid-\n     August 1992. Immediately, the union filed a ULP charge \n     claiming they were laid off because of their union \n     affiliation.\n\n  I will not read it all, but it concludes:\n\n       To date, I have paid my attorney over $75,000 for my \n     defense and have been ruled guilty on all charges by an \n     administrative law judge who proudly professed he formerly \n     represented the auto union and touted the high percentage of \n     success in union litigation.\n\n  Once again, he is continuing to appeal. But these are the kinds of \nsituations that these small companies are facing. That is from the \nState of Louisiana, Baton Rouge.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter from Manno Electric, Inc., \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         Manno Electric, Inc.,\n\n                                                  Baton Rouge, LA.\n     Re Forced Unionism--``Salting.''\n       The best kept secret by the labor unions today is their \n     insidious organizing strategy known as ``salting.'' Salting \n     is the practice of sending paid professional organizers and \n     union members into non-union work places (merit shops) under \n     the guise of seeking employment.\n       These ``salts'' are trained in a program called COMET, the \n     official organizing program of the AFL-CIO. They learn to \n     infiltrate a private business, and use tactics of harassment, \n     project disruption, and filing frivolous unfair labor \n     practice (ULP) charges with the National Labor Relations \n     Board (NLRB) against their employer.\n       If a union organizer is turned down for employment, or \n     dismissed by a merit shop contractor, for any reason, he \n     immediately files an unfair labor practice charge with the \n     NLRB. The strategy behind salting is to file enough ULP \n     charges against the contractor until the company is \n     financially devastated or joins the union. The contractor has \n     to legally defend himself against each charge, no matter how \n     trivial. Each NLRB complaint costs the employer an estimated \n     $5,000 to $10,000 to defend. Litigation for the union member \n     is paid by the taxpayer through the NLRB.\n       My company, Manno Electric, Inc., became a target for \n     salting in July 1992. We are a small firm, founded in 1972, \n     and based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Our business has been \n     family owned and operated for the past 24 years and now has \n     annual sales of approximately one million dollars and an \n     average workforce of 25 employees.\n       In July 1992, I hired five union members during a peak work \n     time and laid them off when their jobs were completed in mid-\n     August 1992. Immediately, the union filed an ULP charge \n     claiming they were laid off because of their union \n     affiliation.\n       Twelve other union members came in and applied for \n     employment during this time but were not hired because we had \n     no work for them. They filed unfair labor practice charges \n     for failure-to-hire, claiming discrimination because they \n     were affiliated with the union. The union contends that once \n     a member has applied for employment, you are forever bound to \n     keep his application at the forefront or risk another ULP \n     charge. The NLRB accepts this union theory and this is one of \n     the biggest weapons used to abuse the contractor. At my trial \n     in September 1993, I produced in evidence over 100 \n     applications we had on file at that time.\n       In all, over 20 union activists filed frivolous charges \n     against my company. To date, I have paid my attorney over \n     $75,000 for my defense and have been ruled guilty on all \n     charges by an Administrative Law Judge who proudly professed \n     he formally represented the auto union and touted the high \n     percentage of success in union litigation.\n       My trial was a mockery to justice. The judge slept \n     repeatedly during my trial and it was painfully clear that he \n     did not hear all of the proceedings or read the 1700 pages of \n     transcript in making his decision. He completely ignored our \n     witnesses' testimony and our exhibits.\n       The Clinton administration, through its powerful political \n     appointments in the Labor Department, has given a ``green \n     light'' to the labor unions, the NLRB and now the Supreme \n     Court to exercise their power to strike a deadly blow to \n     American enterprises and the free market system. Unions have \n     trained their agents to use and abuse the procedures of the \n     National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) as an offensive weapon \n     against employers. The NLRB accepts these frivolous charges \n     and rules with a strong bias toward labor.\n       The AFL-CIO has declared organizing as their top priority \n     in an effort to revive and rebuild union membership at all \n     costs.\n       The Supreme Court in its recent Town & Country unanimous \n     decision (9-0) has also helped to encourage labor. It focused \n     on a very narrow aspect of the law, ruling that a paid \n     organizer is a ``bona fide'' employee. It failed to address \n     the issue that open shops are being assaulted by union \n     agents, intent on not recruiting new members, but on putting \n     contractors out of business.\n       Today, due in part to the one and one-half years my appeal \n     was stayed by the NLRB awaiting the Town & Country decision \n     by the Supreme Court, my fines could exceed $500,000. In \n     addition, the back pay and interest mounts daily and will \n     continue to do so until I rehire the six union members that \n     were terminated and also the seven others who merely applied \n     but were not hired four years ago.\n       My business appears to be in financial ruin. This travesty \n     of justice must be exposed so that business owners across \n     this country can be alerted! An agent of the NLRB has even \n     warned me that if I tried to close my business due to the \n     inability to meet the liability, they had the right to force \n     me to reopen.\n       The appellate court and, perhaps, the Supreme Court is the \n     only recourse we have remaining. I can only pray that we do \n     not fall victim to this new domestic terrorism.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jack L. Manno,\n                                   President, Manno Electric, Inc.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Then I have a letter written by Betty Tyson at T \nMetal Works, Inc. I believe it does sheet metal duct work in \nJacksonville,\n\n[[Page S10274]]\n\nFL. This was addressed to the Honorable Tillie Fowler, a Congresswoman \nfrom Jacksonville, FL, regarding the Truth in Employment Act in 1996 in \nthe House of Representatives, H.R. 3211.\n  Once again, I will not read all of this correspondence. But part of \nwhat Betty Tyson writes is the following:\n\n       T Metal Works, Inc. has been in business for 10 years and \n     is a sheet metal company which fabricates and installs duct \n     work in commercial buildings. Presently, it is unlawful for a \n     business to refuse to hire a job applicant because he is a \n     union organizer or union member. Therefore, we have hired \n     several ``organizers'' from Sheet Metal Local 435 over the \n     past 10 months (since the organizing campaign began). The \n     problem is, these people are not trying to organize our \n     employees--they simply do everything they can think of to \n     disrupt our business by filing false charges, and are hiding \n     behind the labor laws which were created to protect \n     employees.\n\n  Then there are a number of specific details that are provided \nregarding the situation that T Metal Works face in Jacksonville, FL. \nI have a binder with similar letters and examples from all of the \nStates of the Union. This is something that is becoming very broad-\nbased and is becoming a widespread problem for small businesses \nstruggling to survive and provide jobs for working people of this \ncountry.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter from T Metal Works in \nJacksonville, FL, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord,  as follows:\n\n                                        T Metal Works, Inc.,\n\n                              Jacksonville, FL, December 11, 1996.\n     Re H.R. 3211 ``Truth in Employment Act of 1996.''\n\n     Hon. Tillie Fowler,\n     House of Representatives, Jacksonville, FL.\n       Dear Representative Fowler: Reference is made to my \n     telephone conversation with your assistant, Susan Siegmund, \n     on December 2, 1996, regarding the above-named bill, as well \n     as the conduct of the National Labor Relations Board. I \n     requested that you represent us because we seem to be in \n     limbo between our new representative (Brown) and our old one \n     (Stearns).\n       You may have copies of letters that were sent to you \n     previously dated May 1, 1996, and October 15, 1996. To date, \n     we have not had any luck with anyone taking a serious \n     interest in the problems we are encountering.\n       I also spoke to your assistant in Washington D.C., Brad \n     Thoburn. He requested that we put together an outline of the \n     problems we have experienced as a result of salting and the \n     lack of impartial decisions by the National Labor Relations \n     Board. I have enclosed a copy of that information for your \n     review. Mr. Thoburn also indicated that you are on the \n     Committee for H.R. 3211.\n       With all that said, I will try to give you a brief idea of \n     what our business has been going through as a result of \n     ``salting''.\n       T Metal Works, Inc. has been in business for 10 years and \n     is a sheet metal company which fabricates and installs duct \n     work in commercial buildings. Presently, it is unlawful for a \n     business to refuse to hire a job applicant because he is a \n     union organizer or union member. Therefore, we have hired \n     several ``organizers'' from Sheet Metal Local 435, over the \n     past ten months (since the organizing campaign began). The \n     problem is, these people are not trying to organize our \n     employees--they simply do everything they can think of to \n     disrupt our business by filing false charges, and are hiding \n     behind the Labor Laws which were created to protect \n     employees! (You will find details in the attached outline.)\n        We have had four sets of charges filed against us this \n     year. Representative Fowler, I can assure you that if we \n     didn't know the Labor Laws before, we certainly became \n     familiar with them between December, 1990, and February 1993. \n     During that period, we had ten sets of charges filed against \n     us by the union, and we spent $28,000 on labor attorneys \n     defending ourselves. We understand the labor laws and abide \n     by them, but it doesn't seem to matter. Somehow, the union is \n     able to persuade their ``organizers'' to lie repeatedly about \n     us.\n       There is a statement at the bottom of the ``Charge Against \n     Employer'' form which says ``Willful false statements on this \n     charge can be punished by fine and imprisonment''. This is a \n     joke! They might as well not have it on the form at all. The \n     local NLRB representative has told me he knows these people \n     are lying, yet the charges are not dismissed! In his defense, \n     I know he refers his findings to the Regional Office in \n     Tampa, and they make the final decision.\n       I have attached a copy of a letter we sent to Rochelle \n     Kentov, Regional Director/NLRB, regarding her recent decision \n     to postpone making a determination on charges that were \n     clearly false. I have no idea why she would want to review \n     the subsequent charges before making a decision on this \n     issue. The charges are unrelated, as you can see in the \n     attached.\n       In summary, we would like to request your support of the \n     Truth in Employment Act of 1996 in an effort to aid small \n     businesses, such as ours, throughout the country. Working \n     hard and having your own business is supposed to be the \n     American Dream, but is quickly turning into the American \n     Nightmare for us and countless others who are being pursued \n     by unscrupulous unions!\n       In addition, we feel it is imperative that the National \n     Labor Relations Board be an impartial entity. It is a crime \n     for them to allow this continued abuse of the Labor Laws. I \n     hope you will have some suggestions or ideas of how this can \n     be accomplished.\n       Thank you for this opportunity to express our concerns. We \n     look forward to hearing from you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Betty Tyson.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Then I have before me an editorial that appeared in \nthe Anchorage Times on December 17, 1996. You will notice that most of \nthe correspondence and editorials that have been written have occurred \nwithin the last 2, 3 years, because it is during this time period that \nthis problem has become so exacerbated, become so widely used by union \norganizers who are having little success in organizing otherwise, and \nthey are going to these very destructive tactics.\n  This was written December 17, 1996, in the Anchorage Times, and I \nthink the title of the editorial is significant: ``Do Bad Real Good.'' \nIn this case, it was actually a city that was facing a union salting \ncampaign, and the threats that were made by the IBEW representatives \nwere so egregious that it received widespread attention. I will read \npart of that editorial:\n\n       In a meeting with Mayor Margie Johnson in November, \n     according to City Manager Scott Janke, the IBEW \n     representatives threatened the community with great financial \n     harm.\n\n  The IBEW representative said:\n\n       By the time we get finished with this town, it will make \n     the open meeting lawsuit your town was in look like chicken \n     feed.\n\n  That cost the town over a million dollars in legal fees. So the union \norganizer representative said it was going to be ``chicken feed'' \ncompared to what they were going to do.\n  He said:\n\n       Your town can't afford it, but we can. We will take out \n     advertisements in the paper. We will ruin you.\n       * * * What we will do is rip this town apart.\n\n  Then he said:\n\n       We do bad real good.\n\n  It is that abuse, which is so often explicitly and blatantly stated, \nwhich this legislation would address.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this Anchorage Times editorial be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Anchorage Times, Dec. 17, 1996]\n\n                            Do Bad Real Good\n\n       Organized labor began the year with optimism about the \n     national and state elections. Unions invested heavily in \n     favorite candidates. But they didn't fair well--either in \n     races for Congress or the Alaska Legislature.\n       Polls indicated the results had to do with labor's \n     reputation in the eyes of many voters--a rap for heavy-handed \n     dealings. It proved too much of a burden for many labor-\n     backed candidates.\n       Whether deserved or not, labor's negative reputation was \n     reinforced the other day when residents of Cordova read a \n     memo from the city manager about an encounter between the \n     mayor and two female officials of the International \n     Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.\n       The IBEW and the city have been in a stalemate over \n     contract negotiations that began after city employees voted \n     two years ago in favor of being represented by the union. The \n     union says it intends to file an unfair labor practice charge \n     against the city because it hasn't engaged in good faith \n     bargaining. The city says it has.\n       In a meeting with Mayor Margie Johnson in November, \n     according to City Manager Scott Janke, the IBEW \n     representatives threatened the community with great financial \n     harm.\n       According to Janke's memo, this--including a reference to a \n     non-related open meeting lawsuit that had cost Cordova $1.3 \n     million--is what one of the union people said:\n       ``By the time we get finished with this town it will make \n     the open meeting lawsuit your town was in look like chicken \n     feed. Your town can't afford it, but we can. We will take out \n     advertisements in the paper. We will ruin you.\n       ``If you hire a lobbyist, I am going to be right behind him \n     or her in Juneau and (urinate) on everything that Cordova \n     wants. You won't get one capital project.\n       ``What we will do is rip this town apart. We do bad real \n     good.''\n       The following day at a meeting between city officials and \n     the IBEW representatives, a lawyer for the city confirmed \n     with the two union officials that the quotes, as recorded by \n     the mayor, were accurate. A half dozen city officials heard \n     the confirmation, Janke says.\n\n[[Page S10275]]\n\n       After the city's memo began circulating around the state \n     about a month later, the IBEW issued a denial of the quotes, \n     demanded an apology from the city and a retraction for what \n     it called misrepresentation and false statements.\n       The city gave this official response to the IBEW last week: \n     ``Shame on you.'' The union should be ashamed, the city said, \n     for the threat, for the belated denial, and for the demand \n     for an apology.\n       Mayor Johnson, who receives no salary, says she is \n     disappointed. She had hoped for a partnership between the \n     city and the union. ``They know we don't have a lot of \n     resources in Cordova. A leaking roof at city hall, the \n     school's falling apart, and there are only 750 property tax \n     payers to support it all. We're struggling to stay abreast. \n     Threats don't help anything,'' she said.\n       Especially on election day.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, while I continue to have the floor, I \njust want to point to this chart, which is an editorial that I think \nvery well frames the issue that confronts the Senate today in this \ncloture motion.\n  It is entitled ``Harassing Job Providers.'' It appeared recently in \nthe Detroit News. I think, once again, it frames this issue quite well. \nI will read part of it.\n\n       One form of the tactic is called ``salting'' in which union \n     agents take a job at a nonunion firm and attempt to organize \n     workers. They also file endless and often frivolous claims of \n     labor law violations against the companies. Another tactic is \n     simply to file the claims on behalf of other workers, whether \n     or not the workers are actually aggrieved.\n       These tactics, as well as ``salting,'' are known as \n     corporate campaigns and are designed to give unions more \n     leverage when they are at a low ebb. Only 10 percent of \n     private sector workers are in unions. One prounion handbook \n     quoted by Investors Business Daily observes that ``Every law \n     or regulation is a potential net in which management can be \n     snared and entangled.\n\n  I think they rightly conclude that:\n\n       Regulations ought to be about protecting people, not \n     ``ensnaring and entangling'' anyone. Part of the problem is \n     addressed by legislation introduced by Republicans Harris \n     Fawell of Illinois in the House and * * *.''\n\n  And it goes on and speaks about that legislation.\n  But here is the point I would make; I think the editorial made it \nwell: Regulations, labor laws, and labor regulations implemented by the \nNLRB exist not to ensnare and entangle small business men and women who \nare trying to survive, trying to provide jobs and trying to make a \nliving. They exist to protect both employer and employee and have \nalways been intended to provide and to maintain balance. The fact is \nthat when the National Labor Relations Act was passed no one could have \nenvisioned that these kinds of tactics would become so commonplace.\n  So when the opponents of this legislation stand, as they surely will, \nand say, ``This is just an effort to undermine and to hurt organizing \nefforts, this is antiworker and antilabor,'' I once again remind those \nSenators that the only thing this legislation targets are the abuses of \nexisting law. The only thing this legislation targets are the insidious \nand absolutely indefensible tactics of going in with the explicit \npurpose of destroying a business, destroying a businesswoman, of \nruining their financial viability with a truly scorched earth policy, a \nterm that has been used frequently of recent. This is truly scorched \nearth. If you can't organize and destroy them, that is what ``salting'' \nis all about. That is why it is incumbent upon us to restore balance \nand to restrain these kinds of unethical tactics that are being more \nand more widely used.\n  Mr. President, I observe the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the time under the quorum call be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand we have a time allocation and those who are \nopposed to the Hutchinson proposal now have, as I understand it, about \n50 minutes. Am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 48 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. OK. I will yield myself 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are reaching the last few weeks of \nthis session of the Congress, and I think it is appropriate to give \nsome consideration to the positions of the Republican leadership on the \nmany issues that affect working families, because we will consider one \nof these issues later in the afternoon and another tomorrow when the \nSenate is going to be debating and also voting on the increase in the \nminimum wage.\n  I think it is appropriate that we look over what has been the \nRepublican leadership position on issue after issue that affects \nworking families in this country over the period of these last few \nyears. There you will find a wholesale assault on the interests and the \nrights and the economic conditions and wages of working Americans.\n  I can remember 3 and one-half years ago, just after the Republicans \ngained leadership positions in the Senate, one of the first proposals \noffered was the repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act. I can remember being in \nthis Chamber and asking my colleagues what is it about the Davis-Bacon \nAct that they object to. Well, they talked about the inflation it adds \nto construction projects. The average income for a construction worker \nin the United States of America is just over $30,500. What is it that \nis so outrageous for a worker involved in construction--construction, \nthe second most dangerous industry--to make $30,500? Why is that such a \ndramatic concern to the leadership of the Republican Party? We find it \ntime in and time out--let us eliminate Davis-Bacon to make sure that we \ndo not give government contractors the opportunity to inflate wages of \nworkers in this country.\n  Nonetheless, we took a number of days on that particular issue. I was \nwondering why it was, with all the problems we were facing at that \nparticular time, our Republican friends wanted to take away some very \nimportant income for working families.\n  And then we had introduced an increase in the minimum wage--at that \ntime it was $4.35 an hour--for the working poor--men and women who work \n40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, who want to be able to bring up \ntheir children with some kind of respect, but who are living in \npoverty. Most Americans believe that those who want to work and can \nwork, who believe in work, who are prepared to show up for work and \nplay by the rules, ought to be able to have a livable wage.\n  We will have an opportunity to address that issue again tomorrow. We \nhave the most extraordinary prosperity in the history of the nation, \nwith the lowest unemployment and the lowest inflation. But still the \nRepublicans say no to that, no to the wages of working families who are \ninvolved in construction, no 2 years ago to any increase in the minimum \nwage, and then finally, finally, finally, finally, they acceded to a \nmodest increase in the minimum wage. And now we have the issue before \nus again. We know that the purchasing power of working families has \nbeen at its lowest, has deteriorated the greatest, and the highest \nincome Americans have seen their incomes increase.\n  In the immediate postwar period, all Americans went up together. The \nrising tide raised all the boats--low income and upper income Americans \nincreased at about the same rate. But now, according to the Republican \nleadership, they want to see a decline in the wages of working families \nby repealing Davis-Bacon. They don't want to see any increase for \nworking families in a minimum wage.\n  And then I remember, as we went on into last session, the assault on \nthe earned-income tax credit. Increasing the minimum wage helps working \npeople, whatever the size of their family. But the earned income tax \ncredit helps low wage workers if they have one or more children. The \nmore children you have, the greater the benefit to you from the earned-\nincome tax credit.\n  But we had the Republican leadership not only condemning the income \nof construction workers under the Davis-Bacon Act, but saying no to any \nincrease in the minimum wage. And for those Americans with large \nfamilies who earn less than $31,000, we saw the wholesale Republican \nassault on those families by cutting the earned-income tax credit. I \nbelieve their particular proposal was $9 billion.\n  Now, we went on for 6 or 8 months, and I asked, what is this all \nabout?\n\n[[Page S10276]]\n\n Why are we having this wholesale assault on working families at the \nsame time we saw the assault on Medicare and Social Security, to take \nover $256 billion and give tax breaks to the wealthiest individuals.\n  Well, Mr. President, this assault that we had from the Republican \nleadership in the last session of Congress has continued, and it \ncontinues today. We have seen serious efforts to undermine the \noccupational health and safety legislation. Who does that protect? \nLegislation that had bipartisan support in 1972 that has seen the total \nnumber of deaths in the United States from on-the-job work cut in half. \nBut we see our Republican friends saying we want to cut back on OSHA \nprotections.\n  We say, all right, maybe it ought to be streamlined; maybe it ought \nto be more effective. What can we do to provide additional protection \nfor workers? The GOP says, oh, no, we want more protection for the \ncompanies, and less protection for the workers. The Republicans want to \npermit companies to hire their own inspectors, and if their own \ninspectors say they pass muster, they want them to be immune from any \nkind of enforcement by OSHA. The Republican agenda includes undermining \ntheir income, undermining the safety of working families--this is their \nagenda.\n\n  We say maybe it really is not so. Let's give the Republicans an \nopportunity to prove that they really do care about working families. \nLet's try to see what we can do with family and medical leave. We are \nthe only industrial nation that does not provide paid family and \nmedical leave that pays the workers. We provided it for companies with \nover 50 employees, and it has been a resounding success. It has been a \nresounding success, and enormously important, as we have seen from the \nstudies that show the importance of parents being with infants during \ntheir early days.\n  We heard the debate. It went on for weeks with the opposition of \nRepublicans on the Family and Medical Leave Act. Now it is in effect. \nIt is broadly accepted, welcomed, and the people who benefited from it \nhave been working families.\n  Efforts were brought up not long ago, a little over a year ago: Let's \ntry to extend it from companies that have 50 or more workers to those \nwith over 25 and pick up another 13 million working families. We cover \nabout half of the workforce now with the 50 or more, but let's bring it \ndown so we pick up another 13 million Americans. If it works for one, \nlet's try it for the other.\n  You would think the world would collapse when we listened to the \nRepublican leadership saying ``no way are we going to consider \nextension of the Family and Medical Leave. No way are we going to \nextend that concept.''\n  We hear a great deal on the floor of the U.S. Senate about families \nand family values. One of the best ways of advancing family values is \nto let working people have family income. Let them spend some time with \ntheir families when they are working. Let them be safe so they can go \nhome to their families, and not lose their lives in construction or be \nmaimed in construction. That is a family value.\n  Now we had the wonderful amendment of Senator Murray of the State of \nWashington. She said, ``Let's just give parents 24 hours--24 hours so \nthat parent might be able to go to a parent meeting, maybe be able to \ngo to an academic program in which a child is involved. Let us give 24 \nhours a year of unpaid leave so parents can see their child receive an \naward at school.''\n  ``No, no, no,'' said our Republican friends, ``we can't possibly do \nthat. We can't possibly do that. That will interrupt the workplace. \nThat will disrupt the workforce. We will give you something else.''\n  They came back with a wonderful proposal--what they call ``comp \ntime.'' ``No,'' to Senator Murray, the Senator from Washington, who was \ntrying to do something for families. They come back with what they call \ncomp time. They use all the appealing rhetoric. They claim they will \ngive people the time they need to take off to attend to family needs. \nBut, you know, Mr. President, we went through that debate. One thing \nthat those proponents would never be able to answer is that little part \nof the legislation that I read time in and time out that said it will \nbe up to the employer when they will be able to get the comp time. In \nthe meantime, we are going to abolish the 40-hour week and we are not \ngoing to pay overtime. A wonderful deal for workers. A wonderful deal \nfor workers.\n  Who do you think supported that? It is always interesting to me when \nwe have these wonderful statements of people who propose things, to \nthen look at who benefits and who loses. Who do you think supported the \nRepublican proposal on comp time? The Chamber of Commerce, all the \nbusiness interests. Who opposed it? Working families, women's \norganizations and children's groups, because they saw it was phony and \nthey saw it was fraudulent.\n  So on it goes. Here we have the assault on the economic interests of \nworking families, the assault on OSHA, the assault on our efforts to \nextend Family and Medical Leave, and many more.\n  Another example is campaign finance reform. We talked about it. It \nhas been effectively defeated in the U.S. Senate because of Republican \nleadership. Eight courageous Republicans, eight of them, were willing \nto stand up and try to advance campaign finance reform.\n  The first amendment that our Republican friends offered, before they \nsunk campaign finance reform, was what they call the paycheck \nprotection provision. That sounds like a good one. On whom do you think \nit was focused? On whom do you think that paycheck protection was \nfocused? Can you guess? Working families. Working families, to deny \nthem the opportunity to participate effectively in our political \nprocess. That is just a continuation of the assault on working \nfamilies. It is meant to deny them the most fundamental and basic \nopportunity--to participate in the election process.\n  The No. 1 amendment was to deny people their rights. Our agenda was \ndifferent. Our agenda seeks to expand safety and health protection in \nthe workplace. We want to expand family and medical leave, invest in \neducation, strengthen Medicare for our elderly, try to do something for \nSocial Security--that is our agenda. I know it.\n  I yield to no one in sponsoring those proposals because they make an \nimportant difference to children, to workers and to our parents. I also \nsupport other proposals to make sure our streets are safe and our air \nwater is clean. But we spent weeks on their so-called Paycheck \nProtection Act, not to change the system to try to deal with the \nabuses--but to deny working families the right to participate in the \npolitical process.\n  It was not much later that the GOP brought up the TEAM Act. That bill \ngoes under the guise of giving workers a chance to work together in \norder to get a safer workplace and better productivity. All of those \ngoals can be advanced now, under current law. I do not think any of \nthose who supported the TEAM Act can compare the kind of increased \nproductivity we have seen with General Electric, for example, in \nmodernizing their jet engines, that has been done with workers and \nengineers working together.\n  I can take you up to the plant in Lynn, Massachusetts. Every time I \ntour that plant, I see the incredible increase in productivity, because \nworkers are working there alongside engineers to increase productivity \nand increase safety. But the TEAM Act does something else. What was \nthat? That bill would have permitted any CEO to choose employees' \nrepresentatives, so that the CEO could bargain with the named employees \nabout any of the issues about which other workers might be concerned.\n  How do we like that? Generally speaking, we would think that the \nworkers themselves ought to be able to make a decision among themselves \nwho ought to represent the group. That is a basic, fundamentally \ndemocratic concept. But no, no, not according to the Republican \nleadership.\n  Under the TEAM Act, the employee names the representatives, and if \nthe employer doesn't like the person, he can fire the person. The \nemployer sets the agenda and the schedule. The employer sets what will \nbe on the schedule. The employer can change the schedule any time he or \nshe wants to do it. Mr. President, that is under the guise of trying to \nchange and be more productive. It basically would have undermined the \nopportunity for worker expression that has worked effectively\n\n[[Page S10277]]\n\nover some 60 years of collective bargaining.\n  So, Mr. President, now we are in the final days of this session, and \nsuddenly we come up here with other legislation which is focused on \nundermining the opportunity for workers to organize. Surprise, \nsurprise, surprise. Absolutely no surprise. Absolutely no surprise.\n  There has been a continuous effort over the last several years to \nundermine working families' interests in this country. It is as plain \nand simple as that. The Republicans have tried all different ways of \ndoing it. They tried to undermine them economically. They tried to \nundermine their health and their safety in their OSHA recommendations. \nThey tried to undermine their ability to participate in elections with \ntheir paycheck protection, and here they are trying to undermine their \nbasic and fundamental opportunity to organize.\n  They have come in the last few days to try to overturn a unanimous \nSupreme Court decision--unanimous. It wasn't a decision that was 5-4, \nit was unanimous. Why? Because Republican appointees to the Supreme \nCourt--conservative Republican appointees to the Supreme Court--\nunderstand very clearly what this kind of antisalting legislation will \nmean, and that is, basically, it will undermine one of the most basic \nand fundamental tenets of American and industrial democracy, and that \nis the ability to have collective bargaining and to have opportunities \nfor workers to make a judgment either to choose a union or to reject \nit. That is where we are. We will have that particular vote this \nevening, and then we will go to the minimum wage issue tomorrow. We \nwill have an opportunity to do that, Mr. President.\n  I won't even bother taking the time, because I want to address more \nspecifically the legislation that is before us, but I just mention that \nunder the Republican House leadership, they effectively eliminated \nevery summer job for kids in this country--zeroed out the summer jobs \nprogram. Zero funding. It isn't just the workers, it is the teenagers \nin urban and rural areas.\n  I hope we will not hear tomorrow during the debate on the minimum \nwage, ``Well, this is an entry-level job; we want to give teenagers an \nopportunity to work, and if we have an increase in the minimum wage, we \nare going to deny all those teenagers an opportunity to work.'' It \nwon't stand up. We will give them the reports, show them the charts and \nthe various economic analyses that show their argument is just baloney.\n  How are they going to explain that they zeroed out every single cent \nfor summer jobs for teenagers in the House of Representatives? Zero. \nThey say they care about workers? They claim they care about teenagers? \nThe summer jobs program gives them an opportunity to have meaningful \nwork, and they zeroed it out.\n  Mr. President, this was just a very brief comment about where we find \nourselves, about who is really interested in working families, and what \nthe Republican leadership has been about over the past three and a half \nyears.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 25 minutes 22 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 15 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose the so-called Truth in \nEmployment Act, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it, too. This bill \nis the latest in a long series of Republican antilabor, antiunion, \nantiworker initiatives. They have soothing titles and harsh provisions. \nThe GOP's Family Friendly Workplace Act would abolish the 40-hour week. \nThe GOP's Paycheck Protection Act would lock American workers out of \nelection campaigns. The GOP TEAM Act would bring back company-dominated \nsham unions. Like those schemes, the GOP Truth in Employment Act has an \nappealing title and appalling substance.\n  The bill's sponsors claim that it is designed to outlaw salting, a \ndecades-old practice of people seeking a job at a nonunion shop with \nthe intention of persuading coworkers to join the union.\n  Salting was unanimously upheld by the Supreme Court in the 1995 Town \n& Country decision. But this bill does much more than simply reverse \nthat decision. It undermines the rights of workers to organize to \nimprove their jobs and also infringes on a wide array of other \nlegitimate activities that are important to all Americans. These \nactivities include efforts to improve the status of women and \nminorities in employment, strengthen safety in the workplace, and many, \nmany more.\n  The bill aims at labor unions, but it also hits many other important \nrights. This bill allows employers to deny jobs to people if they have \n``the primary purpose of furthering another employment or agency \nstatus.'' Those are the words from the legislation.\n  The bill invites employers to pry into their employees' activities \noutside the workplace to discover the workers' ``primary purpose.'' It \nencourages firms to ask job applicants whether they are union members \nor civil rights activists and refuse to hire them if they answer yes. \nThis blunderbuss provision institutionalizes the blacklist.\n  The bill is blatantly antiunion, and its supporters include the \nNational Right to Work Committee and many antiunion employer \nassociations. But the bill goes well beyond discrimination against \nunion members. It permits many other kinds of flagrant discrimination.\n  By permitting employers to deny jobs to workers who have ``the \nprimary purpose of furthering another employment or agency status,'' \nthe bill also allows firms to fire or refuse to hire a person who seeks \nto advance the goals of another employer.\n  A company can fire a worker who is also employed by a labor union.\n  The bill also lets an employer refuse to hire someone based on the \nfear that she might band together with coworkers to push for an on-the-\njob child care center. The employer can argue the applicant was trying \nto advance the goal of women's groups to which she belonged.\n  The bill also allows a firm to fire African-American employees who \nseek to reduce race discrimination in the workplace.\n  The bill lets an employer fire workers who seek to change company \npolicy and allow time off for religious holidays, for family and \nmedical leave, or other worthwhile purposes.\n  This legislation legitimizes discrimination of the most offensive \ntype. It encourages companies not to hire women. It invites \ndiscrimination against anyone else the employer believes might push an \nagenda in the workplace the employer doesn't like.\n  It encourages employers to probe into employees' private beliefs and \nactivities. Freedom of expression and association are guaranteed in the \nfirst amendment. For over 200 years, this country has protected \nindividual liberties. Those freedoms are essential to our national \ncharacter, but this bill clearly undermines their beliefs.\n  The bill's supporters claim they want only to outlaw deceptive \npractices. They contend that employers are victimized by paid union \norganizers who accept a job with no intention of performing the work. \nInstead, they claim, these employees disrupt the job, harass coworkers, \nand file repeated frivolous complaints with governmental agencies. \nInnocent employers are forced to waste time and effort defending \nthemselves against baseless charges.\n  Section 3 of the bill says its purpose is ``to alleviate pressure on \nemployers to hire individuals who seek or gain employment in order to \ndisrupt the workplace of the employer or otherwise inflict economic \nharm designed to put the employer out of business.''\n  Employers are not powerless under current law in the face of abusive \npractices. To the contrary--employers have many ways to ensure an \nefficient and productive workplace.\n  First and foremost, a business can refuse to hire someone who is not \nqualified for the job. If an applicant lacks the experience or the \nskills required, the employer can simply say no. Union membership does \nnot automatically entitle someone to be hired, nor is it discrimination \nnot to hire a union organizer who cannot perform the duties of the job. \nThe employer has substantial control.\n  The company can also protect its legitimate business interests by \nsetting a policy barring workers from outside employment.\n  The firm can require employees to forego moonlighting of all kinds, \nfrom\n\n[[Page S10278]]\n\ndriving a taxi, to telemarketing from home, to working weekends at the \ncorner store.\n  The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that such a policy \ncan be applied against paid union organizers so long as it is applied \nneutrally to all other types of employment.\n  This is a sensible rule. It recognizes employers' legitimate \ninterests in workers who are focused on the job. We understand that, \nMr. President. If the company says, ``No, no moonlighting. The workers \nin our particular shop can only work on one job. We want that for \nbusiness reasons, because we might need to have the workers work a \nsecond shift or a third shift and, therefore, we don't want you working \nin some other capacity.'' They can do that and accomplish the result \nthey claim is their intent.\n  That is the Sixth Circuit's decision in the Architectural Glass \ndecision in 1997. It says that they can effectively ban all kinds of \nmoonlighting if they have a company-wide policy. So people cannot \nparticipate in other kinds of employment. If they are so concerned \nabout that, they can do that. They can do that now. That is a way for \nthem to try and deal with this issue if they are concerned about it.\n  Employers can also discipline or discharge employees who neglect \ntheir job duties. Workers who leave their stations or simply do not \ncomplete the work required of them can be disciplined. In April 1997, \nthe Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld an employer's right to \ndischarge workers who failed to carry out their duties. In the Hess \nMechanical case, the workers neglected their duties and tried to \npersuade their coworkers to join the union. The court held that the \nemployer was well within his right to fire the workers for poor \nperformance.\n  We understand that, Mr. President. If they hire someone who isn't \ninterested in working, will not work, or can't do the work they can \nfire the workers who neglect their job duties. If they are not going to \ndo the work for which they were hired, and if they are not qualified \nfor the job, they don't need to be hired. If they are qualified for the \njob, they are hired, they work. If they do not work, and they are busy \nin other activities, they can be fired. That is the law of the land \ntoday--today.\n  Union membership does not give workers the right not to perform the \njob. A company can suspend workers who fail to perform adequately. \nTheir pay can be docked. Disciplinary letters can be placed in their \nfiles. In extreme cases, they can be fired. Employers can use all of \nthese items, and more, to get the job done. They are far from powerless \nto address the types of abuses cited by the bill's supporters.\n  Employers are also free to discipline workers who disrupt the job. \nHarassing coworkers or customers or blocking entrances, intruding in \nother work areas, all of these acts can constitute grounds for \ndiscipline. Once again, employers have many ways to maintain quality, \nefficiency, and productivity without undermining the employee's \nlegitimate rights.\n  If the misconduct is extreme, employers can call the police. \nViolence, threats, and intimidation are criminal offenses. Damaging or \ndestroying company property is a crime. No employer needs to sit idly \nby if employees commit such gross misconduct. Criminal charges can be \nfiled. The offender can be removed from the worksite. These sanctions \nare in addition to all the other disciplinary mechanisms available to \nthe employer. Once again, union membership confers no immunity.\n  This bill's supporters contend that union members inherently suffer \nfrom ``divided loyalties.'' They claim that union members simply cannot \nbe truly loyal to the employer, cannot give the employer the genuine \nallegiance required for an effective and productive workplace. But that \nextreme antiworker, antiunion view was rejected over 60 years ago when \nCongress passed the National Labor Relations Act. The so-called divided \nloyalty antiunion claim is phony. It was used by countless harsh \nemployers to deny the fundamental rights of workers. And Congress put a \nstop to it in the 1930s.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nvarious letters that I have from a number of companies.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Central Sierra Electric Co., Inc.,\n\n                                   Jackson, CA, November 21, 1995.\n     Mr. Jim DeWilms,\n     Local #684 IBEW.\n       Dear Jim: In response to our conversation last week, here \n     is my opinion concerning the benefits and drawbacks to being \n     a union shop. As you know, Central Sierra Electric Co., Inc. \n     has been in business for fourteen years and has been \n     signatory with IBEW for the past two years. Listed below are \n     what I consider to be among the Union's strengths. To date we \n     have found no drawbacks.\n       Extremely helpful in getting qualified manpower.\n       Notified us of numerous jobs out to bid.\n       Given our name to developers & manufacturers looking for \n     qualified contractors.\n       Assistance in getting jobs when competing against non-union \n     shops.\n       I hope this is of assistance to you. Please feel free to \n     give me a call.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Cliff Franklin,\n     Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            Tl Electric, Inc.,\n\n                             Mountain View, CA, November 17, 1995.\n     Subcommittee Chairman, Peter Hoekstra,\n     U.S. Congress.\n       To the Honorable Mr. Hoekstra: My name is Tim Long the \n     owner of TL Electric License #701016. I was formerly a non-\n     union firm who was just recently organized by the use of \n     union salts from a couple of IBEW locals here in Northern \n     California. After these employees made it known to me that \n     they were affiliated with the union, it became apparent to me \n     that the skill and ability that they had, along with their \n     understanding of their rights as employees could only help me \n     became a better contractor. At no time did they try to put my \n     company in a bad light with my clients nor did they try to \n     encourage my employees to become destructive to my equipment \n     or to stop performing any assigned tasks. What they did do, \n     was to show me they were productive, loyal employees that \n     only wanted my company to succeed and for my employees to \n     enjoy a better way of life by educating them as to what their \n     rights were under the National Labor Relations Act.\n       Once I started to deal with the union salts and talk to \n     them and to my employees I felt that becoming union would be \n     something that I could look into. In all my dealings with the \n     local union I was never threatened with any type of action. I \n     was offered help in every area that I asked for and had my \n     questions answered honestly. Since becoming a union \n     contractor I have used the local union hiring halls and I am \n     very pleased with all of the union members who have staffed \n     my jobs. They have proven to me that they can be loyal as \n     employees and to their union and that they are educated men \n     and women who care about their rights and want to ensure that \n     these rights are not denied to them. These union salts are \n     out there trying to educate every man and woman that they \n     have rights. They are not out there trying to put honest \n     contractors out of business. I know that with the IBEW my \n     company will be profitable and my employees educated to their \n     rights.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                      Tim J. Long,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Alonso Electric,\n\n                                Burlingame, CA, November 28, 1995.\n       To Whom it may Concern:  I am an Electrical Contractor and \n     have been licensed since 1995. I joined the IBEW, Electrician \n     Union in 1993. As an IBEW contractor I have been able to call \n     the union hall when I need qualified electricians to work for \n     me, and when the job is complete I can send them back to the \n     union hall and do not have to worry about keeping a good man \n     even when I have no work for him. So as a contractor the IBEW \n     has solved my labor problems.\n       Personally I am receiving training in electrical theory and \n     code requirements. I now have a good health and dental \n     insurance plan, and am participating in a pension plan, which \n     I never had before.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Frank Alonso.\n\n           [From the Labor Times, Kansas City, KS, Dec. 1995]\n\n              IBEW 124 Ties Good Business, Contractor Says\n\n                            (By Tom Bogdon)\n\n       One of the active boosters of recruiting reforms within \n     International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 124 has \n     been Carl McKarnin, general manager of the power plant \n     division of Pioneer Electric Co. That is not too surprising \n     considering McKarnin's own experience as a young electrician \n     fresh out of the Navy and seeking a career in electrical \n     work.\n       ``I talked to the girl working in the front office (of the \n     union),'' McKarnin said in a recent interview. ``She said she \n     was sorry that no one got any farther without a sponsor. It \n     was a closed-door union. I didn't know anyone at the time to \n     sponsor me. I had no choice but to seek out other unions or \n     go to a non-union shop.\n       ``And it wasn't just the IBEW,'' McKarnin continued. ``All \n     the skilled trades were like that. If you didn't have a \n     relative or friend in the union for a sponsor, you didn't get \n     in.''\n       Local 124 shunned McKarnin back in 1964, but the \n     exclusionary policies in effect then\n\n[[Page S10279]]\n\n     did not slow McKarnin very much. He went on to build one of \n     the largest and most successful electrical contracting firms \n     in the metropolitan area. And five years ago McKarnin signed \n     an agreement affiliating his firm with Local 124.\n       Now McKarnin assists actively in the aggressive efforts led \n     by Local 124 Business Manager Lindell Lee to organize the \n     unorganized sectors of the Kansas City electrical industry. \n     McKarnin is fighting alongside Lee and other Local 124 \n     members to eliminate vestiges of the ``Country Club'' \n     atmosphere that for 30 years contributed to a steep decline, \n     both locally and nationally, in the market share of \n     electricians represented by the IBEW.\n       Also like Lee, McKarnin does not dismiss the competitive \n     threat to growth of the unionized sector of the electrical \n     industry posed by such non-union contractors as South Kansas \n     City Electric (SKCE). * * *\n       ``Unions have got a hard fight on their hands,'' McKarnin \n     said. ``There are several very good non-union companies out \n     there that have good employees working for them. People like \n     Lindell Lee recognize that and are moving aggressively to do \n     something about it.\n       ``An example of that is the employees working for us \n     (Pioneer) who came out of SKCE,'' McKarnin continued. ``We've \n     taken in five of them, I believe that's correct. One of them, \n     Tony Galate, has been with us four years and is a general \n     foreman. He's running the new Federal Courthouse project \n     Downtown for us now. That's the largest single contract the \n     company has now or has ever had.''\n       McKarnin was born 52 years ago in Liberty and grew up in \n     the village of Randolph in Clay County. He attended North \n     Kansas City High School, but dropped out when he got a job in \n     a greenhouse, later working for National Bellas Hess and \n     Pioneer Bag Co. He joined the Navy in 1960 for a four-year \n     hitch, and was stationed on the aircraft carrier Lexington.\n       McKarnin trained ashore as an electrician while the \n     Lexington was docked in San Diego. He described his 14-week \n     Navy training course in electrical work as ``excellent.'' * * \n     *\n       Upon returning to Kansas City and, being unable to join \n     IBEW Local 124. McKarnin went to a North Kansas City bank to \n     open an account. McKarnin said the bank president asked him \n     what he did for a living, and that he replied he was \n     unemployed and looking for a job as an electrician. The \n     banker recommended that McKarnin talk to Gabe Brull at Clayco \n     Electric.\n       McKarnin was hired at Clayco, whose employees were \n     represented by District 5 of the United Mine Workers, serving \n     a four-year apprenticeship with that organization, which \n     later merged with the United Steelworkers of America. \n     McKarnin, who obtained a GED certificate in the Navy, also \n     studied electronics for two years at the Central Technical \n     Institute and electrical engineering for two years at the \n     Finley Engineering College.\n       In 1969, McKarnin worked nine months at Evans Electric with \n     a temporary IBEW Local 124 ticket, helping to build a runway \n     at Kansas City International Airport and the nearby Trans \n     World Airlines office building. He also served six years as \n     president of the 200-member Steelworker Local 14436 which at \n     that time represented electricians.\n       ``It's interesting,'' McKarnin observed. ``I've worked so \n     closely with IBEW 124, but I was never a card-holding \n     member.''\n       In 1984, McKarnin and his wife Patrick bought Pioneer \n     Electric, which had been founded in 1977. In 1994, Pioneer \n     was sold to Duane Russell, and McKarnin signed a five-year \n     contract to remain with the company as general manager for \n     the power plant division.\n       In addition to other types of work, Pioneer services four \n     Kansas City Power Light Co. power plants, the Board of Public \n     Utilities' Quindaro plant, the Thomas H. Power Plant north of \n     Columbia, Mo., and other plants in Denver, Sioux City, Iowa, \n     among others.\n       McKarnin said Pioneer currently employs about 160 \n     electricians, including about 90 IBEW 124 members and others \n     from Local 226 in Topeka. McKarnin said Pioneer's employment \n     peaked at about 300 last year, including office and craft \n     personnel.\n       ``I have worked very closely with IBEW 124 since our \n     employees voted to be represented by the IBEW about five \n     years ago,'' McKarmin said. ``Middle class America was \n     created by the unions. Non-union wage standards are set by \n     the unions. Most people don't realize that. Most people think \n     the employer will automatically take care of the employees.\n       ``But if you travel outside this country to anywhere there \n     is no union representation, you have two classes of people--\n     the extremely rich and the extremely poor.'' McKarnin \n     continued. ``The middle class of any country is created by \n     the unions. And non-union wages are set by the unions. \n     Usually the non-union shops pay just a little bit less. But \n     they don't pay any more than they have to.\n       ``It also should be noted that the middle class--created by \n     unions--pays most of the taxes that have set the high \n     standard of life in this country that is envied by most of \n     the world.'' McKarnin said.\n       ``Other reasons I support the union is because of the \n     federal laws they have fought for,'' McKarnin said. ``Look at \n     your air pollution and water pollution laws, at OSHA safety \n     programs. These and other protections were lobbied for and \n     fought for in Washington, D.C. by unions. That's a fact.\n       ``Federal labor laws are like stop lights and speed \n     limits,'' McKarnin said. ``Somebody has to set the standard. \n     There are people out there who will kill other people. Maybe \n     they have no respect for human life and human rights.''\n       McKarnin, who has assisted in Local 124's organizing \n     efforts at the employer level and also by speaking to \n     prospective union members, was asked if this is because he is \n     an enlightened boss or simply because it is good business.\n       ``It's just something I believe in,'' McKarnin replied. ``I \n     believe very strongly in union representation and that would \n     be my attitude whether or not I owned a company. I buy \n     American-made clothes when I can. Most of my clothes have a \n     union label.\n       ``Unfortunately some union members don't do the same thing, \n     or you wouldn't have the unfair competition from foreign \n     products. A good example is a union member who drives to work \n     in a foreign vehicle. As owner of the company I have \n     discouraged that and still do. It's not good business.''\n       McKarnin said he has been involved with Lindell Lee and \n     Local 124 organizers Chris Heegn and JIm Beem in the effort \n     to organize SKCE.\n       ``One employer asked me why doesn't the owner of SKCE want \n     to go union,'' McKarnin said. ``Simply stated, the reason \n     SKCE employees should vote to go union are all the reasons \n     why the employer does not go union.\n       ``The employer does not want to pay a competitive wage and \n     benefit package,'' McKarnin said. ``And another thing is \n     young people want the cash money in their pocket right away. \n     Retirement is a lifetime away for them. They don't care about \n     costly benefits such as health insurance, life insurance and \n     retirement planning.\n       ``People interested in joining the union have been with the \n     company 10 or 15 years,'' McKarnin continued. ``They've \n     started thinking about the future and realize why they would \n     benefit from joining the union.''\n       McKarnin said that while employees benefit for union \n     membership, so does the company.\n       ``In the case of Pioneer Electric, the company believes we \n     benefit from union representation,'' McKarnin said. ``When we \n     went IBEW, we had 25 employees. As I said, we peaked out last \n     year at 300. So we have seen some benefits from IBEW \n     affiliation in the availability of skilled manpower. We can't \n     survive without the union, and the union can't survive \n     without the company. That's the bottom line.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Wilson Electric,\n\n                                                      Oakland, CA.\n     Hon. Peter Hoekstra,\n     U.S. Congress.\n       To the Honorable Peter Hoekstra:  I am the owner of Wilson \n     Electric Lic. #462959 a minority firm located in Oakland, Ca. \n     I was a non-union firm until Oct of 1994. Until that time I \n     had many projects that I manned through the use of temporary \n     hiring halls, word of mouth and advertisement in local \n     papers. I hired an employee who came to work on a fire \n     station that I was doing for the city of Oakland. I was \n     impressed with his skill and the way that he got right in and \n     helped me to get this job back on track. He then informed me \n     that he was an I.B.E.W. union member, a salt and wanted to \n     organize my shop into the local union. I guess you can \n     imagine my surprise to this revelation. He told me that he \n     wanted all my employees to know that they had the right talk \n     about the union, that they had the right talk about other \n     conditions that might be of concern to them, and that he was \n     still a good employee himself and would still be loyal and \n     productive. Not only did this employee remain a valuable \n     asset to my company through his display of skill and \n     knowledge and leadership, he treated my employees with \n     respect and dignity, something that I had been told that the \n     unions wouldn't do.\n       Through this union salt, the local I.B.E.W. union has shown \n     me that their membership is committed to excellence on the \n     job, continued education to improve their skills, to working \n     with all of their contractors, to protecting the rights of \n     all people working in the construction industry, to try and \n     educate the public about all of the positive things that \n     unions bring to their communities and that they can be loyal \n     to their contractors and their union.\n       I am very pleased to say that I'm a union contractor. I \n     believe that the union salting program is not only a good way \n     to reach out to other working people, but that this right \n     should be protected under the National Labor Relations Act.\n           Respectfully,\n     Robert Wilson.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Coast Electric,\n\n                               Morgan Hill, CA, November 30, 1995.\n     To Whom It May Concern:\n       In mid 1992 My company was ``salted'' by a member of the \n     IBEW, a Mr. Pat Mangano, for the purposes of organizing.

Thank God I am a union \n     Contractor.\n\n  From Central Sierra Electric Co., Inc.:\n\n       Here is my opinion concerning the benefits and drawbacks to \n     being a union shop. As you know, Central Sierra Electric Co, \n     Inc. has been in business for fourteen years and has been \n     signatory with IBEW for the past two years. Listed below are \n     what I consider to be among the Union's strengths. To date we \n     have found no drawbacks.\n       Extremely helpful in getting qualified manpower.\n       Notified us of numerous jobs out to bid.\n       Given our name to developers and manufacturers looking for \n     qualified contractors.\n       Assistance in getting jobs when competing against non-union \n     shops.\n\n  From TL Electric, Inc., 2296 Mora Drive, Mountain View, CA:\n\n       I was formerly a non-union firm who was just recently \n     organized by the use of union salts from a couple of I.B.E.W. \n     locals here in Northern Carolina. After these employees made \n     it known to me that they were affiliated with the union, it \n     became apparent to me that the skill and ability that they \n     had, along with their understanding of their rights as \n     employees could only help me become a better contractor.\n\n  You see the fact is, Mr. President, when unions do use the salting \ntechnique, they send their best people into these companies. Opponents \nclaim that they do not, and that they send people in there who are \ndisruptive and harassing in order to break up the shops. In fact, they \nsend their better people in to be an example in order to convince \npeople to become union members. If they cannot win the respect of their \nco-workers, they will not be able to convince them to join the union.\n  I will go on with some of these others when I conclude this evening.\n  The principle of basic fairness was reaffirmed in the Town & Country \ncase in 1992, decided by a National Labor Relations Board composed of \nmembers appointed by President Reagan and President Bush.\n  In that case, the NLRB emphatically rejected the employer's claim \nthat paid union organizers are not ``employees'' under the labor laws, \nand that they are incapable of possessing the requisite loyalty to the \nemployer. Instead, the Board ruled, ``the statute is founded on the \nbelief that an employee may legitimately give allegiance to both a \nunion and an employer. To the extent that may appear to give rise to a \nconflict, it is a conflict that was resolved by Congress long since in \nfavor of the right of employees to organize.''\n  The Supreme Court unanimously affirmed the NLRB's decision. The Court \ndescribed the issue before as follows: ``Can a worker be a company's \n`employee,' within the terms of the National Labor Relations Act . . . \nif, at the same time, a union pays that worker to help organize the \ncompany?''\n  In answer to that question, the Court held: ``We agree with the \nNational Labor Relations Board that the answer is `yes.' ''\n  The Court noted that the law protects employees' right to engage in \nunion activities during nonworking time in nonworking areas. We \nunderstand that, Mr. President. They are only entitled to try to \nencourage people to involve themselves in union activities in \nnonworking time in nonworking areas. Otherwise, they can be \ndisciplined. So we are talking about nonworking time in nonworking \nareas. That is key, Mr. President.\n  The decision explained that ``this is true even if a company \nperceives these protected activities as disloyal. After all, the \nemployer has no legal right to require that, as a part of his or her \nservice to the company, a worker refrain from engaging in protected \nactivity.''\n  Mr. President, the bill before the Senate destroys this protection. \nIt lets employers force workers to renounce their right to engage in \nlegitimate, lawful activities. Businesses can discharge employees who \nattempt to organize their coworkers to join a union, or protest \ndangerous working conditions, unfair pay practices, or race or sex \ndiscrimination.\n  This legislation takes a giant step backward. It legitimizes conduct \nthat our society has long condemned. It is hard to believe the \nRepublican leadership is giving this misguided, antiworker bill such \nhigh priority as we near the end of this Congress.\n  Many of us have been trying to get consideration of the Patient's \nBill of Rights so we can debate that issue before we recess. And, no, \nthe Republican leadership says, no to patient protections that are of \ncentral concern to more than 160 million Americans who are in various \nhealth maintenance organizations and managed care plans. But what do we \nhave on the floor of the U.S. Senate? The salting legislation. We could \nask how many Members of this body on either side have read through this \nlegislation and understood it. It was scheduled at the close of \nbusiness last Thursday for a cloture vote this evening.\n\n  We could have debated patients' protection Friday, or if necessary, \nSaturday, or all day today. I bet you would have two-thirds of the \nMembers of the U.S. Senate here instead of two Members. If we were \ndealing with the people's business, two-thirds of the Members would be \nhere because they know the concern that families have about the abuses \nthat are taking place. In too many instances in our Nation, it is \ninsurance company accountants and agents making decisions on health \ncare that ought to be made by doctors. Why aren't we debating that \ninstead of an antiworker piece of legislation?\n  The silence from the Republican leadership is amazing. ``Oh, no,'' \nthey say, ``you can only have three amendments. You either have to have \nyour bill or our bill or two other possible amendments because we don't \nwant to take up the time.'' Here it is, two Members of the Senate are \non the floor, and we are moving off this bill to consider the Interior \nAppropriations bill later in the afternoon, and they will be hard-\npressed to get another couple of Senators on various amendments on \nthat.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. How much time does my side have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has 11 minutes 56 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, after listening to Senator Kennedy, I \nfeel I should start by checking to see if I have horns that ought to be \nremoved. I wasn't sure, frankly, whether we were debating minimum wage, \nfamily and medical leave, Davis-Bacon, comp time, OSHA, campaign \nfinance team or summer jobs program.\n  I know that while there is concern about the amount of time we are \nspending on what Senator Kennedy feels is an inappropriate bill, the \ntotal amount of time designated and agreed upon is 2\\1/2\\ hours equally \ndivided on this cloture motion. I think to the thousands of small \nbusinesses across this country, their owners and their families, this \nis certainly worth 2\\1/2\\ hours on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I know \nthat many businesses in the State of Massachusetts are certainly worth \nthe time we are devoting to the subject today.\n  While Senator Kennedy may be concerned that people have not read the \nbill, it is 3\\1/2\\ pages long. I suspect that any Senator, between now \nand this evening, will have time not only to study it and to study its \nimpact, but also perhaps to read some of the hundreds and hundreds of \nletters that every Senator in this body has received on this subject.\n  For the sake of those who may not have time to read what I think is \nvery important in this bill, I want to read it for the sake of my \ncolleagues and the\n\n[[Page S10281]]\n\nsake of the manager of the other side, because while part of the bill \nwas quoted, a big part of the bill was not cited. It is this:\n\n       Provided, That this sentence shall not affect the rights \n     and responsibilities under this Act of any employee who is or \n     was a bona fide employee applicant, including the right to \n     self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor \n     organizations, to bargain collectively through \n     representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other \n     concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining \n     or other mutual aid or protections.\n\n  That is language directly from the National Labor Relations Act. We \nsay there is nothing in this bill that can possibly infringe upon the \nright of a worker to do what they have always done. Salting has not \nbeen an accepted practice. Disrupting the workplace, causing economic \ndamage, seeking to destroy one's employer, has never been an accepted \norganizing strategy in this country, nor should it be. That is all this \nlegislation would restrict.\n  I suggest that when we talk about families, that we realize that \nsmall business men and women in this country have families, too. That \nthey are workers, too. To invest a lifetime building a small business, \nbuilding jobs and an economic future for their employees, to have that \ndestroyed by this insidious practice is indefensible. I am amazed that \nanybody would stand and defend the practice of salting.\n  Now, we heard a couple of examples, I think, that mischaracterize \nwhat salting is. They say it is organizing. There is nothing in this \nbill that would prevent organizing. In fact, it specifically says that. \nSo, please, let's not have red herrings thrown in. A small contractor \nin the Boston, MA, area has experienced numerous cases of union salts \ncoming into the company under the presumption that at the open-shop \ncompany they would have low wages and no benefits. That is what they \nwere told.\n  Every union salt came to realize that not only had the working \nconditions at the open shop been mischaracterized, but they were \nsubjecting the company to an immoral and unscrupulous practice designed \nto harm the company. These employees and their families were later \nthreatened by union members. Some compelling letters were received from \nemployees to their union representatives saying they will quit the \nunion and expressing disgust with the unscrupulous tactics they were \nput up to.\n  Let me read from one, and I will not use the names because I think \nthat would be unfair. This letter is very moving. She mentioned the \nname of the company:\n\n       . . . doesn't deserve the disgrace and shame local 12 wants \n     me to bring upon them. Every one at [the company] has worked \n     too hard to have this done by me. I can't do it. I have been \n     raised different. How can I raise my kids by setting an \n     example like this.\n       I have decided to sever my time with local 12 [in Boston, \n     MA.] After 2 years, I'm finally there. If this is how I have \n     to get it, I don't want it.\n\n  And then she mentioned her employer's name.\n\n       Please do not contact me by phone, mail or in person.\n       I would like to remain an employee of [this company] but I \n     understand and deserve termination. . . . Do as you see fit.\n       I would strongly recommend to anyone involved in local 12's \n     program, [that is referring to the salting program] to get \n     out.\n       I don't know how I could face you and do what they want me \n     to do. I'm sorry I've betrayed you. I would like to \n     apologize.\n\n  There are many salts we heard from, former salts who said, ``I got \nout. It was too dirty. It was too much of an unscrupulous business to \nbe part of it. I got out.''\n  That is what we want to ban--not legitimate organizing, but this \ndestructive tactic to go only to destroy the company. In their own \nwords, from the State of Massachusetts, the organizing report of the \nInternational Brotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades, Roslindale, \nMA, this is what they wrote:\n\n       This is the opportunity to strip these nonunion contractors \n     of their most skilled workers and put the nonunion contractor \n     in a situation where they won't be able to fulfill their \n     contract obligations.\n\n  That is not me. It is their own words. Not their best workers, but to \nstrip them of skilled workers.\n  They say:\n\n       We are stripping quality workers from these shops, \n     weakening their ability to man their jobs. Our intent with \n     this company and companies like them is to put them out of \n     business or have them sign on the bottom line and become a \n     union shop. Our efforts at this major nonunion shop have \n     resulted in a victory from the council. We stripped away the \n     best of their workers so far. They stopped advertising for \n     help, and in fact, they put a freeze on all hiring. This has \n     impeded [the Company's] day-to-day running daily. They need \n     workers at this busy time of year, but they cannot hire. The \n     word from our sources in the company is they will use a temp \n     agency to hire workers. This will result in their having \n     difficulty getting quality, long-term workers and will drag \n     down their standard of worker. We know [the Company] has \n     already been kicked off from one job for not getting it done \n     on time. The less work this painting contractor does, the \n     more there is for our signatory contractors to take on, and \n     the stronger we get.\n\n  That is in their own words.\n  You can either accept salting is legitimate, salting is just an \norganizing tactic, or you could listen to their own manual and to their \nown reports that their goal is to destroy small businesses. And that's \nwrong.\n  It isn't impinging upon the rights of workers to organize, to \ncollectively bargain. It is saying there is a right way to do it and \nthere is a wrong way. This was never envisioned when the National Labor \nRelations Act was passed and it should be prohibited.\n  In 1996, there were over 17,000 complaints to the NLRB. This isn't a \nrare, isolated thing. There are thousands of frivolous complaints. The \ncost when they are investigating, $17,500 of taxpayers' money just to \ninvestigate these frivolous charges. That is what we are dealing with.\n  May I inquire as to how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 7 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator \nHutchinson's bill, the Truth in Employment Act. This legislation is \nneeded to address the problem of salting abuse, which places unfair \neconomic pressure on non-union employers and ultimately costs American \ntaxpayers millions of dollars each year.\n  In a typical salting case, union operatives gain access to a non-\nunion workplace by obtaining employment with the company. Rather than \nfurther the interests of the company or even organize employees, their \ntrue objective is to disrupt business operations and increase costs for \nthe non-union employer. This, of course, is achieved in a number of \nways, including the filing of discrimination complaints with the \nNational Labor Relations Board or other regulatory agencies.\n  Mr. President, an overwhelming majority of these cases are dismissed \nby the National Labor Relations Board as frivolous and without merit. \nUnfortunately, employers must shoulder the enormous costs of legal \nexpenses, delays, and lost productivity, regardless of their innocence. \nOne such frivolous case involves Burns Electrical Contractors in \nCharlotte, North Carolina. In 1996, a union salt gained employment with \nBurns Electric after lying on his application about his qualifications \nand his past employment. In actuality, he was on a union payroll for \n$65,000. Within the first week, he began disrupting business, and, \nafter abandoning his job, he was permanently replaced. Of course, \ndiscrimination charges were soon filed with the National Labor \nRelations Board.\n  More than two years later, the case was still not heard by the \nNational Labor Relations Board. Burns Electric was forced to lay off \nworkers and lost several bids on new construction projects. It incurred \nan estimated $250,000 in business losses and $10,000 in legal fees. \nEventually, Burns Electric yielded to its attorney's advice and settled \nthe case (it is often far less expensive for small businesses to settle \nthan it is for them to contest the charges). Thus, the union salt was \nsuccessful in disrupting operations and weakening the market share of \nthis company, simply because its employees would not join a union.\n  Unfortunately, there is no disincentive for filing such a frivolous \ncomplaint. The federal government funds the investigation and \nprosecution of charges. This, of course, results in a considerable tab \nfor the American taxpayer. I am informed that 8,449 cases were \ndismissed and 8,595 cases were withdrawn during FY 1996, costing \ntaxpayers $780 apiece. In the same year,\n\n[[Page S10282]]\n\n2,509 unfair labor practice charges were actually investigated and \nprosecuted in front of an Administrative Law Judge. The average cost \nfor these cases is $17,500. Finally, 174 charges were appealed to the \nCircuit Court of Appeals in FY 1996, at a cost of $42,700 each.\n  As you can see, the Federal government spends millions to process, \ninvestigate, and prosecute these complaints. And because most of these \ncharges are frivolous, taxpayers are actually funding the extortion of \nemployers and the manipulation of government institutions. I believe it \nis wrong to use tax dollars to support this fraudulent and wasteful \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, the solution to this problem is simple. An employer \nshould not be required to hire any individual whose overriding purpose \nis to disrupt the workplace or inflict economic harm on the business. \nBy making this clear, the Truth in Employment Act will bring fairness \nto our labor laws and will go a long way toward eliminating waste and \nfraud in government. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this \ncommonsense legislation and vote in favor of cloture.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think we have 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes 37 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I am sorry I could not have been here earlier to speak \nagainst this onerous piece of legislation. The so-called ``truth'' in \nemployment act? It ought to be called the ``fear'' in employment act. \nOf all the requirements that a person has to go through to get \nemployment, the last thing you ought to worry about is your personal \nbeliefs or what you think.\n  How is an employer going to find this out? Are we now going to start \nadministering ``truth tests'' to people who seek employment? Are we \ngoing to give them an injection of sodium pentothal so they have to \ntell the truth? Are we going to put them under hypnosis to open their \nminds?\n  This is probably one of the most far-reaching, invasive pieces of \nlegislation that goes at the very heart of the Bill of Rights. The \nfreedom of thought--to make sure that people can't force you, either in \na court or anywhere else, to testify against your will, testify against \nyourself, or to force you to tell what you think is fundamental to our \nliberty. Yet, this bill amends this principle. This legislation would \nimplement a unprecedented chilling effect on employment practices in \nthis country.\n  I was listening to the Senator, my friend from Arkansas, talk about \nthis. Employers already have the ability to fire workers who neglect \ntheir job duties. In fact, under the Hess Mechanical case, they will \nget attorney's fees for anybody who neglects their job duties and are \ndismissed, if they file a countersuit in court, for example.\n  So the more I look at this bill, I have to admit that this is really \nwhat I would call--and I listened to the Senator from Massachusetts \nearlier, listing all of the assaults that have been made on workers' \nrights since the Republicans have taken charge around here. This bill \nis just another bill on the Republican donors' wish list. That is all \nthis is; it is nothing more than that.\n  But beyond that, it is a terribly invasive piece of legislation. \nEmployers already have more power to tip the scales. If we really want \nto level the scales between employers and employees, we ought to do \naway with the Striker Replacement Act. We ought to make it so they \ncan't replace striking workers. That would even and balance the scales. \nBut this piece of legislation here, which says an employer can delve \ninto the thoughts of a person--my gosh, how far are we going to go in \nthis country?\n  Lastly, when it uses the words ``for the purpose of furthering \nanother employment or agency status,'' what does that mean? Does that \ninclude, for example, women who come to work and organize to start a \nday care center? How about racial minorities who may want to organize \nor petition for a day off to observe Martin Luther King's birthday? \nThat presumably would be covered under agency status. There is no \ndefinition of ``agency status.'' I understand what employment status \nis, but agency status is a broad net that would capture everything--\npotentially usurping our fundamental freedoms to organize and \nparticipate in important causes.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has laid out quite eloquently the \nreasons why this legislation ought to be stopped in its tracks and why \nwe ought to stick up for not just the working people in this country, \nbut for the Bill of Rights and the right of people to think freely and \nto act freely in accordance with the law.\n  There was a Supreme Court case 2 years ago, the Town and Country \ncase, with a unanimous opinion of the Supreme Court ruled that an \nemployees affiliation with a labor union or other group cannot affect \ntheir employment eligibility. That is what they are trying to overturn \nhere, the Town and Country case. It says that it doesn't make any \ndifference what you think, as long as you are doing your job. If you \nwant to do something outside of the job that is lawful and legal, \nemployers cannot require you to disavow yourself of your right to \nparticipate in that activity, whether it be organizing a union or \npetitioning for workplace child-care centers. I think that is an \nexcellent decision, a unanimous decision. We don't get that many \nanymore. Yet, this legislation seeks to overturn that Supreme Court \ndecision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 4 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask for 30 more seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 30 more seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is a bad piece of legislation, and not just for \nworking people, but for every American, for the Bill of Rights, and for \nour constitutional rights to be free to think and have our own \nconsciences, this bill ought to be stopped in its tracks.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, sometimes when I hear debate on the \nfloor of the Senate, I wonder what bill we are debating or whether the \nbill being spoken of is actually reflected in the specific provisions.\n  I remind my colleagues once again that this bill does not overturn \nthe Supreme Court decision, the unanimous Supreme Court decision. It \ndoes not infringe whatsoever on the rights of employees to organize. It \nspecifically states in a provision added on page 4, the last part of \nthe last statement in the bill, that nothing in this shall infringe \nupon or affect the rights and responsibilities of the employee. It \ncomes straight from the Labor Relations Act that says nothing in this \ncan infringe upon that. It says that an employer doesn't have to hire \nsomeone whose--it doesn't infringe if they want to organize, for \nwhatever reason, whatever the cost, or whatever thought. It says that \nif your primary goal in taking that job is not to fulfill the \nresponsibilities of the job but is to further the goals of another \norganization or another agency, that employer is not bound to hire you. \nAnd, yes, they can file a discrimination suit. But now the burden would \nbe upon the NLRB lawyers to demonstrate that, in fact, this person was \na bona fide employee applicant.\n  So the employees' rights are absolutely and totally protected under \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Gorton of \nWashington and Senator Kyl be added as cosponsors to this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Once again, we get this impression that has been \npresented this morning that somehow these are legitimate organizing \nefforts. Yet, I have read quotation after quotation from the IBEW and \nother unions' own organizing manuals that make it very clear that the \ngoal is, in fact, to economically destroy the company and the employer.\n  So I will throw one more in. This is the IBEW Organizing News Letter, \nvolume No. 1, March 1995, on page 4:\n\n       These companies know that when they are targeted with \n     stripping, salting, and market recovery funds, it is only a \n     matter of time before their foundations begin to crumble. The \n     NLRB charges the attorney fees, and the loss of employees can \n     lead to an unprofitable business.\n\n  That is what they want. If they can't organize, they destroy them \neconomically. But it not only destroys them\n\n[[Page S10283]]\n\neconomically, it costs the taxpayers, because we are paying the NLRB \nattorneys, and it ruins the reputation of good, hard-working Americans \nwho have invested their lives in building businesses. I can't think of \nanything more tragic than to spend your life building a business--\nspending 30 years out there starting as a mom-and-pop operation and \ngradually adding employees, providing a good place of employment for \nworkers--and then, through this pernicious tactic, see your business \ndestroyed and have to close your doors, to see those jobs lost, and to \nsay that somehow this is antiworker.\n  I will tell you what is antiworker. It is those who would use that \nkind of an unconscionable tactic to destroy the economic viability of a \nbusiness. Yes, it ought to be legal to organize; that is something that \nought to be protected by law; it is a precious right of workers in this \ncountry. But it is not a right to go in and destroy the economic \nviability of a company or business of a small business owner. That is \nwrong. I find it amazing that anybody could come down and defend that \nkind of tactic. All in the world this legislation would do is stop \nthose kinds of tactics.\n  Mr. President, when a union salt goes home to his family, his wife, \nhis son, his daughter, and his wife says to him at the end of that day, \n``Honey, how was your day?'' or that child says, ``Daddy, how was your \nday?'' can he look his wife or child in the eye and say, ``Oh, I had a \ngreat day. I participated in the destruction of a hard-working \nAmerican's life dream and his livelihood''?\n  I hope my colleagues will support this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Kennedy's time is 2 minutes 32 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask for 1 minute.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have been listening to my friend from \nArkansas. I read the language of his bill. The words are, ``for the \npurpose of furthering another employment or agency status.'' It doesn't \nsay for the purpose of destroying the company. Yet that is what he is \ntalking about.\n\n  What is wrong with the purpose, for example, of helping to form a \nunion? There is nothing wrong with that. There is nothing wrong for \nwomen, for example, wanting to organize to have a day care center, or \nminorities wanting to organize to have a day off. That is an agency. \nThe words don't say for the purpose of destroying a company. That is \nthe Senator's own thought process. Furthermore, the Senator from \nArkansas's argument is faulty in that he claims this ``salting'' \nactivity is carried out to specifically cripple economic viability of a \nbusiness. However, I ask, what person would destroy the very business, \nthe very thing, their job and living is dependent upon? So it seems the \nSenator's argument is counter productive.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. On whose time?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. My time is up. My time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is controlled by the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I wish we had more time. We will debate this later.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 more \nminutes, and yield time to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts. I thank my friend from Iowa for yielding for the \nquestion.\n  If you will look at the language in the bill, clearly the primary \npurpose is to go in to further the goals of an organization or agency. \nIf we go to apply for a job--I ask for the Senator's opinion of this--\nit is my understanding that if you apply for the job, the primary \npurpose would be to fulfill the job, and it is not the primary purpose \nto fulfill the goals of the organization. That is why the employer \nwould not be required to hire the employee under that. He would not fit \nthe definition of a bona fide employee.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator. I don't know what the definition of \nbona fide employee is.\n  I am reading section 4 of the bill. It says:\n\n       Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as requiring \n     an employer to employ any person who is not a bona fide \n     employee applicant, in that such person seeks or has sought \n     employment with the employer with the primary purpose of \n     furthering another employment or agency status.\n\n  It doesn't say for the primary purpose of destroying the company. \nThat is not it at all.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. If I could ask one more question, would the Senator \nconsider hiring someone in his office whose primary purpose was not to \nwork for him, but whose primary purpose was to undermine everything he \nis trying to achieve in the U.S. Senate?\n  Mr. HARKIN. No. Obviously, if someone came in with the purpose of \nworking for me and doing a good job for constituents that I represent \nin the State of Iowa and is willing to do the job, is dedicated to that \njob but also wanted, for example, to organize an employee's group for \nday care, or for minorities rights, or whatever, absolutely I would \nhire that person. I would do it in a minute. But that example begs the \nquestion, how can employer determine a prospective employee's thoughts, \nintent, or motives? Subsequently, arbitrarily deny employment to \nsomeone because they suspect they had ulterior motives. This is bad \nlegislation that deserves to be defeated. We should be concerned with \nensuring fairness and equity for the workers rather than further \ntilting the scales in favor of unscrupulous employers.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. First of all, I will include in the Record the scores of \nletters from small businessmen and women across the country that reject \nthe Senator's proposition and hope that this legislation will not be \nincluded.\n  Second, Mr. President, any of the circumstances that the Senator has \noutlined here can be prosecuted under law at the present time.\n  The idea of conjuring up all of these horror stories and then saying \nthat is what happens in the workplace as a matter of course is \nfundamentally wrong. That is not the case. If you have disruptions, \nthere are perfectly adequate ways of addressing them.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the Supreme Court has upheld the concept that \none can be interested in a good job with good working conditions, \nbelieve in a union, and also be interested in furthering the interests \nof the company. That is what this proposal would overturn.\n  Mr. President, I think all of our time has been used up.\n  I yield 36 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I just say that I thank my colleague. \nMy understanding is that there might be a little time. My plane was \ndelayed. I will wait. I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. GORTON. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/14/senate-section/article/S10270-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10283-S10304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  1998\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 1 p.m. \nhaving arrived, the Senate will now resume consideration of S. 2237, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2237) making appropriations for the Department \n     of the Interior and related agencies for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 1999, and for other purposes.\n\n\n[[Page S10284]]\n\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we began debate on this Interior \nappropriations bill last Tuesday. The Senator from West Virginia, Mr. \nByrd, and I each made our opening statements and a handful of agreed-\nupon amendments were added to the bill at that point.\n  Then we spent much of the rest of the week on an amendment relating \nto campaign finance laws and other subjects not related to the Interior \nappropriations bill. So no progress was made on this bill.\n  Today, a number of Members on the other side of the aisle wish to \noffer an amendment related to agricultural policy. Of course, under the \nrules of the Senate, they have every right to do so. It is certainly \nappropriate to recognize them in the absence of a contested amendment \ndealing with the Interior appropriations bill.\n  The majority leader wants all Members to know that there will be time \nfor discussion of that amendment during the course of the afternoon on \nboth sides, including the distinguished chairman of the Committee on \nAgriculture. But when that debate seems to be over, or at 5 o'clock, \nwhichever comes first, the Senator from Indiana, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, will move to table the amendment and will ask \nfor the yeas and nays, and there will be a vote on tabling the \namendment immediately after the vote that is already scheduled for 5:30 \nthis afternoon.\n  With that notification, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me inquire of the Senator from Iowa--\ndoes the Senator from Iowa have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator is going to offer an amendment on our behalf \nand on behalf of the Senate minority leader. My expectation is Senator \nGorton would like to provide an opportunity for the minority leader to \nspeak before the vote. I don't know if he made a unanimous consent \nrequest. I hope, in any event, if there is a discussion of time with \nrespect to the tabling of this amendment, that there is an \nunderstanding the minority leader will be given time to speak prior to \nthe tabling motion.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield without losing my right to the floor. I obviously \nyield to the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. At 5 o'clock, under the previous order, we are to go back \nto another bill, on which we will vote on cloture on the motion to \nproceed at 5:30. It is the present intention of the majority leader to \nhave a vote on tabling this amendment immediately after that 5:30 vote. \nI am sure that the majority leader will want to give the minority \nleader an opportunity to speak to the issue, however, beforehand. That \nis something they can negotiate with one another, but I see no problem \nin letting the minority leader speak.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, may I ask my colleague one question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield to my friend from Minnesota without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Absolutely. I thank the Chair. I guess it is an \nindirect question for other colleagues as well. I put it in the form of \na question to my colleague from Iowa.\n  While I understand the need for some sort of time agreement, does not \nthe Senator from Iowa agree with me that we have an economic convulsion \nin agriculture right now and this is an issue of central importance to \nmany Senators from the Midwest? I ask my colleague from Iowa if he \nthinks, in all due respect to the majority leader, that we are \nmarginalizing or trivializing this issue by saying that it is going to \nbe tabled at 5 o'clock? Some Senators may not even be back here--not \njust Senator Daschle from South Dakota--without the opportunity to \nspeak about this issue.\n  Does my colleague think maybe it is a mistake not to allow other \nSenators to speak on this? This is not a small issue--am I correct?--in \nour States. Doesn't this issue deserve the full attention of the Senate \nor full opportunity for a full debate? And does my colleague not have \nsome concern that by having a tabling motion sometime around 5, that a \ngood many Senators are not going to be able to speak on this question, \nthis urgent question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I respond to the Senator from Minnesota to say I agree \nwith him absolutely, there is a convulsion going on in agriculture \ntoday. We are spiraling into a deepening crisis in agriculture all over \nAmerica, especially in the Midwest. Yes, this issue is of vital \nimportance to farm families and people in rural areas all over America. \nI do believe we have to take some time to lay out the case and to lay \nout the facts of what is happening in agriculture today.\n  My colleague from Minnesota, I know, will do that today. My colleague \nfrom North Dakota, and others, I am sure, will want to come on the \nfloor. The Senator from Minnesota is right, it is a Monday. People were \ntold there would be a first vote today at 5:30. So I assume a lot of \nSenators are now returning to Washington, such as the case with the \nminority leader, Senator Daschle.\n  I hope, since we are taking some time this afternoon--let's be honest \nabout it, there is not much happening on the floor of the Senate today. \nI don't see anybody lined up with amendments. So we are taking this \ntime to talk about and discuss the parameters of the problem in \nagriculture and to lay down our amendment, of course. But I hope that \nwe will at least have some time beyond 5 or 5:30 this evening, maybe \neven tomorrow, to have some further discussion on the crisis in \nagriculture.\n  The Senator from Minnesota I think is absolutely right. I am sure \nthere are a lot of Senators who would like to say something about this \nand to maybe add their thoughts, their views, their perceptions, their \nsupport. Or perhaps there are those who don't want to support doing \nanything at all but to just let it go, and they have a right to speak \nhere, too, and they should be heard also.\n  I am hopeful that, as the Senator from Minnesota has pointed out, the \nfloor manager of the bill and the majority leader of the Senate will at \nleast afford us some valuable opportunity for other Senators to come in \nand speak on this bill after their return to the Senate Chamber.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. May I ask my colleague one more question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. And I will let my colleague go on with his \npresentation. I know there are a number of Senators who want to speak, \nmyself included.\n  I ask the Senator from Iowa this question, again, making the appeal \nto the majority leader: Doesn't this also go to the heart of \naccountability? Isn't it true people in Iowa, Minnesota, the Dakotas, \nthroughout the Midwest, and, for that matter, throughout the country as \nwell--let me focus on our States--as my colleague from Iowa thinks \nabout it, don't people back in our States have the right to know where \nwe stand? Don't they have a right to know whether or not their Senators \nhave been out here on the floor making proposals--positive proposals--\nabout what could be done that speaks to their economic pain one way or \nthe other? Doesn't this whole issue before us speak to the issue of \naccountability?\n  If we have a tabling motion at 5 or 5:30, albeit the minority leader \nabsolutely has to speak, doesn't this take away from the very idea of \naccountability, where people will wonder, where were our Senators, why \ndidn't they speak up for us, or why didn't they have other alternatives \nif they didn't like this amendment? Don't we really undercut the very \nnotion of accountability and what we are about by rushing to a tabling \nmotion on such an urgent matter, such a central issue, something that \nis so important to people in our States?\n  I feel some indignation about this. This is not the way to proceed. \nFor me, this is the issue. What is happening in Minnesota in \nagriculture is the issue. I just don't see a couple of hours, table, \ngoodbye, that's it, one way or the other.\n\n[[Page S10285]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree with the Senator, this is a matter of \naccountability. Senators should have the right to speak, but they \nshould also have the right to cast their vote one way or the other, up \nor down, on the amendment.\n  So I am hopeful that there would not be a tabling motion, that in \nfact we would be able to vote up or down on the package of amendments \nthat I will soon be offering on behalf of Senator Daschle and the \nSenator from Minnesota, the Senator from North Dakota, and several \nothers. But they should have the right to vote on that up or down. I \nthink our constituents, as the Senator pointed out, they have the \nright. We have the obligation. They have the right to demand that we \nvote up or down on whether we are going to take some meaningful steps \nto alleviate the situation in agriculture.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3580\n\n  (Purpose: To provide emergency assistance to agricultural producers)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will soon be sending an amendment \nforward, but I thought I would speak on it before I do. Then I will \nyield to my colleague from North Dakota, who I know wants to speak, and \nmy colleague from Minnesota. But I would like to take just a few \nminutes again to talk about the grave economic situation in rural \nAmerica.\n  I just remind my colleagues in the Senate, that the Senate voted \nunanimously in July on my resolution describing the terrible conditions \nin agriculture and calling for immediate action by Congress and the \nadministration. That passed the Senate unanimously. Unfortunately, a \nlittle bit later, when the Senate had a chance to pass a measure to \nprovide some assistance, we did not manage to assemble the necessary \nvotes. That was in late July before we left for the August recess. I \nam, however, encouraged by some information I have become aware of that \nattitudes toward what we proposed in July may have changed. So I am \nhopeful that today we will be able to pass this critically important \nlegislation to provide emergency farm income assistance to farm \nfamilies. I see no reason why we cannot pass it in the bipartisan \ntradition that has customarily been the hallmark of agricultural \nlegislation.\n  If there was any doubt about the seriousness of the situation and the \nneed for taking action in July, there can be no doubt today that the \nsituation has worsened and that the urgency of the need for a response \nhas increased.\n  Mr. President, I used these charts last week. Unfortunately, they are \nstill valid this week. But I just want to point out that since we first \ndebated this in July, on July 17, when there seemed to be some sense on \nthe Senate floor that we were not really in a crisis situation in \nagriculture, that since July 17, we have had a 21-percent decline in \nthe corn price--we used central Illinois as an indicator--and the \nprices keep on dropping.\n  As a matter of fact, I point out that just late last week the \nDepartment of Agriculture revised their crop estimates for corn, and we \nare going to have even more corn than we thought we were going to have. \nSo we see that about every time a new estimate comes out, we get closer \nand closer to 10 billion bushels of corn; and that drives the market \nprice down. The same thing happened with the soybean price. We had an \nequivalent 21-percent decline in the prices. Again, they are still down \nthere.\n  Since July 16, when we passed here the version of our agricultural \nappropriations bill: Dodge City, KS, wheat down 20 percent; north \ncentral Iowa corn down 26 percent; southern Iowa/Minnesota market hogs \ndown 11.6 percent. In fact, in hogs we are looking at the lowest prices \nfor hogs since 1974--almost 25 years. Billings, MT, feed barley down 20 \npercent. Kansas City hard red winter wheat down 13 percent. As I \nunderstand it, it is still going down.\n  We can see what has happened since we passed the farm bill. You see \nwhat happened. We had a couple years here of increasing prices, exports \nwere going out, customers overseas, the Asian economy was booming. So \nwe passed the 1996 so-called Freedom to Farm bill, but then everything \njust started going to pot.\n  Look at what our prices have done since then. We are on a constant \ndecline and a sharp decline in commodity prices since that period of \ntime, all in corn and in soybeans and in wheat. All three of them, ever \nsince the 1996 farm bill, keeps coming down. That little red line \nindicates just what happened in the last several weeks.\n  So if there ever was any doubt in anyone's mind of the crisis in \nJuly, there can be no doubt any longer. And prices, unfortunately, are \ncertain to fall even more at harvest. We are facing the reality of a \nvery serious economic hardship, all around the Nation.\n  And let me just underscore this: This is not the fault of farmers. We \nhave a world situation where large supplies of commodities have \ncombined with weakened demand to drive these commodity prices lower. In \njust the past 2 years, the farm-level prices for corn, wheat and \nsoybeans have declined an average of over 50 percent in 2 years; and \ncattle prices, 20 percent below their level earlier in the decade. As I \nsaid, hog prices are at their lowest level since 1974.\n  On top of that, many regions--North Dakota, parts of Minnesota, \nOklahoma, Texas, Louisiana--several regions, we have had bad weather \nand/or crop disease that have devastated farmers. Thirty-two of 50 \nStates suffered declines in personal farm income between 1996 and now.\n\n  USDA price estimates are that the lower corn and soybean prices will \ncause a loss in farm income of $1.4 billion in Iowa alone this year. \nSuch a loss would threaten up to 26,000 jobs in my State. Nationally, \nUSDA now predicts a precipitous drop in farm income of $11 billion this \nyear. That loss of farm income could result in a loss of over 207,000 \njobs. Farm debt is at the highest level since the mid-1980s in the \ndepths of the farm crisis at that time.\n  So, Mr. President, use whatever yardstick of measurement you want. By \nany measurement, we are spiraling into a deepening crisis in \nagriculture that must be stopped--and stopped now--before it gets any \nworse.\n  So today what we are proposing is a package that has four main \nelements. No. 1, we propose to remove the caps on loan rates that were \nput into effect in the 1996 farm bill and to allow the Secretary of \nAgriculture to extend the loans from 9 months to 15 months.\n  The way that loan rate would work is that you would take the average \nprice over the last 5 years, drop out the high and the low, take the \naverage, and 85 percent of that would be the loan rate.\n  No. 2, we propose to ensure that enough money is available for \nindemnity compensation to farmers who have suffered losses from weather \nand disease.\n  No. 3, we propose to provide the Secretary of Agriculture the \nauthority to make storage payments on wheat and feed grains in order to \nencourage producers to place surplus commodities under loan when the \nSecretary determines that such action is appropriate to respond to \nproblems in the transportation and marketing systems caused by large \nsupplies.\n  No. 4, we are reiterating our commitment to livestock price reporting \nand to the labeling of imported beef and lamb. Parts of this were \npassed before, but we do not know if that bill is ever going to see the \nlight of day. So we are offering it again on the Interior \nappropriations. For example, on the livestock reporting and the \nlabeling of imported beef and lamb, those two were passed before. \nIndemnity compensation was passed before, but at much too low a level. \nWe now know that the losses are much higher than what we anticipated in \nJuly.\n  We believe we have crafted a responsible and modest package to \nrespond to the deepening crisis in rural America. We are not proposing \nany radical change to the 1996 farm bill. We are not changing any \nfundamental principles of the 1996 farm bill, which was to give farmers \nnew planning flexibility and freedom. We are not touching that aspect \nof the 1996 bill.\n  We are simply modifying something that is already in the bill. Loan \nrates are part of the 1996 legislation. It is just at that time the \nwisdom of the Congress--I voted oppositely--was to put caps on the loan \nrates and to freeze them at the 1996 level. All we would simply do is \nmodify that and lift the caps for the loan rates--use the existing law \nbut just take the caps off, but use the existing law--which would allow \nthe Secretary to extend the loan periods and to make storage payments.\n\n[[Page S10286]]\n\n Again, we are not introducing new features. We are simply taking the \ncaps off these loan rates.\n\n  Our amendment focuses on the level of the loan that these farmers can \ntake out on commodities after harvest, using their crops as collateral. \nThe loan allows the farmer to pay bills, retain the crop while waiting \nfor improved marketing opportunities.\n  We always heard about Freedom to Farm that allows families the \nflexibility to plant, but what the farmer this year doesn't have is the \nflexibility to market. Because of the need to pay bills, the farmer \nmost often this fall will have to dump the grain on the market at the \nlowest possible price.\n  What extending the loan rates and raising the caps means--the farmer \ncan take that loan out, and if the Secretary determines that they \nshould make storage payments, they get storage payments also and the \nfarmer can take the grant--the loan rate that he has--pay the bills, \nand then he can market his grain, market his grain when he feels is the \nright time, not just when he is forced to dump it on the market this \nfall.\n  We all hope, of course, that next year grain prices might recover, \nthe Asian economy might get better, and prices might come up. If so, I \nwant the farmer to reap the benefits of that, and not just the large \ngrain companies.\n  The formula, as I said, has been around for a long time. I mentioned \nthe formula; I don't need to go through that again. I will give a \ncouple of examples. The 1996 farm bill set as a cap on the loan rate \n$1.89 a bushel; if the cap were removed, the loan rate would be about \n$2.17 for the 1998 corn crop--modest, very modest, but it would really \nhelp. In the case of wheat, the loan rate capped at $2.58 a bushel; \nremoving the cap put it at $3.16 a bushel--still much too low for a \nreal market price for wheat but, again, a modest increase that would \nhelp our wheat farmers.\n  In addition, as I said, our amendment would allow the Secretary to \nextend the loan for an additional 6 months--from 9 to 15 months--again, \nto give the farmers some more marketing flexibility.\n  Let me say a word about giving the Secretary the ability to make \nstorage payments. The purpose of the storage payments is to facilitate \norderly marketing, to alleviate burdens on commodity transportation and \nmarketing systems. As we have seen in recent months, large supplies of \ncommodities place a huge stress on the transportation system and on the \nentire commodity marketing and merchandising system. If farmers place \nsome of this surplus grain into storage rather than dumping it into the \nmarket at harvest time, there will be some relief from the pressures on \nthe grain transportation and marketing system.\n  Again, keep in mind that we are making this discretionary with the \nSecretary. He can look at the situation as it develops. If it looks \nlike we will have a lot of grain sitting on the railroad sidings with a \nbackup in cars and we won't be able to get our grain out to market and \nthe prices keep going down, he could then extend some storage payments \nto farmers.\n  Again, we are not changing any of the planting flexibility of the \n1996 bill or anything like that.\n  Now, I will just close on this note and say there seems to be some \nmisconception that our amendment involves ``Government intrusion'' into \nthe business of farmers--that we are going to put the Government back \nin farming. Nothing could be more mistaken. In fact, we are enhancing \nthe ability of farmers to market their commodities when it is most \nadvantageous for them to do so. I know the old refrain about keeping \nthe Government out of agriculture, giving the farmers more freedom. \nThat is what we are doing. We are giving them more freedom in our \namendment, more freedom to be able to market their crops.\n  Again, this is a modest approach, one that shouldn't cause any real \ndiscomfort among those who so strongly adhere to the 1996 farm bill and \nwho believe that we shouldn't make any changes in it. I happen to be \none of those who did not vote for the 1996 farm bill. I thought it was \na good farm bill for when the export demand is high; when there is a \nlot of money overseas, it is fine; but when those markets disappear, as \nthey always do cyclically, the farmer is left holding the bag. There is \nno safety net for farmers.\n  President Clinton said at the time he signed the farm bill that he \nwas doing so but he recognized that the safety net was taken away and \nwe would have to come back and modify it at some future time. Well, now \nis the time to take the loan rate caps off and to send a strong message \nto farmers that we, indeed, recognize the disaster that is taking place \nout there.\n  I spent the weekend in my State of Iowa. I had a meeting with a farm \nadvisory committee. There are some people on the committee who are \nbankers, farmers, commodities dealers, and they stated, to a person, if \nsomething is not done this fall, it will be too late next spring. It \nwill be too late to save a lot of farmers. It will be too late to do \nsomething about the spiraling down and the economic effects that this \nwill have on all of our businesses in rural America come next year if \nwe don't do something right now.\n  I see a lot of my colleagues on the floor who would like to speak, so \nI send my amendment to the desk on behalf of Senator Daschle, myself, \nSenator Johnson, Senator Kerrey, Senator Conrad, Senator Baucus, \nSenator Dorgan, and Senator Wellstone, and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for Mr. Daschle, for \n     himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. \n     Conrad, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Wellstone, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3580.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the comments by \nSenator Harkin from Iowa. I have spoken over the weekend, again, with \nSenator Daschle, on whose behalf we offer this amendment. A group of us \nhave joined together, believing it is urgent that we respond to the \nfarm crisis and that we do so quickly.\n  I want to go through a couple of charts, just briefly, that describe \nwhat this crisis is about. The first chart goes back to April 1996 and \nshows what has happened to farm prices. Wheat prices have fallen from \n$5.75 per bushel down to $2.46. The price of wheat, in this case, \ndropped 57 percent in this nearly 2-year period, since the farm bill.\n  Now, I ask people to think of their own situation. If their income \ndropped 57 percent, what shape would they find themselves? That is what \nhas happened with family farmers. At the same time the price of their \ninputs have grown, and increased dramatically. The price of their grain \nhas collapsed. In my State of North Dakota, in 1 year, net farm income \nfor family farmers dropped 98 percent. Anyone in this country, any \nneighborhood, any community, any business, would be in desperate \ntrouble if they lost 98 percent of their income, and yet that is what \nhas happened to our family farmers.\n  When historians look back at this period, they will say that this is \none of the most significant farm crises that we have faced since the \nGreat Depression. We, in fact, have Depression-era prices for grain in \nrural America right now. We won't have many family farmers left if this \nCongress doesn't extend a hand to help out when family farmers are in \ntrouble.\n  Each month has brought more and more bad news for family farmers. \nWheat prices have fallen an average of a 11-cent-a-month drop during \nthis entire year. That amounts to an almost $40 million income loss \neach month to North Dakota farmers.\n  I want to read a letter from a 15-year-old high school boy who comes \nfrom a family farm. He wrote me a letter that I received in recent \ndays.\n\n       My name is Wyatt Goettle.\n\n  Incidentally, he told us we should go ahead and use his name. Wyatt \nsays:\n\n       I live on a farm by Donnybrook [in North Dakota], and we \n     raise sheep, cattle, and grow crops. I'm 15 years old and I'm \n     a sophomore at Stanley High School.\n       This year we rented out most of our cropland. The prices of \n     crops this year and in\n\n[[Page S10287]]\n\n     past years is ridiculous. What would happen if all the \n     farmers just quit because they couldn't even feed their \n     families? I don't know what is going on, but somebody \n     somewhere is making money and it isn't the farmers that put \n     all the work into it.\n\n  Then he says this:\n\n       You know, my dad can feed 180 people, but he can't feed his \n     own family because of the prices.\n       . . . Our farm is a small family farm and it's hard to keep \n     going . . . It's hard getting back from school and working \n     until 10:30 or 11:00 at night. Then having to get up at 6:15 \n     the next morning just to find out that you can't put gas in \n     the car to go to school because you can't afford it. It all \n     goes back to the beef and grain prices.\n\n  This from a 15-year-old boy, a sophomore attending school in Stanley, \nND.\n  Let me read an additional letter from Brian and Johnet Christianson, \nwho wrote to me recently from Glenburn, ND. She said:\n\n       Our loan officer has told us this will be our last year of \n     farming if we can't make our scheduled payments. We want to \n     farm. I have a good job, and my husband has taken on a full-\n     time job and a part-time job [off the farm] to make ends \n     meet. That is to cover living expenses.\n       . . . The public keeps hearing about the family farmer, but \n     what about the farmer's family? The wife tries to be a \n     decision-maker with her husband to pay a bill or get \n     disconnected; or put food on the table. The wife is there to \n     give a smile and a hug when he comes in from the field. As a \n     new school year is getting underway, it is the farmers' \n     children who continue to suffer the misfortunes of the farm \n     life. Don't get me wrong. We have chosen this life for our \n     family, and we will fight to keep it going.\n\n  She said:\n\n       When mom offers to buy one pair of new school jeans, it is \n     the daughter who says, ``No, mommy, I don't need them because \n     we [can't afford it], right, mommy?'' As I fill out reduced \n     or free school lunch applications, the farm has brought us \n     $72 a month this past year. Yet people think we are rich \n     farmers who can handle a bad year.\n       . . . Brian and I have a very strong marriage and we will \n     get through this year with hope for a better tomorrow. Our \n     children will, too. We will make it--the optimism of the \n     farmer.\n       Please continue to fight for equity in grain prices for the \n     farmer and his family.\n\n  Now, these two letters--one from a husband and wife and one from a \n15-year-old boy--describe this crisis better than I can describe it. \nThe young 15-year-old boy, a sophomore in high school, says:\n\n       My dad can feed 180 people, but can't feed his own family \n     because of farm prices.\n\n  There is something wrong with that. One fellow sent me something that \nI ask unanimous consent to be able to show on the floor of the Senate. \nIt is a handful of grain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might, I will show my colleagues that this is the \nbarley he sent to my office a couple of days ago. Then he sent a \nsimilar bag of kitty litter. This kitty litter is worth 20 cents a \npound, and the barley is worth 2 cents a pound. This farmer said, ``Is \nthere something wrong here? Kitty litter is 20 cents a pound and barley \n2 cents a pound. Am I missing something?''\n  No, he is not missing something. There is something fundamentally \nwrong with grain prices. There is something wrong when we say to the \nworld and to family farmers that what they produce has no value. What \nthey produce has no worth?\n  I have said this before on the floor of the Senate and we have heard \nit in testimony of people. Halfway around the world, old women are \nclimbing trees in Sudan to scour for leaves to eat because they are \nfacing starvation. A million and a half people in Sudan are starving \nhalfway around the world. At the same moment that an old woman is \nclimbing trees to get leaves to eat, a family farmer loads up his truck \nto drive to the elevator with a load of hard red spring wheat. When he \ngets to the elevator, he is told, ``This wheat doesn't have much value; \nit is not worth much.''\n  Is there a disconnection here? I think so. We produce an abundant \nquantity of food that the world needs, but somehow we cannot get to \nhalfway around the world where they need it. Those who need it can't \nget it and those who produce it are told it has no value. If you want \nto talk about a disconnection of things that are really important on \nthis Earth, that is it.\n  Now, we passed a new farm bill a couple years ago. I didn't vote for \nit. I didn't believe the farm bill was the right approach. I still \ndon't. Like so many political promises, that farm bill had big print \nand it had little print. Unfortunately, as is often the case, the big \nprint giveth and the little print taketh away.\n  Now, the big print promised that price supports would be set based on \nmarketplace prices. Loan rates would therefore be 85 percent of the \nOlympic 5-year average of prices on the market. This promised a price \ncushion for family farmers. If market prices fell, there would be a \ncushion set at 85 percent of the Olympic 5-year average price. That was \nthe big print.\n  Now here comes the little print. The little print then said that what \nthe big print said was wrong. The little print said that while loan \nrates were supposed to be based on market prices, the little print put \na cap on it. That is an innocuous little word, that three-letter word--\n``cap.''\n  So the big print says you get 85 percent of the Olympic market \naverage, and we are going to give you that as an opportunity to provide \nsome kind of price support so that if the market collapses, you have \nsomething to support you. But then the little print comes back and \nsays, ``Oh, by the way, we are not going to give you what you were \npromised; we are going to put a cap on it; and therefore your support \nprices are pathetic.'' They never use the word ``pathetic''; they put \nthe cap on it that made it pathetic. Now we find ourselves under \ncircumstances where we must come to the floor and say let's take the \ncap off the loan rate and give farmers what they were promised in the \nfarm bill.\n  All we want to do is delete just a part of the little print. Our \namendment would just delete a part of that little print in the farm \nbill. Why, you would think we were burning 85 barns down with all the \ncommotion about this. We come and say, ``Let's delete the little print \nthat took away from farmers what the big print promised,'' and you \nwould think we were burning barns down.\n  Holy cow, people are jumping up and down and screaming that we are \ngoing to unwind, unravel, and tear apart the farm bill. No; we are just \ngoing to make the farm bill honest. We are trying to make it do for \nfarmers what the farm bill promised it was going to do for farmers. If \nmaking that bill honest is the wrong direction, then I guess I have \nlost part of the compass by which to measure these issues.\n  Well, let me show the second chart. It describes part of the problem \nthat cries out for attention. The red and orange areas are counties in \nour State. This is the State of North Dakota, which is 10 times the \nsize of the State of Massachusetts, just for some land mass \ncomparisons. This whole area of the State has been declared as an \nagricultural disaster. One third of our counties have been declared a \ndisaster every year for the last 5 years. That's right; every single \nyear. Two thirds of our counties have been declared disaster areas in 3 \nof the last 5 years. Why? It is because of a wet cycle that came and \nstayed, and provided the conditions for the worst crop disease in a \ncentury. And, now we have collapsed grain prices on top of it.\n  Now, farmers can't make it when, year after year after year, they \nhave recurring natural disasters. That is exactly what has happened. It \nis precisely why, if we are going to save the family farmers, we must \ntake action now to deal with this issue.\n  One of the problems that came from these wet cycles and all of the \nother natural disasters is a crop disease called fusarium head blight, \nwhich is a fancy way of saying scab. Farmers know what scab means. It \nmeans money is sucked right out of their pockets by decreased grain \nquality and quantity. Brian Steffenson, a cereal scientist from North \nDakota State University, said:\n\n       Make no mistake about it. This is the worst plant disease \n     epidemic that the U.S. has faced with any major crop during \n     this century.\n\n  Our family farmers face collapsed prices, the worst crop disease of \nthe century, disaster declarations year after year in most of the \nState. Yet, North Dakota, which is a rural State, is an important part \nof the bread basket in this country.\n  Let me add one additional chart which shows another part of the \nproblem. As if this situation is not bad\n\n[[Page S10288]]\n\nenough with bad prices, poor crops and crop disease there is another \neconomic dilemma facing our farmers. When the farmer does produce a \nproduct, the farmer faces basic monopoly pricing or monopoly influences \nup the marketing stream.\n  Want to sell some beef? Well, then, show up at the packing plant and \nyou will find that 87 percent of the beef packing is controlled by four \nfirms. Eighty-seven percent of the cattle slaughtered in this country \nis controlled by four firms. How about pork? Sixty percent of pork \nslaughter is controlled by four firms. Fifty-five percent of broiler \nchicken processing is controlled by four firms. Do you have sheep to \nsend to the market? Well, 73 percent of sheep slaughter is controlled \nby four companies.\n  Everywhere a farmer turns, as he sells his commodities up the \nmarketing stream, he finds that it is controlled by monopolistic kinds \nof enterprises.\n  How about transportation? Take it to the railroad, and what do you \nfind there? Competition? No. You find one railroad that says, ``We will \nhaul your wheat, and here is what we charge you. If you don't like it, \ntough luck. Try walking down the highway carrying your wheat to market \nin gunnysacks.''\n\n  In North Dakota, when you want to ship your wheat from Bismark to \nMinneapolis, MN, the railroad charges a farmer $2,300 to ship that \ncarload of wheat. But, if you put that carload wheat on in Minneapolis \nand ship it to Chicago, which is about the same distance, they don't \ncharge $2,300. They charge $1,000. Why do we get charged more than \ndouble? Because there is only one railroad. And they say, ``Here is \nyour price. If you don't like it, tough luck.'' So we pay too much \nmoney for transportation.\n  My point is that in every direction the family farmer is confronted \nnot by a free market but by a controlled market--controlled in someone \nelse's interest. That is the dilemma we face.\n  At some point in agriculture, we reach a point of no return. The \nquestion for this Congress is whether we care enough about the future \nof family farmers in America to take effective action. Do we want to \nsave family farmers? We can decide not to do that.\n  The best way to decide not to do much about family farming is to \nessentially say the farm bill passed by Congress was just fine. We can \nsay it is all right that the big print giveth and the little print \ntaketh away. Well, I don't think that is just fine. I think it is \ncritically important to save family farmers.\n  If this country believes that food is expensive these days, they \nought to try buying food once corporate agrifactories farm America from \nCalifornia to Maine. Then they will find out what the price of food \nreally is. It won't be cheap food. It will be expensive food for the \nAmerican consumer.\n  This last chart shows a cartoon from one of our newspapers. There is \nnothing very funny what we have been discussing. This cartoon tells the \nstory of agriculture in our region. It shows ``Family Farmers: The \nPoint of No Returns.'' It describes the roadbed our farmers are \ntraveling. That roadbed is made up of low yields, low market price, low \ncattle prices, high production costs, crop disease, bad weather. Our \nfarmers have no returns on their production and now are on the point of \nno return.\n  When I talked about transportation costs earlier, I should have also \nmentioned that there are many other business stories of what family \nfarmers are facing.\n  My colleague from Minnesota is ready to speak. He comes from the east \nof North Dakota, Minneapolis, MN. Did you know that if a North Dakota \nfarmer is going to ship his or her grain on a rail bed, put it in a car \nand ship it on the railroad, that the same railroad that will ship a \ncarload of wheat from Iowa all the way up through North Dakota and then \nto the West Coast for less? That's right shipping from Iowa up through \nMinneapolis, through North Dakota to the West Coast will be cheaper to \nthan to load the grain on in North Dakota and ship it from North Dakota \nto the West Coast? Why? Because shipping from Iowa is a circumstance \nwhere you are shipping where there is competition at the point from \nwhich you start to ship it. The railroad will charge more money for \nfewer miles to North Dakota farmers to ship that same load of grain.\n  My point is, it doesn't matter where you intersect this farm problem. \nIn every single instance you will find out that there are no free \nmarkets; not in transportation, chemical prices, slaughterhouses, grain \nmarkets, you name it.\n  I haven't yet even mentioned the unfair trade that comes from Canada \nand elsewhere that undercuts our farmers' markets and further collapse \nfarm prices. This is in addition to all of the other things I have \nmentioned. Right now, as I speak, somewhere up in a border port between \nCanada and the United States there is an 18-wheel truck driving up. And \nthe driver is leaning out with his left elbow telling some Customs' \ninspector, ``Yes. I have Canadian durum on the back of this truck. I \nhave got a load of Canadian durum.'' He is going to drive that Canadian \ndurum into the United States, undercutting our market, and thus taking \nthe money right out of the pockets of American producers.\n  How is he going to do it? Because the grain on his truck was sent by \nthe Canadian Wheat Board, which is a monopoly. It is a state-sponsored \nmonopoly that would be illegal in the United States of America. The \ndurum wheat that he is hauling is sold through the Wheat Board at \nsecret prices, which is not something that can happen in this country, \neither. So we have a state monopoly from Canada selling at secret \nprices in this country to undercut our farmers' price. It is \nfundamentally unfair.\n  While that truck comes across today, we have trade officials who just \nsit on their hands. They see nothing, they do nothing and they say \nnothing. In fact, they ought not be there when the paychecks come out. \nWe ought to save the money. Why have a trade office that doesn't have \nthe energy to get up in the morning and suit up, with the notion that, \n``I am going to do something good''? I will have more to say about that \nthis week.\n  Right now my sense is we have trade people who have an unwillingness \nto take action. I say get rid of them. Get rid of all of them, and do \nit now. I am at my wit's end with our trade officials, because they \nknow in their hearts that all they have is this mantra of free trade. \nThey ought to really have some cymbals on the street corner someplace \nand just chant all day. That is all they do is chant. They certainly \ndon't do any effective work with this country. If they did, they would \nbe at the borders deciding that when people come into this country \nunfairly to try to undercut our markets and dump in this country at \nsecret prices that there ought to be sanctions for that. As I said, I \nwill have more to say about our trade officials later this week.\n  But I am here today for a very specific reason. Between now and \nseveral weeks from now when this Congress adjourns, there isn't a more \nimportant agenda item for us to complete than to deal with the farm \nproblem. I hope we can do it together. I hope that Republicans and \nDemocrats coming from farm country are able to stand together and say, \n``We want to do something to help family farmers get over this price \ndepression.''\n  When prices drop and you have a price valley, we need to build a \nbridge across that valley. That is what this farm program this Congress \npassed was supposed to do. But, as I said, the promise was in the big \nprint and the small print took that away. Shame on the small print. \nWhat we propose to do is dump the small print today and give family \nfarmers the kind of support that is necessary to get across these price \nvalleys.\n  Let me finish as I started by telling you about Brian and Johnet \nChristianson. This is just one farm family--one couple living on a \nfarm--that is representative of thousands and thousands of farmers \nacross the region. They say, ``This will be the last year for us, our \nloan officer tells us, if we can't make scheduled payments.'' They ask \na question. When their prices drop 57 percent and they are getting more \nthan $2 a bushel less for their grain than it cost them to produce, how \ncan they possibly be expected to meet their payments?\n  There are no better people in this country than our farm families. I \nam not judging who is best. But, certainly there is nobody better folks \nin this\n\n[[Page S10289]]\n\ncountry than those people who went out and homesteaded the land, built \nthemselves a house, raised a family, and operated a family farm. There \nare no bigger risk takers in America than those who plant the seed in \nthe spring, and borrow some money to do it. They put everything they \nhave, their sweat, their blood, their tears, everything they have into \nit. They risk everything they have every year. Then they hope that the \ninsects don't come, it doesn't rain too much, that it rains enough, it \ndoesn't hail, hoping their crop grows. And, when it grows, they hope \nthat if they can harvest it and get it to the elevator, they hope among \nhope there is some kind of price that will give them the opportunity to \nmake a living.\n  All of us know in our hearts that those folks are out there crying \ntears tonight because they are losing their hope and they are losing \ntheir dream of wanting to continue a family farm for themselves and \ntheir children.\n  We know what is happening to these people in those farm houses that \nBrian and Johnet talk about it. This mother says she is only able to \nbuy her young daughter one pair of new jeans for the school year, and \nher daughter says, ``No, no, that is all right; I know we can't afford \nthat.'' We know that in those houses they hope tonight that this \nCongress will do the right thing.\n  Congress extends itself to say to everyone around the world whenever \nthere is trouble, ``We are off rushing to help.'' What about now, here \nat home on the family farm, where there is trouble? Shouldn't we begin \nto rush to help with some real assistance that gives these farm \nfamilies the hope of surviving for another day, another year, and an \nopportunity to say, ``I am a family farmer, I am making a decent living \non the family farm, and I am proud of it.'' If at the end of the day, \ntogether we do what we can and should do to make things right for \nAmerica's family farmers, we will give these people on our family farms \nthe opportunity to be able to say that with dignity and pride.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me, first of all, thank my \ncolleague, Senator Dorgan from North Dakota, and also Senator Harkin \nfrom Iowa.\n  I think that it is not just a matter of--I think my colleague, \nSenator Dorgan, will agree with me--of coming to the floor and giving a \nspeech.\n  This is all so real to us. It is very concrete. This is the issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter which was sent \nto me from Wally Sparby, who is the Minnesota State director of our \nMinnesota Farm Service Agency, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         USDA Farm Service Agency,\n\n\n                                       Minnesota State Office,\n\n                                 St. Paul, MN, September 10, 1998.\n       Hon. Paul Wellstone: During our 1998 loan season, we \n     approved loans based on $4.00 per bushel for wheat and $2.55 \n     to $2.75 for corn.\n       Now the farmers are receiving from $2.50 to $2.70 for their \n     wheat in the market place and $1.42 to $.52 per bushel for \n     their corn--this just does not sustain cash flow!\n       1. The one thing Congress can do that will help farmers \n     with cash flow today, more than anything else right now, is \n     to take the caps off the loan rates!!\n       That will, on the average, immediately pump 60 cents a \n     bushel into the wheat and 30 cents a bushel into the corn.\n       2. A Consumer Assurance Reserve should be established to \n     provide for a plentiful food supply in the interest of \n     National security. Store it on the farms and pay them the \n     same rate as commercial storage!\n       3. Storage should have a two year rotation.\n       4. Extend the Marketing Loan Program to 18 months.\n       Senator, I'm also sending you a copy of our Minnesota State \n     Committee deliberations from their South Dakota meeting two \n     weeks ago.\n       Hope these items can be of some value to you. If I can be \n     of further assistance, please feel free to contact me.\n     Sincerely,\n                                                      Wally Sparby\n                                 MN State Executive Director, FSA.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Minnesota yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand that the unanimous consent \nrequest I am going to ask for has been agreed to by both sides.\n  I ask unanimous consent that no amendments be in order to the pending \nHarkin amendment prior to a tabling vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator from Minnesota will yield \nfurther just for a question before he begins his address. I understand \nthat this coming Saturday in Worthington, MN, there is to be a farm \nrally, which I assume the Senator will be speaking about. The rally is \nin his home State, but it is a rally designed to encourage farmers from \na four-State area to come together to talk about and demonstrate the \nurgent need to stress this farm crisis. I intend to be in Worthington, \nMN, this Saturday with Senator Wellstone and others. I think it is a \n9:30 a.m. farm rally. But I would expect a good many farm families will \ncome from our four-State region to talk about their hopes and dreams \nand talk about especially what they hope this Congress will do to \naddress this deep and abiding farm crisis.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my colleague from North Dakota is \nright. This gathering is not a gathering just for farmers, but it is \nalso for small businesses, for educators, for the religious community. \nIt is really for rural America, farmers and other citizens from the \nDakotas, from Iowa, from Minnesota. It is going to be 9:30 to noon at \nthe Nobles County Fairground grandstand. And I also say to my colleague \nfrom North Dakota, it is very important to point out to the presiding \nChair and others that Republicans are invited to be a part of this \ngathering. This is going to be a bipartisan effort to focus the \nattention of the Nation on what is happening in agriculture. So it is a \nvery, very important gathering. I think there will be a huge turnout of \npeople, and I hope that those of us who represent the Midwest, \nDemocrats and Republicans alike, will be there.\n  Mr. President, I want to read the beginning of the letter that Wally \nSparby sent to me. Again, he is the director of the Minnesota State \noffice of the USDA Farm Service Agency.\n\n       Senator Wellstone:\n       During our 1998 loan season, we approved loans based on $4 \n     per bushel for wheat and $2.55 to $2.75 for corn. Now that \n     farmers are receiving from $2.50 to $2.70 for their wheat in \n     the marketplace and $1.42 to $1.52 per bushel for their corn, \n     it just does not sustain cash flow.\n\n  And among the recommendations, the first recommendation is:\n\n       The one thing Congress can do that will help farmers with \n     cash flow today more than anything else is to take the caps \n     off loan rates.\n\n  That is followed by two exclamation points. I would, again, like to \nhave this letter printed in the Record. I think the Chair already \nindicated its approval.\n  Mr. President, for the State of Minnesota, according to the Federal \nfigures, net farm income fell 38 percent from 1996 to 1997. With these \nprices, the current farm income might fall far more than that if we do \nnot act.\n  I am going to get to the figures and the statistics in a moment, but \nI would again like to go back to what I said to my colleague, Senator \nHarkin from Iowa, at the beginning. We just now had a unanimous consent \nagreement that there will be no second-degree amendment, but from my \npoint of view, as a Senator from Minnesota, I would just want to say to \nthe majority leader, Senator Lott, I do not think this procedure is \nsatisfactory. I think we should be accountable. I do not think this \nshould be a tabling motion. I think this should be an up-or-down vote.\n  We have a package of proposals here, which I will go over in a \nmoment, which represent our best effort to, in a very positive way, \nrespond to an economic convulsion that is taking place in agriculture, \nto respond to the economic pain of people we represent, to respond to \nthe fact that we now have broken dreams and broken lives and broken \nfamilies, and the status quo is unacceptable. There is not a one of us, \nDemocrat or Republican, from the Midwest or from the agricultural \nStates, who cannot and should not be out on the floor of the Senate \nfighting as hard as we can for our people. This is the issue, and I \ndon't think the majority leader's proposal that we have an up or down \ntabling motion is satisfactory.\n\n[[Page S10290]]\n\n For my own part, I do not intend for this to be the end of the debate \nthis week. We are going to come back to this question over and over \nagain. We must.\n  I think the intent that there only be 3 hours to debate this \namendment marginalizes or trivializes what is a central issue in the \nUnited States of America today. I think a tabling motion as opposed to \nan up-or-down vote does the same thing, and we are going to have to be \nheld accountable. One way or another, if we should not prevail today, \nmy working assumption--I am only speaking for myself as a Senator from \nMinnesota--is that we will come back to this over and over again in \nhowever many weeks we have remaining. I consider it to be my mandate as \na Senator from Minnesota to make this my central priority.\n\n  I do not know any other way to do it. We have so many discussions on \nthe floor of the Senate. People are just coming --they are not even \nback yet. A lot of Senators will not even have an opportunity to debate \nthis before we have a tabling motion.\n  Let me just say that in personal terms what this means, this \ndepression in agriculture, these record low prices, is that family \nfarmers, that is to say, people who work on the land, live on the \nland--they are not absentee investors--are not going to make it. It is \njust that simple. They cannot make it. So in personal terms this is \ndevastating not just for family farmers but for our small towns, our \nrural communities, whether it be in Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota or \nSouth Dakota. You name it. It is devastating, absolutely devastating.\n  We are always going to have somebody farming. There will be acres of \nland. Someone will own the land. Someone will own the animals for the \nlivestock producers, but the health and vitality of our communities in \nrural America is not based upon the number of acres that are farmed or \nthe number of farm animals. It is based upon the number of family \nfarmers who live in those communities and contribute to our schools and \nbuy from our local businesses and contribute to our churches or \nsynagogues.\n  That is what this is all about. We are confronted with the fierce \nurgency of now. If we are not careful, time is going to march on, and \nit is going to leave all of us standing alone, standing naked. What \nthat will really mean is that family farmers are just going to be \ndriven off the land where they not only work but where they live.\n  Again, before I get to the statistics, because I want my colleagues, \nas I make this plea to Republicans as well, and Democrats and everybody \nhere to understand my own position, which is going to be today if we \nwin, great; if we do not, come back over and over and over again--from \nmy own part I remember moving out to Minnesota to Northfield, where I \nwas a teacher, college teacher, and I don't have an agricultural \nbackground, but my father was a Jewish immigrant who fled persecution \nin Russia where he was a writer. My mother was a cafeteria worker. But, \nTheresa and Phil--Phil Van Zuillan is no longer alive, he passed away--\nfrom Nerstrand in rural Rice County, they were the people who were my \nteachers when I began to do a lot of community organizing. And that is \nwhen I first began to learn about community agriculture. And my friend, \nDon Langer, who is no longer alive. I learned an awful lot from farmers \nin Rice County, crop farmers, dairy farmers, about a county 490-some \nsquare miles, population 41,000. And then I began to organize with \nfarmers.\n\n  And then there was the mid-1980s, and all my organizing then was with \nfarmers. And we saw just essentially a meltdown in agriculture. We saw \npeople driven off the land and record foreclosures--record low prices \nand record farm foreclosures, in that formula that goes together. I \nremember going to some of those foreclosures--it was awful--some of \nthose auctions. It was awful. I remember seeing people just breaking \ndown and crying. There were some farm families--let me not be \nmelodramatic, but let me just say it because it is true: I remember \nsome of the men I met, some of the farmers I met, who took their lives. \nThey took their lives.\n  Mary Ryan works in our office in Willmar in West Central Minnesota, \nMary and Bob Ryan--one of their friends, I say to my colleague, Senator \nConrad from North Dakota, took his life. He had been foreclosed on. \nThat is what is going on now. We have to somehow sort of bring this to \nthe attention of the Nation today, but today is not the end of it. If \nthis set of proposals are tabled, this is just the beginning. This will \nnot be the end. For me, I will tell you that as a Senator from \nMinnesota, it will just be the beginning. We saw this dislocation, we \nsaw people foreclosed on. We had huge, massive rallies. We had anywhere \nbetween 10,000 and 15,000 people who marched on the State capital in \nMinnesota.\n  I do not want to go through it again, but that is exactly what is \nhappening. My appeal to farmers in our States, and not just the \nfarmers, but to rural America and around the country, is we are going \nto need you. I hope we succeed today, but if we do not succeed today I \nhope you will hold people accountable. We are going to need you because \nwe are going to be back over and over again. The principal problem is \nlow commodity prices. If I had a blackboard here and I was teaching, I \nwould just write: Price, price, price. The price of corn in Minnesota \nis $1.50 a bushel, or even less at many elevators. You could be the \nbest farmer in the world, the best manager in the world, and there is \nno way you can cash-flow at $1.50 a bushel. We ought to have a price of \n$2.70 or even $3 a bushel. Anything below $2 a bushel is a death knell \nfor family farmers. Virtually no farmer can cash-flow at that level.\n  Wheat these days in Minnesota is about $2.65 per bushel. It should be \n$3.75 or $4. Soybeans are approximately $5 or $5.10. We would like to \nsee that price at $6. The current prices are almost unbelievably low.\n  According to a letter sent by Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman \nto Minority Leader Daschle, corn prices nationwide are 30 percent below \nthe average price of the last 5 years; wheat prices are 28 percent \nunder the average price; and soybean prices are 17 percent below 5-year \naverages. Livestock prices are way down as well.\n  This is exactly what happened in the mid-1980s, and we had this \nmassive shakeout of family farmers at that time which changed the face \nof rural America--and not for the better. Many communities in Minnesota \nand all across the heartland were devastated by what happened. And that \nis going to happen again. It is happening now, and we are going to see \nmany of our rural communities destroyed on the present course. We must \nchange that course. This amendment that we have introduced is a \npositive proposal to change that course.\n  Some in Minnesota are talking about losses to our State's economy \nthis year of over $1 billion. Some are speaking about 20 percent plus \nof family farmers who are threatened. Again, this is not just for the \nfamily farmers. It is for small business people, it is for ag lenders, \nit is for our educational institutions, it is for our children, it is \nfor our grandchildren, it is for our small towns, it is for our rural \ncommunities. Do you know what else? In Minnesota, it is also for the \nTwin Cities. We are all in the same boat. The fate of greater Minnesota \nand the health and vitality of greater Minnesota, or lack thereof, and \nhealth and vitality of our metropolitan area are intertwined. We are \nlooking at an economic convulsion in rural America. Certainly that is \nthe case in the Midwest. We are looking at broken dreams and broken \nlives and broken families. We have to do something.\n  I was at a farm crisis meeting, first in Crookston, MN, back in \nMarch, in northwestern Minnesota. My colleague, Senator Conrad, will \nspeak about this as well. It certainly applies to North Dakota in full \nforce. The issue was not just low prices, but several years of bad \nweather and crop disease. Then I was on a farm in Granite Falls, MN, \nEast Grand Forks and Fulda.\n  Next weekend, we have this rally scheduled, September 19, Saturday \nmorning. Again, 9:30 to noon, rain or shine, Nobles County Fairgrounds \ngrandstand, Worthington, MN, junction I-90 and highway 59. Senator \nHarkin will be there. Senator Dorgan will be there. As many Republicans \nas possible, and Democrats, I hope will be there as well.\n\n  It is not a partisan crisis. I can tell you right now, many of these \nfarmers\n\n[[Page S10291]]\n\nwho are going under are not Democrats. Many are Republicans and many \nare Democrats. And I don't think it makes a darned bit of difference to \nany of them, in terms of political party.\n  Mr. President, we have taken some steps this year to address the \nproblem. But we are falling way short. We included, if Senator Conrad \nremembers this, we included some additional plant loan money into the \nsupplemental appropriations bill earlier this year. That was for spring \nplanting loans. We were pleased to do that. It helped some. Senator \nConrad and Dorgan and Daschle and others--and I was pleased to be a \npart of that effort--put together an indemnity bill that was $500 \nmillion in disaster assistance. It is going to go way up. We are now \ntalking about $1.5 billion of indemnity payments when we are looking at \nwhat is happening in the South as well. That is part of this amendment. \nThat is critically important. We need to get some assistance to people, \nASAP. This is a crisis, all in capital letters.\n  What our current amendment does is simple. I am just going to focus \non two or three provisions. First thing our amendment does is it lifts \nthe cap on the farm marketing loan rates, and it raises that loan rate. \nAgain, the primary problem is price. What farmers say to me is: Paul, \neven if you get the payments out, indemnity payment, disaster \nassistance payments for us, what is the future for us? Comodity prices \nhave fallen through the floor. Whatever our explanation is for the low \ncommodity prices, there has to be some kind of safety net to help \npeople stay in business. The single most important thing we can do is \nto improve prices, and the tool we have available to us is the loan \nrate.\n  The loan rate does not set the prices, it does not even set a floor \nunder the prices. If it did, the prices would not be as low as they are \ncurrently. But the loan rate does tend to give farmers--there is not \none Senator who can argue to the contrary--a bit of leverage in the \nmarketplace. It let's them take a loan on that crop, on their crop, and \nhang on to the crop and wait for prices to improve--if that is their \nchoice.\n  Or, and this is a critical point--I am sorry that we are at this \ncritical point, but we are--or, when the prices fall below the loan \nrate, farmers can also use that loan rate as a safety net and take a \ncheck worth the difference between the loan rate and the market price \non the amount of their production.\n  It is simple. It is simple. Unfortunately, the 1996 farm bill, which \nI always call the ``freedom to fail'' bill--when it passed, I called it \nthat--capped those loan rates at unrealistically low levels. There were \nsome good things in the Freedom to Farm or ``freedom to fail'' bill, I \nsay to my colleagues who are now coming to the floor, but at least we \nhave to have this modification.\n  For corn, the Freedom to Farm bill capped loan rates at $1.89 a \nbushel. Again, virtually no farmer can make it on $1.89 a bushel. It \ndoesn't even work as a partial safety net.\n  What our amendment will do is lift the current cap on loan rates and \nraise the marketing loan rate on corn from its current $1.89 per bushel \nto $2.20 or $2.25. It will raise the loan rate for wheat from the \ncurrent $2.58 to about $3.22. Raising the loan rate usually tends to \nset a floor under prices by giving farmers some leverage in the \nmarketplace. At a minimum, it certainly will greatly improve the safety \nnet for our farmers.\n  Our proposal will also extend the repayment period on these same \nmarketing loans to give farmers an extra 6 months to hold on to the \ngrain and wait for a better price.\n  The purpose of both of these provisions is to give farmers some \nleverage. The Freedom to Farm bill--what I call the ``freedom to fail'' \nbill--gave farmers planting flexibility. That is great. Let me repeat \nit, that is great.\n  We were for that. But we now need to give farmers some marketing \nfreedom to go along with the planting freedom. We need to raise the \nloan rate and extend the repayment on these loans along with \ndramatically increasing the indemnity money.\n  I am going to say it one more time. I have other colleagues on the \nfloor who want to speak. Mr. President, we have come to the floor of \nthe Senate with a set of proposals that are substantive, that are \ncredible. The vast majority of family farmers around the country, I am \npositive, support the proposal to take the cap off the loan rate and \nget the price up to give them some leverage in the marketplace and the \nindemnity payments. I hope that there will be strong bipartisan support \nfor this amendment. I hope so. If not, if this amendment should be \ntabled, then as far as I am concerned, the debate just begins.\n  I say to Senator Conrad, who is about to speak--I am about to yield \nthe floor--but I think he will agree with the last point I make which \nis, for us, am I right, I say to Senator Conrad, this is the issue, \nthis has to be our work, we want it to be our work? We don't want the \npain to be there, but we can't go home without fighting in every \npossible way, using every rule available, using all of our leverage to \nmake sure that this Senate and this Congress comes forward with \npositive legislation that can make a difference so that so many good, \nwonderful people in our States don't go under, are not ruined, are not \ndevastated. That is what this debate is all about. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to support the package of \namendments that is before us, because agriculture in my State is in a \ncrisis. I have previously referred to it as a stealth disaster, because \nit is flying below the radar screen of much of the national media. \nUnlike the disasters of last year that were very visual, this is hard \nto take a picture of, because this is a circumstance where we have \ncollapsing prices and falling production, and the combination of the \ntwo is pressing farmers and forcing them into selling out.\n  I draw my colleagues' attention to a May, 1998, front-page Wall \nStreet Journal story that examined the agricultural crisis in the \nheartland of America. It pointed out very clearly that on the northern \nplains, the new farm bill is yielding pain and upheaval, and, indeed, \nit is. They point out that the dramatic drop in wheat prices was \nalready, back in May, creating desperate problems for farmers in my \nState, but also in the State of the Senator from Minnesota, Senator \nWellstone, who just spoke.\n  This is a problem that is now recognized not just in our home areas, \nbut across the country. Indeed, not only has the Wall Street Journal \nwritten articles on what is happening, but the New York Times. This is \na story that ran in July, 1998. They point out we have a desperate \ncrisis in agriculture. We have seen, in fact, two front-page stories in \nthe New York Times, a front-page story in the Washington Post, all \ntalking about the extreme conditions farmers in North Dakota are \nfacing.\n  Just moments ago, the respected Farm Journal released a survey of \n1,000 wheat and corn farmers. The support for changes in farm policy in \nthat Farm Journal survey is overwhelming: 73 percent of those surveyed \nbelieve that our current farm bill does not provide adequate income; 77 \npercent believe Congress should modify the farm bill; 73 percent \nbelieve we should lift the caps on marketing loans; 85 percent believe \nwe must stop the import of surplus grain from abroad; 86 percent \nbelieve the United States should reestablish the farmer-owned and \ncontrolled grain reserve. Only 40 percent of farmers surveyed believe \nthat they will be farming in 5 years. Mr. President, only 32 percent \nsaid they would encourage their kids to farm.\n  This is a survey done by the Farm Journal, perhaps one of the most \nrespected farm journals in this country. The level of support for a \nchange in farm policy is overwhelming, and of course it should be, \nbecause what is happening is an unmitigated disaster.\n  This chart shows what is happening in my home State of North Dakota. \nNorth Dakota farm incomes were washed away in 1997. From 1996 to 1997, \naccording to the Government's own records, there was a 98-percent \nreduction in farm income--a 98-percent reduction. By any measure, this \nis a calamity, and the result is that literally thousands of farmers \nare quitting. In fact, the Secretary of Agriculture visited North \nDakota in June, 1998. When he came to visit with area producers, he was \ntold by his own crisis response team that we might anticipate losing\n\n[[Page S10292]]\n\nup to 25 or even 30 percent of the farmers in my State in the next 2 \nyears. Mr. President, this may be a stealth disaster, but it is a \ndisaster nonetheless, and it requires a response.\n  The drop in farm income is not just limited to North Dakota. In fact, \nwe are seeing farm income drop in a majority of States. This shows the \ndecrease in farm income from 1996 to 1997 in State after State.\n  You can see North Dakota, unfortunately, led the way. But not very \nfar behind were Missouri, Maryland, New York, West Virginia, Virginia, \nMinnesota, Wisconsin. You can see that the heartland States in many \ncases were those most affected.\n  In 1998, this picture is even getting more serious, because we are \nseeing other States deeply affected, some of them by natural disaster, \nall of them--all of them--by collapsing prices.\n  Mr. President, we have to understand that this disaster is a result \nof really two factors: One, natural disasters in my State--overly wet \nconditions that have led to a dramatic loss in production because of \nfungus that has gotten loose in the fields. That fungus has caused \ndramatic crop losses. But on top of that, we have very low farm prices. \nIn fact, we have now reached the lowest level in real terms for farm \nprices in our history.\n  This shows spring wheat prices from 1946 to 1997. You can see in 1997 \nalready we were nearing the all-time lows for wheat prices.\n  Look what has happened in 1998. The bottom has fallen out. We have \nthe lowest prices in real terms in history. In nominal terms we have \nthe lowest prices in 21 years. The result is a collapse of income for \nfarmers and the result is thousands of farmers being forced off the \nland.\n  I had a blowup made of some of the ads that are in the farm journals \nback home. Auction, auction, auction--we are absolutely being flooded \nwith auctions all across North Dakota and Minnesota, parts of Montana \nand South Dakota and Wisconsin. And one of the interesting things to \nnote is, it isn't old equipment being auctioned off. It is new \nequipment--1996 cultivator, 1996 swapper, 1996 disc, 1996 tractor. \nThese are farmers who thought they were going to be around. They \nthought they were going to be in farming, but they are being forced off \nthe land.\n  Mr. President, in North Dakota, wheat prices last week hit $2.50 a \nbushel--$2.50 a bushel for a commodity that takes about $5 a bushel to \nproduce. Some have said, ``Well, they just plant more and make it up in \nvolume.'' It reminds me of the story of the fellow that was selling \nshovels. He was buying them for $20 and selling them for $16. And he \nwas so excited because he was selling lots of them. One of his friends \nwith a little cooler head said, ``You know, it's not working out so \nwell if you buy them for $20 and are selling them for $16. You're \nlosing $4 on every shovel.'' This fellow, who was the ultimate optimist \nsaid, ``I'm going to make up for it in volume.'' You are not going to \nmake up for it in volume. You are not going to make up for it in any \nway when you are losing $4 on every shovel you sell.\n  The same thing is happening on every bushel of wheat. When it costs \nyou $5 to produce, and you are getting $2.50 at the market, you are not \ngoing to stay in business very long. That is the hard reality. That is \nthe simple truth.\n  Mr. President, that is what is happening in my State and many others. \nSomething must be done. And it must be done quickly or we are going to \nsee an exodus from agriculture unlike any we have seen in our history.\n  Mr. President, it is not enough to define the problem. It is also \nimportant to look at what is causing the problem. Let me just put up a \nchart that shows what we did in the last farm bill.\n  In the last farm bill we dramatically cut support for agriculture. In \nthe previous 5-year farm bill we averaged $10 billion a year in support \nfor American producers. In the new farm bill, that has been cut in \nhalf--$5 billion a year for support for our agriculture producers--a \ndramatic reduction. In fact, this is the biggest cut in Federal \nspending of any part of the Federal budget.\n  I am someone that has been a deficit hawk the entire time I have been \nin the U.S. Senate. I deeply believe in balanced budgets, not because \nthat is the thing to do, but because it makes economic sense. It takes \npressure off interest rates and allows America to be more competitive \nand allows us to get back on track. That is exactly what has happened \nsince we started dramatic reductions in the deficit since 1993.\n  Mr. President, it is important to understand that no sector of the \nbudget has taken bigger reductions than agriculture. If we look at what \nour competitors are doing, we see why it puts us in a very difficult \nposition. Because our competitors in Europe are spending much more than \nwe are at supporting their producers.\n  Mr. President, I indicated that in our country we are spending $5 \nbillion a year to support our farmers. But in Europe, they are spending \nnearly $50 billion a year to support their producers. This is an unfair \nfight. It is one thing to say to our farmers, ``You go out there and \ncompete against the French farmer and the German farmer.'' That is \nfair. It is not fair to say to our farmers, ``And while you're at it, \nyou go compete against the French Government and the German Government \nas well.'' That is not a fair fight. But that is exactly what we are \ntelling our farmers to do. This represents unilateral disarmament in a \ntrade war. We would never do this in a military confrontation. Why are \nwe doing it in a trade confrontation?\n  Mr. President, $50 billion a year by Europe to support their \nproducers; $5 billion a year by us to support our producers. Is it any \nwonder that we are losing the fight? Is it any wonder that Europe is on \nthe march and on the move? Is it any wonder that Europe, who believes \nthey have a strategy and a plan, believes that that strategy and plan \nare working?\n  Mr. President, we have to wake up in America. We have to understand \nthat our competitors think we are asleep. They believe that we have \nbeen prosperous so long that we are not going to be willing to stay the \nfight. They believe that America is going to roll over and that they \nare going to be able to resume agricultural dominance.\n  Mr. President, if you examine the trend lines so far, they are right, \nbecause if you look at what the Europeans are doing, they have gone \nfrom being major wheat importers to being major exporters. Their share \nof the world grain trade has increased year after year after year. And \nit is time for America to decide, do we fight back or do we surrender?\n  I do not believe America wants to surrender. I believe America wants \nto fight back. Other countries want farmers out across the land, not \nhuddled in the cities. That is the choice before us, Mr. President. \nBecause unless we respond, unless we react, unless we help our \nproducers in this fight, they will lose. And that will be a sad day for \nAmerica. That will be a day we live to regret, because agriculture is \nat the heart of America's economic dominance. Make no mistake, \nagriculture is right at the heart of the strength of America. And if we \nare to surrender that position of dominance, we will rue the day we \nallow it to happen.\n  Mr. President, the last farm bill we passed dramatically reduced \nsupport. I put a chart up that showed spending per year for our farmers \nwas cut in half. This chart shows the payments that are going out to \nfarmers. In 1998--that is the year we are in--you can see this is the \nbest year; this is the best year under the new farm plan, the best \nyear. Look where it goes from here--down, down, down.\n  Mr. President, this cannot be allowed to stand. If you look at it \nfrom the individual producer's standpoint, here is what happens to the \nper bushel support that they get under the new farm plan: 1996, 1997--\nyou can see 1998 is the second best year in terms of per bushel \npayments to our farmers. And then it goes down, down, down.\n  Again, Mr. President, we have our farmers going on a one-way \nescalator, and it is an escalator going down. It is an escalator \nleading to defeat. It is an escalator that says to our farmers, forget \nit, because this country is not going to stand behind you in this \nworldwide trade confrontation. We are going to give up. We are going to \nsurrender. We are going to wave the white flag. We would never do that \nin any kind of military confrontation, and we should not be doing it in \nthis trade confrontation.\n  As we look at what is before the Senate in terms of this package, we \nhave\n\n[[Page S10293]]\n\nan increase in indemnity payments. A number of weeks ago, I introduced \non the floor an indemnity plan to help farmers because they are \nsuffering from natural disasters. So many farmers in our State have had \n5 years of extraordinary conditions, very bad conditions for the \ngrowing of grain, conditions that have led to this outbreak of disease, \nconditions that have led to a steep drop in production. We put in place \ncrop insurance. It is supposed to be the risk manager for our farmers \nand help them in disastrous circumstances.\n  One of the things we have learned about this new program of crop \ninsurance is that it does not work where you have multiple years of \ndisaster. It does not work. The reason it doesn't work is because your \nproduction history and base are determined on what your last 5 years of \nproduction have been. If you have suffered disaster after disaster, \nyour base is reduced; that determines what you get paid under crop \ninsurance. If you have had 5 years of disaster, your base is so reduced \nthat there is not a safety net, even though the farmers are paying for \nit through crop insurance premiums.\n  The first thing we need to do, and the Senate has already agreed, is \nto provide a system of indemnity payments to those who have had \nexperienced repeated losses and suffered sharp income declines.\n  Those indemnity payments that we passed in the U.S. Senate were for \n$500 million. However, since we passed them, the losses have mounted. \nThey have increased because of drought and disasters in Oklahoma and \nLouisiana. Because of other natural disasters around the country, we \nare seeing the income losses mount.\n  In this amendment we are proposing $1.5 billion. Already, the USDA \ntells us that to provide the same level of support we had when we \npassed the $500 million amendment in July, it would now take $1.1 \nbillion today to provide the same level of assistance. We are proposing \nto go to $1.5 billion to cover these mounting losses with respect to an \nindemnity payment.\n  In addition, we are recommending that we lift the marketing loan rate \ncaps, these artificial caps that were put in place in the last farm \nbill. On wheat, those caps are put in place at $2.58 a bushel; $2.58, \nwhen it costs about $5 a bushel to produce the product. Obviously, \nthose marketing loan rate caps in no way cover the costs of production. \nThe result is devastating losses to farmers' income. The result is \ndevastating losses of farm families.\n  That is why we are recommending lifting those loan rate caps. No, not \nto $5; no, not to $4; no, not even to $3.50; but to about $3.20. We \nthink that is a reasonable proposal on top of the indemnity plan to get \nsome money out across the land so farmers are not forced off their \nfarms. Those are the two key elements of this plan: an indemnity \npayment plan and lifting of the marketing loan rate caps.\n  I have already indicated, according to the Farm Journal and their \nsurvey just released moments ago, that the overwhelming majority of \nfarmers support lifting the marketing loan rate caps. Now, we will hear \nsome argue that if you lift the loan rate caps, prices will increase \nand, therefore, production will increase, and therefore a further glut \non the market will be created.\n  I had my staff call the Chief Economist's office at the Department of \nAgriculture and ask them if that scenario is plausible. They told us, \nno, it is not plausible due to the structure of the marketing loan \nprogram. If we lift the loan rate to $3.20 a bushel, a farmer can take \nout a loan for that amount. If he ultimately markets the grain for less \nthan that, he can keep the difference. Only if he sells the grain for \nmore than that $3.20 does he repay the entire loan amount. That is the \nway the marketing loan works. By the way, this is not unprecedented. We \nhave a marketing loan in place for cotton and rice. It has worked \nextremely well for those commodities.\n  What is wrong here is that the loan rate that we have set is simply \ntoo low. It is not allowing farmers to recover sufficient income to be \nable to stay in business. Again, some have argued if you do this you \nwill get more production; you will raise prices. The people at USDA, \nthe Chief Economist's office, say that is not true. Because of the way \nthe marketing loan rate is structured, a farmer sells for whatever the \nmarket brings. If the market is $2, he gets $2. If the market is $2.50, \nhe gets $2.50. But he gets to keep the difference between the marketing \nloan rate amount and what he gets for his product in the marketplace. \nHe only repays entirely if, in fact, he gets more in the market than \nthe marketing loan amount. It is, in effect, a safety net. A producer \nsells his product at whatever he can get for it, but then he is able to \nkeep the difference between the marketing loan rate amount and the \nmarket price.\n  I don't think those who argue that this is going to build stocks have \nstudied this proposal carefully because this applies for just this \nyear. Those who say it will lead to more production are going to have \nto answer the question, How is that? America has already planted and \nharvested its crops for this year. How is it that we will have more \nproduction when we have already produced this year's crop?\n  This marketing loan rate increase only applies to this crop year. How \nis it, we have to ask those on the other side, that this is going to \nlead to more production when, in fact, the production for this year is \nalready determined? We have already planted. We have already harvested. \nThis marketing loan rate increase is not going to increase production \nbecause there is no way to increase the production that is already in \nthe bin. This year is a closed album.\n  Some say it is going to induce others to produce more. Europe has \nfinished their crop for this year. Canada has finished their crop for \nthis year. We have finished our crop for this year. Who is it that is \ngoing to produce more because of a marketing loan rate increase in the \nUnited States? The Chief Economist for the United States Agriculture \nDepartment says it is not going to induce a price increase anywhere.\n  The fact is, this is a way of getting financial assistance to farmers \nwho are in a disastrous condition now. What are the alternatives? If \nsomebody else has a better idea, another alternative, I am glad to \nlisten to it. But right here, right now, we have what the farmers are \ncalling for. What the farmers are calling for is to take away these \nartificial loan rate limits and give farmers a fighting chance against \nthis incredible international competition, where our chief competitors \nare spending ten times as much as we are in order to support their \nfarmers. I have indicated that Europe is spending nearly $50 billion a \nyear to support their producers and we are spending $5 billion.\n  In support of exports, the margin is even more dramatic. In 1997, we \nspent $56 million supporting agricultural exports; Europe spent nearly \n$8 billion. This was a ratio of about 138-to-1. Now, I defy my \ncolleagues to explain how it is we win a fight when our side is being \noutspent 138-to-1. How is it that you have any chance of winning when \nthe other side is outspending you 138-to-1?\n  Mr. President, I hope very much that my colleagues will move to \nsupport this amendment, that the attempt to table this amendment will \nfail, and that together Republicans and Democrats will decide to back \nour producers, support our farmers, to say to our chief competitors, \nthe Europeans: ``You are not going to buy these markets. America is not \ngoing to wave the white flag of surrender, because this country \ndeserves better.'' It would be a profound mistake to let 20 or 30 \npercent of our farmers be washed away because other countries have put \na higher value on their producers.\n  Mr. President, I hope very much in the coming hours that people will \nreflect very carefully on the vote that we are to cast, that they will \nunderstand that we are in a trade confrontation, that our chief \ncompetitors are outspending us 10-to-1 in terms of overall support for \nproducers. In exports, they are outspending us 100-to-1. Now is the \ntime to respond, fight back, and the time for America to say that we \nare not going to allow our competitors to put our farmers under because \nour country is not willing to stand behind its producers.\n  Mr. President, this will be a defining moment for this year. This \nwill be a defining moment on the floor of the U.S. Senate when we vote \non this amendment. I hope very much, on a bipartisan basis, that our \ncolleagues will stand behind our farmers and our farm\n\n[[Page S10294]]\n\nfamilies and not allow them to be pushed off the land, to be forced \ninto the cities, and to be left with a very hollow legacy.\n  I just want to close by saying I just had a farmer call me, whose \nfamily has been on the land for over 100 years. They are farmers in the \nRed River Valley of North Dakota, which is some of the richest farmland \nin the world. He told me, with tears, that this was the last year for \nhim and his family, that they could not go forward any longer, that it \nwas not possible for them to survive this collection of natural \ndisasters and disastrously low farm prices.\n  Mr. President, the person that made that call to me is somebody who \nis recognized in our State as one of our very best farmers. He has won \naward after award. This is not a case of bad management. This is not a \ncase of people who are spending money foolishly. This is a case of \npeople who have worked hard and committed themselves fully. In fact, in \nthis family, both the man and wife have off-farm jobs as well as full-\ntime farm work. And every member of that family has made a commitment \nto farm this year. But because of these disastrous conditions, they \nhave said this is their last year.\n  Mr. President, America will be stronger if that family stays on the \nfarm. America will be better if that family stays on the farm. But it \nwill not happen unless we are willing to help them fight. It will not \nhappen unless we are willing to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with that \nfarm family to give them a fighting chance. It will not happen unless \nwe recognize that we are in a trade confrontation and that we have sent \nour farmers very lightly armed into a battle in which the competition \nis heavily armed.\n  I have spent many hours meeting with European agricultural leaders. \nIt is clear to me that they have a plan and they have a strategy. Their \nplan and strategy is to regain agricultural dominance worldwide. I hope \nwe don't show the white flag of surrender and give in to our \ncompetitors and walk away from this fight. We ought to say today that \nAmerica is standing by its producers and we intend to fight and we \nintend to win.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I commend my colleagues, Senator \nDaschle, Senator Harkin, Senator Dorgan, Senator Conrad, Senator \nWellstone, and others who have devoted a great amount of time, energy, \nand talent to crafting this amendment. I rise in strong support of this \ncomprehensive farm relief package being debated on the Senate floor \ntoday.\n  Madam President, I have been in communication with my home State just \nthis morning. Local cash prices for corn now, as we are approaching \nharvest, have collapsed to a new record low. Cash corn in Winner, SD, \nis bringing $1.10 per bushel today as we speak. Wheat prices have \ncollapsed to $1.70 per bushel. Land values across my State are \nbeginning to falter. In a communication with a farmer near the \nAberdeen, SD, area today, I am apprised of land values that have been \nvalued at $800 an acre bringing only $400 an acre in actual sale this \nweek.\n  This has a rippling effect. As I talk to farm implement dealers, \nthose providing feed, chemical dealers, veterinarians, mechanics, and \nall the people who prosper when farmers and ranchers in our Nation \nprosper, they say we need now, more than ever, not only comprehensive \nlegislation, but urgent legislation, to deal in a constructive fashion \nwith the crisis we face in farm country.\n  Now, Senator Conrad, I think, made an excellent point in pointing out \nhow the European Community is spending roughly $50 billion per year \nsustaining family agriculture in the E.C. In the United States, where \nonly 10 or 12 years ago we were spending $26 billion ourselves, we are \nnow down to $5 billion, and we are headed to zero, to the point where \nwe sustain family agriculture, in the greatest food-producing mechanism \nthe world has ever known, with far less than one-half percent of the \nFederal budget.\n  Is there a reason our European friends sustain their family \nagriculture at such a high level? Well, yes, there is. The reason is \nobvious. In Europe, they have been hungry a couple of times in this \ncentury. They know the dilemma that every society faces when \nagriculture is on its knees, when people are leaving the farm, when \nfood production is inadequate. They value highly the reliability and \nsustainability and high quality of agriculture in their part of the \nworld.\n  We in the United States, I am afraid, have grown complacent with the \nthought that somehow, no matter what we do, fields will be planted and \nthe livestock will be raised, the food will remain inexpensive at the \ngrocery mart, even while we destroy the roots of our agricultural \nproduction in this country. I fear that we are going to reach the point \nsome day when we are going to have an experience something similar to \nwhat the former Soviet Union found when they destroyed family \nagriculture, thinking that they could find a new, more efficient way of \ngrowing food, only to find the results catastrophic for their society.\n  Now Russia is trying to reestablish family agriculture. But guess \nwhat? Once family agriculture has been pulled up by the roots, it is \nnot so easily reestablished. It is very difficult to do. I fear that \nindirectly we are going down some of that same road of the destruction \nof family-based agriculture in this country.\n  I appreciate that there are some who have such a commitment to the \ncurrent farm bill that it borders on a theological commitment that \nnothing could be changed in that farm bill. There is much in the \nFreedom to Farm legislation that is constructive. And it is positive. I \nthink most of us applaud the flexibility and the lessened degree of \nmicromanagement that came with that farm bill. Yet, at the same time, I \nthink there is a growing recognition that all is not well. In fact, \nportions of the farm bill need a desperate and urgent revisit.\n  We understand that with the collapse of prices that we have now that \nwe need to give farmers a better opportunity to weather these down \ncycles, both in the grain side, in the farm bill's case, and in terms \nof livestock production.\n  For the past few months, I have joined my farm State Democratic \ncolleagues in working on ways to improve economic conditions for \nfarmers and ranchers. As you may remember, during this year's \nAgriculture appropriations bill, we introduced legislation to assist \nfarmers. We offered amendments which would lift the caps on marketing \nloans for grain farmers, provide disaster assistance for farmers who \nsuffered losses, provide for mandatory price reporting for livestock \nsales, and the labeling of imported beef and lamb products.\n  We were successful to some degree with those amendments. We passed \nthree of those proposals through this Senate: a $500 million disaster \nrelief assistance package for farmers, a pilot project for mandatory \nprice reporting on captive supplies of live cattle and boxed beef, and \nan amendment which I offered that will label beef and lamb products for \ncountry of origin. However, now that we have gone through the August \nrecess, we are into September, and we still have to convince the House \nconferees of the importance of these proposals.\n  So we are back today because the economy in farm country and ranch \ncountry is getting, frankly, desperate. Since July, prices for cattle \nand crops have fallen further, and it seems at this point that there is \nalmost no end in sight.\n  My recent conversations with farmers and ranchers across my State \nhave been alarming. Ranchers have been selling off their cattle herds. \nFarmers are applying for off-farm jobs in preparation of losing their \nfarms. And farm-related businesses are laying off employees. Implement \ndealers are laying off mechanics. Sale barns and veterinarians are \nlaying off their hired help as well.\n  The ripple effect of this economic crisis has already hurt farmers \nand ranchers. But it is moving now quickly into our rural communities--\nand not just the small communities but the larger cities and towns as \nwell.\n  With that, my farm State colleagues and I are offering this farm \nrelief legislation--this amendment. This legislation is crucially \nneeded if we are going to improve, if we are going to step in the right \ndirection with our farm economy.\n\n[[Page S10295]]\n\n  The first measure included in this package lifts the caps on \nmarketing loans and extends the terms from 9 to 15 months. Again, we \nvoted on this very same amendment earlier on on this Senate floor. We \nwere defeated on a party-line vote at that time. But this amendment is \nthe best way to provide farmers with an immediate economic impact for \nthe grain products they produce.\n  It would amend the Agriculture Marketing Transition Act--Freedom to \nFarm. As many of us know, it gives the President of the United States \nthe authority to declare a state of emergency for producers affected \nfor 1 year, removing the current loan rate caps, and extending the loan \nperiod from 9 to 15 months.\n  Wheat would have the cap increased from the current $2.58 to $3.22, \nup 64 cents per bushel; corn from $1.89, the current cap, to $2.25, up \n36 cents per bushel; and soybeans from $5.26 to $5.33, up 7 cents per \nbushel.\n  This would build on the existing marketing loan that is in the \ncurrent farm bill. This is not a revolutionary departure from the \ncurrent farm bill. It simply extends and expands the caps to a point \nwhere they become meaningful.\n  The Freedom to Farm, touted in the 1996 farm bill, did deliver the \nplanting and management flexibility to farmers who are able to take \nadvantage of that flexibility, but it failed to deliver freedom for \nfarmers to market in a flexible manner and at a profitable manner. When \nthe farm bill passed, wheat prices stood at nearly $6. Now, in some \ncases, it is down to $1.70. When the farm bill passed, corn was $5. Now \nit is $1.10 in some places.\n  The financial progress and future viability of our farm and ranch \noperations depends on the profits that can be gained from our \nagricultural products. I think all of us support short-term disaster \nrelief. And that is part of our package, too. But the long-term \nunderlying challenge that we have is to create an environment in which \nthe attendant market prices can be gained. Our farmers want, in the \nlong run, to have a decent price for their products. They are not \nlooking for government checks. They are not looking to go back to the \nold days of $26 billion a year in the farm program expenditures, \nalthough even that is only around half of what the European Community \nis spending today. But they want an environment where profitability is \nat least possible.\n  When cash flow projections were developed last fall by farmers and \ncreditors, better commodity prices were relied upon than what we see \ntoday. Keeping in mind the incredible, terrible prices that the farmers \nare now seeing, it is likely that we will see increased loan \ndelinquencies and default rates in the coming months. So while \nproducers are now essentially receiving prices comparable to what they \nreceived in the 1940s, their input and production costs reflect the \nmodern-day realities of the 1990s.\n  How many of us could make a decent living on 1940s wages and 1990s \ncosts? We could not, and neither can the farmers nor the ranchers. So \nwe are witnessing another devastating bout of farmers and ranchers \ngoing out of business.\n  Second, this package will provide short-term disaster assistance. It \nwill provide funding for income losses to farmers in the Dakotas, \nTexas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana--all of the hard-hit rural areas of our \nNation.\n  We successfully passed a $500 million proposal as part of the coming \nfiscal year's Agriculture appropriations debate. But it is still tied \nup in conference and it doesn't take into account the recent disasters \nwe have had in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana, the devastating drought \ncircumstances that currently exist there.\n  Third, this package would provide for emergency storage payments. It \nprovides for commodities placed under the marketing loans. It will \nallow farmers to store their grains during these low price cycles so \nthey will be able to market them with an eye toward more profitability \nover a longer window every time.\n  It would provide for mandatory price reporting creating a 3-year \npilot program that requires meat packers to report prices on live \ncattle and boxed beef; allows the Secretary of Agriculture to define \nand prohibit anticompetitive practices. It strengthens the 1921 Packers \nand Stockyards Act; provides whistle-blower protection for smaller \nproducers who speak out against captive supplies from business \ndiscrimination in the livestock industry; and, it would create a \ncommission to study credit availability to determine if current lending \npractices on the part of the Federal Government contribute to the \ngrowing problem of concentration in agriculture. Lastly, and \nimportantly to me, it would again reinvestigate the issue of labeling \nbeef and lamb meat products.\n  The Meat Labeling Act of 1998 was unanimously approved by the Senate \nduring its deliberations of the 1999 Agriculture appropriations bill. \nThe House, however, did not include it in its version of its \nAgriculture appropriations bill. Currently, we are tied up in \nconference.\n  Again, this is commonsense legislation. We label virtually every \nproduct Americans purchase, whether it be T-shirts, auto parts, shoes, \nwhatever. The one thing that is not labeled by country of origin is the \nfood products we feed our families.\n  This has the support of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, \nthe National Farmers Union, the American Farm Bureau Federation, and \nthe American Sheep Industry Association. It has broad bipartisan \nsupport, and I am proud that the original Senate bill had the support \nof eight Republicans and nine Democratic Senators.\n  Our livestock producers across this country have invested heavily in \napproved genetics, in marketing efforts, and in food safety in order to \nprovide the best quality and safest food in the world to American \nconsumers. But all too often they don't gain the benefit of those \ninvestments.\n  With the Canadian producers sending over half their beef production \ninto the United States today, I believe more than ever the time is ripe \nfor American consumers to at least have the ability to judge for \nthemselves whether or not they wish to buy a foreign product. They may \nchoose to do so. That is their prerogative. There is nothing in the \nfood labeling amendment that would prohibit imported meat products into \nthe United States, but it would put us on par with what other countries \nin the world are doing. The European Community is going to be mandating \ncountry of origin food labeling by the year 2000 for all of their \nnations. Most other major consuming nations in the world also apply \ncountry of origin labeling to food as well as to other consumer \nproducts.\n  This legislation, in short, is more than simply help for our \nlivestock producers. It is endorsed by the National Consumers League, \nthe Nation's oldest consumer organization. Once again, American \nconsumers have a right to know the source of the food products they \nfeed their families.\n  Madam President, this particular effort is not anti free trade; it is \ncommon sense. I know there are some who say, on the one hand, that \nAmericans may choose a foreign meat product. If they do so, that \ncertainly is their prerogative. There are others who say no, Americans \nwill choose American meat products. If they do so, again, it is their \nprerogative. There are those who are concerned that other nations will \nlabel country of origin on their food products. They already have. But \neven so, I have enough confidence, and obviously the American \nagricultural organizations, the key organizations that are in support \nof this amendment have equal confidence, that if any nation anywhere in \nthe world wishes a stamp ``Made in USA'' on an American meat product, \nmore power to them. We have confidence in our product. We think we can \nmarket with the country of origin label right now.\n  Currently, Argentina, Australia, Bosnia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, \nColombia, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, the Dominican Republic, \nEgypt, El Salvador, Estonia, Guatemala, Honduras, Hungary, Indonesia, \nIsrael, Korea, Latvia, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Russia, \nSwitzerland, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela have \nsome sort of meat labeling, with the E.C. soon to follow \ncomprehensively by the year 2000.\n  I have been meeting with Secretary Glickman as well as with Senator \nLarry Craig of Idaho, Senator Conrad Burns of Montana, Senator Max \nBaucus of Montana, and Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota to discuss \nthe importance of this legislation to our\n\n[[Page S10296]]\n\nfarmers and ranchers as well as our consumers. I am pleased that \nSecretary Glickman has exhibited his willingness to work with us on \nthis legislation to make country of origin meat labeling a reality.\n  With these steps in the right direction, I do not believe that we \nwill have resolved all of the crises that we have in American \nagriculture, but it will go a long way toward addressing both the \nshort- and the long-term problems we face. We need, obviously, to \naddress trade issues, we need to address rural development issues, ag \nresearch--all of them go together--if we are going to have the kind of \ncomprehensive strategy that is necessary to maintain a strong rural \nAmerica and an underlying strong level of support for a qualitative and \nabundant food supply for this Nation.\n  At this time, there is no other package that comes as close as this \ndoes to addressing the urgent crises that we have in American \nagriculture. So I enthusiastically rise in support of this amendment \nand again commend ranking member Harkin for his tremendous leadership, \nas well as Senator Daschle for his work in making this amendment a \nreality. This is an opportunity to address this crisis. We are running \nout of time. We have 5 to 6 weeks remaining of this Congress. There are \nfarmers and ranchers leaving the land as we speak. There are small \nbusinesses going broke as we speak. There is no time to wait. We need \nto move now on this legislation and get this to the President's desk as \nquickly as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota \nfor his contribution not only to this debate but his contribution to \noverall agriculture legislation which he has worked on for so many \nyears, first as a Member of the House and now the Senate. I know of his \ndeep commitment to family farmers and to doing whatever we can this \nfall to stop the crisis in agriculture. I know it is hitting the State \nof South Dakota every bit as hard as it is hitting Iowa and other \nStates in the Midwest. So I listened carefully to what the Senator from \nSouth Dakota had to say, and he is right on the mark.\n  Madam President, we cannot really afford to dally around any longer. \nWe have to take action, and we have to take action now, or it is going \nto cost us a lot more later on.\n  There are two things I would like to have printed in the Record. One \nis a letter dated September 10 from Secretary of Agriculture Glickman \nsupporting the package of amendments we are considering in the Chamber \nright now. I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in full in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                        Department of Agriculture,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 10, 1998.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Tom: I am writing in support of the Daschle-Harkin \n     Agriculture Relief amendments to address the crisis faced by \n     American farmers. This is an important set of actions that \n     will help respond to the deteriorating economic conditions \n     that have placed enormous burdens on our nation's \n     agricultural community.\n       Our farmers are faced with problems unequaled in years: \n     Corn prices are 30% below the average of the past five years; \n     Wheat prices are 28% under the average level of the past five \n     years; Soybean prices are under the five year average by 16%; \n     Cattle prices are 17% under the 5 year average; Net cash farm \n     income projects will be 43% below the average of the past \n     five years; and as a result of these and other price \n     declines: many of our farm families are facing dire \n     circumstances; farm land values are declining, farmers are \n     increasingly facing cash flow problems, and they are being \n     told they might not get credit for their 1999 crops.\n       When the President signed the 1996 Farm Bill, he said we \n     must do more to restore the safety net for American farmers. \n     In July, in response to this crisis, the President announced \n     measures to ease farmers' difficulties, including the \n     purchase of up to 80 million bushels of wheat worth \n     approximately $250 million for humanitarian shipment abroad, \n     and he supported the Conrad-Dorgan amendment for disaster \n     assistance that was added to the agricultural appropriations \n     bill.\n       Since then, because crop prices have continued to plummet, \n     with no immediate sign that the trend will be reversed, we \n     must do even more. Therefore, the Administration supports the \n     Daschle-Harkin amendment to the Interior appropriations bill \n     that would remove the cap on marketing loan rates for one \n     year.\n       We look forward to working with you to assist the nation's \n     farmers who have been so severely affected by these \n     circumstances.\n       With best personal regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Dan Glickman,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Secondly, Madam President, I learned this morning of a \npoll that had been taken, and the poll has just been released. I \nbelieve it was released at 2:30 this afternoon, so the paper is still \nhot, just off the press. It is quite a startling poll when you look at \nthe results. I am going to talk about that. The poll was prepared by \nRockwood Research, a subsidiary of Farm Journal, Inc. It was prepared \nfor the Nebraska Wheat Growers Association, the American Corn Growers \nAssociation, and the Nebraska Farmers Union.\n  I just want to say what the method was here. The method was that \nrepresentative data was drawn from 1,000 wheat and corn growers \nthroughout the United States. They have here a table of how many were \ncontacted in each State. For example, in the State of Illinois, 55 corn \ngrowers and 33 wheat growers, for a total of 88, were contacted; in \nIdaho, 1 corn grower, 12 wheat growers, a total of 13; in Iowa, 72 corn \ngrowers, no wheat growers; in Kansas, 9 corn growers, 72 wheat growers, \net cetera. All over the United States, from every State, from Alabama \nto Wyoming, farmers were contacted on this poll--500 corn growers and \n500 wheat growers, calls made randomly. I will not go through all the \nquestions, but I would like to highlight just a couple.\n  Question No. 7: ``Congress should modify the current farm program?'' \nYes or no. Seventy-six point nine percent said yes, 17.7 percent said \nno.\n  Question No. 8: ``Congress should lift loan caps and raise loan rates \n59 cents per bushel on wheat and 32 cents on corn.'' That is what is in \nthe package of amendments in the Chamber right now. And 72.5 said yes, \n19.4 percent said no.\n  Overwhelming, 3 to 1--actually over 3 to 1--said that we have to \nraise the loan rates, we have to modify the farm program, and we ought \nto lift the caps.\n  There are a couple of other findings in this poll, one here that I \nfound very illuminating. Question No. 13: ``A farm program should \nretain planting flexibility and include a farmer-owned and farmer-\ncontrolled grain reserve?'' Eighty-five point nine percent, yes; 9.9 \npercent, no. Think about it. Planting flexibility with a farmer-owned \nand farmer-controlled grain reserve--almost 86 percent of the farmers \npolled said yes. There is no question about that.\n  Well, that is what is in the package of amendments before us. We have \nplanting flexibility, we provide standby authority for the Secretary of \nAgriculture to provide for storage payments to farmers, and then \nlifting the caps from the loan rates would give the farmer marketing \nflexibility, that ability to keep his own grain and market it as he \nwants to over the next several months. Eighty-six percent of those \npolled said yes, they were in favor of that.\n  Madam President, I am going to put a copy of this poll on every \nSenator's desk, and I hope that each Senator will read this poll very \ncarefully before a vote is taken on our package of amendments. I \nunderstand there is going to be a motion to table. I am just hopeful \nthat every Senator will take a look at these poll results and see what \nthe farmers are saying. This is not my poll. It is not a skewed poll. \nThe poll was done by a reputable polling firm. One thousand farmers \npolled, random sampling. It is not even close--it is not even close--\nabout whether farmers want to raise the loan rates or not. It is \noverwhelmingly positive to get the loan rates raised and to provide for \na farmer-owned reserve so that farmers can market their own grain.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to print the results of this \npoll in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S10297]]\n\n                          U.S. Farm Bill Study\n\n  (Prepared by: Rockwood Research, a subsidiary of Farm Journal, Inc.)\n\n(Prepared for Nebraska Wheat Growers Association, American Corn Growers \n                Association, and Nebraska Farmers Union)\n\n\n                               background\n\n       The ``Freedom to Farm'' bill was intended to give farmers \n     financial stability despite the fluctuating market. Nebraska \n     Wheat Growers Association, along with American Corn Growers \n     Association and Nebraska and National Farmers Union, are \n     concerned that the bill is not effective considering the \n     current U.S. economic position. This study investigates the \n     attitudes of U.S. farmers in regards to the current and \n     future economic climate associated with the farm bill.\n\n\n                                purpose\n\n       To identify farmers' attitudes concerning the current U.S. \n     farm economy and farm program.

Madam President, I heard some talk around here that some \non the other side of the aisle are talking about coming up with a new \nprogram called lost market compensation payments, or something like \nthat. So, as I understand it, it would just be a set rate of payments. \nThey are going to come up with money and give it out to farmers like \nanother AMTA payment.\n  So what is the difference between that and taking the caps off the \nloan rates? A big difference. Keep in mind, if we have a direct \npayment, if you just give the money out to farmers this fall, and if \nthe prices go up next year--which we all hope they do--the Government \nis out that money. If we have an increased loan rate and farmers can \ntake that loan and pay their bills, and if the prices go up next year \nover 15 months--because that is what we put in the legislation, a 15-\nmonth loan--if, over the next 15 months, the prices go up, farmers can \nsell their grain, pay the loan back to the Government with interest, \nand, therefore, the Government would not necessarily be out all that \nmoney. The income protection is there, but if prices rise the \nGovernment will not bear as much cost.\n  As I understand it the idea is to come up with this lost market \ncompensation payment--it certainly sounds fancy to me--to pay out some \namount of money regardless of what prices may do over the course of the \nmarketing year. The loan rate approach is responsive to changes in \nmarket prices and the need for farm income protection. Again, keep in \nmind, if the money just goes out in direct AMTA-type payments and the \nprice goes up next year, the Government is out that money. You do not \nget that money back.\n  Second, if you make that direct payment to farmers, a lot of that \ndirect payment will not go to farmers. Like the AMTA payment, it will \ngo to landowners, it will go to landlords, and it may go to a number of \npeople who will not even be farming next year. I heard that concern a \nlot in Iowa. In July we passed a bill to allow up-front payment of AMTA \npayments, we brought up next year's payment to this fall. There are \ngoing to be a number of cases where people who took that early AMTA \npayment are not around to be farming next year, and the person who is \nfarming the land next year will get nothing. Lifting the caps from the \nmarketing loan rates goes to benefit the farmer. It goes to that \nproducer out there who really needs the income protection this fall and \nover the next 12 to 15 months.\n  The next point to keep in mind, and the difference between raising \nthe loan rates and the new AMTA-type payments, is that with increasing \nthe loan rate, even though it is a marketing loan, we believe it will \nprovide some price stability. It will help farmers conduct more orderly \nmarketing of commodities and help to lessen the erosion of prices \nbecause farmers will not be under such pressure to sell. A direct \npayment out will not have this effect. And it will mean that farmers \nthis fall without an adequate loan rate will have less of an \nopportunity to avoid just having to dump their grain on the market for \nwhatever they get. So a marketing loan at a better level, particularly \nalong with some storage payments, can head off a lot of problems. \nWithout them we are likely to have more grain sitting on the siding, \ngrain\n\n[[Page S10298]]\n\ndumped on the ground and more of it rotting out there because we do not \nhave the railcars to move it all at once.\n  So any way you cut it, any way you want to look at it, lifting the \nloan rate caps makes sense. From the standpoint of how much we are \nasking the taxpayers to bear the burden, who is going to receive the \nhelp--whether it is farmers or landlords--and whether we are going to \ndo something to stop the downward trend of prices, any way you look at \nit, removing the caps on loan rates and providing standby authority for \nstorage payments is in our best interest.\n  Finally, there are those who might say if you raise the loan rates, \nyou are going to cut us out of foreign markets. What nonsense. Keep in \nmind that these are marketing loans we are addressing today. They do \nnot price the U.S. out of markets. And, in any event, I have often \nwondered what good does it do if a farmer has to sell a bushel of grain \nfor 10 cents a bushel because that is the only way to export the grain? \nBy that reasoning we will drive all our farmers out of business. Taking \nthe cap off of loan rates will help farmers stay in business to produce \nthe grain we are going to need to be a reliable and adequate supplier \nfor the world market, and it will help our farmers and not just those \nwho may happen to own land.\n  Madam President, we are, right now, on the verge of losing thousands \nand thousands more farmers, mainly young farmers, a lot of them who \nhave a heavy debt load who are paying it off, trying to get a foothold \nin agriculture. They are smart. They are aggressive. They are good \nmanagers. But they are being driven out of agriculture by forces beyond \ntheir control. Now our efforts to improve the farm bill to help them \nseems blocked by an ideological devotion to every aspect of the present \nfarm bill. I don't mind. I know people have ideologies and they believe \ncertain things and they enact them into law. That is fine. It happens \nall the time. But at some point, practicality has to rule. However good \nthe so-called Freedom to Farm was for the last couple of years because \nwe had good export markets, it is not working now to address this \ncrisis. If it is not working, change it. Are we so rigid, are we so \ncast in stone that because we passed a bill a couple of years ago we \ncan't do anything about that?\n  Yes, we can. The farm bill is not the Ten Commandments. Improving it \ndoesn't require a constitutional amendment. It just requires 51 votes; \nthat is all, just 51 votes. As I said earlier, when you look at those \npoll results, when you see more than a three-to-one ratio of farmers \nsaying we ought to raise the loan rates, then you know that we ought to \nbe doing it to help them survive this crisis.\n  Madam President, over the weekend, farmers, bankers and others with \nreal knowledge of the farm economic situation told me that by next \nFebruary, March, and April, we will likely have many farmers in this \ncountry going to the banks to get their loans for planting and being \ntold by the bankers who look at their balance sheets, ``I am sorry, you \nsimply do not qualify.''\n  I also point out that we have a lot of farmers with Government-backed \nloans who are making it now; they are farming. But what is going to \nhappen next spring if they can't make it and they can't get the money \nto put in another crop? What is going to happen to all the Government-\nbacked loans that we have out to farmers?\n  Again, we have to act, and we have to act soon. We cannot wait until \nnext February, March, or April. It will be too late. The one thing I \nheard loudly and clearly this weekend in my State of Iowa was that if \nCongress doesn't do something before we adjourn, we might as well not \ndo anything at all next year. That came through loudly and clearly.\n  Another message that came through loudly and clearly is that we don't \nneed another direct payment going out in a lump sum because the benefit \nof those payments flows so heavily to landowners, and the farmer got \nprecious little.\n  I had a number of farmers tell me this weekend that some of those \nadvanced payments that we gave, or are sending out this fall, a number \nof those people getting those payments won't even be farming next \nyear--won't even be farming. So we are giving them a farm payment that \nwould have gone next year to farmers, and they are not even farming, \nbut they are going to get the payment this fall. That doesn't sound \nlike a very wise policy to me.\n  The wisest thing for us to do is what has proven to be effective and \nwhat farmers know is effective and the poll results show: Lift the caps \non marketing loan rates, extend the period to 15 months, provide the \nSecretary of Agriculture the authority to make storage payments and \nincrease the amount of indemnity payments we are going to make. The \namount we passed in July is not sufficient. Do those things, and then \nwe can really help farm families to survive, we can save our economy, \nand remain competitive in world markets.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. What is the current business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the Harkin amendment \nNo. 3580, which is a first-degree amendment to S. 2237, the Interior \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 1999.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you. Madam President, I am going to speak a few \nminutes on the amendment and, in particular, on the farmers' and \nranchers' situation.\n  Madam President, almost all of us have farmers and ranchers in our \nareas. Certainly in Wyoming, agriculture is one of the three economic \ninterests that we have, most of us do, so all of us are concerned about \nagriculture. And we are in a time when agriculture needs, indeed, are \nour concern, and more than our concern, it needs some action. Many of \nus have been working for some time to find some areas in which \nagriculture can be strengthened, in which agriculture can be helped and \nassisted through a very hard time.\n  I have listened this afternoon to several Senators representing their \nconstituents and talking about agriculture. Each of them has \nrepresented a point of view, and that is basically to seek to return to \nthe farm program time, and that is the issue here. I don't think there \nwill be a soul in this place who doesn't want to assist agriculture. \nThere won't be anyone in this Senate who doesn't think we ought to do \nsomething to strengthen this segment of our economy, but there is a \ndivision of view as to whether we seek to do some things to help make \nthe transition from agriculture, as we have known it over the years--\nwith acreage limitations, with farm subsidies and those kinds of \nthings--to a market enterprise which we are now seeking to do.\n  Our real challenge is to assist in continuing to move toward market \nagriculture which, at least in the State I represent, is the \npredominant view. People know that long-term agriculture will be \nstronger. Agriculture will be better. Our production will be more \nefficient in a market economy. What we are really talking about is how \ncan we best do this, how can we best help agriculture, how can we best \npull through this kind of a situation, and at the same time continue to \nhelp agriculture move to a market economy.\n  Some have spoken about their contacts over the last week and, indeed, \nover the last month. I spent August in Wyoming talking with farmers and \nranchers about it. Interestingly enough, we have three economic areas, \nbasically, in my State: One is agriculture; one is mineral extraction; \nand one is visitation and tourism. Frankly, agriculture and minerals \nare both in tough shape. Oil, for example, is the cheapest it has been \nin history, I think. So we do have some concerns.\n  Let me talk to you about some of the things that agricultural \nproducers said to me in terms of long-term recommendations.\n  One is consumer demand. For instance, in the beef industry, we need \nto strengthen consumer demand. Certainly what has happened in Asia has \nan impact on agriculture, particularly on exports. Some 40 percent of \nagricultural production goes into exports.\n\n  Meat labeling, which we are moving toward doing--we need meat \nlabeling so we know the origin of meat, whether it is imported, whether \nit is domestic, so buyers can make a choice.\n  In my State, we have other kinds of things. Fifty percent of our \nState belongs to the Federal Government and is\n\n[[Page S10299]]\n\nFederal lands. We have a good deal of problems with animal damage \ncontrol, with predators and these kinds of things. These are also some \nof the issues.\n  The idea that you simply try to go back to a controlled farming \nprogram is not a solution to all of agriculture. I understand the \nSenator from Iowa is concerned about the basic crops--wheat and corn \nand grains. That is a farm program kind of a thing.\n  The agricultural problem is not confined only to those commodities. I \nam told, with the market, in rural areas, they are talking about fast \ntrack, for example, doing something about increasing markets in South \nAmerica, doing something about increasing markets in Asia to strengthen \naccess, increase consumer demand. These are the things that were told \nto me by agriculturists who want to do things that will be of long-term \nbenefit.\n  We need to talk about control programs for grasshoppers. We haven't \ndone as well. We are not funding the Grasshopper Control Program as we \ndid. Those are things having an impact on agriculture, not simply going \nback to a program that we had before to increase the loan rate. That is \na remedy, but that is certainly not the only remedy and, indeed, \nprobably not the best remedy.\n  We need to be doing some things now and, indeed, we are. We need to \ncontinue to do that. The $5.5 billion in transition payments and \naccelerated payments that have been made to farm producers designed to \nhelp make the transition from a controlled Government farm program to a \nmarket program, that is what is expected; that is what is being done. \nWe will do something, hopefully, about fast-track negotiations which \nare being held up, as you know.\n  The Crop Insurance Program is one that needs to be changed. Crop \ninsurance is based on last year's production, last year's crop. If you \ndidn't have a crop last year because of the drought, or whatever, then \nyour crop insurance is virtually of no value.\n  We need to do something about tax legislation. We need capital gains \nrelief in agriculture. Probably of any industry, the people who are in \nagriculture have more money invested in their facilities for the amount \nof cash flow of any industry.\n  There are farm savings accounts and income averaging which we passed \nand need to make permanent. Agriculture is traditionally profitable one \nyear, less profitable another year. There needs to be income averaging.\n  They need 100 percent deductibility of self-employed health care, \nwhich is one of the things that farmers and ranchers need to put them \non an even par with others.\n  These are the kinds of things that we are, indeed, talking about \ndoing and, indeed, must do in order to allow this transition to take \nplace.\n  There has been talk about a program for an increased conservation \nreserve, which would cost, I suppose, $2.5 billion to actually take \nsome of the production out of production and put into a conservation \narea so that we can have impact on the prices. We can do this.\n  These are the things that are underway now, as a matter of fact, and \nhave been for some time. Some of them were passed before we left in \nAugust. And we should continue to do that.\n\n  So I think everyone here takes seriously the difficulties that we are \nhaving in agriculture. Everyone here knows that we need to do some \nthings to keep agriculturists in business, to help level out income \nover years when it is up and down--as it traditionally is--to do \nsomething about crop insurance so that when you are put up to the \nvagaries of weather and those kinds of things that there is some kind \nof an income support that you can depend on, but one that is part of \nthe market, the market system.\n  We surely need to go back to the beginning to open more foreign \nmarkets so we can do that. We have to do something about unilateral \nsanctions, which we already did at least partially. And you remember in \nPakistan when they fired off the nuclear thing, immediately sanctions \nwent on, the fact that we could not sell agricultural products there. \nThat has been changed and, indeed, should be changed so we have that \nmarket available.\n  So these are the kinds of things. I hope that we take a look at what \nreally helps farmers and ranchers make a transition into the \nmarketplace, in which I believe strongly. Frankly, the people in my \nState who I talk to believe also the best long-term direction for both \nagriculture and producers, and for consumers, is to have a market \ndemand so that the production is, indeed, for the market, that \nproduction is not simply for some kind of a loan in which it goes into \nstorage and becomes an obligation of the Federal Government. We have \nbeen through that. We have been through that program.\n  I happen to have been in agriculture almost all my life. My first job \nwhen I got out of the Marine Corps was with the Farm Bureau. I worked \nwith the Farm Bureau for a very long time at the local level, the \nAmerican Farm Bureau.\n  I just came back from my home college, the University of Wyoming, \nwhere we had Agriculture Appreciation Weekend this weekend. This is an \narea about which I feel very strongly. I hope that we make some moves \nbefore we leave, as the Senator from Iowa said. We should do that.\n  We have begun. We started a number of things that need to be \ncontinued now. We need to do more short-term things that will have \nimpact this year, but also the long-term kinds of changes that allow \nthis transition to take place, that allow farmers to produce for the \nmarket, that allow consumers to have a choice as to what it is they \nbuy, that farmers are not dependent upon the Federal Government \npaycheck but indeed produce the kinds of things in the market, that we \ncan increase these markets. We have the most efficient agriculture in \nthe world, and there is a great deal of market available there as the \nworld changes.\n  Let me say, again, that there is no question, I do not think among \nall of us, there needs to be something done. The real question is, What \ndo we do? It is a philosophical question to a large extent, not whether \nyou help but how in fact you do it, how in fact that help will impact \nover a period of time as we make the transition to a marketplace.\n  Madam President, I hope that we continue to talk about this. And I am \nsure we will.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to address the farm crisis, and \nit is indeed a farm crisis. Prices are at historic lows for many \ncommodities. That fact has received much of the attention.\n  Well, in North Carolina, that is just a part of the problem. My \ntobacco farmers also faced a direct attack on our billion-dollar \ntobacco crop from the White House. Further, my tobacco farmers were hit \nwith a 17% quota cut last year, so they're facing dire times.\n  The Daschle amendment is not the answer for them. Really, it is not \nthe answer for most farmers, it just doesn't address the root issues. \nIt will not help in the short term. It will not help in the long term.\n  The Daschle amendment ignores the tobacco farmers. North Carolina \ntobacco farmers face the effects of drought--and hurricanes--but this \namendment fails to address their problems. In fact, it's just not \ngeared for the Southeastern farmers, but for the Midwest and West.\n  My tobacco farmers can't boost their exports to relieve their crisis \nnot because there is no foreign market, but because it is government \npolicy to prohibit efforts to help them build export markets. All the \nother commodities are on the table at the trade negotiations, but it is \nofficial policy to ignore tens of thousands of tobacco farmers. That is \nwrong.\n  We need a farm assistance plan that includes all farmers and that \ndoes not ignore North Carolinians.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I rise to oppose the amendment offered by \nthe distinguished ranking member of the Agriculture Committee. I \nappreciate his sincerity, scholarship, research, and his passion, but \nthe solution that he offers, in my judgment, is the wrong one.\n  Republicans and Democrats are concerned about the financial stress in \nthe farm sector. It is substantial. We have\n\n[[Page S10300]]\n\nworked together on many initiatives aimed at strengthening the long-run \nhealth of our farm and ranch economy. There is, unfortunately, no \nsingle magic bullet that will make all of our farmers prosperous. But \nseveral constructive steps have been taken. I will explain later why \nraising loan rate caps would be unwise, but first it is appropriate to \nmention a few of the constructive steps that farm organizations have \nsuggested would help American agriculture.\n  Nearly all farm groups strongly support giving the President fast-\ntrack negotiating authority. The Senate Finance Committee has reported, \nin fact, a comprehensive trade bill containing a renewal of fast track. \nThe majority leader, Senator Lott, intends that the Senate act upon \nthat bill in this session. Our House colleagues have also pledged to \nact on fast-track legislation.\n  Madam President, I start with that point because, very clearly, we \nmust give the President fast-track authority. By that I mean the \nability to submit to the Senate, on an up-or-down basis, a trade treaty \nnegotiated with others, and in the case of the World Trade Organization \nnegotiations next year, over 100 countries. If there is not the ability \nto deal with that legislation or that treaty on an up-or-down basis--\nand the normal course of the Senate would be to offer amendments--then \nother nations will feel free to offer amendments and the negotiations \nwill founder.\n  Madam President, I mention fast-track authority, and so do most farm \ngroups, first because the export side of our farm business is the \ngrowth side. As a matter of fact, in recent years most Americans must \nrealize that about a third of all we produce on our farms has been \nexported. That is a very large part of demand.\n  The current crisis on the farm is of two origins. One is bad weather \nin some sections of our country and, in some cases, bad weather for \nseveral years running. As we have heard testimony from the \ndistinguished Senators from South Dakota and North Dakota, parts of \ntheir States have reported conditions impossible for 4 years to get a \ncrop. We have noticed very considerable drought this year in Texas, in \nOklahoma, and in Georgia. And the Senate has acted appropriately.\n  When the appropriations bill came before the Senate, the agriculture \nappropriations bill--and it was managed very adroitly by the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi, Senator Cochran--$500 million \nof so-called indemnity payments were set aside, and that amount of \nmoney is in a conference between the House and the Senate now. The \nthrust of the indemnity payments was to recognize that although we are \ninexact in knowing exactly what damages should be assessed, there has \nbeen a great deal of pain and a formula must be worked out. That would \nbe helpful to those farmers in those States and those regions that have \nhad extraordinarily bad luck from the weather.\n  Farming is always a situation of potential bad luck from the weather. \nNo farm in this country is immune from those natural difficulties. That \nis a part of the excitement, risk, and the reward situation. \nNevertheless, the Senate reacted appropriately, in my judgment, and now \nin conference a discussion about a half billion dollars of indemnity \npayments is proceeding.\n  The other reason that a farm crisis has occurred is that the \nMalaysian economy, the Thai economy, the South Korean economy, and the \nIndonesian economy all went into disastrous tailspins for a variety of \nreasons. But whatever may have been the reasons, agricultural demand \ncoming from our Asian customers stopped cold. Our best estimates are \nthat about one-third of our exports to Asia, which we would have \ncounted on this year--there is a very strong trend showing year by year \ngains, and as Asian citizens have had more income and have tried to \nupgrade their diets, they have become very good customers of farmers in \nthis country.\n  In any event, about a third of that demand is gone, and a third of \nall of our exports were headed to Asia. That means that roughly 10 \npercent of the entire demand for agricultural products in this country \nhas vanished--vanished literally overnight. That has had a devastating \nimpact, obviously, when demand heads into the tank at a time in which \nsupply is huge. The supply of our corn crop, for example, is now going \nto be perhaps the second largest crop in the history of the country, \nand the soybean crop is the largest ever. Wheat farmers have already \nbeen heard from, and their pain has been felt. That registers both in \nthe indemnity payment situation as well as a number of steps that the \nSenate and House have taken, including, as you will recall, an \nextraordinary debate on the Glenn amendment on Pakistan and India. The \nGlenn amendment required sanctions on both of those countries after \nthey both tested nuclear weapons. But the Senate and the House voted \nrapidly to exempt Pakistan from that situation with regard to wheat so \nthat an auction going on in Pakistan could continue, and, as a matter \nof fact, Pakistan bought, apparently, about 100 thousand metric tons \nbushels of wheat from the United States due to that extraordinary \naction. We had been conscious of the lack of demand for wheat and we \nare conscious of that lack of demand for corn and for soybeans.\n\n  As the distinguished Senator from Wyoming who preceded me on the \nfloor pointed out, American agriculture is not entirely grain. It is \nnot entirely vegetables or fruits. It includes livestock. Of course, \none of the interesting aspects of agriculture is that as we dwell upon \nthe price of feed grains, it has the worst effect on the cost of \nraising cattle or raising hogs. There are many farmers who have \nproductions that include both livestock and grain. Many do so \ndeliberately so that they have hedges either way.\n  But, in any event, in the totality of American agriculture, the \nimportant point this year is weather and Asia. Worse still is that the \nAsian situation was not contained there. The Asian problems may have \nbeen precipitated or extended by the fact that the world appears to be \nin the throes of a deflationary spiral, not only for agricultural \ncommodities, but also for metals, minerals and for oil. All of these \nsituations have been in what could be called a deflationary mode. The \nworld has not seen this type of phenomenon for a half a century.\n  It is not clear who the winners and losers are from deflation. There \nare many of us anecdotically going to a filling station to fill up a \ntank who rejoice in the fact that sometimes you can buy a gallon of \ngasoline for less than $1 these days. There is not a great hue and cry \non the part of the public to raise the price of gasoline to $1.20 or \n$1.50. As a matter of fact, we pocket the change without commenting and \nare simply pleased that some nice things come along in life \nunexpectedly.\n  But, if you were in fact a Nigerian, a Venezuelan, or even a Russian, \nand you saw that a large portion of the income of your country comes \nfrom oil and that income has gone down precipitously, or if you were \nany country in the world that gained most of its hard currency and \nexport from mineral extraction, you would find a first-class recession \non your hands. That has compounded the problem, obviously, for many of \nthe Asian countries, as well as the increasing number of difficulties \nin our own hemisphere. It is not clear, Madam President, where the \nfallout will end with regard to so-called developing countries and \nothers that have currency crises. But each of these weaken export \ndemand from the United States for agricultural products and \nincreasingly for other manufactured products as well. We need to \nrecognize that.\n  There are speeches every year about shortfalls in prices. Some of \nthese shortfalls occur every year as we approach our harvest and the \nmarket tries to sort out where the lows are going to be and a certain \namount of speculation occurs. This time the real fear is that, given \nthe harvest woes, the bounce back may not be very substantial if there \nis not somewhere the prospect that we are going to have sales.\n  I noted in the Wall Street Journal last Friday, at least that day--\ncorn went down and beans went down. The problem pointed to by traders \nwas that the export markets still looked weak. The article commented \nthat wheat prospects looked somewhat better in the export markets--but \nnot for corn and not for beans. That is a problem with which we are \ngoing to have to deal. That is why, Madam President, I pointed out that \nin the World Trade\n\n[[Page S10301]]\n\nOrganization meeting next year we must have fast-track authority. It is \nessential if we are to expand substantially our export markets, which \nwe must do if demand is to increase and if prices are to go up.\n  Let me point out that farm groups also strongly support International \nMonetary Fund funding and reform. They know that we have to deal with \nthe Asian demand, the potential for declining demand in Latin America, \nand restoring IMF funding.\n  Madam President, the debates upon IMF have been hot and heavy on this \nfloor, and in the committees. That has been true in the other body. \nClearly, a number of Senators pointed out that the IMF may not have \ngiven the best prescriptions for a healthy return in Malaysia, \nThailand, Indonesia, and Korea; that the IMF is far too opaque in terms \nof its deals; needs to be less secretive; that in fact prescriptions of \nraising taxes and lowering spending do not always work in economies and \nmay not have been a realistic solution for Russia during the several \ntimes IMF money was given to that country. So, as a result, the \nCongress has not decided yet IMF funding. But, as I have pointed out, \nit is a very crucial situation. As a matter of fact, it is essential \nthat we act in that area as well as the fast-track authority--two votes \nwhich leadership has promised.\n  Agricultural groups want to maintain the viability of crop insurance \nand to improve it. In the debate today, considerable attention has been \ngiven to one of the failings of crop insurance. This failing is that \nshould crop failure occur for several years, the producer's acreage \nproduction history falls, and his insurance premiums increase. We will \nhave to reform crop insurance. But I would simply point out that there \nare a good number of debates, depending upon the standpoint of the \nobservers, as to how that is to be done.\n  For example, should there be a national premium for all farmers in \nall States and all locations regardless of risk that might be involved? \nOr should there be a premium based upon risk; upon the actuarial \nfigures that show the history of a particular region or a particular \ncrop? What should be the exposure of the taxpayers to the support of \nthe insurance companies? We will need to face those problems of \nmulticrop failures and actuarial soundness.\n  There is currently a subsidy to the companies so that crop insurance \nwill be provided universally, and, yet, there will be debates among \nSenators who are not in the agriculture business as to why this \nparticular type of insurance is subsidized. But this year the Senate \nand the House--and the President by signing legislation as an amendment \nto the agricultural research bill--went a long way to stabilizing the \nsituation for the next 5 years so that farmers would have a pretty good \nidea of the lay of the land, and so would the insurance providers. That \nwas critically important.\n  Madam President, part of our debate today on how agriculture is to be \nstrengthened in the country was addressed in legislation that the \nSenate and the House passed and the President signed. We went a long \nway in the same legislation by providing specifically for agricultural \nresearch of all sorts, including pure research on those breakthroughs \nthat we need to have if American agriculture is to be the most \nefficient, to be the lowest cost, and to be in a position to feed the \nworld.\n  I look forward in the Agriculture Committee to substantial hearings \nand efforts by all parties as we progress into the next session. But \nfor now, we have most farmers in this country covered with some degree \nof crop insurance. The amount of coverage was the choice of the farmer. \nI would say from my own experience that I had to make choices with \nregard to coverage of my corn and soybean crops this year. I could take \na chance by having no insurance. That really has been my policy for \ndecades. Or I could assume that perhaps El Nino would not work out so \nwell, or El Nino would come behind it, or there would be other \ndifficulties. I had better be prudent, be certain that I cover certain \nacres, and guarantee a certain price or outcome. Premiums differ \naccording to the amount of risk that is acceptable. That is what most \nprudent business people do, in agriculture, outside of agriculture, \nanywhere.\n\n  Madam President, a number of farmers in the country apparently were \nnot prudent and did not purchase adequate crop insurance coverage. \nMaybe they did not adequately understand the program, which means we \nhave a large education job to do. But in any event, crop insurance \nreform is of the essence. That ought to be a part of our agenda. We \nhave acted to mitigate the effects of economic sanctions on \nagriculture.\n  Madam President, I wish that the Senate had passed the sanction \nreform legislation, S. 1413, which I offered as an amendment to the \nagriculture appropriations bill. I believe that would have been a very \nconstructive and hopeful step not only for agriculture but for all of \nAmerican exporters. I have suggested in that legislation--which is \nstill alive and hopefully will be reconsidered this year or next year--\nthat there ought to be a systematic way in which our country considers \neconomic sanctions. The President or the Congress ought to state what \nwe are attempting to achieve, what the benchmarks will be for success, \nand what the costs will be of the sanctions to Americans and to \nAmerican businesses, in terms of their effect on incomes and jobs. \nFinally, we ought to review sanctions each year. After 2 years they \nought to be sunsetted unless the President or Congress specifically \ndecides that a particular sanction is making a difference in our \nforeign policy.\n  I proposed this prospectively--that is, for the future--as opposed to \nrevisiting the sanctions of the past, although many Senators have \noffered bills that touch upon the past or offered sanction waivers to \nthe President. Unhappily, my bill got caught up, in a way, in the \nproblems we have had during the appropriations season. There is not \nmuch time and there is much work to do.\n  But in any event, others have proposed sanction reform legislation. I \nhave supported a number of those attempts because they take away \nroadblocks to exporting, and exporting addresses demand and increases \nprice. Those who have talked eloquently today about price and income \nneed to talk about exports, fast-track authority, and sanctions reform \nas opposed to policy options to store and overhang supplies for the \nfuture.\n  Let me point out, Madam President, that with regard to food there is \na special case to be made against sanctions. I have supported such \nlegislation, and I have supported the thought that we ought not to have \neconomic sanctions on food, and that it is an inhumane policy. It is \nnot an effective policy with regard to our foreign policy, and \nresolving sanctions on food would be of great help to American \nagriculture and American farmers.\n  We acted with corresponding dispatch in this body, as we did on the \nwheat sales to Pakistan, by speeding up the 1999 AMTA payments, the \nFreedom to Farm payments to farmers. This is a very large sum of cash. \nAMTA payments are made twice. The final 1998 payment for farmers will \nbe made before the end of the fiscal year.\n  But we suggested that beginning October 1, 1999, farmers all over \nAmerica who need increased cash flow--and we have heard much discussion \nof that today--could apply for the total AMTA payment for fiscal year \n1999. Whether due to an emergency because of weather or because of the \ncatastrophe in Asia, the cash flow could occur without taking out a \nloan; it is simply cash that the farmer in the program was guaranteed \nin the farm bill:\n\n       But in any event, we decided to make that whole sum of \n     about $5.5 billion available, and available promptly, as soon \n     after October 1 as the U.S. Department of Agriculture could \n     work out the administrative details, possibly by October 15.\n\n  This, I think, is an important point about the current farm bill. It \nhas been suggested--I hope facetiously--by some today that it was the \n``Freedom to Fail'' bill as opposed to Freedom to Farm, but most people \nwould say when it comes to the AMTA payments, they like it. They like \nthe thought that for 7 years, if you are in the program, you get a \npayment, divorced entirely from supply and demand, from the Asian \neconomic crisis, from anything else as a matter of fact. It is a so-\ncalled transition from the farm bills of supply control of the past to \nthe market-oriented programs that we have now.\n  Let me just say finally that the Senate, while approving $500 million \nin disaster aid as a placeholder for conference, it was understood that \nthere\n\n[[Page S10302]]\n\nmay be additional monetary demands placed on the conference. I am not \nadvocating that the sum be increased, but I am acknowledging that \nSenators from around the country have realized there has been further \ncrop losses and plummeting prices. This legislation that is going to \npass as a conference report, and hopefully will be signed by the \nPresident.\n  Let me point out, Madam President, that in addition to these very \nsubstantial ways of bringing money to farmers and new and enhanced \ndemand, many of us have supported Senator Grassley's farm and ranch \nrisk management proposal and we will work diligently to encourage its \ninclusion in any new tax legislation this year.\n  I was very pleased to note in the Wall Street Journal today that \nCongressman Archer, the distinguished chairman of the House Ways and \nMeans Committee, as he initiates $80 billion of tax cuts, has created \nan accelerated estate tax exclusion. The $1 million exclusion would \ncommence January 1, 1999.\n  In the hearings we have had before the Senate Ag Committee, there \nhave been two items that real live farmers said we need, we want. One \nis estate tax relief because it means the family farm really does have \nsome possibility of remaining a family farm as opposed to confiscatory \ntaxes intruding into an estate which is very heavy in real estate, \nland, livestock, buildings, and often very low in cash. So this is a \ncritical item if you are a family farmer, and I am. This is critical, \nat least as I take a look at it, from the perspective of all the people \nI know in Indiana who are involved in family farming. This is real \nchange in the economic aspects for this year and for many years for the \ncontinuity of farm life as we know it. So that is an important item.\n  The second thing people came in to say is, year by year, the most \nimportant thing you could do for us is to give us 100 percent \ndeductibility of our health payments. For the average family farmer \nfarming, say, 500 acres or so in Indiana, that often is an additional \n$4,000 or $5,000 added to the bottom line. That is a big piece of \nchange.\n  The price effects changes that would come from removing the cap on \nthe loan rate amount to about a 15-cent change, a 15-cent change in the \nprice of a bushel of corn. It takes a lot of additional bushels to add \nup to $5,000 in the bottom line. A learned study just performed by the \nFood Agriculture and Policy Research Institute, and commissioned by the \ndistinguished ranking member, Senator Harkin, determined this.\n  Congressman Archer is proposing in this bill that we go to 100-\npercent exemption promptly. That would be true for all Americans, and \nthat is true of the estate tax situation. These are not proposals that \nare made specifically for farmers.\n  I make that point because, although, quite properly, we are concerned \nwith agricultural America, Senators have other people in their States \nin addition to farmers. In fact, some States hardly have very many \nfarmers at all. What we are talking about, for example, in raising the \nloan caps is what the Congressional Budget Office now has estimated as \na $5 billion new expenditure. That means that $5 billion would go from \nall the other taxpayers of the United States to some specific taxpayers \nwho are essentially grain farmers. Few Americans may understand that \ntransaction, that we have today been debating whether to give up $5 \nbillion to grain farmers. But that is a huge transfer of income to a \nsmall group.\n  What I think is more constructive is a proposal such as that of the \ndistinguished chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee in which \nhe said estate taxes apply to all, including farmers. Farmers are 16 \ntimes more likely to pay estate taxes, for example, than other people. \nBut this legislation is not limited to farmers or grain farmers. It is \nfor all of us, and is true of the deductibility of those who pay their \nmedical payments as individual persons.\n  I think it is, likewise, important to point out that Congressman \nArcher was quite specific on one of his proposals. He suggested that a \nprovision retroactive to January 1, 1998--that is the beginning of this \nyear--would expand to 5 years from 2, the number of tax years farmers \ncan carry back losses.\n  That would be very helpful. A number of us have been talking about \nincome averaging. This really goes at it aggressively, a carry back to \n5 years. The Outlook, the publication of the USDA, points out that the \nlast 5 years have been pretty good ones for agricultural America. This \nyear is a downer with the weather and the Asia problems, but this has \nnot always been the case. I can testify from my own farm that the last \n5 years have been very, very healthy years. And farmers all over \nAmerica have repaid debt. And businesses that thrive at the crossroads \nhave thrived with that type of farm income.\n  Let me point out the FAIR Act, the Freedom to Farm Act, did not \nabolish price support loans. I think that is important to point out. In \nfairness, several Senators have pointed that out. They have said that \nthere is a marketing loan in the farm bill. They disagree with the rate \nof that loan, or the price that is to be allowed--$1.89 for corn, for \nexample, and would like for that to be over $2.20.\n  But let me just take an example, once again, from my own operations. \nI ask the patience of the Senate with regard to that because I do not \nbelieve there are many Senators here today who are in farming. There \nmay be a few. I know the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Senator \nGrassley, has long been involved with his family farm that I visited in \nIowa. But there are not many. I am one of them, and today, Providence \nwilling, soybeans will be shipped from harvest on my farm into the \nlocal elevator in Indianapolis. We will receive the marketing \nassistance loan at the rate of $5.26, which is being quoted today.\n  I sold beans at an average pretty close to $6.75 to $6.80 over the \nlast year. So $5.26 is well off of that. One could say it is 20 \npercent, maybe more, maybe less. But I am happy to report that the \nyield per acre on the Lugar farm on beans looks to me to be way up. I \nthink that is probably important, too. As a matter of fact, the cost \nper bushel will be down if the number of beans coming up is up.\n  We have heard suggestions today that you have almost an immutable \ncost out there. It simply cannot be met by these loan deficiency \npayments or marketing assistance loans. But I point out, volume still \ncounts. And volume we have this year--a record soybean crop in America. \nNot just on our farm, that specific location, but all over America; \nunparalleled number of bushels of beans, maybe only the second in \nhistory in terms of corn.\n  So before all the dire predictions are visited, one has to take a \nlook at some actual situations, some actual farmers who have some beans \nand have some corn. I point out the Freedom to Farm Act has not gotten \ninto the loan deficiency payment until this year, and it is because low \nprices have kicked it in. But it would appear that this is going to be \nan additional $2 or $3 billion for grain farmers this year.\n  I pointed out earlier that over $5 billion is kicking in early in the \nAMTA payments for cash flow purposes, an additional $2 or $3 billion in \nthis LDP program, and at least $500 million in an indemnity payment in \nregard to the weather. The taxpayers of this country have not been \ngrudging when it has come to trying to meet agricultural pain and \ndifficulty this year. As a matter of fact they have been very generous. \nAnd farmers are saying we do not really want charity, we want sales, we \nwant marketing, we want exports. Give us at least those tools in fast-\ntrack authority in the IMF, in various other facilities. Give us \ntaxation changes so as individuals who have to pay our own health \ninsurance, we get the benefit of the deduction which in some strange \nway has been denied us. That is not the case in the industrial sector. \nGive us tax relief in terms of carry-back provisions so we can average \nout over the good years, and save the taxes. Give us estate tax relief.\n  Let me just point out, we are not going to see, in my judgment, an \nend to the Asian crisis, the Russian crisis, or others, overnight. But \nwe can exacerbate the problem inadvertently by doing the wrong thing. \nHigher loan rates have instant appeal--and I think that is obvious from \nthe argumentation given here earlier today. But history shows they have \nlong-term effects that are undesirable. A higher loan rate inevitably \nstimulates more production than the market can absorb.\n\n[[Page S10303]]\n\n  That is a very big point, Madam President, because, as a matter of \nfact, lower prices currently are very likely to send exactly different \nsignals; namely, do not plant as much of those things in which you do \nnot do well. There will be marginal changes. There are some farm \noperations geared up to plant a particular crop every year come hell or \nhigh water. There is no need for market signals, that is what the farm \ndoes. The question is, Can you lower costs so that you become \nprofitable and efficient over the years? Most farmers have lowered \ncosts. That is why we are the lowest cost producers in the world and \nwhy we are bound to be good when we export.\n  But at the same time, the higher loan rate, by stimulating more \nproduction, will lead to a surplus and, thus, lower prices in the \nfuture, not higher prices. This amendment is clearly a short-term \nstimulus. If the projections of a $5 billion cost for taking off the \nloan cap is correct, $5 billion is going fairly immediately from some \ntaxpayers in America to grain farmers, essentially. That will increase \nthe income but, Madam President, the following year, the income comes \ndown.\n  Let me point out that a study that was completed for my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Harkin, points this out. Senator Harkin approached \nwell-known researchers at the Food and Agricultural Policy Research \nInstitute. They pointed out, as we might anticipate, that if, in fact, \nthe amendment before us were to be adopted, the average price of corn \nfor the current year, 1998-1999, would increase 10 cents a bushel. That \nwould be the average increase for that corn this year--10 cents. Wheat \nprices would increase 15 cents and soybean prices 6 cents.\n  But, unfortunately, they point out that the aftermath also indicates \nthat in the following year, prices go down. Corn prices go down by 6 \ncents and wheat prices go down by 10 cents below the baseline. Soybean \nprices, would be relatively flat, they say. Essentially, they evaluate \nthe immediate income surge at about $4.56 billion, pretty close to the \n$5 billion estimated by CBO.\n  They point out the obvious: if you have $5 billion injected into this \nsituation averaged over 2 or 3 years, you still have more money than \nyou had when the $5 billion went in. But they point out that absent a \nconstant stream of this kind of activity--that is unleashing the caps, \nwith continual injections of cash--that prices come down and so does \noverall income.\n  (Mr. ROBERTS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. LUGAR. That, Mr. President, is the basic problem with the \namendment that has been offered by the distinguished Senator from Iowa. \nI simply point out that the basic and largest farm organizations in \nAmerica have spotted this and they wrote to me on September 11. The \norganizations that have written and signed this letter are: American \nFarm Bureau Federation, American Sheep Industry Association, National \nBroiler Council, National Cattlemen's Beef Association, National Pork \nProducers Council and the National Turkey Federation--very sizable \ngroups, covering general agriculture, as well as specific livestock and \npoultry situations.\n  They say:\n\n       Dear Chairman Lugar: As the largest market for feed grains \n     and soybean meal, the livestock and poultry producers are \n     concerned over the debate to change the farm program's non-\n     recourse loan rate structure. While we empathize with the \n     market situation faced by feed grain farmers, we urge you to \n     consider the very serious potential impact that changes in \n     loan rates could have on all users of feed grains. With the \n     export market being so vitally important to American \n     agriculture, it is necessary to ensure that changes in \n     government policy not put animal agriculture at a competitive \n     disadvantage.\n       Historically, non-recourse loan rates that do not reflect \n     market conditions have proven to affect producers' marketing \n     decisions, which in turn have led to government surpluses \n     that negatively pressure market price recovery. At a time \n     when all of agriculture is facing depressed marketing \n     conditions and export losses, we respectfully request that \n     the Committee examine alternative policy initiatives to \n     address low price conditions and help restore profitability \n     to farmers and livestock and poultry producers.\n\n  I make that letter available, Mr. President, and ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               September 11, 1998.\n     Hon. Richard Lugar,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and \n         Forestry, Senate Russell 328, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Lugar: As the largest market for feed grains \n     and soybean meal, the livestock and poultry producers are \n     concerned over the debate to change the farm program's non-\n     recourse loan rate structure.

We look \n     forward to working with you and the Committee on these \n     matters.\n           Sincerely,\n     American Farm Bureau Federation.\n     American Sheep Industry Association.\n     National Broiler Council.\n     National Cattlemen's Beef Association.\n     National Pork Producers Council.\n     National Turkey Federation.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, these agencies, including the American Farm \nBureau and the sheep, broiler, beef and pork producers have made the \nessential point with regard to the removing of the cap on the marketing \nloans. Inevitably, the signals go out and the supplies increase. Even \nunder the marketing loan concept, in which it is unlikely that there \nwill be the buildup of forfeitures and the buildup of governmental \nstorage that characterized previous situations, there still is a glut \non the market. The surplus does not disappear.\n  Price signals were out there for a purpose. They indicated who wanted \nto utilize the commodity, who could utilize the commodity. Tragically, \nin this country, we are utilizing commodities about as well as we are \ngoing to. The up-side potential that we talked about today on the \nexport side is the difference. That is where the thrust has to occur. \nTo have a domestic transfer of income simply hides the problem; it \ndoesn't market the commodities. The costs do not decrease for farmers \nin the field, although much that we have done this year in terms of our \nresearch bill might assist people in bringing about lower costs.\n  I commend all of my colleagues who have spoken to this issue today \nfor their concern. They have spoken with sincerity. They are advocates \nof producers in their States and of American agriculture generally. \nMany are Members of the Senate Committee on Agriculture and participate \nregularly in trying to think along with the majority and minority how \nwe can deal with these problems.\n  But, Mr. President, we have debated, as was pointed out earlier by \nvarious Senators, this issue on at least a couple of occasions. On one \noccasion, the distinguished Senator from Montana, who is on the floor \nnow, discussed a lengthening of payment of the loan rate. He did not \npress for a vote on that occasion. But then on the appropriations bill, \nan amendment was offered by the distinguished minority leader of the \nSenate, Senator Daschle, that had very similar characteristics with \nregard to the caps on the loan rate. The Senate voted 56 to 43 after \nextensive debate that took, as I recall, the better part of 4 hours on \nthat occasion.\n  We have revisited the issue for another 4 hours this afternoon, and \nit is probably worthy of considerably more attention. I suspect the \nproblem is that the Senate is also attempting to deal with the Interior \nappropriations bill in addition to problems of agriculture.\n  It will not be a good idea to adopt this amendment. I have listened \ncarefully to others who have spoken. But\n\n[[Page S10304]]\n\nwe ought to defeat this amendment. Therefore, Mr. President, I commend \nmy colleagues for their sincerity, but after a consultation with and on \nbehalf of the majority leader I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. The vote, I understand, Mr. President, will occur after \nthe first vote that is now set for 5:30; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/14/senate-section/article/S10283-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10304-S10309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRUTH IN EMPLOYMENT ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 5 p.m. \nhaving arrived, there will now be 30 minutes for debate equally divided \nin relation to S. 1981. The Senators from Arkansas and Massachusetts \ncontrol the time.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I think we have before us a bill that is very important and well \nworth the time that we have taken debating it on the floor of the \nSenate today. This bill deals with the unconscionable practice of some \nlabor unions today to send paid salts or unpaid salts into a business \nunder the guise of working for that employer but when the real intent \nis to wreak economic damage and ultimately bring a business and \nemployer to his or her knees.\n  Salting is the calculated practice of placing trained union agents in \na nonunion workplace whose primary purpose is to harass, disrupt \ncompany operations, apply economic pressure, increase operating and \nlegal costs, and ultimately put the company out of business.\n  Mr. President, the Truth in Employment Act simply inserts a provision \nin the NLRA freeing an employer from the requirement of employing ``. . \n. any person who is not a bona fide employee applicant, in that such \nperson seeks or has sought employment with the employer with the \nprimary purpose of furthering another employment or agency status.'' In \nother words, an employer is not required to hire an employee whose \nprimary--primary purpose--I emphasize, whose primary purpose in \napplying for a job is not to work and benefit the company.\n  Participation in union activities or an in-house employee organizing \ncommittee would not constitute employment or agency status. It simply \nallows employers to not hire overt salts and to give employers recourse \nagainst covert salts--those who would come in surreptitiously.\n  The bill also specifically protects the rights of bona fide employees \nto self-organization, labor organization membership, and collective \nbargaining.\n  Let me just take a moment to emphasize what this bill will not do, \nbecause it has been so grossly mischaracterized by those who want to \nsee this practice continue in the American workplace.\n  No. 1, it does not undermine legitimate rights or protections. \nEmployers will gain no ability to discriminate against union membership \nand activities or activities, or activities in other organizations. It \nonly seeks to stop the destructive practice of salting; that is all.\n  No. 2, it does not prevent union organizing or other types of \norganizing, such as women advocacy groups or a day-care program in the \nworkplace. It does not prevent women and minorities from advocating \ntheir rights. It does not change the definition of ``an employee'' and \nwhat an employee is.\n  It does not overturn the decisions of the Supreme Court. It does not \noverturn the decision of Town & Country Electric, Inc., which stated \nthat paid union organizers can fall within the literal, statutory \ndefinition of ``employees.''\n  It does not create a system of blacklists. And it does not promote \nmind reading or mind control, as some of my colleagues would suggest.\n  Salting is not a product of my imagination, it is a very great \nreality in the workplace today.\n  Jack Allen, previously of Thomasville, GA, provided an account of his \nexperiences to Representative Allen Boyd of Florida, where he currently \nis employed. Allen Electric was founded by his father in 1947. He \neventually took over the company.\n  Mr. Allen's family-owned business, passed down from his father, \neventually sank under the heavy financial weight of legal expenses--\nexpenses incurred because he tried to defend himself against fraudulent \ndiscrimination charges by union salts.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will prevent others from suffering \nthe injuries that Mr. Allen suffered--the loss of his family company, \nthe loss of all his hard work, the loss of his reputation.\n  I think it is wrong for us, under current law, to compel employers to \nhire someone who comes into the workplace with the goal of disrupting, \ndestroying, and eventually bankrupting their employer. That is wrong. \nThis is a modest piece of legislation that takes a small step in \nrestoring balance and fairness in employee-employer relations. I ask my \ncolleagues to support this motion to invoke cloture.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield my colleague 7 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my good friend--he is a good \nfriend--Senator Hutchinson, I have looked through the language, and \nunder the section dealing with protection of employer rights--maybe \nthere should be another time my colleague should bring this bill to the \nfloor because this bill, in its present form, would allow an employer \nnot to hire someone who might simply have an interest in joining a \nunion. It is that ambiguous.\n  I say to my colleague that while this isn't his intention, it sort of \nreminds me--you cannot have such broad language. It is sort of like the \ndays a long time ago--it is not the intention of my colleague from \nArkansas; and I think my colleague from Massachusetts would appreciate \nthis--where the Irish had a hard time getting jobs because people \nassumed, ``They might very well come in there and organize a union.'' \nWe cannot go back to those days.\n  Or as I look at this piece of legislation, you have a situation where \nmaybe an employer would not hire a minority for fear that that \nminority, based upon her past experience, might come into the workplace \nand say to other people, ``Listen. We're not getting a fair shake.'' Or \nthe same thing can hold true with someone who has been active in the \nNational Organization for Women, and the argument might be, ``We don't \nwant to hire such a person because, again, they might engage in the \nkind of activity that we would prohibit.''\n  Or you might get into a situation where you do not want to hire \nsomeone--I think we have had that discussion before--who might come in \nand, because of her background--she is an activist--``My gosh, she \nmight come in and start organizing with other women and say, `You know \nwhat? We ought to be going to our employer and saying this ought to be \na more family-friendly workplace. We need good child care here.' ''\n  This is a piece of legislation which is so broad in its application \nand so ambiguous, I say to my friend from Arkansas, that this is an \nenormous step backward.\n  I only have a few minutes, and if I get more time we can go to \ndebate, but I just want to simply say that I think the direction we \nought to go in--because the truth about this Truth in Employment Act is \nthat it just takes us back decades. It is unacceptable.\n  I have a piece of legislation that I have introduced called the Fair \nLabor Organizing Act. Let us talk about, What is the truth when it \ncomes to the imbalance of power between employers and employees right \nnow? If there is going to be a focus on how parents or a parent can do \ntheir best by their kids--in which case, they do their best by our \ncountry--then part of the focus is going to be on living-wage jobs. \nThat speaks to the right of people to organize and bargain \ncollectively, to earn a\n\n[[Page S10305]]\n\ndecent living, and give their children the care they know their \nchildren need and deserve. This piece of legislation goes exactly in \nthe opposite direction.\n  Now, the Fair Labor Organizing Act--and I would love to have support \nfrom my colleague on this--says three or four things. It says, first of \nall, let us talk about what is going on, the reality, the truth of what \nis going on right now. It says, first of all, that when it comes to \norganizing, companies do not get to give captive-audience speeches; the \nemployees, the workers, also are going to have a right to hear someone \nfrom the union. Free flow of information.\n\n  The second thing it says is that companies--let's talk about the \ntruth. The truth is that, right now, there are too many companies that \nhire union-busting consultants and illegally fire people. Some 10,000 \npeople a year are illegally fired because they want to do nothing more \nthan join a union, have some power, bargain for a decent wage and do \nwell for their families. What the Fair Labor Organizing Act, which I \nhave introduced, says is that if a company does that, it is not going \nto be profitable for them to do that any longer. They are going to pay \nserious back pay. There are going to be serious fines on them.\n  The third thing we say in this legislation is that even if people are \nlucky enough to be able to organize a union and aren't fired while they \nare trying to do so, then all too often companies just stonewall and \nrefuse to sign a contract, in which case they will go to binding \narbitration, mediation.\n  I say to my colleague from Arkansas that if, in fact, we want to talk \nabout truth in employment, then we ought to deal with the truth of the \nmatter, which is right now we have egregious examples of people being \nillegally fired, not able to organize, not able to bargain \ncollectively, and this legislation goes in exactly the opposite \ndirection.\n  This has very little to do with truth in employment. This has a whole \nlot to do with basic first amendment rights. This has a whole lot to do \nwith giving those companies--I hope there are not too many, and I don't \nthink there are; unfortunately, there are more than I wish there would \nbe--a huge loophole whereby they simply don't have to hire somebody who \npotentially might have an interest to join a union, or she calls on her \ncolleagues to join a union. It is unacceptable. You can't have a piece \nof legislation passed with this kind of mandate. We can't give \ncompanies a mandate not to hire women, not to hire minorities, not to \nhire activists who might want to join a union or want other members to \njoin a union, not to hire men or women who want to fight for more child \ncare. That is what this legislation does. Bring back another piece of \nlegislation which doesn't have this kind of language and I will support \nit. But tonight I come to the floor to say to my colleagues that there \nshould be an overwhelming vote against this piece of legislation.\n  How much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 7 minutes \n44 seconds, and the Senator from Arkansas has 10 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished \nassistant majority leader, Senator Nickles from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I wish to compliment my colleague \nfrom Arkansas for bringing this bill to the floor. I urge my colleagues \nto vote in favor of it. In response to my colleague from Minnesota, I \nthink he should read the legislation. In reading the legislation, the \nprotection of employer rights, section 8(a) of the NLRA is amended on \nline 22 to read:\n\n       Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as requiring \n     an employer to employ any person who is not a bona fide \n     employee applicant, in that such person seeks or has sought \n     employment with the employer with the primary purpose of \n     furthering another employment or agency status: Provided, \n     That this sentence shall not affect the rights and \n     responsibilities under this Act of any employee who is or was \n     a bona fide employee applicant, including the right to self-\n     organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, \n     to bargain collectively through representatives of their own \n     choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the \n     purpose of collective bargaining. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, under the legislation my colleague from Arkansas has, \nan employee can come in, and if they want to help organize or \nparticipate in the collective bargaining process, they can do so. But \nthey have to have the primary purpose of employment, of working with \nthe employer. It can't be to circumvent and say, no, we want to work \nfull time for the union, even to the destruction of the company.\n  Unfortunately, that happens today to some companies that might be \nnonunion. The organizers who are trying to unionize the company \nsometimes say, ``We would rather destroy that company if they are not \ngoing to be union.'' I will read you one comment that was in the \nInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers' organizing document on \nhow to use salting techniques:\n\n       Phase 3 is infiltration, confrontation, litigation, \n     disruption, and annihilation of all nonunion contractors. If \n     we cannot get inside and organize, then we must disrupt the \n     operations of the nonunion contractor.\n\n  That is a quote. I understand they have now taken that out of their \norganizational manual. But, in essence, they want to infiltrate and do \neverything they can to disrupt, and that means filing untold numbers of \nunfair labor practices. That means filing untold numbers of OSHA \ncomplaints, and any other thing to disrupt the company and make them an \nunsuccessful organization. Unfortunately that happens.\n  I have a letter from one of my small companies in Oklahoma, dated May \n29, 1998. He is telling a story and talking about filing false and \nincorrect reports with the NLRB:\n\n       We hired an attorney to represent us in these proceedings. \n     Each time, we had proof, and sometimes outside witnesses, to \n     prove our side of the story.\n\n  It goes on and on and on and talks about harassment. So I compliment \nmy colleague from Arkansas. I think he is exactly right. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I have two editorials. One is dated June 8 of this \nyear, from the Daily Oklahoman, entitled ``Salt, Not Light.'' It \nrepeats the real essence of this legislation, why it is needed. Also, I \nhave one that was in today's Washington Times, entitled ``Pass the Salt \nReform.'' It is dated Monday, September 14.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have these printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Daily Oklahoman, June 8, 1998]\n\n                            Salt, Not Light\n\n       At a recent congressional hearing the owner of a non-union \n     electrical contracting firm explained that his company had \n     been hit by 85 unfair-labor-practice complaints since 1985, \n     all dismissed as frivolous.\n       One came from a worker who'd been fired for refusing to \n     wear his hard hat on his head. ``He would strap it to his \n     knee and then dare us to fire him because he said our policy \n     stated only that he had to wear the hard hat--it (the \n     employee manual) didn't say where he had to wear it,'' said \n     John Gaylor of Carmel, Ind.\n       The worker was a ``union salt'' sent to harass a non-union \n     business. Gaylor's firm is a favorite target of the \n     International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW). He \n     budgets $250,000 a year to fight frivolous complaints.\n       ``Union salting'' is a serious problem for small \n     businesses. Union members are sent to disrupt productivity. \n     According to the IBEW's organizing manual, the idea is to \n     ``threaten or actually apply the economic pressure necessary \n     to cause the employer to . . . raise his prices, to recoup \n     additional costs, scale back his business activities, leave \n     the union's jurisdiction, go out of business and so on.''\n       It's big labor's version of guerrilla warfare, and it \n     should be stopped. In March the U.S. House passed a bill to \n     free employers from having to hire anyone who seeks a job to \n     pursue interests unrelated to their own. The bill would \n     require the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to decide \n     complaints related to union membership within a year. It \n     would mandate reimbursement for attorneys fees and other \n     costs if NLRB sues a small company and loses.\n       The Senate should follow the House's lead. Congress also \n     should reject Bill Clinton's nomination (AFL-CIO lawyer \n     Laurence Cohen) to be the NLRB's general counsel. Cohen is \n     the father of union salting and as such is the wrong choice \n     for the NLRB, which is supposed to be a non-partisan arbiler \n     in labor-management conflicts.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Washington Times, Sept. 14, 1998]\n\n                          Pass the Salt Reform\n\n       The story goes that a small Dallas electrical company of \n     about 30 employees won a\n\n[[Page S10306]]\n\n     bid for work on a school construction project and ran an ad \n     inviting workers to apply. When a local electricians' union \n     responded to the ad, as Rep. Sam Johnson described the \n     incident in debate earlier this year, their hiring blew the \n     company's fuse.\n       The union members, he said, ``staged small strikes by \n     leaving the job for three or four hours but returning just \n     before they could be replaced. They also sabotaged the \n     electrical work and went on to file close to 50 grievances \n     against the company, eventually driving it out of business.''\n       What the company didn't know was that it had hired \n     ``salts,'' union members sprinkled into non-union companies \n     with the goal not of organizing them along union lines but of \n     sabotaging them financially. It's an increasingly popular way \n     for Big Labor to beat non-union firms with which it can't \n     compete.\n       As one former salt testified, ``Salting has become a method \n     to stifle competition in the marketplace, steal away \n     employees and to inflict financial harm on the competition. \n     Salting has been practiced in Vermont for over six years, yet \n     not a single group of open-shop electrical workers have \n     petitioned the local union for the right to collectively \n     bargain with their employers.''\n       What makes this practice particularly effective is, first, \n     that as of now it is perfectly legal and, second, salts can \n     win even when they lose simply by running up a company's \n     legal bills with frivolous charges filed with the National \n     Labor Relations Board, the Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administration and other federal agencies. Among the \n     casualties to date: a Carmel, Ind., firm that faced 96 \n     charges, all of them dismissed, but has run up $250,000 in \n     legal bills trying to defend itself; a Cape Elizabeth, Maine, \n     company that faced 14 charges, all dismissed after spending \n     $100,000 in legal bills; a Clearfield, Pa., firm faced with \n     as many as 20 charges, all but one dismissed, but a $75,000 \n     legal bill plus lost time that eventually forced it out of \n     business after 38 years.\n       Companies faced with this kind of extortion fear they can't \n     afford to win. Given the choice of pyrrhic financial victory \n     or paying off the salts and settling the case for less, many \n     choose to settle.\n       A more cynical exploitation of ``worker rights'' is hard to \n     imagine, but it has been hard to reform existing law. By just \n     a two-vote margin along party lines earlier this year, the \n     House of Representatives approved reform amid much clucking \n     about the Republican Party's anti-worker tendencies.\n       Today, the Senate is scheduled to take up the matter with a \n     vote to shut off debate on the issue. The focus of the debate \n     is legislation introduced by Arkansas Sen. Tim Hutchinson \n     that attempts both to protect the right to organize and to \n     prevent its abuse. The bill specifies that any bona fide job \n     applicant, union or non-union, is entitled to all the rights \n     and responsibilities that go with the job (i.e., to join a \n     union, to bargain collectively and so on). But if the \n     applicant has sought employment with the primary purpose of \n     promoting the agenda of some other organization or business, \n     a company is not required to employ him. Put another way, if \n     the applicant would not have sought the job but for his union \n     mission, then he is a salt not entitled to the usual worker \n     rights.\n       By passing such a law, the Senate would protect not just \n     companies but taxpayers whose money covers the cost of agency \n     hearings and other administration that results from union \n     salting. Workers might have a better opportunity to air \n     legitimate grievances, too. It's time to put union on a low-\n     sodium legislative diet. It's time to pass the salt reform.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  First, let's remind ourselves of what this legislation is all about. \nIts purpose is to say to American workers who are qualified for a job \nthat they will be denied employment if they have an intent to try to \norganize co-workers in nonworking areas and during nonworking hours.\n  Very clearly, you can't have it both ways. You can't say we are \nreally not trying to overturn the Town and Country case. All you have \nto do is look at what the testimony was before our committee. Every \nsingle person who supports this bill wants to reverse that case.\n  Second is the idea that these workers are going in to destroy the \ncompany. What good does it do to organize if they are there to destroy \nit? That makes no sense. The claim makes no sense.\n  Mr. President, it is very clear what the court holdings are. First of \nall, if a company doesn't want to hire individuals who are paid by a \nunion to organize the workforce, which has been a protected right for \nover 60 years, all the company has to do is set a blanket rule barring \nall other employment. That solves the problem--do it for those who are \npaid by the union, and for those who are going to be moonlighting. That \nsolves the problem. We don't need legislation, Mr. President--they can \ndo that today.\n  Mr. President, the court decisions also make plain that you can fire \nany employee who neglects their duties. If workers are disruptive on \nthe jobsite, current law allows them to be fired.\n  Supporters claim that these workers won't do their jobs, but instead \nwill file phony charges with government agencies. But the law allows \ncompanies to recover attorney's fees if an unjustified charge is \npursued.\n  Mr. President, we have to look at what is the issue. The issue is \nfundamental. It is whether we in this country are going to permit \nworkers who have the ability to do the job, and who are performing \ntheir job--whether we are going to muzzle them, to blacklist them and \nsay under no circumstances can they go out there and try to persuade \nworkers to join a union.\n  If the company finds out that they are going to be organizing a \nunion, they can go ahead and fire them. That is what this language \nsays--go out there and fire them right away.\n  Mr. President, this applies not just to those individuals who hold an \nemployment status with a union, but those who hold an ``agency \nstatus.'' What in the world does that mean? I will tell you what it \nmeans. That means, for example, of the 100 top CEOs in the restaurant \nindustry, there isn't a single woman--not one, not a single woman. Do \nyou understand that--in the restaurant industry, of the top 100 CEOs, \nnone is a woman? So workers go in and say, ``We want to break the glass \nceiling in the restaurant industry.'' Under this bill, the employer can \nsay ``Oh, no. Oh, no. You have another thought in mind. You may need \nthis job. You may want this job. You may do it very well. But if you \nintend to try to do something about equal pay for women, try to do \nsomething about a child care program, try to do something to break the \nglass ceiling, oh, no. Oh, no.'' These workers can be fired by the \nemployer as well.\n  This is a continuation of the effort that we have seen in the last 3 \nyears to attack working families' income, and the rights of working \nfamilies to represent themselves and try to persuade individuals to be \npart of their union. If they don't choose to be, so be it. If they do \nchoose to be, so be it as well. But you are denying them that \nopportunity to choose.\n  Mr. President, we have to ask ourselves now on a Monday night why we \nare debating this particular issue when we have a Patients' Bill of \nRights ready to go. We could be debating those issues which are of such \nbasic, fundamental importance and significance to families in this \ncountry.\n  I withhold the rest of my time.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, it is a little frustrating for me \nbecause there could be nothing more unambiguous than the language in \nthis bill. As often as somebody wants to get up and yell and scream and \nhave a tirade about this being disruptive of workers' and union \nmembers' rights and the rights to organize, if you simply read the \nbill, it says unambiguously and very forthrightly that there is nothing \nin this bill that will interfere with ``. . . a bona fide employee \napplicant, including the right to self-organization, to form, join, or \nassist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through \nrepresentation of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted \nactivities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid \nor protection.''\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on my time? Who is going to make \nthat decision? The employer is going to make that decision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has the time.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I will be glad to yield for a question, not a speech.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Who is going to make the decision?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. The NLRB will make the decision, because the employee \nhas the right to file that complaint and go to the NLRB. But the burden \nof proof will be different. It will be the NLRB attorney who certifies \nthat he was a bona fide employee applicant and not someone who went in \nfor the purpose of destroying that company.\n\n[[Page S10307]]\n\n  I would like to yield 3 minutes to my distinguished colleague from \nColorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. President, I am rising in support of Senate bill 1981, the Truth \nin Employment Act.\n  I agree with my colleague from Arkansas that we do protect the right \nof employees to organize under the National Labor Relations Act. The \nproblem is that we have small businesses out here that are being \nharassed and their businesses are being disrupted. I want to take a \nminute to explain to you or relate an incident that happened in Denver, \nCO. It is a real life story of what happened.\n  This businessman, who happened to be an electrical contractor, saw a \nvan pull up in front of his business. Seven union organizers jumped out \nof the van, ran into his office, and they applied for a job with the \nbusiness. They had their videotape running. When all was said and done, \nhe hired some of them and put them to work. When all was said and done, \nwhen all the harassment was done, and all of the later procedure and \neverything, there was a considerable amount of cost to the company in \nmanagement time as well as actual dollars. It ended up that there were \napproximately 19 frivolous and sometimes false charges with the \nNational Labor Relations Board. Each one of those charges was \neventually dropped. However, the company had already dedicated 500 \nmanagement hours to deal with problems created by these salting workers \nand suffered financial losses of more than $1 million.\n  This is not workers' rights, this is going out and harassing your \ncompetition. It is going out and disrupting another company that is \ntrying to compete in the fair marketplace. It doesn't have anything to \ndo with jobs. What it ends up doing is costing the consumer. You and I, \nas consumers of electricity, will have to pay more electrical rates \nbecause of this type of activity that increases the cost of providing \nthe services that consumers end up utilizing.\n  I think this is a good bill. I am rising in support of it. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this. I think my colleague from Arkansas is doing \nthe right thing. I believe that we are protecting the rights of \nemployees. What we are doing is eliminating the harassment and the \nunnecessary cost to the employer.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I oppose the bill before us--S. 1981--\nbecause it would ban a perfectly legal and protected activity which was \nupheld in 1995 by a unanimous Supreme Court decision. The bill would \nban ``salting,'' which occurs when efforts are made by union supporters \nto gain employment with nonunion employers to organize their fellow \nemployees during non-working hours.\n  This bill, I believe, is an attack on the working men and women of \nthis country who choose to exercise their legal rights. For the first \ntime since the enactment of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), \nemployers could refuse to hire workers or could terminate workers who \nsought or obtained employment because they intended to engage in \norganizing activities.\n  Although the proponents of S. 1981 contend the bill merely prevents \nemployers from being forced to hire union organizers, the actual impact \nof this bill would be significantly broader. For example, under S. \n1981, employers could refuse to hire pro-union applicants even if they \nwere not paid union organizers. In addition, an employer could deny \nemployment to an applicant whose goal was to further ``another \nemployment or agency status.'' Agency status, however, is not defined. \nWhat does it mean? Since it is not defined, it could include any number \nof things, including the ability of women to try to organize for an on-\nsite day care center.\n  The proponents of S. 1981 also contend the bill is necessary in order \nto prevent workers from gaining employment for the purpose of \ndestroying an employer's business. I agree, of course, that an employer \nshould not be forced to hire a worker who seeks employment with the \nintention or purpose of destroying the employer's business. In fact, \nhowever, employers already have tools at their disposal to deal with \nemployees who are disrupting an employer's business or who are not \nproperly carrying out their job responsibilities. Such workers can be \ndisciplined or even discharged.\n  S. 1981 goes far beyond that. It says that any worker who applies for \na position and has the intention of organizing a union can be denied \nemployment even if that worker has no relationship with a union.\n  The NLRA currently prohibits the discharge of employees who attempt \nto organize. Nothing in S. 1981 ensures that this protection will \ncontinue. This is important because if S. 1981 were enacted, an \nemployer could claim that a recently hired employee who had begun to \nspeak to fellow workers about the need for a union had applied for the \njob with that purpose, giving the employer the legal right to fire such \nan employee.\n  The right to organize is a basic freedom guaranteed to our American \nworkers and I strongly support it. S. 1981, unfortunately, does not. It \nwould diminish the rights of America's workers, and weaken the \nprotections in the NLRA for them. It is anti-worker and anti-union, and \nit should be defeated.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture so \nthat the Senate may proceed to consideration of S. 1981, The Truth In \nEmployment Act. As an original cosponsor of the bill, I applaud Senator \nHutchinson for his efforts to restore balance to our federal labor \nlaws. S. 1981 would prohibit the controversial practice of some unions \ncalled ``salting,'' while maintaining the right of all workers to \nchoose whether or not to be represented by a union.\n  ``Salting'' is a controversial tactic that typically involves a union \ninstructing its agents to apply for jobs with non-union employers. If \nthese agents, or ``salts,'' are not hired, then the union immediately \nfiles unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations \nBoard (NLRB) alleging discriminatory hiring. If the salt is hired, he \nor she attempts to convince the other employees to join the union, \ntries to generate unfair labor practices, and initiates complaints with \nother federal agencies like OSHA and EPA. Some unions have made it \nclear that if organizing is unsuccessful, then the goal is to drive \nnon-union companies out of business to lessen competition for unionized \nbusinesses.\n  S. 1981 would amend the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to ensure \nthat no employer is required to hire an applicant or retain an employee \nwhose primary purpose is to disrupt the workplace through harassment, \nincreased costs, and frivolous complaints at the direction of a union \nor other employer. Last Congress, the Committee on Small Business \nreceived testimony on salting and the use of such campaigns by some \nunions to harass and intimidate non-union employers and employees.\n  So one denies that unions have the legal right to organize non-union \nworkers. The problem arises when a union directs its members and \nbusiness agents to gain access to a workplace not only to organize, but \nto harass. In the situations I have heard about in Missouri and around \nthe country, salting campaigns involve abuse of the NLRB's procedures \nin an effort to put small companies out of business. For instance, over \na two-year period, the NLRB at the instigation of the unions filed 48 \nunfair labor practice charges against a small construction contractor \nin Missouri. Although 47 of the charges were later thrown out by NLRB \nand one settled for a few hundred dollars, the employer was forced to \nincur $150,000 in legal fees to mount its defense. During this period, \nthe union never sought a representational election so that employees \ncould vote for or against joining the union. Salting campaigns can also \ninclude destruction of property, tampering with equipment, and general \nharassment of the non-union workforce by the union salts applying to \nthe companies with the intention of disrupting the workplace or \nproducing NLRB charges.\n  As Chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I am sensitive to the \nconcerns raised by small businesses about the effects our laws and \nregulations have on their ability to operate. S. 1981 provides a common \nsense solution to a nonsensical situation. While I support the right of \nworkers to organize, S. 1981 would restore the balance intended between \nthe rights of workers and of employers. Under S. 1981, only employees \nand applicants seeking work\n\n[[Page S10308]]\n\nin good faith would be entitled to the protections provided under the \nNLRA. In 1995, the Supreme Court ruled that current law does not \ndistinguish union salts from employees engaged in traditional \norganizing activities protected under the NLRA. S. 1981 does not \noverturn the Court's decision, but would amend the law to recognize the \ndistinction between salting activities to cause economic harm to the \nemployer versus legitimate organizing. S. 1981 retains the prohibition \non employers' discriminating against bona fide employee applicants \nexercising their protected rights under the NLRA. I believe S. 1981 \nwould restore the balance intended.\n  On March 26, 1998, language identical to S. 1981 passed the House of \nRepresentatives as part of H.R. 3246, the Fairness for Small Business \nand Employees Act of 1998. While the House bill passed by a narrow 202-\n200 vote, it is time the Senate gave full and careful consideration to \nthis issue. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for cloture.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to S. 1981, \nthe so-called ``Truth in Employment Act'' and urge my colleagues to do \nso as well.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is an affront to the American worker. \nIt opens the door to abuse of good workers and unfair job termination. \nThis measure would undermine a worker's right to organize, to seek \nbetter working conditions, to work to reduce racial tension, and to \nseek higher wages and better benefits. This measure seeks to undermine \nand penalize most every action an employee might take to improve the \nlot of workers.\n  In a unanimous 1995 decision, NLRB versus Town and Country, the \nUnited Sattes Supreme Court held that a ``union organizer is an \nemployee, with all the protections of the National Labor Relations Act \n(NLRA), if acting as a union organizer does not involve abandonment of \nhis or her service to the employer.'' This legislation makes a mockery \nof the Court's decision by requiring that workers be, what it calls, \n``bona fide'' job applicants and by subjecting workers to an outrageous \ntest of motivation as a condition of enjoying the protection of the \nNLRA rights. This bill provides a legal shield to employers who refuse \nto hire applicants who are union members or who have worked for an \norganized employers.\n  Mr. President, its not my intention to stand here telling the \nbusiness community of this country that they do not have the right to \nterminate union employees for cause or that they must hire only \napplicants who claim a union affiliation. In my eyes, anyone who does \nnot produce quality work product or who consistently ignores the rules \nof the workplace should face the threat of termination. Along those \nlines, any applicant who does not have the skills or experience to \nperform a job well should not be hired and the law today does not \nrequire that any unqualified person even be considered for a job. Mr. \nPresident, that's just common sense--that's just fair. This bill, the \ndeceivingly named ``Truth in Employment Act,'' is not fair.\n  Mr. President, since being elected to the Congress, the Senate \nmajority has used every possible opportunity to attack worker rights. \nThey have used a variety of vehicles, ranging from their anti-overtime \nbills, to repeated efforts to water down OSHA requirements, to their \nopposition to an increase in the minimum wage or any expansion of the \nFamily Medical Leave Act. This latest measure is just the latest in a \nlong history of anti-worker legislation presented to us by the majority \nparty.\n  This bill is blatantly anti-union, anti-worker and anti-American. I \nurge my colleagues to stand up for the ordinary American workers in \ntheir state. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this harmful \nmeasure.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, might I inquire as to the amount of \ntime on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has 2 minutes, 59 \nseconds; the Senator from Massachusetts has 2 minutes, 31 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we hope that this motion for cloture will \nnot be passed. This is a very fundamental issue; that is, whether we \nare going to permit employers to get into the minds of potential \nemployees who are qualified to do the job. If applicants are not \nqualified to do the job, they are not hired. It is not necessary to \nhire them.\n  This legislation permits any employer to say to any worker who comes \ninto the shop, who is interested in trying to describe the benefits of \na union, whether it be higher wages or child care facilities--to be \nable to say, ``No, we are not going to hire you.'' You know what is \ngoing to happen then. It is a decision that will be made by the \nemployer. That decision then goes to the NLRB. Three years go by, and \nthen the case comes to trial. What was in the mind of that particular \nemployee? There is not any evidence of disruptive activities. The law \ngives employers many ways to police those. The fact of the matter is, \nthe workers are trying to convince other workers to join the union, and \nnot be disruptive--to demonstrate that there is a better opportunity \nfor them by working through the company rather than being disruptive.\n  That is why we have scores of letters to indicate that this is \nsomething that is constructive and productive. This involves a very \nbasic and fundamental issue, and that is whether, in our country, which \nhas benefited so much from the development of collective bargaining, we \nare going to deny workers the chance to be able to gather together to \nrepresent their interests to improve the lives of their families.\n  Mr. President, I oppose this legislation and I urge my colleagues to \noppose cloture on this motion.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, we likewise have scores of letters \nthat have been submitted for the Record--small companies that are being \ndestroyed by the terrible practice of salts. We have literally tens of \nthousands of names that have come in on petitions saying please pass \nsomething to protect small employers.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has questioned the logic. Why would \nsomebody go in to destroy a company? Why not organize the company? That \nis the whole point. These are companies that have not been willing to \norganize, or they could not get the support among the employees of that \ncompany to organize. So in desperation they go in not to organize, not \nto legitimately persuade employees to join a union and to collectively \nbargain, but to economically ruin and devastate the viability of a \nsmall company. Why are we compelling employers to hire people who do \nnot want to work but want to destroy their company?\n  Imagine that salt who comes home at the end of the day, hired by the \nlabor union to go in and economically destroy by filing frivolous \ncomplaints, to file OSHA complaints, or cause OSHA complaints, at the \nend of the day facing their wife who says, ``Honey, how did your day \ngo?'' ``My day went great. I went out and helped to destroy the \nlivelihood of my employer''--the American dream of what he has worked \nfor for a lifetime. Imagine the employer going home at the end of the \nday, a small businessman, and his spouse says, ``How did your day go?'' \n``Oh, great. I spent my day in court trying to defend myself against \nfrivolous complaints that have been filed.''\n  It is not good for the employee or the employer. Many salts have come \nout of it and have said, ``I will not be involved in that kind of \npractice any more.''\n  I ask my colleagues this simple question, because I think it is \nsimply an issue of common sense. Would you hire someone in your office, \nwould you hire someone for your staff, who came in with the conscious, \nprimary purpose of undermining everything you are working for--every \nlegislative goal, every legislative agenda, every project in your \nState--and they are coming in for the purpose of undermining your role \nas a U.S. Senator? Would you hire that person? I think the obvious, \ncommonsense answer--and the answer that we employ every day when we \ninterview applicants--is no, we wouldn't do that. And yet, we are \ncompelling small businessmen and women across this country to hire \nthose who, they know in their heart when they come in, are going to \ndisrupt the workplace and undermine the economic viability of the \nbusiness and ultimately destroy them.\n  This legislation is modest. It is appropriate. I ask my colleagues to \ninvoke cloture so that we can pass this\n\n[[Page S10309]]\n\nbill for the benefit of small business men and women across this \ncountry.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand that I have 32 seconds \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this issue was considered by the Supreme \nCourt of the United States with a number of Justices that were \nnominated by Republican Presidents, and it was decided 9 to 0--not 7-2, \nnot 8-1, 9 to 0--to sustain the arguments that we have presented here \nthis afternoon. The Senator wants to overturn that decision here this \nafternoon, and I hope that we will not do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time under the control of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. This legislation does not overturn that Supreme Court \ndecision, as I know. That court decision involved the issue of whether \nyou could be a paid union employee and be a bona fide employee for \nanother company, and you can't. This doesn't deal with that. This deals \nwith the destructive practice of going in with the primary purpose of \nnot organizing but destroying the employer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I observe the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

So after a relatively \nbrief period of time we will have another vote, and then that will be \nthe last vote for tonight.\n  Again, I am going to talk to Senator Daschle, but I believe the next \nvote will be at 2:15 tomorrow afternoon, after the luncheon.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/14/senate-section/article/S10309-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10309-S10313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  1998\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I understand all time has expired on the \npending amendment. I choose to use my leader time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, could we have order? The leader is entitled \nto be heard. The Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order. Senators \nwill please take their conversations to the cloakroom. We would like to \nhave quiet in the Chamber.\n  The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Chair, and I yield 2 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my leader from South Dakota.\n  Mr. President, I think many minds on this amendment are already made \nup. I, just for a couple of minutes, would like to speak to those \nSenators who have not yet made up their minds. The point very simply is \nthis: There are a good number of farmers and ranchers. I daresay most \nof them are in dire straits through problems and conditions that are no \nfault of theirs. They didn't cause them.\n  Prices for their products are way below cost of production, whether \nit is wheat, cattle prices, whatnot. For example, in my State of \nMontana, farmers are getting $2 a bushel. They subtract from that $1 a \nbushel for freight costs and that ends up $1 a bushel. The price of a \nloaf of bread in the supermarkets is pretty close to that. There is no \nway in the world a farmer can begin to make ends meet in these \nconditions, and that is true for most farmers.\n  The amendment before us is very simple. It just says take the cap off \nthe loan rates just for crops that are harvested in 1998--not for next \nyear, just 1998--to put a little bit of cash in farmers' pockets to \nhelp them pay the loans, to help them make the payments to the bank, to \nhelp them just a little bit. I must tell you, raising the caps is \nnowhere close to solving the problem. It is just a little bit.\n  Why are prices so low? Very simply, because of worldwide production, \ncountries are subsidizing producing wheat.\n  Second, we are in dire straits because of the Asian crisis. Asia is \nnot buying anymore.\n  Third, because the U.S. dollar is so high. Farmers didn't cause those \nproblems, but farmers are facing those problems, and in some parts of \nthe country, there is a drought, there is flooding, there is \ninfestation of insects. They are stuck.\n\n[[Page S10310]]\n\n  The only argument of any credibility I have heard against this \namendment----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator. The only credible argument I have \nheard against this amendment is it breaks open Freedom to Farm and it \nmight raise worldwide prices because you are raising loan rates. The \nshort answer to that is we are not opening Freedom to Farm. This is \njust a 1-year, temporary payment to meet an emergency. And secondly, we \nhave no idea what the prices are going to be next year. We have no \nidea.\n  We can't let perfection be the enemy of the good. At least adopt this \namendment to help farmers right now. We will worry about next year, \nnext year. This amendment is very much needed.\n  Mr. President, I very much thank the Senator from South Dakota for \nyielding this time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to our ranking member, \nthe distinguished Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment is going to save a lot of \nfarmers and do it in a cost-effective manner and a manner that is sound \nfinancially. It looks as though we are going to come down on one or two \ncourses here. We either are going to raise the caps on loans and \nprovide a loan rate increase to farmers, or we are going to have some \nkind of direct payment to farmers. I hear rumbling around that there is \ngoing to be a big, massive multibillion-dollar check to go out to \nfarmers this year.\n  I said earlier there is a poll released today of 1,000 farmers--Mr. \nPresident, may we have order? I can't even hear myself think.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order. The \nSenator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the President. A poll came out today of 1,000 \nfarmers taken nationwide by a polling firm. It was done for the \nNebraska Wheat Growers, American Corn Growers and the Nebraska Farmers \nUnion--1,000 farmers.\n  Two questions I will point out: One, Congress should modify the \ncurrent farm program. Yes, 76.9 percent; no, 17 percent.\n  Congress should lift loan caps and raise loan rates 59 cents per \nbushel on wheat and 32 cents on corn. Yes, 72.5 percent; no, 19.4 \npercent.\n  Over 3 to 1. Farmers recognize this is the best way to proceed rather \nthan getting a direct payment. Keep in mind, if we raise the loan \nrates, it gives the farmer a marketing tool. The farmer can get the \nloan and hold on to the crop. If prices go up next year, the farmer can \nsell that crop and then pay the loan back to the Government with \ninterest.\n  If, however, we are just going to get a bunch of money and send it \nout to farmers in a payment, there is no chance that any of that money \nis ever going to come back to the Government. Keep in mind, these loans \nhave interest charges, and if farmers pay those loans back, they pay \nthem back with interest.\n  Secondly, if we make a payment to farmers this fall, as I hear some \npeople want to do, just one big lump sum, just a check that goes out, a \nlot of those people getting that money will not be in farming next \nyear, and it won't go to the producers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 2 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask for 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the Senator an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the loan rates go up, the loan rates increase, it goes \nto producers; it gives them a marketing tool whereby they can take the \ngrain and market when they want and not just dump it all out there this \nfall. That is why we have to remove the loan caps that are in the farm \nbill of 1996. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to the distinguished Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, two months ago, I joined my colleagues \nin requesting assistance for our Nation's farmers in Louisiana and \nother parts of the Nation who are on the brink of bankruptcy. Not \nbecause they are bad farmers but as a result of natural disasters and \nprices that they cannot control.\n  In Louisiana, farmers are experiencing the most severe agriculture \ndisaster it has been subjected to in the last 100 years. The Louisiana \nState University (LSU) Agricultural Center has estimated crop losses at \n$391 million. When losses due to aflatoxin in corn and livestock losses \nare added, the State is projecting escalated losses of $450 million. If \nno effective disaster relief is provided, Louisiana will lose 35-40 \npercent of its farmers. Without these farmers the State projects that \nits economy will lose an additional $1 billion.\n  Mr. President, this is a very serious situation, one that warrants an \neffective solution for the disaster situation facing the South and the \nincome losses facing the Midwest. For Louisiana, relief needed is \ntwofold: One, production loss related to the drought and heat and two, \neconomic. For other areas, income loss assistance needed is different.\n  The major problem in providing equitable relief is that while the \nMidwest has bumper crops and no price, the South has no crops and no \nprice. Therefore, I am very concerned that while this amendment will \nprovide help to some, it does not go near far enough to ensure that \nLouisiana farmers are provided the emergency disaster assistance that \nthey need to make it another year.\n  For example, under the current legislation being debated a corn \nfarmer in the Midwest who produces a normal yield of 120 bushels per \nacre under a loan rate of 30 cents per bushel would receive a Loan \nDeficiency Payment (LDP) of $36 per acre. In the South, a corn farmer \nwho produced only 50 bushels per acre, due to the drought, under the \nsame loan rate would only receive a LDP of $15 per acre. A corn farmer \nin the South whose corn had to be destroyed due to aflatoxin would \nreceive no LDP whatsoever.\n  The bottom line is that higher loan rates only benefit producers on \nactual production sold. The only way higher loan rates would benefit \nproducers whose production was substantially reduced would be to make \nan economic payment on the lost production in addition to the bushels \nharvested. Therefore, while this may help farmers in the Midwest, it \nprovides little to no assistance to farmers in the South.\n  The other provision in the underlying amendment that may be more \nhelpful in providing disaster assistance to Louisiana is the $1.5 \nbillion included in the amendment to replenish the national disaster \nreserve. However, the details in how USDA would implement this measure \nto provide disaster assistance to farmers with only one year losses, \nsuch as in the case of Louisiana, is unclear.\n  As I have previously stated, the reasons for the income loss related \nproblems facing farmers in Louisiana and other parts of the U.S. are \nquite different, but the results are the same. Only through direct \nassistance, can Louisiana farmers be helped.\n  For Louisiana and other Southern States, many farmers will not see \nnext year and grow the crops that provide Americans with the safest \nfood supply in the world. Time and time again, when a natural disaster \nhas struck, the Congress has provided the help needed to rebuild our \ncities and towns. Should we provide help to family farms that are \nfacing an economic disaster beyond their control? Absolutely. It is now \ntime that the Congress work on the bipartisan basis to provide direct \nfinancial assistance to our farmers just like we provide assistance to \nother individuals who have faced disasters beyond their control.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me and my senior \ncolleague from Louisiana, Senator Breaux, in working to ensure this \nassistance is provided fairly to all farmers, including farmers in \nLouisiana and the South.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their eloquent \ncomments and the contributions they have made to this debate all \nafternoon. I will be very brief, because I know that Senators wish to \nexpress themselves on this amendment, and we will accommodate that.\n  There are two points I want to make. The first is that since the \nSenate has\n\n[[Page S10311]]\n\nattempted to address this problem in July, the situation has worsened \nimmeasurably. To the extent that we can measure it, it is simply \nimportant for all of us to understand that prices have fallen \ndramatically just in the last 6 weeks.\n  For July, corn prices have fallen 28 percent. For wheat, since July, \nprices have fallen an additional 20 percent. For soybeans, an \nadditional 20 percent, and that is just since July. The bottom has \nfallen out of the market. The situation continues to worsen.\n  Mr. President, we have no choice but to take as immediate an action, \nas comprehensive an action as we possibly can to address this problem. \nVery simply, the second point is to simply address one last time what \nit is we attempt to do.\n  The Senator from Iowa ably, again, articulated why we need to \nincrease the cap on the marketing loan. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, so farmers aren't forced to move their grain onto the market, \nwe give them the opportunity to store their grain on an emergency \nbasis. Let me remind my colleagues, we are only talking about a 1-year \nauthorization, first for the loan rate, and second for the storage.\n  Third, we provide indemnity losses. The Senator from Louisiana is \nright and the senior Senator from Louisiana has expressed his concern \nto me about how this problem is spreading. Louisiana is hit even harder \nnow than they were last July. So the indemnity proposal is absolutely \nessential if we are going to address the multiplicity of problems we \nhave in agriculture nationally.\n  The fourth is that we go back to the issue that we discussed earlier \non mandatory price reporting. If we are ever going to change the \nlivestock situation, we must get rid of the secret deals. We must make \nsure that they--that is livestock producers--have the same \nopportunities for open and fair competition as others. Mandatory price \nreporting will do that.\n\n  And then finally, we believe that we need to make consistent in \nagriculture what we have done in every other commodity and industry for \nas long as I know, and that is, simply label the products when they are \nimported. We do it for every other product. We ought to do it for the \nfood we eat.\n  Mr. President, basically that is what we are proposing today, to \naddress this problem in as comprehensive a way, recognizing that in \nboth livestock and grain we have a serious problem. We cannot wait any \nlonger. This issue must be addressed. This amendment does it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. From my leader time, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe Senator from Idaho, Senator Craig.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, is there a farm problem? You bet there is. \nIs there a farm crisis? Yes. On most farms in America today, if you are \nbelow the cost of production, and you have a debt, you have a problem. \nThe Senators on the other side of the aisle are absolutely true to what \nthey speak. And I could have used every one of their charts this \nafternoon for the very same message.\n  We have a crisis in American agriculture. Is it a result of Freedom \nto Farm? No. It is a combination of everything coming together, the \nloss of our markets in Asian countries and tremendous overproduction. \nThank goodness, it is a blessing in most countries when agriculture \noverproduces; it is a crisis in ours because it shoves down the price \nof commodities.\n  Yes, Mr. President, we have a crisis in farm country. Have we \nrecognized it? Yes, we have. And we started doing something about it \nbefore we adjourned here in August. We passed and reauthorized the \nagriculture research title. We advanced the fiscal year 1999 transition \npayment. We revoked sanctions on India and Pakistan to try to move some \nof our product into the market.\n  We approved significant reform in the farm labor program. We \nestablished a binational commission to examine the concern that we have \nwith beef prices and with the flood of Canadian meat coming into our \nmarket. We required international programs to purchase American \ncommodities. And we passed a sense-of-the-Senate resolution encouraging \nUSDA to use existing authorities to help wheat farmers. Did it raise \nthe price of wheat at the farm bin? It did not. But it sets in motion a \nvariety of opportunities to begin to move that.\n  What further should we do? Frankly, Mr. President, there is a great \ndeal more we should do. The chairman of the Ag Committee has announced \nhe will reexamine much more thoroughly sanctions and trade reform to \nopen up the 11 percent of the market that our farmers are now exempt \nfrom or cannot get to. We have talked about and we will do meaningful \ntax reform.\n  Our colleague from Kansas has talked about making sure that crop \ninsurance is the right kind of insurance so that the production \nagriculture buys it and uses it to insure their crops, to insure their \nincome against disaster, against drought for an income purpose. We are \nworking on that. We have to get that done next Congress, come heck or \nhigh water.\n  And then let us look at a lost market compensation payment. The \nSenator from Iowa says that is so much money, just throw it out to the \nfarmer. It is something we can buy and afford to buy. It is not a $7 \nbillion program off-budget, no offsets--emergency spending proposed by \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  Senators, this is a $7 billion program you are being asked to vote on \ntonight. Stop and think about it. We have not worked together. When we \nsolve agricultural problems, we come together. All of those items that \nI mentioned we passed before the August recess, we did it in a \nbipartisan way. We did not open the farm bill. We did not open Freedom \nto Farm.\n  I would hope you stand behind the chairman of the Senate Ag Committee \ntonight on a motion to table. Does that mean this issue is gone? \nAbsolutely not. We are meeting now and we will meet tomorrow. I would \nhope, too, that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would come \ndown and sit with us and look at what we can do. Are we going to spend \nsome money? Yes. We are going to spend some money so that agriculture \ndoes not go bankrupt. And we have got to do it. But I suggest that \nlifting a loan cap does not solve that problem on the short-term basis \nand the long-term basis. Then it becomes so easy to extend it, and then \nit is $8 or $10 billion or more.\n  So this is not the last vote we are going to have tonight or tomorrow \nor before this Congress adjourns to deal with a real farm crisis, be \nyou a grain producer, a hog farmer, a cattle rancher--soybeans, corn, \nyou name it. They are not making money. They are losing millions.\n  We ought to be sensitive to assuring that there is some kind of \nbaseline out there this year so that the farmer can be in production \nnext year. We will accomplish that here in the Senate, if we recognize \nthat and come together to get it done.\n  I do not believe this is a solution to the problem. I encourage all \nof our colleagues to stand with the chairman of the Ag Committee--vote \nto table this amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Roberts. I \nunderstand we have one other Senator who would like to speak briefly, \nSenator Breaux. But first I yield that time to Senator Roberts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the distinguished majority leader for yielding.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Iowa and to present what I believe will be an \nimportant plan to help our farmers and ranchers get through the current \nlow prices and natural disasters they are experiencing.\n  Mr. President, there are indeed areas of rural America facing \neconomic hardships caused by drought, flooding, wheat scab, and low \nprices. The question here is: will raising loan rates provide the cash \nflow assistance that farmers need? Or, will it create an additional set \nof issues that simply exacerbate the current problem?\n  We have consistently heard on this floor that there is no longer a \n``safety net'' for America's farmers. Yet, we do not hear that under \nthe 1996 farm bill,\n\n[[Page S10312]]\n\nfarmers have received over $6 billion more in payments than they would \nhave received under the old farm bill. We do not hear about the \ntransition payments producers are receiving on 85 percent of their \nhistorical yields. And, we do not hear about the Loan Deficiency \nPayments (LDPs) producers are receiving under the 1996 legislation. \nRecent estimates show that producers may obtain up to $3 billion in \nLDPs on their 1998 crops--in addition to their transition payments.\n  This is a ``safety-net!''\n  Let me repeat: We have a ``safety-net!''\n  Raising and extending loan rates does not improve producer incomes. \nExtending the loan rate actually results in lower prices in the long-\nrun. Extending the loan for six months simply gives producers another \nfalse hope for holding onto the remainder of last year's crop. Farmers \nwill be holding onto a portion of the previous year's crop, while at \nthe same time harvesting another bumper crop in 1998.\n  As I stated during debate on the Agricultural Appropriations bill, \nrolling over the loan rate actually increases the amount of grain and \nsoybeans on the market and results in lower prices--not higher prices. \nSince excess stocks will continue to depress prices, will we then \nextend the rate again? It will become an endless cycle that costs \nbillions of dollars, and which will eventually lead to a return to \nplanting requirements and set-aside acres in an attempt to control \nagricultural output and limit the budget effects.\n  Extending and raising loan rates will only serve to exacerbate the \nlack of storage associated with the transportation problems in rural \nAmerica because it causes farmers to hold onto their crops and fill \nelevator storage spaces. Kansas still has wheat on the ground from this \nyear's near record wheat harvest and we have begun to harvest what are \nexpected to be record or near record corn, sorgham, and soybean crops. \nRaising loan rates will worsen the storage problems we are already \nfacing.\n  It is also argued raising loans rates allows farmers to wait for a \nhigher price. However, a study by Kansas State University looked at the \nyears 1981 through 1997 and compared farmers' earnings if they held \nwheat in storage until mid-November versus selling at harvest. In all \nbut five years, farmers ended up with a net loss as storage and \ninterest costs exceeded grains in prices. Raising rates simply provides \na false hope to farmers.\n  Mr. President, I think we must also ask several important question \nthat have not been addressed by the advocates of this plan.\n  How do higher loan rates help producers who have suffered crop \nfailures and have no crop to put under loan?\n  If loan rates will raise prices--as has been argued by the \nadvocates--what will this do to feed prices for livestock producers who \nare in many instances facing more severe economic situations than grain \nproducers?\n  How do higher loan rates help wheat producers that have already \nharvested and marketed their crops?\n  It is argued this action is needed to raise prices because the 1996 \nFarm Bill has caused the low prices we are currently experiencing. What \nabout the low prices we experienced under the previous program in the \nmid-1980s and early 1990s? What was the cause of those programs?\n  Mr. President, it is obvious this plan will not work and will not \nassist all producers. Therefore, I am proposing the following five \npoint plan which will be supported by many Republicans and which I \nbelieve can also garner bipartisan support.\n  The plan addresses cash flow concerns, crop insurance, the tax burden \non farmers, trade, and the Conservation Reserve Program.\n  It is obvious we must provide some form of cash flow assistance to \nall farmers, including those who did not or will not have a crop to \nharvest. Therefore, I propose a ``Farmer Income Assistance Program'' \nwhich will ensure that all farmers receive some form of cash \nassistance. I know of no other way to address the multiple problems of \nfarmers with one year of crop losses, multi-year crop losses, and those \nwith large crop but no price. This is the fairest method available to \nus, and it will ensure that no producer slips through the cracks.\n  Mr. President, we must also take important steps to reform the crop \ninsurance program. One of the most common complaints I hear from my \nfarmers is that cop insurance does not work. They argue the policies \navailable do not address their needs, not do they get adequate coverage \nfor the money they invest in insurance policies.\n  A large problem with the program is the roadblocks the Risk \nManagement Agency (RMA) has repeatedly put up to halt or slow down the \ndevelopment and expansion of many private policies. At the same time \nRMA acts as the regulator over these private companies, it is also \ndeveloping and selling products in direct competition with the \ninsurance companies. I know of no other industry facing these same \nroadblocks.\n  Mr. Kerrey and I have long been committed to major reforms of the \ncrop insurance program. And, we are circulating a proposal to pursue \nthese goals. However, it will be difficult to pursue major reforms in \nthe short period of time remaining this session. Therefore, I propose \nseveral minor changes this fall to improve the program followed by what \nI hope will be serious reform next year. The proposed changes include:\n\n  Providing a proportional subsidy for all coverage levels up to 75 \npercent. Farmers often buy only the lowest level of coverage because \nthat is where the highest subsidy levels occur.\n  Increase the subsidy rate so that it is the same for all revenue \ninsurance contracts as for other all forms of crop insurance.\n  Mr. President, we must also pursue real tax reform that benefits our \nfarmers and ranchers. We must pursue tax legislation that includes: 100 \npercent deductibility of self-employed health care; permanent extension \nof income averaging for farmers; farmer savings accounts; and \nreductions in the capital gains rates.\n  I realize some will argue that capital gains reductions do not help \nfarmers. However, I would advise my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle that a recent report by the Department of Agriculture recently \nstated that the greatest level of benefits to farmers from the 1997 \nTaxpayer Relief Act has come from the reduction in the capital gains \nrate.\n  Increased access to world markets is an important step that must be \ntaken. Our farmers and ranchers simply cannot be successful without \naccess to foreign markets. The most important toll to obtaining these \nmarkets is to pass fast track trade negotiating authority for the \nPresident. Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman has stated on several \noccasions that trade is the ``safety-net'' for America's farmers and \nranchers. Last fall's failure to pass fast track is the single most \nimportant foreign policy blunder for agriculture since the shattered \nglass embargo policies of the late 70s and early 80s. We must pass fast \ntrack now.\n  Finally, Mr. President, USDA should announce a new Conservation \nReserve Program (CRP) sign-up sometime this fall. I checked the Farm \nService Agency (FSA) website before coming to the floor, and it stated \nthat as of October 1998 there will be just over 30 million acres \nenrolled in the CRP. The Secretary is allowed to enroll up to 36.4 \nmillion acres, and I encourage him to enroll the maximum number of \nacres during this fall's sign-up. This is an important action which the \nSecretary does not need additional Congressional approval to undertake, \nand it will help to take many acres of high risk land out of \nproduction--particularly in the Northern Plains.\n  Mr. President, to summarize the plan is as follows: Income assistance \npayments; crop insurance reform; tax relief; increased trade; and full \nenrollment in the CRP.\n  This is not a plan which is set in stone. It is open to change, and I \nam happy to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nundertake a plan to assist America's farmers.\n  I am hopeful my colleagues will work with me in a bipartisan manner. \nI do not question the desire of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle to help our producers. I simply think their approach will do more \nharm than good.\n  We tried to increase loan rates in the early and mid-1980s. It led to \nexcess production and excess stocks that brought agriculture to its \nknees and greatly contributed to the agricultural crisis of the 1980s.\n\n[[Page S10313]]\n\n  Mr. President, we tell our children that we study history so we will \nnot make the same mistakes of the past. Past history shows us the \nSenator from Iowa's plan will not work. I hope that we have learned our \nlesson and will take the steps necessary to help agriculture move into \nthe 21st Century and not mired in the broken policies of the 20th \nCentury.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Do I have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. This is unusual. But in the hope that he will be brief, I \nyield the balance of that time to Senator Breaux. I am sure he will \nspeak against this amendment in that time.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Thank you for the time.\n  I make one point very quickly, and the point is this: Our friends in \nagriculture in the northern part of the United States have a problem: \nThey have a crop but they have a very poor price that doesn't allow \nthem to continue. They need help. That is why the loan level is being \nincreased--to try to help those.\n  For those of us who represent the southern areas, our problem is the \nopposite: Because of the drought, we don't have any crop. It is not a \nquestion of local price. There is no crop to sell at any price.\n  One of the sections that is in this bill says that the Secretary may \nuse funds made available under this section to make cash payments that \ndon't go for crop disasters but for income loss.\n  Now, as a representative of an area that has a crop disaster, it \nseems to me I am being written out of any help at all. If that is the \ncase, I would like to know about it.\n  Maybe my friend from North Dakota can respond, and I yield to him.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I might respond to the Senator from Louisiana and \nassure him, as the author of this provision, it is designed \nspecifically to help every State that has experienced income loss.\n  Mr. LOTT. How much time is left?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Conrad may complete \nthe response to my question.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I just say to the Senator from Louisiana, this is \nspecifically designed to help every State that has suffered income \nloss. The reason the funding has been expanded is because of the losses \nin Louisiana, the losses in Oklahoma, the losses in Texas, the losses \nin Georgia.\n  This is designed to help every State that has experienced income \nloss, including the Senator's State of Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder for the majority leader, after consultation with the Democratic \nleader, to proceed to the consideration of S. 2279, the Wendell Ford \nNational Air Transportation System Improvement Act. I further ask that \nduring the pendency of S. 2279 only relevant amendments be in order to \nthe bill.\n\n[[Page S10314]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, in spite of the extraordinarily good \nname this bill has, I just inform the majority leader that we are still \nnegotiating. We hope that we can come to some accommodation here. I \nwould personally like to see this legislation pass, but we are not \nthere yet. On behalf of colleagues on this side, I will object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, on this subject, this is a very important \nFederal Aviation Administration bill. It is critical and is must-pass \nlegislation. I discussed it briefly with Senator Daschle and he \nindicates that he will work to see if we can clear any objections or \nholds that we might have on it. It involves billions of dollars in \nairport improvement grants, which cannot be distributed without the \nauthorization bill that has been named the Wendell Ford bill, since he \nhas been a member of the committee and has worked on this particular \nbill and its authorization for many years. It would provide funding for \nprojects at nearly every airport in the Nation and for work that is \nreally essential. I hope we can come to an agreement on this and get it \nup for consideration within the next 2 weeks so it won't get caught up \nand lost at the end of the session. So I will be talking further to \nSenator Daschle about this and any Senator that might have any \nproblems. I know Senator McCain wishes to speak on this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank the majority leader for trying \nto move this legislation. I thank the Democratic leader for expressing \nhis willingness to try to work something out. But I also have to \nexpress my disappointment that we can't reach agreement yet on a manner \nto proceed to the consideration of the Wendell H. Ford National Air \nTransportation System Improvement Act. I pledge to do whatever I can \nwithin my power to work with my colleagues on a way to move forward \nwith this critical legislation.\n  This reauthorization bill is a must-pass piece of legislation. The \nbill must be reauthorized before the end of this fiscal year, or \nairport grants across the Nation will lapse. Grants to our airports \nwill stop regardless of whether the transportation appropriations bill \nis signed into law or not.\n  Madam President, the bill allows for approximately $2 billion to be \nspent annually on safety and security improvements, as well as capacity \nenhancements, at public use airports across the country. Ongoing \nconstruction projects at hundreds, if not thousands, of airports will \nbe jeopardized if Congress doesn't act before the end of September. \nFunding for noise grants will halt, as well as funding for important \nFAA Letter of Intent projects.\n  Madam President, coincidentally, the State of Texas happens to entail \n$26,942,447.\n  This bill authorizes a number of safety initiatives, as well as \nprovisions to promote competition in the domestic airline industry. We \nneed only to look at the crippling effect of the Northwest Airlines \nstrike to understand the need to advance legislation that enhances \ncapacity at and access to our most congested airports.\n  We must move quickly on this bill. Otherwise, we run the risk of the \nbill's getting caught up in unrelated politically charged issues at the \nend of the session.\n  Also, we need to take the time to move through the appropriate \nprocess on this bill. There are too many significant improvements in \nthe Senate reauthorization bill which would die on the vine if we don't \nproceed to consideration of the Senate version of the bill. Both the \nHouse and the Senate have completed action on their respective 1999 \ntransportation appropriations bills and are currently moving towards \nconference. Without an authorization bill these funds would be \nunavailable obligations to our Nation's airport.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Letters of Intent, as well as the \nAirport Improvement Program Formula Distributions, some $2.1 billion, \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Letters of Intent\n\n       Current letters of intent assume the following fiscal year \n     1999 grant allocations:\n\nArkansas: Fayetteville (northwest Arkansas)..................$5,000,000\nColorado: Denver International...............................24,931,000\nGeorgia: Hartsfield Atlanta International.....................7,083,000\nIllinois:\n  Mid-America, Belleville reliever...........................14,000,000\n  Chicago Midway..............................................3,000,000\nKentucky:\n  Greater Cincinnati..........................................6,000,000\n  Louisville.................................................18,243,000\nMichigan: Detroit Metropolitan...............................16,400,000\nMississippi: Golden Triangle....................................300,000\nNevada: Reno/Tahoe International..............................6,500,000\nNew York: Buffalo International...............................1,700,000\nRhode Island: Theodore F.

Madam President, I am fortunate to be a Senator \nrepresenting the great State of Illinois, the great city of Chicago, at \ngreat ballpark named Wrigley Field.\n  Yesterday afternoon it was my good fortune to see at least part of \nthe very historic game, a game between the Chicago Cubs and the \nMilwaukee Brewers, which will now be part of baseball history. It was a \ngame attended by 40,846 fans at Wrigley Field, and several hundred of \nus on the rooftops and around the field watched and marveled. Not only \nwas it a great baseball game with the Cubs' victory, but it was a \nhistoric game for a very important person. Any newspaper you picked up \nin Chicago, or Illinois, or perhaps across the country, this morning \nlet everyone in on the fact that baseball history was made yesterday in \nWrigley Field.\n  Paul Sullivan, a Tribune staff writer for the Chicago Tribune put it \nin lyric words that I would like to read:\n\n       With the shadows creeping over the right field vines, and \n     the crowd on its tiptoes, Sosa took hold of an Eric Plunk \n     fastball in the ninth inning and sent it screaming onto \n     Waveland Avenue for number 62, in the greatest home run chase \n     the game has ever seen.\n\n  I was happy to be there and to see home run 62. I am happy to \nrepresent the State which has in it such a fine man playing as Sammy \nSosa. We are really blessed--those of us who follow baseball--to have \nthis wonderful home run derby, and have two extraordinary individuals \ninvolved in it.\n  Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals also sent 62 home runs this \nyear, eclipsing the record of Babe Ruth, as well as Roger Maris. It is \ngood to know that Mark McGwire is a good person. He announced early in \nthe season that he would be donating $1 million of his salary this year \nfor those children who have been physically and sexually abused. He has \na heart, and he has shown it many times.\n  Then there is Sammy Sosa, from the Dominican Republic.\n  If you will recall the scene last week when Mark McGwire was breaking \nthe record to be the first to do so, there was Sammy Sosa in right \nfield. He could not have been more supportive and more congratulatory. \nThere is a true friendship between the men.\n  As Mark McGwire received all of this attention and adulation, Sammy \nwas there to cheer him on. Yesterday, Sammy Sosa matched Mark McGwire \nwith 62 home runs. He continued to praise him as a friend and hoped \nthat they both had good luck in this home run derby in the remaining \ngames.\n  It tells us a lot about baseball. It tells us a lot about these two \nmen.\n  Sammy Sosa comes from particularly humble beginnings, starting off in \nthe Dominican Republic. One of my favorite quotes during the course of \nthe season is someone went to Sammy Sosa and said, ``Aren't you under a \nlot of stress because of this race for the home run title?'' And he \nsaid, ``You think this is stressful, earning a living as a shoeshine \nboy in the Dominican Republic is stressful.'' He put it all in \nperspective.\n  He has been gracious and friendly. He has been a true sportsman \nthroughout this race. He deserves our praise and our cheers as well.\n  All of us watch anxiously for the closing games to see who ends up \nwith the ultimate home run record.\n  For those of us who are fortunate to love the game and to be watching \nit closely in 1998, I want to say my hat is off to Mark McGwire and \nespecially to Sammy Sosa, who yesterday with two towering home runs \nover left field and into Waveland Avenue, really brought Chicago to its \nfeet, cheering this man and all that he stands for.\n  I am hoping now that they will continue this race to set the record \nand to put the great American pastime back on its feet. I think they \nhave done a lot for it.\n  I wish them both the very best. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/14/senate-section/article/S10315-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10315-S10318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  1999\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, Senator Hollings, on July 31, 1997 \nintroduced a bill that makes a boundary change to Unit M09, Edisto \nIsland, which was referred to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks. It is my understanding that the amendment he is now offering is \nidentical to your bill. Is that correct?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks is correct. The amendment before us is identical to S. 1104.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Could the Senator please explain why the circumstances \nsurrounding this issue are unique?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Certainly, unit M09 has been part of the coastal \nbarrier system since the passage of the Coastal Barrier Resources Act \nin 1982. In 1987, a portion of Edisto Island was annexed by Colleton \nCounty from Charleston County. In 1988, after public notice and \ncomment, the Fish and Wildlife Service recommended that this unit be \nexpanded to include additional areas on Edisto Island. The Fish and \nWildlife Service was not advised that a jurisdictional transfer had \noccurred and provided maps relating to Edisto Island to Charleston \nCounty, rather than Colleton. Because Colleton County did not have the \nappropriate maps, they provided inaccurate maps to landowners at a time \nwhen significant economic development were being made.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, the Committee on Environment and Public \nworks favorably reported out this bill last May. The area in question \nwas correctly mapped as an undeveloped coastal barrier, but \nextraordinary miscommunication at the Federal, State and local levels \nfailed to ensure that the appropriate maps were being provided to the \npublic. As a result, when the landowner inquired from Colleton County \nabout the status of his land with respect to the Coastal Barrier \nResources System, he was given inaccurate information. The sole reason \nthat we supported the changes made by Senator Hollings' bill was \nbecause of the unprecedented and unique procedural circumstances in \nthis case, and we do not anticipate that there would be other instances \nthat would warrant similar changes. The law only requires Coastal \nBarrier Resources System maps to be on file at the United States Fish \nand Wildlife Service, and reporting this bill does not imply that \nlandowners should rely on maps filed at any other location to determine \nwhether or not their property is located within the Coastal Barrier \nResources System.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3587\n\n       On page 74, after line 20, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1  . LAND EXCHANGE IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND \n                   PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY, MARYLAND.\n\n       Section 135 of the Department of the Interior and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998 is amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n       ``(g) Environmental Impact Statement, Compliance With \n     Law.--As a condition of the exchange of property under this \n     subsection, the Secretary shall--\n       ``(1) prepare an environmental impact statement in \n     accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act, and\n       ``(2) comply with all other applicable laws (including \n     regulations) and rules relating to property transfers.''.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nSenator Mikulski in sponsoring this amendment to require the Secretary \nof the Interior to prepare an environmental impact statement and comply \nwith all other applicable laws, rules and regulations related to \nproperty transfers before engaging in a land exchange near Oxon Creek \nin Prince Georges County and the District of Columbia.\n  Section 135 of the Interior Appropriations Act of 1998 directs the \nSecretary of the Interior, to ``accept full title to approximately 84 \nacres of land located in Prince Georges County, Maryland, adjacent to \nOxon Cove Park, and * * * in exchange * * * convey to the Corrections \nCorporation of America all of the interest of the United States in \napproximately 42 acres of land located in Oxon Cove Park in the \nDistrict of Columbia,'' ``notwithstanding any other provision of law.'' \nThe language directing this exchange was inserted at the eleventh hour \nin the Conference Report on the Interior Appropriations bill with no \nprior hearings or consideration, no opportunity for debate, no input \nfrom the National Park Service or the area Congressional Delegation and \nno consultation with the affected communities. It circumvented every \nprocedure and process by which land exchanges normally take place. The \nonly conditions placed on the transaction were that the property would \nnot have environment contamination and that it be a fair market value \nexchange or equalized in value by a cash payment from CCA.\n  Since the enactment of the Interior Appropriations bill, the \nCorrections Corporation of America (CCA) has filed an application with \nthe District of Columbia Zoning Commission to build a 2,200 bed prison \non the 42 acre National Park site to house portions of the District of \nColumbia's inmate population. This facility is strongly opposed by \nlocal residents who have raised serious concerns about both the planned \nlocation of the prison and the propriety of bypassing National Park \nService land exchange and environmental compliance guidelines which \nallow for public input. Department of the Interior officials have \nstated that ``absent public review, which NPS has been precluded to \nconduct by statute, it is not clear that the location of a prison on \nthe current parcel of park land would be in the best interest of the \npublic. Further, the legislated land exchange with CCA does not afford \nequal opportunity to all potential bidders to provide a nearby inmate \nfacility for felons of the District of Columbia.''\n  It is important to point out that the National Park Service's Oxon \nCove property has been planned as the site of a public golf course and \na hiker-biker trail--recreational facilities urgently needed in great \ndemand by the local community. They are a key component of an overall \neffort to revitalize the area and enhance the quality of life for local \nresidents. These public facilities would largely be displaced by the \nCCA prison. Moreover, development of a correctional facility on this \nsite would likely have adverse environmental impacts on Oxon Cove and \non the Potomac River which was recently designated as an American \nHeritage River. In addition, it is my understanding that the CCA owned \nproperty in Prince Georges County is mostly wetlands and has no access \nand consequently the land swap is hardly a ``fair market value'' \nexchange.\n  The amendment which Senator Mikulski and I are offering will ensure \nthat no legislated land exchange can be consummated unless and until \nthe exchange has been reviewed in accordance with the procedures \ncustomary for such land exchange proposals including: an Environmental \nImpact Statement in accord with the National Environmental Policy Act; \na determination by the Secretary of the Interior that the land is \nsuitable for exchange under the criteria normally used for such \nexchanges; an evaluation of whether the land exchange is in the best \ninterests of the public and the National Park Service; an opportunity \nfor public hearings and input; a review of the NPS General Management \nPlan for the property and scrutiny by the National Capital Planning \nCommission. It is my firm conviction that this legislated land exchange \nshould never have been enacted. We hold this property and all of our \nNation's lands in public trust and it my hope that the amendment we are \noffering will help preserve that trust as well as citizens' rights to \ndue process and having their concerns heard. I urge adoption of this \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3588\n\n  (Purpose: To modify Section 121 of the bill regarding wildland fire \n                         management in Alaska)\n\n       On page 59, line 25, insert between the words ``Alaska'' \n     and ``prior'' the following: ``for assignment to a Type I hot \n     shot crew that previously has been certified and listed in \n     the Bureau of Land Management 1998 Interagency National \n     Mobilization Guide,''.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3589\n\n       S. 2237 is hereby amended as follows:\n       At page 19, line 20, add the following after the word \n     ``program'': ``and of which $4,400,000 shall be available for \n     the Katmai National Park Land Exchange''.\n       At the appropriate place insert the following new section:\n\n[[Page S10317]]\n\n     SEC.

Madam President, it was a week ago tomorrow early in the \nafternoon that the Senate began consideration of the Interior \nappropriations bill. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Mr. \nByrd, and I made our opening statements. We passed a handful of agreed \namendments, and since then the entire subject matter has dealt with \nmatters totally extraneous to that Interior appropriations bill. \nAccording to the minority leader's action, we will have another such \nextraneous amendment tomorrow. But in the closing of this evening, I do \nhave this set of amendments, all of which relate to the subject of the \nbill.\n  The first is by Senator Campbell on behalf of the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs, which strikes certain language in the bill on the subject of \nthe use of highway trust funds.\n  The second, of which I am a sponsor, also on behalf of the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs, is an amendment to the Tribal Self-Governance Act to \nrequire the repayment of misused Federal funds by self-governance \ntribes.\n  The third one of mine is a minor boundary modification at the \nColumbia River Gorge National Scenic Area.\n  The fourth also is one of mine for the Fish and Wildlife Service \nwhich prohibits the use of funds for land acquisition at Texas Chenier \nPlain.\n  The fifth, by Senator Hollings, to which the colloquy applies, makes \namendments to the Coastal Barrier Resource System maps in South \nCarolina.\n  The sixth, by the two Senators from Maryland, is a modification of \nsection 135 of the fiscal year 1998 Interior appropriations bill on the \nsubject of the Oxon Cove land exchange.\n  The next is by Senator Stevens which clarifies section 121, re: \n``hotshot'' crews--that is to say, forest firefighting crews--in \nAlaska.\n  The next, also by Senator Stevens, provides for exchange of lands in \nKatmai National Park.\n  And, the last by Senator Wyden of Oregon gives the Bureau of Land \nManagement authority to enter into the watershed restoration and \nenhancement agreements to the same extent that the Forest Service can \ndo so.\n  With that, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendments be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3582 to 3590) were agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           goose depredation\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, the wintering Canada goose \npopulation has increased ten times in the last twenty years, to 250,000 \ngeese in the Lower Columbia River and Willamette Valley regions. The \nresult has been large numbers of geese grazing on private agricultural \nfields of wheat, corn, grass seed, and many other crops, leading to \nhuge financial losses for farmers. Farmers have been meeting since the \nearly 1980s with local wildlife officials to create coordinated \nresource management plans to relieve depredation, but with no results. \nIn 1997, the first Pacific Flyway Council plan was assembled to deal \nwith agricultural depredation by migratory Canada geese. Farmers met \nwith state and federal wildlife officials and other interested parties \nfrom Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and California to create a plan that \nall parties could agree to--as a first step. This funding will \nimplement some of the priorities of that plan.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thanked the Chairman for helping us in the Northwest to \naddress a serious, growing problem with a tremendous overpopulation of \ngeese in the Pacific Northwest. During the course of the past year the \nOregon and Washington Farm Bureaus, the Alaska Waterfowl Conservation \nCommittee, and state and federal wildlife agencies have worked together \non a plan to address this growing problem, and I appreciate the \nChairman's help in funding this proposal. Mr. President, the\n\n[[Page S10318]]\n\nOregon and Washington Farm Bureaus have provided critical leadership in \nhelping us obtain these funds, and I wonder if the Chairman of the \nSubcommittee would engage in a colloquy about how these funds are to be \nspent.\n  Mr. GORTON. Of course, as the senior Senator from Oregon mentioned, \nthis issue is a serious concern of many of my constituents in the \nsouthwestern part of my state. I am delighted to have been able to \nprovide funds from this year's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service budget to \ndevelop a solution to this problem affecting both of our states.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Is it the Chairman's understanding that at least $152,000 \nwould be directed to fund a study of the economic impact of goose \ngrazing and to develop the most effective methods for reducing damage \nby Canada Geese; and that the remaining funds will be used to assess, \nmonitor, and reduce depredation by Canadian Geese of agricultural crops \nin Washington State and Oregon?\n  Mr. GORTON. The gentleman from Oregon is correct. The $152,000 of \nstudy money will be used to continue ongoing studies at Oregon State \nUniversity and has strong support among farmers in both our states.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Further, is it the Chairman's understanding that \nthe Committee directs the monies be allocated by and based upon the \nconsensus of the Canada Goose Agricultural Depredation Working Group, \ncomprised of, but not limited to, one person from each of the \nfollowing: Washington and Oregon Departments of Fish and Wildlife; U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service; USDA/APHIS Wildlife Services; and an \nagricultural representative each from Washington and Oregon?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes. I understand that this group, which is composed of a \ndiverse array of impacted interests, recently received approval for the \nNW Oregon/SW Washington Canada Goose Agricultural Depredation Control \nPlan which provides a foundation for many depredation reduction \nprograms. I am very impressed by the work of this group and am \ndelighted that it will have sufficient flexibility to develop solutions \nto this problem.\n\n\n                   civil war battlefield preservation\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I would like to thank the many \nSenators who have demonstrated a commitment to historic Civil War \nbattlefield preservation which culminated in this amendment to the \nInterior Appropriations Bill that directs $10 million be made available \nfor matching grants to States and local communities for Civil War \nBattlefield preservation. I especially want to thank Senators Lott and \nGorton for their efforts over the past several months as well as my \nlong time ally in this issue, Senator Jeffords.\n  Battlefield preservation is essential to allow current and future \ngenerations to experience the powerful lessons these places convey \nabout the past, present, and future of the United States. A \nbattlefield's landscape speaks beyond written accounts and motion \npicture and television recreations. The remarkable story of our \ncountry's struggle for independence cannot be compellingly told or \nwholly understood without these sites. The need to protect these sites \nof heroism and sacrifice has never been more acute. Today, residential, \ncommercial, and industrial development threaten significant battle \nsites in many states.\n  A Congressional study of the nation's Civil War sites completed in \n1993, found that 20% of the most important sites had already been lost \nand an additional 50% would be lost in the next ten years without \nconcerted action. The report specifically recommended that $70 million \nbe made available over a 7 year period for matching grants to aid land \nacquisition efforts. This amendment would for the first time provide a \n$10 million installment for this purpose.\n  The premise behind this amendment is simple: Congress must provide \nfunds to leverage nonfederal resources to preserve endangered \nbattlefields. These funds are an investment in our national heritage, \nan investment that will pay dividends not just for our towns and \nstates, but for the entire country and for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/14/senate-section/article/S10315-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Madam President, this week, Americans across the country \nwill be participating in events to pay tribute to Americans Missing in \nAction and former Prisoners of War (MIAs/POWs). With that in mind, I \nwould like to talk about an event that took place on February 12th, \n1973. On that date, a United States Air Force C-141 landed at the Gia \nLam Airport in Hanoi, North Viet Nam. The crew's mission was to pick up \nand return to the United States the first American POWs from Viet Nam. \nThis historic mission signaled the beginning of the end of a period of \nuncertainty for many American POWs and their families. The flight for \nfreedom from captivity came to a joyous conclusion when the aircraft \ncarrying these soldiers landed at Hickham Air Force Base, Hawaii, where \nfor the first time in many years, the former POWs once again stepped \nproudly and honorably onto American soil.\n  On that day in February 1973, the tail number of the aircraft \ndispatched to Gia Lam was 660177. As the primary cargo aircraft for the \nAir Force at that time, the C-141, and specifically aircraft 660177, \nhad flown cargo missions in support of U.S. operations in Viet Nam. To \nthis day, many of the former POWs that were on board that first freedom \nflight still remember the tail number--660177. In tribute to the \nhistoric mission competed by this particular aircraft, flight crew \nmembers informally named the aircraft the ``Hanoi Taxi.''\n  Following the conclusion of activities in Viet Nam, the ``Hanoi \nTaxi'' continued to serve the Air Force as a cargo aircraft. Throughout \nthe years, the role this aircraft played in our military history went \nlargely unnoticed.\n  In 1992, aircraft 660177, was assigned to the 445th Airlift Wing of \nthe United States Air Force Reserve at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base \nin Ohio. At that time, members from the maintenance squadron of the \n445th Airlift Wing noticed the words ``Hanoi Taxi'' on a label above \nthe flight engineer's panel. M/Sgt. Dave Dillon became very interested \nin this unusual appearance and with the assistance of T/Sgt Henry \nHarlow, S/Sgt. Jeff Wittman and T/Sgt. Susan Denlinger, they worked to \npiece together the story behind the name. When they learned of the \nhistoric mission that gave aircraft 660177 the name ``Hanoi Taxi'', \npersonnel from the 445th Airlift Wing began the process of transforming \nthe aircraft into a flying tribute to honor those former Prisoners of \nWar and those that are still Missing in Action.\n  Today, nose art on the ``Hanoi Taxi'' represents the emblem of the \n4th Allied Prisoner of War Wing and a plaque adorns a position of high \nvisibility near the flight deck honoring the first 40 individuals that \nmade that first flight from Hanoi on February 12, 1973. In addition, \nphotographs of the historic mission are placed throughout the aircraft \nto allow those passing through the cabin to see those brave individuals \nwho were forced to surrender their own freedom to protect ours.\n  For many of the POW's that were on board the ``Hanoi Taxi'', some of \nthe\n\n[[Page S10319]]\n\nmemories of their captivity have faded over the years, but today the \nnumber 660177 is the number of freedom--the number of the aircraft that \nreunited them with their friends and families.\n  Notable passengers on board the ``Hanoi Taxi'' include retired Navy \nRear Admiral Jeremiah Denton, who later served as a United States \nSenator. Then Air Force Captain Ed Mechenbier also was a passenger. \nToday, Brigadier General Ed Mechenbier still serves his country in the \nUnited States Air Force Reserve. The significance of the ``Hanoi Taxi'' \nis best illustrated by the following comments General Mechenbier \nprovided in a recent interview:\n\n       This airplane is more than a tribute to the POW's that were \n     fortunate to be released in 1973. It reminds us of the \n     service of more than a million Viet Nam era veterans, and it \n     says to those POW/MIAs who did not share in our joy, you are \n     not forgotten.\n\n  This week our Nation honors the sacrifices and dedication to duty, \nhonor and country that those Missing in Action and former Prisoners of \nWar have provided. As we remember the sacrifice that has been made, let \nus not forget the continuing sacrifice that our present members of our \narmed forces have made as we forge pathways of peace in an ever \nchanging environment of world events.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/14/senate-section/article/S10318-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate communities.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/14/senate-section/article/S10319-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT CONCERNING THE UNITED STATES PARTICIPATION IN THE UNITED NATIONS \n       FOR CALENDAR YEAR 1997--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 155\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit herewith a report of the activities of the \nUnited States Government in the United Nations and its affiliated \nagencies during the calendar year 1997.

Aeronautics and space activities involved 13 \ncontributing departments and agencies of the Federal Government, and \nthe results of their ongoing research and development affect the Nation \nin many ways.\n  A wide variety of aeronautics and space developments took place \nduring FY 1997. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n(NASA) successfully completed eight Space Shuttle flights. There were \n23 successful U.S. Expendable Launch Vehicle (ELV) launches in FY 1997. \nOf those, 4 were NASA-managed missions, 2 were NASA-funded/Federal \nAviation Administration (FAA)-licensed missions, 5 were Department of \nDefense-managed missions, and 12 were FAA-licensed commercial launches. \nThe Mars Pathfinder spacecraft and Sojourner rover captured the \npublic's attention with a very successful mission. Scientists also made \nsome dramatic new discoveries in various space-related fields such as \nspace science, Earth science and remote sensing, and life and \nmicrogravity science. In aeronautics, activities included work on high-\nspeed research, advanced subsonic technology, and technologies designed \nto improve the safety and efficiency of our commercial airlines and air \ntraffic control system.\n  Close international cooperation with Russia occurred on the Shuttle-\nMir docking missions and on the International Space Station program. \nThe United States also entered into new forms of cooperation with its \npartners in Europe, South America, and Asia.\n  Thus, FY 1997 was a very successful one for U.S. aeronautics and \nspace programs. Efforts in these areas have contributed significantly \nto the Nation's scientific and technical knowledge, international \ncooperation, a healthier environment, and a more competitive economy.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the National Trails System Act to designate \nthe route of the War of 1812 British invasion of Maryland and \nWashington, District of Columbia, and the route of the American \ndefense, for study for potential addition to the national trails \nsystem; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n     star-spangled banner national historic trail study act of 1998\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nhelp commemorate and preserve significant sites associated with \nAmerica's Second War of Independence, the War of 1812. My legislation, \nentitled ``The Star-Spangled Banner National Historic Trail Study Act \nof 1998,'' directs the Secretary of the Interior to initiate a study to \nassess the feasibility and desirability of designating the route of the \nBritish invasion of Washington, D.C. and their subsequent defeat at \nBaltimore, Maryland, as a National Historic Trail.\n  Since the passage of the National Trail Systems Act of 1968, the \nNational Park Service has recognized historically significant routes of \nexploration, migration and military action through its National \nHistoric Trails Program. Routes such as the Juan Bautista de Anza, \nLewis and Clark, Pony Express and Selma to Montgomery National Historic \nTrails cross our country and represent important episodes of our \nnation's history, episodes which were influential in shaping the very \nfuture of this country. It is my view that the inclusion of the Star-\nSpangled Banner Trail will give long overdue recognition to another of \nthese important events.\n  The War of 1812, and the Chesapeake Campaign in particular, mark a \nturning point in the development of the United States. Faced with the \npossibility of losing the independence for which they struggled so \nvaliantly, the citizens of this country were forced to assert \nthemselves on an international level.\n  From the period of the arrival of the British forces at Bendedict, in \nCharles County, Maryland, on August 18, 1814, to the American victory \nat Fort McHenry in Baltimore, on September 14, 1814, the war took a \ndramatic turn. The American forces, largely comprised of Maryland's \ncitizens, were able to slow the British advance through the state and \nsuccessfully defended Baltimore, leading to the retreat of the British.\n  The sites along this trail mark some of the most historically \nimportant events of the War of 1812. It begins with the only combined \nnaval and land attack on the United States, originating at Benedict, \nMaryland and continuing on to the nation's capital, Washington, D.C. It \nfollows the defeat of the Americans at the Battle of Bladensburg, the \nevacuation of the United States Government, the burning of the nation's \ncapital, including the White House and the Capitol Building, the battle \nat North Point and the bombardment of Fort McHenry, site of the \ncomposition of our National Anthem, the Star-Spangled Banner, and the \nultimate defeat of the British.\n  The route will also serve to bring awareness to several lesser known, \nbut equally important sites of the war, including St. Leonard's Creek \nin Calvert County, where two American vessels scuttled by the British \nhave recently been found, Brookeville, Maryland, which served as the \nnation's capital for one day, and Todd's Inheritance, the signal \nstation for the American defenders at Fort McHenry. These sites, and \nmany like them, will only enrich the story told along the trail. \nAdditionally, the attention given to these sites should prove \nbeneficial in terms of efforts to preserve and restore them.\n  Mr. President, the designation of the route of the British invasion \nof Washington and American defense of Baltimore as a National Historic \nTrail will serve as a reminder of the importance of the concept of \nliberty to all who experience the Star-Spangled Banner Trail. It will \nalso give long overdue recognition to those patriots whose \ndetermination to stand firm against enemy invasion and bombardment \npreserved this liberty for future generations of Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 2467. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nincrease the years for carryback of net operating losses for certain \nfarm losses; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                            tax legislation\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation for \nmyself and Senator Johnson providing farmers with the opinion of \nreceiving a refund from taxes paid in the past 10\n\n[[Page S10321]]\n\nyears for their current operating losses. Congressman John Tanner of \nTennessee is introducing an identical measure in the House.\n  Farmers are suffering huge losses through no fault of their own. No \nother business has less control of the price they can receive for what \nthy produce. Farmers cannot control the world's weather or the World \neconomy. But, those factors determine the price of corn, soybeans and \nwheat. The Freedom to Farm bill passed in 1997 sharply reduced the \nfarmer's safety net. And, now, farm prices are crashing to levels not \nseen in decades, to levels never seen before if we adjust for \ninflation. Many farmers are going to have a very difficult time being \nable to acquire the funds needed to plant their crops in the coming \nyear or maintain their annual operations. Many farmers could lose the \nfarms that have been in their families for generations. And, the \neconomic difficulty is far broader. It is already having a terrible \nripple effect on the economies of rural areas. Layoffs are starting to \noccur at agricultural equipment manufacturers and in stores in small \ntowns. But, we are just at the beginning stages of what could become a \nvery severe downtown in rural America.\n  A number of Senators and I are proposing a series of modifications in \nagricultural programs to help alleviate the problem. But, I believe the \nCongress should also pass a provision broadening existing law allowing \nfarmers to recover taxes paid in the past to cover their net operating \nlosses.\n  Under existing law, businesses including farmers can be reimbursed \nfor their business losses by receiving a rebate for taxes paid in the \nprior 2 years, 3 years in cases where there was a natural disaster. Now \nwe are facing a large economic disaster that can really sink rural \nAmerica.\n  There are widely supported proposals to allow farmers to invest some \nof their profits for up to 5 years without being taxed till the money \nis used in poor years, effectively a type of income averaging. That is \nfine. But, what is more desperately needed at this time is more \nimmediate assistance.\n  I propose that family farmers be allowed the option to get a rebate \nfrom the taxes that they paid over the past 10 years covering up to \n$200,000 in operating losses rather than the two years allowed under \ncurrent law. Many farmers cannot receive a rebate for their operating \nlosses because they were not able to make any taxable profits in the \nlast few years. The benefit would only go to farmers whose families are \nactively engaged in farming and whose business activity is mostly \nfarming. The amount of the rebate would be dependent on the amount of \nthe loss and the tax rate paid by the farmer for the paid taxes that \nare being restored.\n  The provision would cover losses occurring in 1998 or 1999. If the \nmeasure passed this year, farmers would be able to calculate their loss \nearly next year and quickly receive a rebate from the IRS for the taxes \npaid in earlier years.\n  This proposal provides a significant amount of relief when it is \nneeded early next year. It will help many farmers acquire some of the \nfunds they need to plant.\n  Current law already allows a few taxpayers in certain circumstances \nto go back and recover taxes that they paid for 10 years. I believe \nthat it should be broadened to cover farmers in this difficult time. In \nfact, there is a precedent in the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act in which \nAmtrak was allowed to use net operating losses of their predecessor \nrailroads from over 25 years in the past.\n  I urge that when the Congress considers a tax bill, this provision be \nconsidered and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, there was this lady of nobility, \nwhom everybody called ``Lib,'' who was loved by everyone who knew her. \nShe slipped away into eternity on August 15 prompting\n\n[[Page S10327]]\n\nsadness among the multitudes whom she had helped and befriended during \nher busy lifetime.\n  I met Mrs. Elisabeth Smith in 1972, the year I first became a \ncandidate for the U.S. Senate. She came to our campaign headquarters in \nRaleigh's Sir Walter Hotel, announcing that she had come to support \nme--perhaps the most improbable Senate candidate in the history of the \nrepublic.\n  And support me she did, vigorously, from the first campaign in 1972 \ndown through the years until 1996, the year of my fourth reelection.\n  That day in 1972, she had just retired after long service as a \nregistered nurse in the office of a prominent Raleigh physician.\n  There was never any question about her fervent love for her country, \nnor her devotion to the moral and spiritual principles laid down by the \nFounding Fathers.\n  She agreed to take on the responsibilities of treasurer of four of \nthe five campaigns conducted by the Helms for Senate campaign \norganizations.\n  Year after year, Lib Smith was a sort of beloved ``mother hen'' to \nthe throngs of volunteer campaign workers as well as those who bore \nprimary responsibilities conducting the campaigns. She was a soothing \ninfluence when tempers festered. She was a reliable friend to all who \nneeded her. And she performed perfectly and responsibly as the official \nTreasurer of every Helms for Senate campaign from 1978 through 1990.\n  She was a faithful member of St. Timothy's Episcopal Church, the \nDiocese of North Carolina, and the Altar Guild. In her ``spare time'' \nshe did the needlework for St. Timothy's Altar Vestments--as well as \nanything else that needed doing at her church.\n  I learned only recently that she was renowned as a ballroom dancer--\nand as an artist who painted many portraits of loved ones and friends. \nHer two children--son Phillip W. Smith and daughter Mrs. Gayle \nBullock--provided her with four grandchildren and six great-\ngrandchildren.\n  Mr. President, I know of no one who enjoyed life more than Lib Smith. \nShe brought joy and comfort to countless others. She was a wonderfully \nremarkable lady whom I will never forget and to whom I shall always be \ngrateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/14/senate-section/article/S10326-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10327-S10328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VERMONT MOZART FESTIVAL\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an event \nthat has been a Vermont cultural tradition for twenty-five years. The \nVermont Mozart Festival began in 1974, and through the vision of its \nfounders, it has grown tremendously in popularity, today attracting \nover 17,000 advance ticket buyers for a series of 25 concerts in 16 \ndifferent locations across the state.\n  The international acclaim of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is clearly \ndemonstrated by the long distances loyal festival attendees travel each \nyear. Concert-goers flock from all across the United States, Canada and \neven as far away as Europe to hear top-caliber musicians perform world-\nclass compositions. These faithful return year after year to hear the \nworks of a variety of composers, with a primary focus on the \nsymphonies, concertos and other brilliant works of Mozart.\n  The festival is a tradition for the Leahy family. I was honored when \nthe festival asked me to speak at a concert to honor its 25th \nanniversary. I took this opportunity to praise the musicians but also \nto acknowledge the dedication of the festival organizers and the \nexpansive volunteer network, now numbering over 150. The fruits of \ntheir efforts are clear from the warm applause that bring the curtain \ndown at the end of each performance.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a recent article about the Vermont Mozart \nFestival that appeared in the Rutland Herald be printed in the Record \nso that all Senators and their staff can learn more about this great \nVermont tradition.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the Rutland Herald, July 5, 1998]\n\n          Festival Celebrates 25th Year With More Great Music\n\n                             (By Jim Lowe)\n\n       The Vermont Mozart Festival's 25 years of success come from \n     turning adversity to advantage, making the most of a \n     situation, according to two of its founders, Melvin Kaplan \n     and William Metcalfe.\n       When Kaplan, the festival's artistic director from the \n     beginning, discovered Shelburne Farms in a book of North \n     American barns, he got himself invited to tea with Elizabeth \n     Webb, the estate's owner.\n       ``No one living in this community 25 years ago had ever \n     seen it. It was a private home. It was like stepping into a \n     fairy tale,'' Kaplan said.\n       ``So I said to her, `Gee, two years from now we're going to \n     start a festival, and it would be wonderful to have concerts \n     here.' And she said, `Why don't you come and have your \n     concerts here?' A lot of people wouldn't have asked the \n     question.''\n       Five months before the festival opened, however, the Webb \n     children reduced the offer to only a few concerts each year. \n     ``Because of that, we turned it into doing multiple \n     locations, which turned out to be a big plus,'' Kaplan said.\n       ``I think of the concept, which is so special,'' added \n     Metcalfe, who conducts choral and orchestral concerts, as \n     well as leading the annual Gilbert and Sullivan operetta. ``I \n     think the concept, in my mind, is that you take advantage of \n     the special locations we have around Burlington, and you put \n     high quality music into those locations, and build programs \n     in a way which suits the locations. I think that makes this \n     festival very special.''\n       The Vermont Mozart Festival is celebrating its 25th \n     anniversary this summer with 25 concerts at 16 different \n     locations in 12 towns. After a special presentation of the \n     Peter Shaffer play, ``Amadeus,'' July 10 and 11 at \n     Burlington's Flynn Theatre, produced with Vermont Stage \n     Company and the Flynn, the festival will formally open July \n     12 with the orchestral concert at Shelburne Farms, including \n     the annual dressage exhibition. The festival actually opened \n     July 4 with a pre-season holiday concert at Sugarbush, and \n     closes Aug. 12 at Stowe's Trapp Family Meadow.\n       ``They've got a great theme--the whole notion of Mozart, \n     the greatest composer who ever lived,'' Thomas Philibon, \n     executive director of the Vermont Symphony Orchestra, said of \n     the festival's success.\n       ``They've been at it all those years, and they really know \n     how to fix up the events and make it so they can attract a \n     lot of happy people.''\n       It all started when Kaplan, a professional oboist and New \n     York concert manager, and his wife, violist Ynez Lynch, \n     bought a barn in Charlotte in 1971, and converted it into a \n     house. He was approached by University of Vermont Lane Series \n     director Jack Trevithick, UVM choral director James Chapman \n     and Metcalfe, who though a UVM history professor had taken \n     over the music department for a year. They asked him to join \n     them in creating a summer music event.\n       Thus, in 1974, under the auspices of the UVM Lanes Series, \n     the first Vermont Mozart Festival presented 10 concerts over \n     a two-week period, including the opening concert at the UVM \n     Show Barn, Mozart piano concertos on the Lake Champlain Ferry \n     performed by Beaux Arts Trio pianist Menahem Pressler, and \n     myriad ancillary activities. The concert in the Shelburne \n     Farms ballroom was the first time the Webb estate had ever \n     been used for a public event.\n       Kaplan had connections throughout the music world, and \n     invited some of his well-known musician friends, including \n     Pressler, New York Philharmonic Principal Flutist Julius \n     Baker, as well as his own world-touring ensembles, the New \n     York Chamber Soloists and the Festival Winds. Over 25 years, \n     the festival has attracted some of the world's greatest \n     musicians, including a benefit concert in 1980 by Benny \n     Goodman.\n       ``He looked like a very old man,'' Kaplan said of the great \n     jazz clarinetist's performance. ``He walked up on stage, \n     started to play, and lost 40 years. It was just \n     astonishing.''\n       The festival featured L'Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal \n     (Montreal Symphony) in 1989, but over the years it has \n     presented concerts by such famed ensembles as the Beaux Arts \n     Trio, the Guarneri Quartet, and the Tokyo Quartet. The \n     Emerson String Quartet and the Ying Quartet can thank the \n     festival for some of their earliest concerts. (Both are \n     returning this season.)\n       ``It becomes more like family,'' Kaplan said. ``The people \n     that come here come from San Francisco, Montreal, Ottawa, \n     Philadelphia, New York, etc. Some people come from Europe. \n     Almost all of them have known each other from 30 to 50 years. \n     It's like getting a big family back together.''\n       ``It's also true that we've had Vermont musicians here, and \n     it's still true. It's a wonderful mix from people from all \n     over the place,'' Metcalfe added.\n       Programming, too, has broadened out of necessity. The first \n     two years were devoted entirely to Mozart, including \n     symphonies, piano concertos, chamber and choral works. After \n     the second year, with three weeks of concerts, it was decided \n     to vary the programming. In addition to the 206 works by \n     Mozart the festival programmed over 25 years, 1,948 by other \n     composers have been performed.\n       ``In the beginning, we felt that an audience of 600 or 700 \n     for big events was enormous,'' Kaplan said. ``When we started \n     to get audiences of 1,900 and 2,000, I convinced the board it \n     made no sense to play a Mozart symphony with just five \n     strings. Little by little, we've increased it so that we have \n     as big an orchestra as we could put on the Shelburne Farms \n     porch. We're stretching it a tiny bit to do Brahms Double \n     Concerto this year.''\n       Still, Mozart remains the staple, and for this year's final \n     concert at Shelburne Farms Aug. 1, Metcalfe will conduct his \n     Oriana\n\n[[Page S10328]]\n\n     Singers and the Festival Orchestra in Robert Levin's new \n     orchestration of the Requiem. (Mozart died before the work \n     was completed; the version traditionally performed is by his \n     student, Franz Sussmayr.)\n       ``It's different, and I think it's really good,'' Metcalfe \n     said. ``Part of the Mozart Festival tradition is to introduce \n     new things as well as maintain continuity. It opens your \n     ears.''\n       The festival was a popular success from the beginning, with \n     all concerts selling out the first year, but achieving \n     financial stability took a while. After opening with a \n     $36,000 budget, the festival incurred substantial deficits \n     for its first three years, while under the financial umbrella \n     of the University of Vermont.\n       When UVM then dropped the festival as a financial \n     liability, its leaders managed to turn it to their advantage. \n     Previously, Burlington businessman Duncan Brown had told \n     Kaplan that if there was any problem with the university, he \n     would solve it.\n       ``I called him,'' Kaplan said. ``He said, `What do you \n     need?' I said I needed $55,000 and a secretary to do nothing \n     but that, and an office for her.''\n       Brown hired the secretary, provided space for her at his \n     office, and called together a meeting of a hundred of his \n     music-loving friends and acquaintances at St. Paul's \n     Cathedral.\n       ``Ultimately, it ended up with a bunch of people sitting \n     around saying they didn't want it to die. They met again, and \n     formed the corporation.'' Kaplan said. ``It was much better \n     for the festival to have a community board that was invested \n     emotionally and financially in the whole operation.''\n       Today, the festival has a budget of just over $600,000, \n     with a year-round full-time staff of three, two more in \n     summer. Ticket sales have grown from $13,917 in 1974 to \n     $307,316 in 1997. This year, some 17,000 tickets--6,000 more \n     than last year--were sold by the June 15 discount deadline.\n       If tickets were to pay the cost of the festival, though, \n     they would be $30 as opposed to the $19 charged, explained \n     Trish Sweeney, the festival's executive director since 1996. \n     Fund-raising activities make up the rest, including \n     individual gifts (membership), and merchandise sales, but the \n     largest portion is business sponsorship.\n       Volunteers, numbering some 160, represent the festival's \n     major support group. It requires 60 for each Shelburne Farms \n     concert. ``We have so many who are coming to every concert, \n     which is a blessing because they really know what they are \n     doing,'' Sweeney said. ``People jockey for concerts. For the \n     smaller ones, we have to turn people away.''\n       Although the festival is celebrating its 25th anniversary \n     this year, it doesn't have time to rest. Most of its next \n     season is already set, much of it based on the Paris Piano \n     Trio, which was so successful in the winter season's \n     Burlington chamber music series.\n       ``I think we're going to do the Beethoven Triple Concerto \n     on the opening concert,'' Kaplan said. ``And then on the \n     weekend, on the Friday, Saturday and Sunday, they'll each \n     play a solo with orchestra, and they'll do a trio concert in \n     the middle of that week.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/14/senate-section/article/S10327-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              IN RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL PAYROLL WEEK 1998\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to take a few \nminutes of Senate business to recognize National Payroll Week 1998, \nwhich has been designated as September 14-18.\n  National Payroll Week was founded by the American Payroll Association \nin 1996 to honor the men and women whose tax contributions support the \nAmerican Dream and the payroll professionals who are dedicated to \nprocessing those contributions.\n  In particular, the Susquehanna Valley Chapter of the American Payroll \nAssociation represents 186,000 residents in Pennsylvania who are \nemployed by 21 businesses. These taxpayers and businesses contribute \nmillions of dollars to the federal treasury through payroll taxes each \nyear. These taxes go toward important civic projects including roads, \nschools and crime prevention. In addition, taxpayers and payroll \nprofessionals are partners in upholding the Social Security and \nMedicare systems.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join with me in commending the \ntaxpayers and payroll professionals who, through the collection, \nreporting and payment of payroll taxes, have set a national precedent \nof what works in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/14/senate-section/article/S10328-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HEROES IN REDFORD TOWNSHIP\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

On June 10, 1998 both \ngentlemen were patrolling the South end of Redford Township when they \nmade a routine traffic stop. It was discovered upon investigating that \nthe driver of the vehicle had a revoked driver's license. Sgt. Turner \nand Sgt. Pasciak approached the car to place the driver under arrest. \nAs Sgt. Pasciak began to pat the subject down, the subject pulled out a \ngun and began to shoot. Sgt. Pasciak was critically wounded while Sgt. \nTurner shot back to protect himself and Sgt. Pasciak. Further gunfight \nensued between Sgt. Turner and the subject ending in the subject being \nmortally wounded. The lives of both Sgt. Turner and his partner were \nsaved.\n  Sgt. Turner and Sgt. Pasciak displayed tremendous bravery on June 10, \n1998. They are true heroes whom Redford Township and the State of \nMichigan should be very proud of. It is my pleasure to honor both of \nthem. I also send my warmest ``get well'' wishes to Sgt. Pasciak who is \nrecovering from his gunshot wounds at home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/14/senate-section/article/S10328-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EBRI'S 20TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an \norganization that has served the U.S. Senate well for 20 years. The \norganization I want to talk about is the Employee Benefit Research \nInstitute or EBRI, as we call it. EBRI is observing its 20th \nanniversary today, September 14. Created with the help of a handful of \nemployee benefit consultants and actuaries in 1978 who wanted to fill \nthe void that existed relating to data about employee benefits, EBRI \nhas increased its membership to include representatives from pension \nfunds to Fortune 500 companies, labor unions, and trade associations.\n  With this broad representation, EBRI has the ability to influence \npolicymakers and elected officials throughout the country. But EBRI \nuses its influence wisely. EBRI does not lobby Members of Congress or \nother governmental agencies. Rather, its mission is to provide \nobjective, nonpartial information on the issues of economic security \nand employee benefits. EBRI does its job very, very well.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I can \npersonally attest to the value of EBRI's work and the expertise of its \nstaff. Last year, the CEO of EBRI, Dallas Salisbury moderated a panel \nforum consisting of 6 experts who discussed the role of employment in \nretirement income. This forum led to a Senate hearing on the issue of \nthe implications of raising the retirement age, as well as a number of \narticles in newspapers and magazines on the need to consider whether \nolder Americans have sufficient opportunities to stay employed.\n  More recently, EBRI was actively involved with its educational \npartner, the American Savings Education Council (ASEC), in the planning \nof the first National Summit on Retirement Savings. This Summit was \npart of an initiative I introduced in the Senate called the Savings Are \nVital to Everyone's Retirement or SAVER Act. The Summit attracted \ninternational attention and has put the Department of Labor, ASEC, and \nstate and local governments on a course toward enhancing the awareness \nof Americans about the need to save for retirement and how to go about \nit.\n  I know my colleagues value the work of EBRI just as much I do. In the \nyears ahead, I am sure we will continue to rely heavily on the research \nand the publications produced by EBRI. The issues EBRI concerns itself \nwith--employee benefits and income security--are receiving more \nnational attention than ever before. EBRI's contributions as an \nobjective provider of information will help make the job of ensuring \nAmericans have health and income security in retirement easier to \nachieve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/14/senate-section/article/S10328-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10328-S10329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BENNY GOLSON\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nBenny Golson for his extraordinary career as a musician and a composer.\n  I am proud to say that Mr. Golson began his professional career in \nPhiladelphia. He went on to compose music for many household names such \nas Diana Ross, Sammy Davis, Jr., Mickey Rooney and Dizzy Gillespie.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a \nvery special group of young men. On August 6, 1998 the Georgetown Major \nBoys Baseball Little League Team won the Michigan state little league \nchampionship in Ishpeming, Michigan. They then continued on to win the \ncentral region championship in Indianapolis. They competed in the \nSanctioned Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pennsylvania \nfrom August 20-30. Getting to the World Series is testament to the \ngreat talent and efforts of this team.\n  The following 14 boys who make up the team, have undoubtedly made the \ncity of Jenison, Michigan, very proud: Jesse Barfelz, Brandon Button, \nTony Clausen, Kevin Hogan, Adam Kretz, Sean Markle, Brett Meyer, Billy \nMiller, Casey Robrahn, John Sheeran, Derek Stempin, Peter Vanderkalk, \nBen VanKlompenberg and Cody Fennema. At this time I would also like to \nrecognize the coaches, Tom Meyer, Tom Button and Dick LeFever. It is a \ncombination of good coaching and talent that leads a team to the kind \nof success this team has enjoyed.\n  As an avid fan of baseball it is my pleasure, once again, to \ncongratulate the Georgetown Major Boys little league team on their \nstate Championship. It is very encouraging to see young people strive \nfor such excellence. This team has made Georgetown Charter Township and \nthe entire state of Michigan very proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/14/senate-section/article/S10329-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 1998\n\n  Mr. GORTON.
