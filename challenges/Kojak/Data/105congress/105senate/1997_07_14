Mr. President, today the Senate will begin consideration of \nthe DOD appropriations bill. I urge all Senators who have amendments to \nnotify the chairman and the ranking member. They are here, and they are \nready to proceed with this very important legislation. So we need to \nknow what amendments will be offered in order to make substantial \nprogress today.\n\n  Under the previous order, at 6 o'clock this afternoon the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to conduct a cloture vote on the \nnomination of Joel Klein to be an Assistant Attorney General at the \nJustice Department. In accordance with the consent agreement, if \ncloture is invoked, there will be an additional 3 hours for debate on \nthe nomination before the Senate votes on the nomination of Mr. Klein. \nThat vote may occur tomorrow; therefore, following the cloture vote at \n6 p.m., the Senate will resume the Department of Defense appropriations \nbill.\n  As previously announced, it is the hope that the Senate will complete \naction on three or possibly four major appropriations bills this week. \nTherefore, late sessions can be expected and votes should be \nanticipated throughout each day of the Senate this week. We hope to \nconclude the Department of Defense appropriations bill on Tuesday. We \nwould like to then move to the energy and water appropriations bill. I \nbelieve next we would try to go to the foreign ops appropriations bill, \nand then perhaps Friday we would be ready to go to legislative \nappropriations.\n  In the interim, we also have a couple of bills that we may want to \ncall up for consideration. One of them is a wildlife refuge bill \nreported overwhelmingly from the House of Representatives and held at \nthe desk; and another one is having to do with dolphin legislation \nwhich has been reported from the Commerce Committee. We may look at an \nopportunity to begin consideration of that legislation on Friday of \nthis week.\n  I thank my colleagues for their cooperation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/14/senate-section/article/S7401-6", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7401-S7404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now proceed to the consideration of S. 1005, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1005) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1998, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n\n[[Page S7402]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing Appropriations Committee staff be granted floor privileges \nduring the consideration of this bill, S. 1005, and also for a \nlegislative fellow on detail to our committee: Steve Cortese, Dona \nPate, Jay Kimmitt, Justin Weddle, Michelle Randolph, Mazie Mattson, \nMary Marshall, Gary Reese, Susan Hogan, John Young, Sid Ashworth, Kelly \nHartline, Charlie Houy, Emelie East, and Mike Morris.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It includes the request for the minority.\n  Mr. President, we are now considering the Defense Appropriations Act \nfor the fiscal year 1998. This is the first of the 1998 appropriations \nbills that will come before the Senate. I am pleased that we can \ncommence this year's work with the focus on national security.\n  To date, the Appropriations Committee has reported three bills to the \nSenate; defense, foreign operations, and energy and water.\n  Tomorrow, our committee will report three additional bills; we \nbelieve the legislative branch; Treasury, general Government; and \nCommerce, State, Justice.\n  On Thursday, the committee will report the Transportation, \nAgriculture, military construction, and HUD-VA and NASA bills. That is \nour hope.\n  In all, if we can do that, the committee will have reported 12 of the \n13 bills prior to the August recess. The District of Columbia bill will \nawait action by the Governmental Affairs Committee on the \nadministration's plan to change the Federal payment program for the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  I state at the outset that this schedule is possible because of the \nbipartisan approach that Senator Robert Byrd and I have developed as we \nhave worked together not only now but over the years and the \ncooperation between our staffs on all these bills.\n  I urge the Senate to maintain that bipartisan approach to this \nappropriations process. We have sought and the leader has pledged to \nassist in obtaining floor time to move these bills to conference this \nmonth.\n  We will not be able to meet our October 1 deadline to complete action \non these spending bills unless we move them expeditiously here on the \nfloor and get them to a conference committee prior to the time we leave \nin August so that all of our and the staff work related to the \nconferences may be completed during that period and our staffs also \nhave time to take some needed leave then, too.\n  This bill was reported by the Appropriations Committee to the Senate \nby a unanimous vote of 28 to 0. That again reflects the bipartisan \napproach that my colleague and friend, Senator Inouye of Hawaii, and I \nhave tried to maintain with regard to this subcommittee.\n  This bill is within the 602(b) allocation for the Defense \nSubcommittee. It provides $247 billion in spending authority for 1998. \nThat is an increase of $3.25 billion over the President's request and \n$3.1 billion over the 1997 appropriations, but it is consistent with \nthe allocation under the budget agreement which was reached with the \nPresident.\n  The 602(b) allocation for the Defense Subcommittee is $1.1 billion \nbelow that provided to the House subcommittee. Consistent with the \nbudget agreement, our Appropriations Committee allocated a larger share \nof the defense 050 function for defense nuclear energy programs. That \nis under the energy and water bill chaired by the Senator from New \nMexico [Mr. Domenici]. Those items are funded in the energy and water \ndevelopment bill that the Senate will consider immediately after this \nbill.\n  At the request of Senator Inouye and myself, the Subcommittee on \nDefense Appropriations recommended a balanced bill to the full \ncommittee, and we believe that it addresses key funding needs for \npersonnel, readiness, and modernization at the Department of Defense.\n  This bill and our report have been available to all Senators since \nFriday morning of last week. I will not describe the bill in detail but \nwill touch on a few of the key items.\n  Our bill fully funds the authorized end strength for the military \npersonnel for 1998, including the 2.8-percent pay raise. We have added \n$380 million for real property maintenance, with $100 million set aside \nfor refurbishing Army barracks.\n  We have increased funding for the request for environmental \nrestoration, particularly at formerly used defense sites. And $1.9 \nbillion is provided for overseas contingency operations in Southwest \nAsia and Bosnia, and $261 million is added to correct a second \nconsecutive failure by the Department of Defense to adequately fund \nmilitary health care programs. We have adequately funded it to the \nextent that we have money to do so.\n  We have added $437 million to the budget request to meet the minimum \nspending needs of the Army National Guard. I want to take just a \nmoment, Mr. President, to thank all of my colleagues who joined with \nSenator Bond, Senator Ford, Senator Inouye, and myself to sponsor \nlegislation last week to elevate the rank and status of the Chief of \nthe National Guard.\n  The adoption of that legislation as an amendment to S. 936, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1998, will help \nensure that the National Guard's needs will be met during the \nformulation of the Department's budget and not solely by the \nintervention of Congress.\n  I am going to repeat that. It has taken the intervention of Congress \neach year to try to get the Guard the money it needs to perform its \njob. I believe this amendment will go a long way toward changing that \nstatus. I ask unanimous consent that the list of cosponsors for the \nNational Guard amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n             Cosponsors for the National Guard Legislation\n\n       Senators Stevens, Inouye, Bond, Ford, Cochran, Domenici, \n     McConnell, Burns, Shelby, and Gregg.\n       Senators Bennett, Campbell, Craig, Faircloth, Hutchinson, \n     Byrd, Hollings, Leahy, Bumpers, and Lautenberg.\n       Senators Mikulski, Reid, Murray, Dorgan, Boxer, Wyden, \n     Torricelli, Smith of Oregon, Sarbanes, and Murkowski.\n       Senators Landrieu, Johnson, Jeffords, Feinstein, Enzi, \n     DeWine, D'Amato, Conrad, Bryan, and Breaux.\n       Senators Bingaman, Akaka, Frist, Roberts, Baucus, Daschle, \n     Sessions, Roth, and Mack.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Senator Inouye and I have listened closely to the \npriorities identified by the service chiefs in reviewing the \nmodernization accounts. And $3.8 billion has been provided over the \nbudget request to address aviation, shipbuilding, munitions, and \nsupport equipment needs in the procurement accounts.\n  Our bill includes an additional $616 million for research and \ndevelopment and includes an increase of $474 million for national \nmissile defense and $175 million for additional breast cancer research.\n  The bill includes nearly $700 million for counterdrug missions, and \nincludes funds for the Gulf States initiative, and authority for the \nNational Guard to spend an additional $50 million for counterdrug \nmissions during fiscal year 1998.\n  Consistent with the President's request, the bill provides $300 \nmillion for support of the defense missions undertaken by the Coast \nGuard.\n  The bill before the Senate reflects 11 hearings undertaken by this \nsubcommittee since February, reviewing all aspects of our defense \nprogram. Additionally, many priorities identified in this bill reflect \nvisits by Members to defense bases here at home and abroad.\n  This year we have taken three committee delegations overseas to \nevaluate how this money should be spent. In January we visited Israel, \nEgypt, Jordan, the Gaza, Kuwait, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Hungary, Italy, \nand Bosnia.\n  In March, we met with senior Russian military leaders in Khabarosvk, \nSakalin, and Vladivostok and held talks with senior officials of the \nNorth Korean Government in Pyongyang. We also visited South Korea prior \nto that visit.\n  Last month, we went to Brussels and met with the Secretary-General of\n\n[[Page S7403]]\n\nNATO and senior United States commanders to better understand the \nsituation in Bosnia and the potential costs to the United States \ntaxpayer of NATO expansion.\n  Through these experiences, many of us have drawn a strong impression \nthat we are spending too much overseas, Mr. President, with too little \noversight by Congress of commitments made by our regional U.S. \ncommanders whom we call the CINC's.\n  Senator Inouye and I have discussed these concerns at length with the \nSecretary of Defense, Bill Cohen. In response to our efforts, DOD is \ntaking steps to reduce forces in Southwest Asia and in the vicinity of \nBosnia. Secretary Cohen informed us just prior to the markup of this \nbill in the full committee that the Department will reduce overseas \nJoint Chiefs of Staff exercises in 1998 and will reduce the size of \njoint and unified headquarters overseas.\n  As a result of these consultations, the committee adopted modest \nreductions to the budget for programs in these areas. We are indebted \nto Secretary Cohen for his cooperation with us. I will say I think this \nbill reflects the relationship he has developed not only with Senator \nInouye and myself but with all members of the Defense Subcommittee.\n  Beyond these operations, the committee has also pressed for greater \nfinancial oversight of the regional CINC operation. The Vice Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Joe Ralston, has led this effort to increase \nfinancial limits and visibility on the deployment decisions that are \nmade by the CINC's.\n  Mr. President, it is my judgment that no military officer has the \nunilateral right to commit U.S. forces and taxpayer dollars overseas \nwithout the approval of the Secretary of Defense, the President of the \nUnited States, and the concurrence of Congress, and, specifically, to \nspend money, it is required there be express appropriations of funds \nfor that purpose. I am talking about increasing deployment overseas of \nU.S. forces and increasing and expending from taxpayer dollars by CINC \noperations.\n  This committee will not hesitate to reduce the funding available to \nthe Department and severely limit the Department's spending and \nflexibility unless further progress is made in this area. I want to \nmake certain we have no desire to interfere with the President's role \nas Commander in Chief, nor do we have difficulty with the role played \nby the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  But military officers in command in the field cannot obligate our \nNation to long-term overseas expenditures or deployments--they have \nbeen doing so, Mr. President, and that must come to an end. That is \nwhat is increasing the defense budget. Decisions made in the field \nwithout proper knowledge being transmitted to Congress on the \ncommitments that are being made abroad, long-term commitments--in one \ninstance, we were told it was a 20- to 50-year deployment that \nconstruction was being planned on, and not one word had been said to \nCongress about a deployment of that length.\n  Mr. President, there are many other issues in the bill that I could \nspeak about at this time. It is time for me to yield to my \ndistinguished comanager of this bill, my good friend, the senior \nSenator from Hawaii, Senator Inouye.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, may I first thank my distinguished friend \nfrom Alaska for his very generous remarks.\n  Mr. President, I rise this day to offer my complete support for the \nfiscal year 1998 DOD appropriations bill. As noted by the chairman of \nthis committee, this bill is well within the budget agreement. It is \nabout $1.2 billion below the amount authorized last week by the Senate \nfor these programs. I should point out to all of my colleagues that the \nchairman and I are hopeful we will not have to reconsider items that \nwere debated and voted upon last week.\n  Let me assure my colleagues that we intend to modify this bill to \nconform to many of the changes that were approved by the Senate last \nweek. We look forward to working with Members and their staffs over the \nnext 24 hours to ensure that their views are heard.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to report to my colleagues that this is a \ngood bill. It is a product of a truly bipartisan process. As the \nchairman pointed out, this bill received unanimous support from members \nof the Appropriations Committee. For those of us who have had the \nprivilege and great honor of serving in this body for many years, you \nwill know that it is almost impossible to get unanimous support from \nthe members of the Appropriations Committee.\n  Therefore, I wish to commend Chairman Stevens and his capable staff \nin putting this bill together. It is a tough bill, but, Mr. President, \nit is a fair bill. It protects both the interests of the Nation and \nthose of the individual Members of this body.\n  It is very clear that the top priority of this bill is supporting our \ntroops, the men and women who are willing to stand in harm's way to \nsafeguard the Nation. Our chairman, Chairman Stevens, has pointed out \nin great detail the items that are found in this measure, and included \nin these items we find the procurement of many necessary weapons \nsystems. Each of these recommendations, I believe, will help improve \nthe capability of the Defense Department to protect and defend our \nNation, and, most importantly, it will help to deter aggression against \nthe United States and its interests.\n  Many of my colleagues have commented, why are we spending all this \nmoney? Mr. President, one may think that we are in the business of \nmaking war. But essentially and fundamentally, we are in the business \nof preventing war, and we have learned from experience, bloody \nexperience, that the most effective way to prevent war is to be \nprepared for war, and to be prepared for war, we taxpayers will be \ncalled upon to spend some money. If given a choice of our citizens \ndying on the field or spending more money so that this can be \nprevented, I am certain all of us would go for the latter.\n\n  This bill also provides for programs which may not be directly \ndefense in nature, but I think it somehow gives a fuller picture of the \nCongress of the United States. We have in this measure $175 million for \nbreast cancer. I am certain most people realize that the women in the \nmilitary, like women outside the service, may have to face this tragedy \nwith breast cancer.\n  Though we are not directly responsible for the Coast Guard, as the \nchairman pointed out, we have $300 million included in this measure to \nsupport the Coast Guard. Mr. President, the Coast Guard is one of the \ngreat institutions and services that we do not hear enough about. They \nare out there 24 hours a day, saving lives. They are out there \nmonitoring the seas in our behalf. But importantly, in times of war and \npeace, they carry out military missions. They carried out great \nmissions in the gulf war, though you very seldom hear about them. We \nalso have, Mr. President, in this measure, a sum of $48 million to \nmaintain a program that our National Guard has been carrying on for \ntroubled young people. It has been one of the most successful programs \nwe have had in dealing with troubled teenagers.\n  We also have added nearly $40 million above the budget request for \ndrug interdiction. We are in the business of using DOD assets for \nfighting drugs. We have $1.3 billion to restore the environment. The \nDepartment of Defense is a responsible citizen, a responsible neighbor. \nLet it not be forgotten, they, like all of us, are concerned about the \nenvironment.\n  So, Mr. President, may I once again advise my colleagues that this is \na good bill. It is a tough bill, but it is a fair bill. The Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee faced several challenges in fashioning this \nbill, including reducing funding by $1.2 billion below the amounts \nauthorized. We wanted to spend the whole amount authorized, but the \ncommittee felt at this time in our history that expenditure was not \nnecessary, and other defense-related needs were a higher priority. As a \nresult, this is a tight bill. However, it satisfies the highest \npriority needs of the Defense Department while living within the \nconstraints of the subcommittee's present allocation.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge all the Members of this Senate to support \nthis measure. Once again, I thank my chairman, the great Senator from \nAlaska, for his generous words.\n\n[[Page S7404]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 837\n\n  (Purpose: To provide an additional $60 million for ``Former Soviet \n          Threat Reduction'' activities for fiscal year 1998)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have an amendment that I send to the \ndesk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 837.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 30, line 5, strike the number ``$2,431,741,000'' \n     and insert in lieu thereof ``$2,411,741,000'';\n       On page 28, line number 9, strike the number \n     ``$2,865,800,000'' and insert in lieu thereof \n     ``$2,832,800,000'';\n       On page 20, line number 12, strike the number \n     ``$322,200,000'' and insert in lieu thereof ``$382,200,000''.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this will restore $60 million to the \nFormer Soviet Union Threat Reduction Program. We call it the Nunn-Lugar \nProgram. It will fully fund the program. We had reduced $60 million in \naccordance with the Senate Armed Services Committee's original \nreduction. During debate on the floor last week of the Armed Services \nbill, this item was increased. Since it is the only one that was really \na substantial increase, we seek to have this adopted.\n  We have no jurisdiction over Department of Energy funds, and we have \nused different offsets to restore this $60 million, but we seek to have \nthis amendment adopted because it is a major difference between the \nArmed Services bill and this bill represented by our committee.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to say this matter has the \nconcurrence on the minority.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 837) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to state to the Senate that while \nwe have been told there are some possible amendments, I have not been \ninformed of any Senator's intent, for sure, to offer an amendment. I do \nwant to tell the Senate I intend to move to go to third reading if \nthere are not amendments brought to us and offered for debate.\n  We have a very long program for appropriations this week and we hope \nto finish three, maybe four, maybe even five of the bills this week. If \nthis bill is not going to be the subject of amendments today, we should \nknow that soon. We are obligated to go to debate on the cloture motion \nat 6 o'clock, but we could, if the Senators would bring their \namendments over here prior to that time, finish the debate on \nsignificant amendments and vote on them after the consideration of the \ncloture motion or as soon as the vote on cloture is over, and enable us \nto move to another appropriation tomorrow.\n  It is our hope that Senators will present their amendments now. It is \nhard to get people to listen, but I hope they will listen because I am \ngoing to move to go to third reading if we do not have substantive \namendments presented here before that time comes.\n  Mr. INOUYE. If I may, Mr. President, I wish to most vigorously \nassociate myself with the remarks of my chairman. He means what he \nsays. If my colleagues do not have amendments ready, we are ready to go \nto third reading. This is an important measure and therefore it should \nnot be held up. I hope our colleagues will respond to our chairman's \nrequest that amendments be brought up.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the two of us wish to emphasize to the \nSenate that this bill came out of our committee by unanimous vote. It \nhas been a long time since that happened.

Madam President, on Friday, July 11, I read of the \nretirement of the giant advertising mogul, the macho, motorcycle-\nriding, man-beast, popularly known as Joe Camel.\n  Apparently old Joe is throwing in the towel and forever taking off \nhis black, wrap-around shades to pack his hump and slip quietly off to \nthe anthropomorphic rest home for flashy marketing tools. It is rumored \nthat his bunk mates will be that patch-wearing, black-and-white spotted \nseller of Budweiser, Spuds McKenzie and Alex, the Golden Retriever who \nfinally wore himself out retrieving bottles of Strohs beer from the \nrefrigerator for his ever-demanding master.\n  I, for one, will not lament Joe's departure from the American \nadvertising scene. Maybe R.J. Reynolds' decision to retire him from the \nmurky business of luring impressionable young people to ``light up'' \nwill influence other corporate giants like Budweiser to ``kick the \nhabit'' and ask their famous mono-syllable frogs to croak their last \ncroak. Budweiser might even finally be moved to blow the whistle on the \n``Bud Bowl.''\n  Our kids are faced with enough temptations through peer pressure, and \nbecause of the influence of a fast-paced, morally anemic society \nwithout the influence of cute and clever cartoon seducers such as Joe \nthe Camel; the Budweiser frogs; football-helmeted, dancing beer \nbottles; or pomp and circumstance parading dogs, holding bourbon \nbottles instead of diplomas in their mouths.\n  All of these Madison Avenue devices, designed to project harmless or \nhip images to young impressionable minds, only serve to reenforce the \nlure of a sterile, pleasure-seeking existence which suggests no goals, \nbut a good time on Saturday night.\n  I, for one, am delighted with the news of Joe Camel's departure and \nheartened by the fact that at least some in our attention-fractured, \napathetic society have been outraged by the not-so-subliminal attempts \nto use children to fill up corporate coffers. There is a lesson here \nfor those whose allegiance to profits outweighs any sense of moral \nobligation. It is, to paraphrase a famous quote, that those who ride \nthe back of the tiger, or the camel for that matter, might just end up \ninside.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/14/senate-section/article/S7404-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. INOUYE.

Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman of the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Stevens, and the ranking \nminority members, Senator Inouye, for accepting this very crucial \namendment which I have proudly cosponsored with Senator Snowe.\n  With the recent proliferation of chemical weapons and the increasing \nuncertainty of rogue nations' ability to wage chemical and biological \nwar, I strongly believe that this additional $2 million in funding is \nessential to properly address this very serious threat.\n  A joint service core research program will make possible the \ndevelopment of a prototype hybrid integrated sensor array for chemical \nand biological point detection for personnel use on the battlefield. \nWhile it is my hope that some day sensors of this type are not \nnecessary, until such time, I will continue to ensure that our service \nmen and women are not left unaware or unprotected.\n\n[[Page S7406]]\n\n  Again, I extend my sincere thanks to Senator Stevens and Senator \nInouye for supporting this critical amendment and I thank my fellow \nMaine colleague, Senator Snowe, for her leadership on this matter as \nwell.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 843\n\n    (Purpose: To earmark $6.0 million of the funds appropriated in \n    Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Defense-Wide for a \n            conventional munitions demilitarization program)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Sessions, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 843:\n       On page 34, before the period on line 3, add the following: \n     ``: Provided, That of the funds appropriated under this \n     heading, $6,000,000 shall be available for a conventional \n     munitions demilitarization demonstration program''.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, this amendment would appropriate an \nincrease of $6 million to the budget request for the Explosive \nDemilitarization Technology Program [PE 63104D] to conduct a \ndemonstration program at Anniston Army Depot. This is a much-needed \ndemonstration of current commercial off-the-shelf blast chamber \ntechnology as an acceptable alternative to open burning/open pit \ndetonation [OB/OD] by reducing significantly emissions and noise caused \nby OB/OD. The demonstration has nationwide application if successful \nand is in keeping with the military's program of continuing technology \nevaluation of demilitarization methods for existing conventional \nammunition as described in the Joint Demilitarization Study, September \n1995, page II-4-14, a study prepared for the Director, Environmental \nand Life Sciences, Defense Research and Engineering, Office of the \nSecretary of Defense.\n  Annually we spend millions of dollars on the production of new \nmunitions of all types. At the other end of the pipeline however is the \nvexing problem of disposing of outdated munitions of all types. The \nenormity of the problem for this Nation is this: The stocks managed by \nthe Army, DOD's Manager for Conventional Ammunition [MCA], currently \nstored in 26 States totals approximately 449,308 tons of material and \ncosts over $12 million annually to store according to a DOD 1995 Joint \nDemilitarization Study. More serious however is the fact that the study \npredicts an additional 730,420 tons will be generated into that \nstockpile by the end of fiscal year 2001.\n  Let me state again the magnitude of the problem for the Nation: \nthrough the end of fiscal year 2001, over 1.2 million tons of material \nwill pass through or reside in the military conventional ammunition \naccount. This is enough ammunition to exceed 2,800 earth-covered \nmagazines and will cost over $1.2 billion to destroy if we assume that \nit costs approximately $120 million to destroy 107,000 tons of material \nusing fiscal year 1995 projections. The technology in the COTS blast \nchamber has the potential of mitigating local environmental concerns; \nthe potential of increasing destruction throughput; and is capable of \ndestroying in a safe and environmentally sound manner greater than 98 \npercent of the explosives the DOD stores utilizing particulate bag \nhouse technology at locations in America, Europe, and the Pacific.\n  Alabama stores in excess of 22,437 tons of material ranking us fifth \nin size of stockpile. Environmental considerations are of paramount \nimportance to me and to a balanced national level demilitarized \nprogram. I think DOD, the Army, and the Joint Ordnance Commanders \nGroup, Demilitarization and Disposal Subgroup, are playing a major role \nin ensuring that our various storage sites, to include Anniston Army \nDepot, are in compliance with Federal, State, and local regulations. \nLikewise, I think the DOD is also quite sensitive to public opinion. \nWhile better cost-efficient ways must be found to destroy this \nseemingly unlimited amount of material, we must take advantage now of \nnew technologies in the R stage to compliment the current OM/OD \nmethod of destruction, with the view that not in the too distant future \nthose technologies will not only replace aging organic demilitarization \nfacilities, but close the chapter on the risky OB/OD method before the \nenvironmental challenges close the book for us.\n  The JOCG cited three environmental challenges in a study to be \nconsidered in life cycle management of the demilitarization program. \nThey are: permitting facilities, disposal of residuals, and cleanup. \nWith new technologies the effects of each can be mitigated and give \nlocal communities new hope that their environment will no longer be \nfouled by OB/OD.\n\n  On June 19 Anniston Army Depot received permission from the State of \nAlabama to proceed with the construction of its chemical weapons \ndisposal facility. This is an emotionally charged issue, but one that \nwill be managed every step of the way with safety of the operation and \nconcern for the community as its highest priorities. Previous plants in \nour country are proving that this can be done. However, conventional \nammunition destruction lags behind, in my opinion, on both counts. For \nthis reason I strongly believe that a demonstration program at Anniston \ninvolving COTS blast chamber technology begins the long awaited \nopportunity to rid north Alabama of another type of munition material, \nthat only grows more unstable with time and will furnish the data upon \nwhich the JOCG can make full-scale development decisions for other \nlocations in the country.\n  Today, TOW missile rounds, currently in storage, are experiencing \nstorage problems and must be dealt with as a higher destruction \npriority over older missiles. Storage quantities for TOW missiles \nreaches nearly 400,000 rounds. I cannot conceive that OB/O, in Alabama \nor anywhere else in the Nation, is the most efficient and most \nresponsible method of destruction for these missiles. Other \nmethodologies must be utilized and they must be demonstrated now.\n  The COTS blast chamber I am recommending for this demonstration \nprogram is totally enclosed, constructed of steel and consists of a \nhydraulic chamber door, exhaust fan and over-pressure controls. The \nchamber is large enough to accommodate the TOW missiles I described \nabove and allows the military additional flexibility in destroying some \nof those munitions even as the demonstration matures. Noise measurement \nof 0.5 percent of what is allowable by the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Administration are cited by the manufacturer. Emission controls \nfor exhaust rates and temperatures are also controlled. The chamber \nwill work with Anniston's current Subpart X permits, and according to \nthe manufacturer the blast chamber is 80 percent cleaner than OB/OD. \nThese are pluses for any community in our country.\n  In sum, the people of this Nation should not have to wait for the \nperfect system to evolve when a very good system is currently on hand \nand available to demonstrate that it can do the job for which it was \ndesigned more efficiently. Our environment will not wait; the munitions \nwill not wait, and the people should not have to wait for the slow \nwheels of government to find the perfect solution. Let us begin moving \nnow, by bringing this demonstration program on line in fiscal year 1998 \nand see if we as a country cannot benefit from a simple technology that \ncan get the job done.\n  Madam President, I would like to personally thank Senator Stevens for \nhis support and for including this important DOD appropriations bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, this amendment shifts $6 million to \ncover a demonstration project that was authorized by the Defense \nauthorization bill pursuant to an amendment offered by Senator \nSessions.\n  Mr. INOUYE. This has been cleared on the Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 843) was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 844\n\n    (Purpose: To reduce to $1,000,000 the threshold amount for the \napplicability of the requirement for advance matching of Department of \n            Defense disbursements to particular obligations)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Grassley.\n\n[[Page S7407]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Grassley, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 844.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n       Sec.   . Effective on June 30, 1998, section 8106(a) of the \n     Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1997 (titles I \n     through VIII of the matter under section 101(b) of Public Law \n     104-208; 110 Stat. 3009-111; 10 U.S.C. 113 note), is amended \n     by striking out ``$3,000,000'' and inserting in lieu thereof \n     ``$1,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I understand the committee is prepared \nto accept my amendment on Department of Defense [DOD] disbursements.\n  My amendment is simple and straightforward.\n  It says that each disbursement made by the DOD over $1 million must \nbe matched with the correct obligation before payment is made.\n  It also says that this threshold must be met by June 30, 1998.\n  This is the next, logical step in a process that began with section \n8137 of the fiscal year 1995 DOD Appropriations Act.\n  My amendment is fully consistent with the policy first adopted in \n1994.\n  This policy has been developed under the leadership of my friend from \nAlaska, Senator Stevens, and my friend from Hawaii, Senator Inouye.\n  This policy has been incorporated in the last three appropriations \nbills--fiscal years 1995, 1996, and 1997.\n  The policy is embodied in section 8106 of the current law.\n  The current law says that all disbursements over $3 million must be \nprematched. That's down from $5 million the previous year.\n  What we are trying to do is gradually ratchet down the dollar \nthresholds. I think there is a general consensus for cranking down the \nthresholds. The DOD inspector general [IG], Ms. Eleanor Hill, has said \nwe need to do it.\n  This is what she said in a letter to the committee Chairman:\n\n       We agree with the plan to continue lowering the dollar \n     threshold for prevalidation of all contract payments made by \n     DOD.\n\n  Mr. Richard Keevey, Director of the Defense Finance and Accounting \nService [DFAS] has said exactly the same thing but in stronger terms.\n  This is what Mr. Keevey said in testimony before the Governmental \nAffairs Committee on May 1:\n\n       To prevent future problem disbursements, the department \n     will require that every disbursement be prevalidated, that \n     is, matched to an obligation before payment is made. . . . \n     Our ultimate goal is to validate all disbursements to zero.\n\n  DOD has a plan for meeting the dollar thresholds set in law.\n  There is one small problem, however. The problem is at DOD's major \ncontract payment center at Columbus, OH. DOD says the Columbus center \ncannot meet the $1 million threshold until June 1999. When we launched \nthis policy back in 1994, DOD claimed it would be years before it could \nmake the required matches.\n  Well, despite all the bureaucratic roadblocks, DOD found a way to get \nthe job done. DOD is making the matches today.\n  Second, meeting the $1 million threshold should be no big deal.\n  With all of DOD's cutting edge technology, it should be a piece of \ncake. DFAS Columbus processes no more than 11,000 payments annually \nthat exceed the $1 million threshold.\n  That's chicken feed, Madam President.\n  Banks, for example, routinely handle 500,000 account matching \noperations in a single day. So why can't DOD do it? DOD seems to be \nworking hard to meet the dollar thresholds mandated by Congress. I feel \nlike the momentum is in the right direction.\n  But recent GAO and IG audits clearly indicate we still have a long \nway to go. There's still much more work to be done.\n  My amendment will help to keep the pressure on. It will help the \nDepartment reach the ultimate goal: to validate every disbursement \nprior to payment.\n  Until we reach that goal, DOD's financial accounts will remain \nvulnerable to theft and abuse.\n  Madam President, I thank the chairman and ranking minority member for \ntheir leadership and support on this issue.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, Senator Grassley and the Defense \nComptroller, Mr. Hamre, have been negotiating concerning this subject. \nIt will reduce the deviation ceiling and billing for the Department of \nDefense on June 30, 1998, to $1 million. It is being offered by me on \nbehalf of Senator Grassley with the understanding that the Department \nof Defense does concur in this amendment.\n  Mr. INOUYE. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 844) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, that was the work product of our hot-\nline so far. We are trying to work out amendments as they are received. \nAgain, we urge that Members bring their amendments to the floor and \nnotify us of their intention to do so. At this time, we only know of \none amendment that is to be forthcoming. My understanding is that that \nSenator will present it soon.

Mr. President, I will shortly offer an amendment to \nthis bill. It is an amendment that many of us are working on. We worked \non it last week for the Defense authorization bill. It deals with \nBosnia and exactly what our mission is in Bosnia, and the possibility \nthat we are looking at a change to that mission without congressional \nconsultation.\n  I want to step back and talk about U.S. foreign policy in general \nover the last 4 years since I have been a Member of the U.S. Senate.\n  What concerns me is the lack of focus and the lack of stability in \nour foreign policy that, unfortunately, creates a vacuum that can be \nfilled by either our allies or our adversaries. Since the last 4 years \nhave seen many missions with U.S. troops both under the U.N. umbrella \nand the NATO umbrella, I think it is important for us to take a step \nback and look at what happens when there is a vacuum.\n  As I have observed since President Clinton has been in office, it \nseems that someone is always wanting the United States to do more. \nSometimes it is our allies asking us to send more aid, put more troops \non the ground, go into police missions--missions to capture; not kill. \nIf you look at the use of our troops over the last 4 years, we have, in \nfact, been drawn into conflicts sometimes not really even knowing why \nwe were involved.\n  Starting with Somalia. Somalia was a U.N. mission. Our mission was to \nfeed starving people and starving children\n\n[[Page S7408]]\n\nin Somalia because we heard the reports coming back and saw the \npictures of starving people. No one in the world could look at those \npictures and not say we have to do something. So under the U.N. \nauspices, we did go to feed the starving people.\n  But then there was a mission creep--from feeding starving people to \ncapturing a warlord, Aideed. Because we had a mission creep that \nCongress was not prepared for, we lost 18 Army Rangers without even \nrealizing that the U.S. mission had changed. What was the result? The \nresult is that Aideed outlasted the United States. There was not much \nof a change in Somalia. Yet, we lost 18 Army Rangers.\n  Then consider Haiti. Under the guise of installing a democratically \nelected President, United States forces in a U.N. mission invaded the \nisland of Haiti. We spent $1 billion, American Defense dollars, dollars \nthat we took from other Defense priorities, whether it was training or \ntechnology or new equipment.\n  Today we are seeing the unraveling of the democratically elected \nPresident and that regime in Haiti--$1 billion later.\n  Then we move to Bosnia. It seems that, since the day I walked onto \nthe Senate floor in 1993, we have been trying to deal with the unrest, \nthe war, and the atrocities in the former Yugoslavia. We started by \ntrying to lift the arms embargo on one part of the population in the \nformer Yugoslavia, because other elements of that population had arms. \nSome had gotten their arms even though there was an arms embargo. But \nthe Muslim population received very few arms. Many of us in the Senate \nfelt that if we could lift that arms embargo and let the Muslims have a \nfair fight, perhaps that war would have ended a lot sooner. But the \nPresident refused--refused--to provide the U.S. leadership needed to \nlift the U.N. arms embargo.\n  Then we saw in 1995 a massacre of Muslim men and boys. We think as \nmany as 10,000 died in Srebrenica and other places. It was clear that \nthe U.N. mission could not do what it was supposed to do, which was to \nkeep some sort of peace in Bosnia. We reached the Dayton peace accords \nand NATO entered Bosnia. The United States was pushed into putting U.S. \ntroops on the ground. I believe they were pushed to do it because there \nwas a vacuum of leadership and our allies said the only way that we \ncould show our interest and support of Bosnia and peace is to have \ntroops on the ground. Many of us felt that there were other things that \nwe could do besides putting our troops on the ground that would have \nbeen helpful to peace in Bosnia--including putting our money into \nhelping the Bosnian people build an infrastructure and economic base \nthat would have led, I think, to a better peace settlement than we are \nseeing right now. We are seeing a bubbling up of the hostilities in \nBosnia despite the fact that our troops are there. We are seeing the \nbubbling up of hostilities because there is still no economic base. It \nis that economic base, I think, that would provide hope for the future.\n\n  But, instead, the President said we would put troops on the ground to \nkeep the warring parties apart for 1 year--for 1 year. At the end of \n1995, the President said we would be there for 1 year--until the end of \n1996. As the end of that year approached, the President said we need to \nstay there--doing the same thing, not seeing much progress. He said it \nwould be June 30, 1998 before we could withdraw. The Secretary of \nDefense, Bill Cohen, reiterated when he came into office in his Senate \nhearing that it would in fact be June 1998.\n  Just last week in the Senate took up a resolution to confirm that \nJune 30, 1998 will be the end. We did so so all participants can count \non it and they can start making plans for it, so that there won't be a \nvacuum that anyone else could fill with mandates for the United States. \nBut the President has now said that he thinks it would be wrong for the \nSenate to confirm June 30, 1998 as the withdrawal date.\n  (Ms. COLLINS assumed the chair.)\n  Madam President, I think this is the beginning of another muddled \nmessage. The President says we are going to be out June 30, 1998. His \nSecretary of Defense-designate this year said we are going to be out \nJune 30, 1998. Congress proposed for us to start planning for that \neventuality by saying we are going to set that limit, it will be in the \nlaw, the funding will be cut off. And the President says, no, don't do \nthat. So he must be leaving himself an option, which is a message to \nboth our allies and any adversaries. That leaves room once again for \nsomeone else to come in and establish American policy for us.\n  Now, on top of all of this, we are hearing about a different mission \nin Bosnia. We hear our Secretary of State talking about capturing the \nwar criminals, seeking the war criminals out.\n  Once again, I think we need to go back and look at the parameters of \nthe mission very clearly. We must learn from what happened in Somalia. \nWhen there is mission creep that Congress does not approve, it is in \neffect putting our troops into a combat role that Congress has not \nsanctioned. That is what we are beginning to see in Bosnia. It was \nclearly stated in the Dayton accords that we hoped that the war \ncriminals, the indicted war criminals, would be apprehended and that it \nwould be done by the three parties to the agreement: the Bosnian Serbs, \nthe Bosnian Muslims, and the Croats.\n  I want to read a series of statements that confirm what our mission \nis and what our mission isn't.\n  On July 3 of this year, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns \nstated that a Bosnia Serb television report that NATO peacekeepers had \nbeen ordered to arrest Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic on site was \n``absolutely and unequivocally false.'' In support of that position, \nthe Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, Gen. George Joulwan, reaffirmed \non Monday, July 7, last week, that the principal responsibility for \napprehending war criminals lies with the parties themselves, meaning \nthe Bosnian parties--in accordance with the Dayton accords.\n  On March 18 of this year, General Joulwan testified before the Senate \nArmed Services Committee that the military are not policemen.\n  ``I think''--again quoting General Joulwan--``the proper \nresponsibility rests on the parties, the Bosnian parties. That is what \nDayton says. . . . If we are not careful, we will go down this slippery \nslope where the military will be put into hunting down war criminals. \nThis is not within my mandate.''\n  On July 9, last week, the prospective Supreme Allied Commander in \nEurope, Gen. Wesley Clark, during his confirmation hearing before the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, acknowledged his understanding of his \npredecessor's mandate and affirmed his intention to execute the policy \nin the same way as General Joulwan has.\n  On November 17 of last year the Secretary of Defense stated, in \nresponse to a specific question regarding the apprehension of war \ncriminals in Bosnia, that ``the mission is to provide a secure \nenvironment so that all of the other civil functions can go on. . . . \nIt is not to perform apprehension functions.''\n  On December 18 of last year, the Secretary of Defense reaffirmed that \n``the apprehension of war criminals was not an IFOR mission and it will \nnot be an SFOR mission. Locating and arresting the criminals is a \nmission for a police force.''\n  On March 3 of this year, the Secretary of Defense stated that the \napprehension of war criminals was not a part of the mission. It is a \npolice function. It is not a military-type mission.\n  Madam President, a change in United States and NATO policy regarding \nalleged war criminals in Bosnia could expose United States and NATO \ntroops to direct combat action and ultimately do what none of us want, \nand that is jeopardize the peacekeeping progress to date.\n  United States and NATO forces have made progress in Bosnia. This \ncould allow the situation to deteriorate to the conditions that existed \nbefore the NATO IFOR and SFOR missions were established.\n  Madam President, we cannot let mission creep hurt what we have done \nso far. We have spent 6 billion American taxpayer dollars on this \nmission. We have our soldiers on the ground in Bosnia right now. We \ncannot walk away from this mission prematurely, but we need to set the \nparameters of this mission and reiterate them. And the parameters are \nthat our troops' work will be done June 30, 1998, and the mission \nremains the same unless the President comes back to Congress to change \nit. And that is: if we run across\n\n[[Page S7409]]\n\na war criminal, yes, we would apprehend that criminal. But when we say \nwe are going to be part of a force that is going to go and seek out war \ncriminals, war criminals that have armies still under their control, \nthat is a very different mission. We are beginning to talk about a \ncombat mission that we did not sign up for in the original IFOR and \nSFOR missions, which were very clear with Congress.\n  I have seen General Joulwan time after time get out his book that is \nunderlined and earmarked. It is his mission statement, and he has stuck \nto the mission. If we are going to change the mission, we need to know \nit, and we need to provide the extra alertness that would be required \nfor changing the mission. Congress should be consulted if we are going \nto go out and seek war criminals. And I would say to the Serbs that we \nare not doing that now. We are not doing that. And when I read \nstatements by Serbs that were passed out at the recent funeral of a war \ncriminal, typed in broken English and appearing in Serb-held areas in \nnortheast Bosnia promising a ``head for a head'' and warning that \n``Somalia was too gentle for U.S. troops,'' I am sending a message: \nThere is no change in the mission as far as U.S. troops go.\n  There should not be such a change without the full accord of \nCongress. Many of us in Congress did not want to use our troops in this \nway. All of us admire and respect our troops because they have done a \nwonderful job fulfilling their mission, but if we are going to change \nthat mission, we must make that decision, and we must do it knowing \nwhat the risks are.\n  Madam President, what we should not do is permit mission creep, \nsomething that inches forward without our specific authorization and \nconsultation, but which would put our troops into a different \nsituation, a combat situation, a high alert situation, without \nunderstanding the full consequences of doing that.\n  So I am standing here today saying I hope all of the Senate will be \nable to agree on language which says that we want the war criminals at \nthe Hague; these people who have been indicted, who have committed \natrocities, should be brought to justice. But we cannot change the \nmission of American troops under NATO auspices without a full airing. \nWe cannot put our troops in the position of being targets unless we go \ninto a different state of high alert.\n  So I hope that we will stand together on this to say that we want to \nbe part of a plan that determines how those criminals will be brought \nto justice. But right now, in the Dayton accords, it is provided that \nthe parties, the Bosnian Serbs, the Muslims, and the Croats, will go \nafter war criminals, as they should. It should be an international \npolice force, but it is not a military mission as George Joulwan, as \nGeneral Clark, and as our Secretaries of Defense have said for the last \n2 years. And if we are going into a different kind of mission, we ask \nthe President to come forward. Do not let this mission start creeping \nwithout our assent, without our consultation. It is the least we can do \nfor the security of the United States, for the taxpayers of America, \nfor our troops on the ground, and for the integrity of our word and our \ncommitment.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I am not sure what else can be said \nconcerning the dilemma we find ourselves in right now. I think the \ndistinguished junior Senator from Texas has really said it all.\n  It was just last week that we had our defense authorization bill up \nbefore this body. We talked at that time about the desirability of \nputting some type of amendment on to stop the funding for the Bosnia \noperation for any time after June 30, 1998. Of course, I think we \ndecided that it wasn't going to work out that way because if that \nhappened, it might jeopardize not just the bill but would probably have \ncaused a filibuster, and we didn't want that. We wanted to keep it \nmoving. We need to have our authorization bill. It is imperative to our \nNation's defense that we have it.\n  So I think against the better judgment of several people we agreed to \nnot have that position in. But that is the way it is going to have to \nbe. I don't know any other way we are going to be able to bring our \ntroops back. Clearly, the President has us over a political barrel \nright now because any time our troops get out of there--I don't care if \nit is tomorrow, if it is June 30, 1998, or if it is 10 years from now--\nthe fighting will start again, and anyone with any common sense, with \nany knowledge of history, knows it has happened that way, and it is \ngoing to continue to happen that way. And so the question is do you do \nit sooner or later.\n  Those of us who were concerned about mission creep back when they \nmade the decision to send troops over to Bosnia back in December of \n1995, they were to be there for, of course, 1 year. They kept saying, \n``They will be home for Christmas December 1996.'' And all of us knew \nthey would not be home for Christmas in December of 1996. It just \ndidn't make any sense that that promise was made. So they went over \nthere to provide safety for the corridors, to keep people from crossing \nover them, and supposedly that was going to take care of the problems \nthat existed.\n  Well, this is not the first time in history that this has happened. \nHere it is now. We have made a commitment of 2\\1/2\\ years instead of 12 \nmonths. Now the President is trying to renege on that and go beyond to \nan undetermined period of time.\n  I can remember in history when we sent our Marines into Nicaragua in \n1909, and that was supposed to be for a 6-month period in 1909 because \nthere were some problems with the government down there and they felt \nour intervention would stabilize things, and we did have some national \nsecurity interests at that time, not as great as they were in other \nparts of the world, but nevertheless we sent our troops in for that \nshort period of time and they were still there 13 years later. In fact, \nthey never really came back until 1933. That is 24 years.\n  As to Haiti, the Senator from Texas was talking about the fact that \nwe still have troops in Haiti. People forget about that. We did not \nhave any mission over there in the first place that was strategic to \nany of our problems in this country and yet we sent troops over to \nHaiti to supposedly try to clean up their government and run it better \nthan they can run it. And now we have the same problems over there as \nwe had before and we still have troops over there. We sent Marines to \nHaiti in 1915 and the same problems existed at that time. They were \ngoing to help with some of the stability there in Haiti and they stayed \nthere until 1934.\n  So now we see that we are in the middle of a classic case of mission \ncreep. We are enlarging the mission. We are exposing U.S. troops to a \nwhole new set of risks, and it is all without the permission of the \nAmerican people or the permission of the Senate, but they are going to \ndo it.\n  Let's review for a minute the timeline in Bosnia. The President and \nadministration officials pledged on numerous occasions in 1995 and 1996 \nthat the United States military forces would be out of Bosnia by 1996 \nin the hearings that we had in the Senate Armed Services Committee. The \nSecretaries of Defense and the Secretary of State, the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, John Shalikashvili, all of them said that the \nIFOR mission would be concluded in 1 year and that there were no plans \nto extend United States presence in Bosnia beyond a 1-year timeframe. \nAnd they kept repeating it.\n  I can remember, since I serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee, \na meeting we had October 17, 1995, Madam President, and that was when \nGeneral Shalikashvili said, and I am going to quote his words, not my \nwords--this is General Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff. He said on October 17, 1995:\n\n       From a military perspective, as I evaluated the tasks we \n     wished this force to accomplish, it was my judgment that it \n     in fact can be done in 12 months or less. Secondly, when tied \n     to the equipping and training issue, it was my judgment that \n     that, too, can be accomplished in less than a year. And so I \n     felt it was important that we, therefore, set a target of one \n     year and then bring the force back. In the absence of that, \n     you just find yourself staying there, and that's how very \n     often mission creep comes in. The force needs to be brought \n     home and they need to resume normal training and be ready for \n     other operations. And I just think one year--\n\n[[Page S7410]]\n\n     I saw no military justification for that force to stay longer \n     than one year, and that is why that was my recommendation.\n\n  This is a guy who is supposed to be running the military, the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  I was over in Bosnia several times, but the last time I talked to \nGen. Monte Miggs up in that northeast sector and it is his job--he is \ndoing a great job, by the way, of trying to carry on some type of \ntraining during the time that those troops are stationed over there. \nYou have two big problems that exist when you have, when you are \nleaving troops in an area. One is in the case we are in right now where \nwe have just decimated the military budget, our defense budget, we are \nspending all of this money. I can remember standing on this floor in \nNovember 1995 when the President had made the statement that the cost \nof the deployment to Bosnia would be somewhere between $1.5 billion and \n$2 billion.\n  It is now going through $7.3 billion, and where does that money come \nfrom? It comes from readiness, it comes from modernization, it comes \nfrom force strength, and it comes from quality of life. That's the only \nfour places it can come from.\n  Now we have an optempo rate, where our troops are being asked to do \nthings that human beings really can't do. Instead of being deployed for \nthe normal 115 to 120 days a year, in some cases it is twice that. And \nwe keep hearing stories from the field that it is even worse, because \nwith the depleted budget we are now having to cannibalize perfectly \ngood F-15 engines, that's F-100 engines, to get spare parts to keep the \nones running that are in planes right now. Of course, that is very \nlabor intensive. So from the field we hear these guys are working, some \nof them, 15 and 16 hours a day. They cannot keep that up for a period \nof time.\n  But I think General Miggs up there, if there is ever anyone who can \ndo it, up in the Brcko area, near the Posavina corridor, he is carrying \non training. Of course, to carry on training and perform these \nhumanitarian or peacekeeping or peacemaking missions, whatever they are \nsupposed to be doing over there, it means longer and longer hours. So \nthey are trying to do it. But there is not one general I have talked to \nwho has not said that, if we should need our troops, if something \nshould happen in North Korea at the same time something happened in \nIran--not totally inconceivable--or Iraq or anyplace else, but if we \nwere challenged in two regional fronts, we would have to take those \npeople, withdraw them and retrain them, before we could send them into \ncombat. So it's a real serious problem.\n  In that same Senate Armed Services Committee meeting of October 17, \n1995, I might add, Secretary Bill Perry said:\n\n       I cannot conceive of the circumstances which would motivate \n     me to come back and ask an extension of that time.\n\n  This is an extension, he's talking about, beyond Christmas of 1996.\n\n       . . . 12 months is sufficient to do the job we're \n     describing. And I believe there is a great value, a great \n     management value to putting a definite time scale on it and \n     sticking to that time period.\n\n  Again, he said later, in December, this is 6 weeks later, he said:\n\n       We believe the mission can be accomplished in 1 year, so we \n     have built our plan based on that timeline. This schedule is \n     realistic because the specific militarily tasks [which are \n     changing all the time, and that's the justification they are \n     making for leaving them over there] in the agreement can be \n     completed in the first 6 months, and thereafter IFOR's role \n     will be to maintain the climate of stability that will permit \n     civil work to go forward. We expect these civil functions \n     will be successfully initiated in 1 year. But, even if some \n     of them are not, we must not be drawn into a posture of \n     indefinite garrison.\n\n  Madam President, we are in a posture of indefinite garrison.\n  Look at this in yesterday's paper, ``Clinton keeps door open to \nextending U.S. role in Bosnia.''\n  Here's the problem we have. I was disturbed we had to go beyond 12 \nmonths. Now they say we will make it 2\\1/2\\ years and we will be out of \nthere on June 30, 1998. I went over to the NATO meeting in Brussels and \nfound we had Members of Congress, Members of the other body, who were \nwalking around telling our NATO friends, whispering to them, ``Don't \nworry, we won't leave you. We'll be there.''\n  There is plenty of time, adequate time now to make this as the \npolicy, which is the accepted policy, that is we are getting out on \nJune 30, 1998. Because there is a lot of time between now and then.\n  I was watching the Senator from Texas and remembering what happened \nwhen we had a resolution of disapproval back in October 1995. Because \nwe knew, once they went over there, it was going to be very difficult \nto bring them back. Sure enough, we lost that by four votes. It was \ninteresting, because the main argument that was used by the other side \nwas that our troops will be back in 12 months. So who can object to 12 \nmonths?\n  I heard Senator after Senator say to me, and say privately, ``Well, I \nwas going to support the resolution of disapproval and not send troops \nover there, not agree to that, but after all, the President has \npromised it will be 12 months. He's promised it would not exceed on the \noutside $2 billion.''\n  I made a speech on the floor at that time and stated it would be \ncloser to $8 billion. And sure enough, we are creeping through right \nnow $7.3 billion. Looking back, I remember what I stated on the floor. \nAnd I will repeat that now, because I think it is appropriate now, 18 \nmonths later. This is quoting myself in the Congressional Record, \nDecember 13, 1995.\n\n       My conviction that the administration's intention to put \n     troops in harm's way in Bosnia is a huge mistake rests on \n     three broad arguments. First and above all, the conflict in \n     Bosnia imposes no real threat to vital American interests. \n     Simply put there is nothing in Bosnia that Americans should \n     die for.\n       Second, the Dayton talks have produced a false peace, that \n     is inherently unstable and politically doomed.\n\n  Here I was talking about the fact we go to Dayton and we have all \nthese factions in there, supposedly coming to a peace agreement, but \nwho wasn't at Dayton? Karadzic was not in Dayton, that's the Bosnian \nSerbs. Sure, Milosevic was there. That's Serbia. But that wasn't where \nthe problem was. Those individuals who were creating the problem were \nnot there. The Bosnian Serbs were not represented. Not only were they \nnot represented, but none of the rogue elements were represented. We \nstill had the mujahidin, the Arkan Tigers, the Black Swans, and the \nrest of them, who are still over there right now.\n  So you have a flawed meeting with a flawed attendance making an \nagreement that we cannot live with.\n  Finally, quoting from my statement on the floor on December 13, 1995:\n\n       The Implementation Force [that's IFOR] plan is self-\n     contradictory, and hopelessly optimistic and will expose our \n     soldiers to unreasonable risk even as they diligently pursue \n     its unrealistic objectives.\n\n  So, that is where we are today. I think, if you look and see what \nthey agreed to and what was supposed to have happened in the first 12 \nmonths in the Dayton accords, they talked about ``we were going to have \nthe elections.'' They have not had the elections. They had flawed \nelections. They said, ``The refugees would all be able to go home \nbefore 12 months.'' Guess what, the refugees haven't gone home and it's \n18 months. We keep finding violations of arms agreements, in the 18 \nmonths into the 1-year agreement, and we can't pull out. I am very \nthankful we have not suffered precious casualties at this time, but I \ntell you, we predicted on the floor if we continue this mission creep \nwe may not be so fortunate in the future.\n  I would conclude, Madam President, that we have a responsibility to \nbe responsible. If this were a time when we didn't have the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska, the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, having a very difficult time coming up with the money to \nkeep America strong enough to meet the minimum expectations of the \nAmerican people, which we can't, that is to be able to defend America \non two regional fronts--if that weren't the case, maybe we could afford \nto be sending troops around the world on humanitarian missions, on \npeacekeeping missions. But we can't afford to do that, Madam President.\n  So I conclude by saying we need to make it very clear that we are \ngoing to be out of there, and give a date certain that is still 12 \nmonths from now. There is still plenty of time for our allies to make \ntime to make that happen. I have been agonizing with this concern.\n  This is not a partisan thing, by the way, Madam President. Because \nwhen\n\n[[Page S7411]]\n\nwe sent troops into Somalia, George Bush was President. That was in \nDecember. After he had been defeated but while he was still in office, \nwe sent troops over there, if you'll remember, for a period of some 3 \nmonths to 6 months. Then, once President Clinton got in, he kept \nextending it. So we sent resolutions and resolutions, ``We want to \nbring the troops back.'' Month after month, every month we sent \nresolutions, and the years started going by, and it was not until 18 of \nour rangers were brutally murdered and their naked corpses were dragged \nthrough the streets of Mogadishu before the American people got \nconcerned enough to force the administration to bring the troops home \nfrom Somalia.\n  Madam President, I don't want that to happen in Bosnia. I don't want \nour troops to be dragged through the streets of Sarajevo or Tuzla or \nBrcko or any of the rest of them.\n  We have experienced mission creep. We are now in a situation where \nour troops are there for an indeterminate period of time. Now is the \ntime to draw the line and say that June 30, 1998, is our time that our \ntroops will be coming home. Are they going to be safe over there when \nthat happens? No. If we brought them home tomorrow, there would still \nbe fighting once our troops were out, or June 30, or 10 years from now.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of \nan amendment which expresses the sense of the Senate that: ``The \nAdministration should consult closely and in a timely manner with the \nCongress on the NATO-led Stabilization Force's mission concerning the \napprehension of indicted war criminals, including any changes in the \nmission which could affect American forces.''\n  From the beginning of the NATO mission in Bosnia, particularly the \nground element--a mission which I have consistently opposed--the \nadministration has been clear that U.S. forces would be used primarily \nto implement the military aspects of the Dayton accords, and assist in \nlimited civilian missions at the discretion of the local IFOR or SFOR \ncommander.\n  On the specific issue of apprehending war criminals, the \nadministration has been unequivocal--NATO troops are not charged with \nhunting down war criminals. The specific, detailed mission statement is \nset forth in a classified document; therefore, I can only use as a \nresource statements made by administration officials on this issue. The \nfollowing is a compilation of such statements:\n  Secretary Cohen, before the House National Security Committee, March \n20, 1997, in response to a question from Congressman Lantos: ``Why \naren't we apprehending war criminals? Well, that's not the mission of \nSFOR.''\n  Ken Bacon, DOD Spokesman, July 3, 1997, in response to a question \nabout whether or not the administration was considering expanding the \nauthority of NATO troops to arrest war criminals:\n\n       There's been no change in our procedures. And those \n     procedures are, first of all the Dayton accord makes it very \n     clear that the formerly warring factions are responsible for \n     turning in war criminals.\n       And second, our job, because the collection and detention \n     of war criminals is an act of law enforcement for law \n     enforcement activities, our rules have been clear from the \n     beginning, which is that if we encounter war criminals in the \n     course of our patrols, we would detain them and turn them \n     over to authorized law enforcement agencies. There's been no \n     change in that rule.\n\n  Sandy Berger, National Security Adviser, July 10, 1997:\n\n       Under SFOR's mission they may apprehend indicted war \n     criminals encountered in the course of its duties and if the \n     tactical situation permits. This was such a situation \n     (British action on July 10) . . . SFOR concluded that they \n     could detain these individuals. NATO political authorities \n     agreed with that view. SFOR acted within its mission and \n     mandate.\n\n  Background briefing by senior administration official, July 10, 1997.\n\n       Rules of engagement and the authority of the SFOR forces \n     permit the commander in a particular situation when he \n     encounters or is encountering war criminals and believes that \n     he has a tactical capacity to apprehend in a way that is not \n     unduly risky to exercise that authority. That continues to be \n     the authority.\n       The authority here is to apprehend war criminals who are \n     encountered by SFOR where the commander makes the tactical \n     decision that he can do so.\n\n  From the above, it is clear that war criminals are to be apprehended \nonly if IFOR or SFOR forces encountered these war criminals, and only \nif the local NATO commander determined that the tactical situation \nallowed his troops to safely apprehend the war criminals.\n  Now that understanding seems to be changing. We hear press reports of \nthe Secretary of State urging for a more proactive role for our troops \nin hunting down war criminals in Bosnia. We also hear that the \nSecretary of Defense is opposing this policy change. What is the \naccurate situation?\n  Before it is too late, and the policy is changed, it is imperative \nfor the Senate to express its judgment on this important issue.\n  I strongly support the apprehension of the indicted war criminals so \nthat they may be brought to justice.\n  The policy of ``how''--working with all of the member nations of \nSFOR--must be carefully coordinated. The current policy, as enunciated \nabove by administration officials, if it is to be changed, such change \nshould beforehand be the subject of the most careful consultation with \nthe Congress.\n  In the case of Somalia, the Congress witnessed mission creep without \ntaking any action to try to stop it. The results in that case were \ndisastrous--18 dead, over 70 wounded.\n  We should have learned from history that the military is not an \nappropriate force for tracking down and arresting individuals. There is \nno question as to their capability--but how would that detract from \ntheir primary mission? What are the personal risks?\n  What will be the consequences of an expansion of the SFOR mission to \ninclude actively seeking out and apprehending indicted war criminals? \nWhile I share the hopes of all that the war criminals in Bosnia will be \nbrought to justice, I question the wisdom of seeing the lives of United \nStates or allied troops jeopardized in an effort to hunt and arrest \nthese individuals. Both IFOR and now SFOR have been able to achieve a \nmeasure of success in Bosnia because they have been perceived as even-\nhanded. That will all change if we use our troops to aggressively \npursue indicted war criminals. Rightly or wrongly, we will been seen as \ntaking sides. Our troops will become targets, the success they have \nachieved thus far will be jeopardized.\n  As I said earlier, I opposed the President's decision to send United \nStates ground troops to Bosnia in December 1995. But that decision is \nbehind us, and the American people have invested $7 billion into the \noperations in Bosnia. Precipitous action in this area could well put at \nrisk that investment. As I stated last week, that investment could \nlikewise be jeopardized by Congress forcing a specific withdrawal date. \nBut these are separate issues.\n  Our request of the administration is simple. Do not allow a \nsignificant change in the mission of our troops in Bosnia without first \ncoming to the Congress.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, last week, the Senate expressed in very \nclear terms its view that the United States' mission in Bosnia should \nbe terminated by next June, which is the administration's stated \ndeadline. This was not a position that was taken without public debate. \nIn fact, the Senate debate regarding the Bosnia operation began last \nThursday evening and continued well into Friday morning. A number of \nSenators were involved in the debate at various times during the \nconsideration of the DOD bill. Quite frankly, Mr. President, as we well \nknow, there were some Senators--including the Senator from Delaware \n[Mr. Biden] and the Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner]--who did express \ntheir disagreement with having a date certain for termination of U.S. \nground troop deployment. Mr. President, they were clearly in the \nminority on this issue.\n  The Senate took this action regarding an end date as part of one of \nthe\n\n[[Page S7412]]\n\nmost important pieces of defense related legislation--the Department of \nDefense authorization bill for fiscal year 1998. Mr. President, let me \nremind my colleagues what we did this past Friday. Indeed, one of the \nreasons that I pressed so hard to have a Bosnia-related provision added \nto that bill was because of the importance of having this debate on the \nDOD authorization itself.\n  Now, today, we have begun consideration of the other key defense \nbill--the Department of Defense appropriations bill. As in the \nauthorization bill, I do not think we can let the fact that we \ncurrently have 8,000 of our troops in Bosnia go unnoticed during a \ndebate on the Department of Defense appropriations.\n  Just 3 days ago, we passed an amendment to the defense authorization \nbill that clearly states the Senate's desire to have United States \ntroops out of Bosnia no later than June 30, 1998. The resolution we \npassed was a modification of an amendment I had introduced that would \nhave imposed a hard, statutory requirement that the administration \nstick to its announced pullout date of June 30, 1998. My original \namendment was virtually identical to the one that passed the other \nbody, the House, on a vote of 278-148 that literally cut off funding \nfor the Bosnia mission after that June 30 date.\n  The message of the action, Mr. President, in both the House and the \nSenate is crystal clear: It is the overwhelming desire of the Congress \nthat the administration pull our brave men and women out of Bosnia by \nJune 30, 1998.\n  In light of these strong messages, Mr. President, I was somewhat \ndisappointed in what I read in the papers over the weekend. Only 1 day \nafter the Senate passed its resolution, President Clinton publicly \nstated what I am afraid the administration has been thinking all \nalong--the possibility that the deployment of United States troops in \nBosnia may well continue after the present mission expires. Let's not \nforget, this is already a major extension from the original date when \nit was supposed to terminate, which was approximately the end of \nDecember 1996.\n  The President said, ``I believe the present operation will have run \nits course by then''--referring to the June deadline--``and we'll have \nto discuss what, if any, involvement the United States should have \nthere.'' Meanwhile, the White House said that an international presence \nwill be necessary in Bosnia for perhaps a considerable time past June \n1998.\n  Now, Mr. President, I fear these statements send the wrong message. \nBy making these remarks, the administration is hinting that the United \nStates might be willing to sign on to a new mission once the mandate of \nthe NATO-led stabilization force, or SFOR, has run out. Mr. President, \nI think it frighteningly opens the door for additional U.S. troop \ninvolvement after that time. Now, this is contrary to what Congress has \nsaid, that the U.S. troops should be on the way home next June, not \nstarting a new mission. There should be no maybes about the continued \ninvolvement of U.S. ground troops past the clear deadline that has been \nset by the administration and endorsed by both Houses of Congress.\n\n  Mr. President, in 1995, President Clinton asked Congress to approve \nthe deployment of United States troops to Bosnia, with an \nunderstanding. The understanding was that our military personnel would \nremain there for just 1 year. Well, as we all know, after the 1 year \nthe original implementation force was turned into a stabilization force \nand renamed from IFOR to SFOR. It just kept on going. And as a result, \nthe United States has kept 8,000 of our troops in the region under the \npremise that SFOR was somehow a completely new mission. But it \nobviously is not.\n  I also do not need to remind everyone, I hope, of the ballooning \ncosts of the Bosnia mission. This is really quite startling to me. \nDespite original estimates in the $2 billion range, we are now \ncommitted to pay at least, Mr. President, $7.7 billion, and it is going \nup. When I first raised this issue this year on the supplemental bill, \nthe figure I brought to the floor was $6.5 billion. Now it is already \nup to $7.7 billion a few short weeks later. Every time there is an \nassessment of the cost of this mission, the figure goes up another $1 \nbillion or $2 billion.\n  After this weekend, I have a new fear that when the June deadline \nrolls around this mission will undergo another name change. Maybe the \n``stabilization'' force will become the ``coordination'' force, or \nCFOR. Maybe it will become the ``maintenance'' force, or MFOR. Whatever \nthe new acronym is, Mr. President, I am afraid the results will be the \nsame--our ground troops will be asked to remain in Bosnia past June \nunder the pretense of a new mission.\n  Now, I don't doubt for a minute, Mr. President, that United States \ngoals in Bosnia are to maintain the peace and to help the three sides \nrebuild a united government. While our mission has succeeded in \nstopping the fighting, we are far behind in preparing for the day when \nBosnians will once again have to rule themselves without the benefit of \nNATO troops. In a May study of the Bosnia mission, the GAO noted there \nhas been little progress in creating a united police force, or on \nbuilding a functioning parliament, or even setting up offices for a new \nBosnian cabinet.\n  Mr. President, the best way to ensure that something never gets done \nis to constantly extend the deadline. If a teacher were to give his or \nher students a term paper assignment and tell them, ``try to get it \ndone by this year and, if that's not possible, maybe next year,'' you \ncan bet that the students will not be rushing off to the library to get \nthe work done. In a way, that is a little like what we are doing in \nBosnia. We are saying, ``try to comply with the Dayton accords by June, \nbut if you can't, we'll stick around anyway.'' It is no wonder the \nvarious parties in Bosnia are not making much headway in rebuilding \ntheir civilian institutions, given that NATO and the United States seem \ncommitted, it appears, to policing this country indefinitely.\n  Similarly, I do not think that our European allies will take \nseriously their own responsibilities to the region unless they clearly \nunderstand American intentions. I think that's why the compromise \nresolution the Senate passed last week actually included language that \nthe President should inform our partners in Europe in this exercise of \nthe expression of this Congress--tell them that we are planning to \nleave by June 30, 1998. I think this is a very important part of the \nSenate's position on this issue.\n  The administration, our friends in Europe, and the parties to this \nconflict must all understand that this Congress does consider the June \ndeadline a firm one. That is not to say that at the end of next June \nthere will be no more American involvement in the region. That is not \nmy position. I don't think that is the position of most Senators. As \nthe Senate resolution indicates, Congress would be open to considering \na different kind of supporting role in Bosnia. This could include \nactivities such as airlift, logistics, intelligence, or equipment, for \nexample. As long as such activities do not include the use of ground \nforces, and as long as the Congress is appropriately consulted, I too \nam open to considering the United States having such a supportive role \nfor our allies. That is not inconsistent with the notion of making sure \nground troops come home.\n\n  Mr. President, there are many who feel uncomfortable with Congress \nactually using its literal ``power of the purse'' to command a \nwithdrawal of U.S. troops from a military deployment. During the debate \nlast week, some Members who firmly support termination of the Bosnia \ndeployment by the June target date did express concern about the \nmechanism--a hard funding cutoff--that I had originally proposed. \nHowever, I want to point out that the reason Members of Congress turn \nto these drastic remedies, the reason I proposed it in the first place, \nand the reason the House passed such a hard date overwhelmingly is \nprecisely because not only the administration but also some leaders in \nCongress seem oblivious to the calls by other Members of Congress for \nending the mission by the target date.\n  Given the statements we heard this weekend, Mr. President, it is even \nmore imperative than ever that the conferees employ the strongest \npossible language regarding the June 30 pullout date when we get to the \nfinal version of the Defense authorization bill. I originally believed \nthat a hard mandate--nearly 1 year in advance of that date--would give \nthe administration more than enough time to prepare for and to \nimplement an orderly withdrawal of U.S. ground forces.\n\n[[Page S7413]]\n\n  Unlike the President's remarks, the message from the Congress has to \nleave no room for interpretation or ambiguity. We should not just say \nthat our ground troops should be back home next year, if possible. I \nthink we have to say, as we have done in both Houses--and we have to \nsay this in the conference report--that our men and women should be out \nof Bosnia by June 30, 1998, period.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 846\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for himself and Mr. \n     Inouye, proposes an amendment numbered 846.\n       At an appropriate place in the bill, insert:\n\n     SEC.   . FINDINGS.\n\n       The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, at the Madrid \n     summit, decided to admit three new members, the Czech \n     Republic, Poland and Hungary;\n       The President, on behalf of the United States endorsed and \n     advocated the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization to include three additional members;\n       The Senate will consider the ratification of instruments to \n     approve the admissions of new members to the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization;\n       The United States has contributed more than $20,000,000,000 \n     since 1952 for infrastructure and support of the Alliance;\n       In appropriations Acts likely to be considered by the \n     Senate for fiscal year 1998, $449,000,000 has been requested \n     by the President for expenditures in direct support of United \n     States participation in the Alliance; and\n       In appropriations Acts likely to be considered by the \n     Senate for fiscal year 1998, $9,983,300,000 has been \n     requested by the President in support of United States \n     military expenditures in North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     countries.\n\n     SEC.   .\n\n       The Secretary of Defense shall identify and report to the \n     congressional defense committees not later than October 1, \n     1997; (1) the amounts necessary, by appropriation account, \n     for all anticipated costs to the U.S., for the admission of \n     the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary to the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization for the fiscal years 1998, 1999, 2000, \n     2001 and 2002, and; (2) any new commitments or obligations \n     entered into or assumed by the United States in association \n     with the admission of new members to the Alliance, to include \n     the deployment of United States military personnel, the \n     provision of defense articles or equipment, training \n     activities and the modification and construction of military \n     facilities.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I apologize to the reading clerk for not \nhaving it drafted properly to start with. But I do ask that these \nchanges be made so that the amendment is as read by the reading clerk.\n  It is an amendment that is a direction to the Department of Defense \nto provide the Congress with two specific reports.\n  First, the amounts necessary, by appropriations account, for all \nanticipated costs to the United States for the admission of three new \nmembers to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and that report to \ncover the current budget cycle of fiscal year 1998 through 2002.\n  Second, a report on any new commitments or obligations entered into \nor assumed by our Nation in association with the admission of these new \nmembers of the alliance, including--it is not limited to--but including \ndeployment of U.S. personnel, the provisions of defense articles or \nequipment, training activities, and modification and construction of \nmilitary facilities.\n  I am one who has still strong reservations about the determination to \nadd new members to NATO. I am not opposed to NATO. I have been a firm \nsupporter of NATO. On the other hand, we are doing some studies now on \nthe history of the expansion of NATO and how United States \nparticipation in deployment of forces there has just constantly \nincreased.\n  We, I think, need to know now what the obligation is that we have \nundertaken and really what will be the costs of this obligation in \nconnection with the expansion of NATO. This really is, I think, a \nfairly restrictive list of things that we should have. But, clearly, we \nshould have this information before we proceed with any consideration \nof ratification of any agreements that have been entered into by the \nUnited States in connection with this expansion of NATO.\n  It is, I think, one of the strange coincidences of history that NATO \nwas entered into--and I will present the documentation on this later--\nwith the firm assurance by the then Secretary of State Dean Atchison to \nthe Senate that would be no obligation at all for the deployment of \nforces to Europe by virtue of the North Atlantic Treaty that was \nentered into by the United States at the very beginning of this \norganization, the NATO organization.\n  I want to be right upfront about it, that this information may \nconvince Members to go one way or the other concerning the matters that \nwill be presented to us later. But I don't know of anyone who could \nobject to asking for this information for the use of the Congress, and \nparticularly for the use of those of us who have the duty to find and \nallocate the money to maintain our national defense forces to assure \nthe capability to defend this country.\n  I am pleased that my friend from Hawaii has cosponsored this \namendment in that spirit. This is just seeking information. It will in \nno way inhibit the administration--either the Department of Defense or \nthe President--in their current course. But I do, as I said, still \nmaintain reservations about that course because of what I perceive to \nbe the costs of that course and its impact on our future ability to \nmaintain our own defense.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, as appropriators, I believe it is the only \nprudent process that we can follow to at least advise ourselves and our \ncolleagues as to what can be reasonably and rationally anticipated if \nwe are to take this important step.\n  When NATO was originally organized, I doubt if Members of Congress \nhad any inkling of what the costs would be to the taxpayers of the \nUnited States. Whether you are for it or against it, I think it would \nbe well that we enter into this new phase and very important phase with \nour eyes open.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is not a small amount that is in the \nbill which is before us. As this amendment points out, there is almost \n$10 billion in the request of the President for U.S. military \nexpenditures pursuant to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \nobligations. I do believe that it is important for us to know to what \nextent that will be increased by virtue of the cost of action that is \nproposed due to the enlargement process as far as NATO is concerned.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be set aside so that we may proceed with the program already \noutlined by the leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/14/senate-section/article/S7407-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7413-S7414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNOMINATION OF JOEL KLEIN TO BE ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL IN CHARGE OF \n                         THE ANTITRUST DIVISION\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, as the ranking Democrat on the Antitrust \nSubcommittee, let me tell you why I support Mr. Klein's nomination, why \nhe is a good choice for the job, and why we ought to confirm him today.\n  First, Joel Klein is an accomplished lawyer with a distinguished \ncareer. He graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law School, \nand clerked for the U.S. Court of Appeals here in Washington, then for \nJustice Powell. Just as importantly, he is the President's choice to \nhead the Antitrust Division, and I believe that any President--Democrat \nor Republican--is entitled to a strong presumption in favor of his \nexecutive branch nominees.\n  Second, Joel Klein is a pragmatist, not an idealogue. His answers at \nhis confirmation hearing suggest that he is not antibusiness, as some \nwould claim the Antitrust Division was in the late 1970's, nor \nanticonsumer, as some argue the Division was during the 1980's. \nInstead, he will plot a middle course, I believe, that promotes free \nmarkets, fair competition, and consumer welfare.\n  The third reason we should confirm Joel Klein is because no one \ndeserves\n\n[[Page S7414]]\n\nto linger in this type of legislative limbo. Here in Congress, we need \nthe input of a confirmed head of the Antitrust Division to give us the \nadministration's views on a variety of important policy matters--\ndefense consolidation, electricity deregulation, and telecommunications \nmergers, among others. We need someone who can speak with authority for \nthe Division without a cloud hanging over his head.\n  More than that, without a confirmed leader, morale at the Antitrust \nDivision is suffering. And given the pace at which the President has \nnominated and the Senate has confirmed appointees, if we fail to \napprove Mr. Klein, it will be at least a year before we confirm a \nreplacement--maybe longer, and maybe never. So we need to act now; we \ncan't afford to let the Antitrust Division continue to drift.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I have great respect for the Senator from \nSouth Carolina--as well as the Senators from Nebraska and North Dakota. \nThey have been forceful advocates for consumers on telecommunications \nmatters, and I have stood side by side with them in that fight. But we \nought to give Mr. Klein our vote today, so he can have the chance to \nsucceed or fail as a confirmed appointee. My hope and expectation is \nthat in a few years--when we look back at Joel Klein's service as head \nof the Antitrust Division --his accomplishments will surprise his \ncritics, please his supporters, and improve what is already the best \nfree market economy in the world.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nnomination of Joel Klein to be Assistant Attorney General for the \nAntitrust Division of the Department of Justice. And while I will vote \nto bring this nomination to the floor for a vote, I will outline my \nconcerns for the Senate at this time.\n  Mr. President, a number of my colleagues have expressed their serious \nconcern about this nominee. More importantly, they have detailed the \nresponsibilities of this position. This position has a statutory \nresponsibility to enforce the antitrust authority of the Department of \nJustice.\n  As my colleagues have eloquently stated, this is particularly \nimportant and timely in regard to the telecommunication reform \nregulations which are being promulgated to enforce the reforms enacted \ninto law last year. While these reforms should bring great benefits to \nconsumers across the country, the Department of Justice must play an \nactive role to protect the interests of consumers against violations of \nantitrust authority.\n  This is also important in the meat packing industry. The mergers \nwhich this industry has experienced have left livestock producers at \nthe mercy of precious few meat processors. Just five packers control \nthis industry. Producers and consumers alike need to know that the \nDepartment of Justice is enforcing antitrust law.\n  There have also been a number of mergers in the railroad industry \nwhich have virtually eliminated competition in this transportation \nsector. For a State like Montana--a captive shipper--this is a problem. \nMontana farmers pay freight rates that are among the highest in the \nNation. It generally is cheaper to ship grain from States east of \nMontana to the ports of Portland or Seattle, than it is for Montana \nproducers. Without careful attention, I worry that this discrepancy \ncould get worse, not letter.\n  Mr. President, I will be supporting this nomination. I have long \nrelied on a very simple question to determine my support or opposition \nfor a nominee for a Presidential appointment. Is the candidate \nqualified? In this case, I believe the President's choice is qualified \nand has no reason we should delay confirmation.\n  So I will be voting for this nominee. And, when he is confirmed, I \nwill be watching the issues under the jurisdiction of the Antitrust \nDivision very carefully.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, once again, I find myself in the \nunpleasant position of speaking before my colleagues about unacceptable \nlevels of unnecessary spending in the defense appropriations bill. I \nfully understand the pressure facing the chairman and ranking member of \nthe committee, but I would be remiss in my responsibilities were I not \nto go on record for those items in the bill of truly questionable merit \nthat appear to represent the usual practice of inserting programs \nprimarily for parochial reasons.\n  The total value of these programs is about $5 billion, about twice as \nmuch as the Congress increased the President's overall defense budget \nrequest and, incidentally, about the same amount of wasteful spending \nadded in the defense authorization bill. This amount does not include \nthe $300 million transferred from the Defense Department to the \nTransportation Department for Coast Guard activities, a perennial \nprovision in defense appropriations bills.\n  Let me review some examples of items included in the bill and report \nthat are, in my view, wasteful, unnecessary and designed simply to \nserve personal interests.\n  The bill not only funds an oceanographic research ship not requested \nby the Defense Department, it throws in an extra $19.5 million for \noceanographic and meteorological research. Are we to honestly believe \nthe $209 million in the budget request for that function is inadequate \nfor the next fiscal year? Of course, the over $200 million for C-130J \naircraft--once again not requested and certainly not needed, as \nemphasized by the Air Force Chief of Staff--represents a particularly \negregious waste of taxpayer money.\n  I wonder, Mr. President, if some day, some year we will stop buying \nC-130 aircraft. Many years ago, the Air Force said they didn't need any \nmore C-130 aircraft. It is time--well, I say it every year. It gets a \nlittle ridiculous.\n  An especially troublesome expense, neither budgeted for nor estimated \nin any accompanying documentation provided by the Appropriations \nCommittee, is the amount associated with the various ``Buy America'' \nprovisions included in the bill. Such expenses include restricting to \nU.S. manufacturers procurement of shipboard anchor and mooring chain, \ncarbon, alloy and armor steel plate, and ball and roller bearings. \nConsequently, there is an automatic and generally substantial unknown \ncost tied to this bill that will only become known as contracts are \nsigned with American manufacturers despite the availability of less \nexpensive products from our trading partners.\n  Lest anyone feel that I am unsympathetic to American manufacturers, I \nneed only point out the protectionist measures our European allies and \ncustomers are considering in retaliation for the ``Buy America'' \nstatutes included in the appropriations bills that are routinely passed \nby Congress. Britain, a major purchaser of American platforms and \nsystems, is understandably tired of the one-way street we pursue in \ndefense acquisitions. I am fully cognizant of the need to protect \ncertain vital industries for national security reasons, but the items \nprotected in this and other bills hardly qualify.\n  The costly and unnecessary practice of earmarking appropriations \ncontinues: $35 million for the Kaho'olawe Island Conveyance, \nRemediation and Environmental Restoration Fund; $250,000 for a pilot \nproject to ``facilitate the transfer of commercial cruise ship \nshipbuilding technology and expertise to U.S. yards,'' provided the \nJones Act restrictions are rigorously applied to the Hawaiian Islands; \n$5.4 million for establishment of a small business development center, \nwhich is to focus on agricultural programs in Pacific islands; $2.7 \nmillion to investigate new technologies in such areas as hyperspectral \nfluorescence imaging, work to be conducted at the Akamai project at \nTripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii, with another $10 million \nearmarked that the Department will be expected to spend for these \nprograms; $2.7 million of the oceanographic spending to which I \nreferred earlier at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in south Florida; \n$6.9 million for upgrading air traffic control simulators at Keesler \nAir Force Base in Mississippi; and $8 million for continued activities \nat the Pacific Disaster Center.\n\n  Mr. President, that barely scratches the surface of what is in this \nbill: $3 million is earmarked for the Caribbean radiation early warning \nsystem, which is to be spent at the Center for Monitoring Research, \nwhich brings me to the issue of Congress' tendency to create new \ncenters for the study of every conceivable subject, research virtually \nall of which is already performed elsewhere. The defense authorization \nbill passed last week included $5 million to establish a center for the \nstudy of the Chinese military. I can go to my office or the library and \nfind numerous examples of competent studies on the Chinese military \nalready available, whether from the Rand Corp., the American Enterprise \nInstitute, or various studies published by scholars at various \nuniversities. The authorization bill also establishes a Center for \nHemispheric Defense Studies for no apparent reason.\n  The practice of earmarking funds for centers knows no bounds. S. 1005 \nincludes $7 million for the Center of Excellence for Research in Ocean \nSciences, just in case there was any risk of funds being spent for a \ncenter of mediocrity for research in ocean sciences; $4 million for the \nSouthern Observatory for Astronomical Research; $4 million for the \nCenter of Advanced Microstructure Devices; and on and on it goes. I do \nnot doubt for one second that the sponsors of these programs can come \nbefore the Senate and offer an articulate and thoughtful defense of \ntheir pet projects. I do doubt very seriously whether any of these \nitems properly belongs in the defense appropriations bill, especially \nduring a period when vital accounts are regularly taxed to pay for \nongoing and unforeseen contingencies, like Bosnia and Iraq.\n  Any time military equipment is prepared for shipment to and from \ndeployment, it is inspected for damage and, in the case of equipment \nbeing returned to its home base, for foreign substances like dust that \ncould contain bacteria alien to our country. Do we really need to \nearmark another $1 million to expand that research specifically for \nbrown tree snakes, which, to the best of my knowledge, are located only \nin Guam? Yes, it is true that we base a large number of forces on that \nisland. It is also true that the brown snake is a dangerous snake. I \nsimply find it hard to believe that we need to spend any defense \ndollars on an issue for which plenty of information already exists and \nis readily available.\n\n  Mr. President, I have touched on the tip of the iceberg. There is \nplenty more I could point to were time available. I only look forward \nto the day when my trips to the floor to highlight wasteful and \nunnecessary spending are no longer necessary.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of objectionable \nadd-ons in the Department of Defense appropriations bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as

Mr. President, finally, I want to again thank the Senator \nfrom Alaska and the Senator from Hawaii for, as always, doing an \noutstanding and dedicated job in preparation of this very difficult and \nlargest appropriations bill that we consider. We have had debate and \ndiscussion over my objections for many years. I am sure that will \ncontinue. But that debate and discussion has not been characterized by \na lack of respect on my part for the outstanding job that both the \nSenator from Alaska and the Senator from Hawaii do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I await, sometimes with trepidation, the \nannual report of my good friend from Arizona. I know of no one who \nspends more time, other than Senator Inouye and I do, than the Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  His comments are to the point. We do disagree on some of the issues. \nBut I\n\n[[Page S7417]]\n\nwant the Senate to know once again we are grateful to him for the \namount of time he puts into the bill. He has led, through his comments \nfrom year to year, changes that we have tried to make in subsequent \nbills to reflect his guidance. We again will examine this bill as we go \nto conference to make sure that we have done the best we can to accept \nhis advice and counsel. But I deeply, truly am grateful to him for the \ntime he takes on the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Alaska for his consideration of \nmy remarks and the context in which they are intended. I appreciate the \ndegree of cooperation he and the Senator from Hawaii have accorded me \nand my staff in the examination of the pending amendments. I am \ngrateful for that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. What is the floor \nsituation right now? Is the bill open for amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A first-degree amendment is currently pending \nto the bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment \nbe put aside so we can consider the amendment of the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 848\n\n     (Purpose: To prohibit the use of taxpayer funds to underwrite \n         restructuring costs associated with a business merger)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment which I send to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 848.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n       Sec.   . None of the funds available to the Department of \n     Defense under this Act may be obligated or expended to pay a \n     contractor under a contract with the Department of Defense \n     for any costs incurred by the contractor when it is made \n     known to the Federal official having authority to obligate or \n     expend such funds that such costs are restructuring costs \n     associated with a business combination that were incurred on \n     or after July 15, 1997.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will take just a few minutes here to \ndescribe my amendment and what it does. I appreciate the chairman's \nwillingness to set aside his amendment to take up this one.\n  Mr. President, this is an amendment similar to one that I offered a \nyear ago to get the Government out of the business of paying defense \ncontractors for exercising their own best business judgment in merging \ntogether to form larger corporations, because that is what we are doing \nright now. Even though defense contractors want to merge--it is in \ntheir own best business interest to do so--taxpayers are coming in and \nsubsidizing it.\n  This is new. We have never done this before. Prior to July 1993, the \nDepartment of Defense had a longstanding practice of not permitting \ndefense contractors to charge restructuring costs to flexibly priced \ncontracts that were transferred from one contractor to another as a \nresult of a business combination.\n  That was the longstanding policy of DOD. The rationale for this \npractice was that DOD should not have to pay increased costs merely \nbecause one contractor is combining with another contractor. That \nstatement comes right out of a recent GAO report.\n  But in July 1993, DOD changed its longstanding practice and uniformly \nbegan permitting defense contractors to charge restructuring costs to \nthe taxpayers of this country.\n  How did this come about? Did it come about because Congress passed a \nlaw permitting it? No. Was there ever any debate on the Senate floor \nabout it? None whatsoever. Was there ever one hearing held on it? No, \nthere was not one hearing held on it.\n  What happened was that in 1993, then Undersecretary of Defense, Mr. \nJohn Deutch by name, was Undersecretary for Procurement. He decided, \nsingle-handedly, to change the longstanding policy and made this \nchange.\n  We raised the point at the time, I and others, that this was a change \nin the Federal Acquisition Regulations, [FAR]. To get a change like \nthis in FAR, there was a process and procedure that one had to go \nthrough. It had to be published in the Federal Register. There had to \nbe hearings on it. Congress had to act on it. None of that took place.\n  When we raised the point that regulations were not followed in \nchanging the FAR, Mr. Deutch testified that in fact this was not a \nchange in FAR, this was simply an explanation of existing law, that \nindeed the Department of Defense or any Federal agency had the \nauthority to pay for the costs of mergers and acquisitions. So to get \nout from underneath violating the law, which I believe is what Mr. \nDeutch did at that time in terms of not going through the normal \nprocess, he then said, well, this really was not a change in FAR, it \nwas simply an explanation of what was existing law.\n  That raised all kinds of questions, as I pointed out last year in the \ndebate.\n  If this had been existing law for all these years, then it does not \njust affect the Department of Defense. It affects every agency of \nGovernment. That means that if hospitals merge, if they have Government \ncontracts, can now come in and say, we want help for our mergers and \nacquisitions.\n  This could go back years and years. People could come back from 20 \nyears ago and say, Oh, well, we didn't know that that was existing law, \nso now we need to be reimbursed for the mergers we made in the past.\n  So we are hung up on the twin horns of this sort of dilemma. On the \none hand, if it was indeed a change in FAR, then Mr. Deutch and the \nDepartment of Defense did not go through proper procedures to \naccomplish that. If, on the other hand, it was not a change in FAR, \nthen we have opened a Pandora's box for providing for taxpayer funding \nfor any merger or combination for any company that has any Government \ncontract.\n  But I want to point out this is the Department of Defense, DOD, \nfunding bill. And, you know, some of my colleagues argue that we are \ntight for money in this bill. We tried last week to transfer some money \nout of DOD to pay for veterans. We were told we did not have enough \nmoney in DOD for that. Now we have a subsidy the likes of which we have \nnever seen in this country. I call it the ``money for nothing'' subsidy \nbecause that is exactly what the taxpayers are getting.\n\n  Let us look at the mergers and acquisitions that we have had.\n  Just last week Lockheed Martin announced it would purchase Northrop \nGrumman for an estimated $11.6 billion. Well, besides a nice stock \nboost for Northrop Grumman, which closed up 21.12 cents on the stock \nmarket when the merger was announced, these merging companies are also \neligible to receive millions of dollars from the American taxpayers \njust for doing what is in their own best business interest. So that is \nwhy I am offering this amendment, a commonsense amendment to prevent \nthese large and profitable companies from receiving taxpayer subsidies \nsimply for merging.\n  I am not saying they cannot merge. I am simply saying that the \ntaxpayer should not fund it.\n  For the life of me, I cannot see the wisdom in paying these \nprofitable companies for merging when they are doing it in their own \nbest business interest, when they are making a lot of money on the \nstock market, and we are paying them with money that we just do not \nhave. I thought we were trying to balance the budget.\n  Again, this is not money for any goods that we are going to receive \nat all. I just think that if these companies want to merge, fine--I \nknow the Department of Defense has been urging them to merge for \nsavings to the taxpayers, possible savings to the taxpayers. I do not \nknow whether that is true or not. There may be some savings, but I do \nnot think that has all been documented in terms of real savings. But \neven if there are savings to the taxpayers, the fact is, these \ncompanies are making a lot of money by\n\n[[Page S7418]]\n\nmerging. These companies would not merge if it was not in their best \nbusiness interests to do so. There is no one at the Defense Department \nholding a hammer over their heads saying, Lockheed, you must merge with \nNorthrop Grumman. There is no one holding a hammer over the head of \nBoeing saying, You must merge with McDonnell Douglas. They are doing it \nbecause it is increasing their profits, increasing their bottom line \nfor their stockholders. Otherwise they would never do it.\n  These mergers, aside from making more money for the companies, are in \nfact decreasing the amount of competition that we have out there now \nfor Government procurements. But now they say that, well, these mergers \nare going to save us money.\n  Let me read a couple of passages from a recent DOD inspector general \nreport, dated June 28, 1996. On page 9-- let me read it in its full \ncontext:\n\n       Contractors' [meaning defense contractors] are submitting \n     cost proposals for activities called concentration, \n     transition, economic planning, and other terms that do not \n     immediately suggest restructuring and make the cost issues \n     difficult for the Government to review, administer, and \n     resolve.\n\n  On page 10 of the same IG's report--this is still the DOD inspector \ngeneral's report--they said that:\n\n       One contractor's restructuring proposal projected savings \n     over 10 years. But the contractor's projections are highly \n     speculative since the volume of Government business is not \n     guaranteed. The same contractor also proposed savings based \n     on ``synergies in the work force''--\n\n  How about that one?\n\n     a term that is not defined in the existing procurement \n     regulations, and is difficult at best to substantiate and \n     evaluate.\n\n  Not my words, this is the DOD inspector general's words.\n  On page 16 the same IG report:\n\n       Amortization based on the projection of extended savings \n     can almost make a marginal acquisition appear attractive by \n     spreading costs over a long period, and comparing them to the \n     projected savings to determine savings. In all cases, amorti- \n     zation periods were selected for arbitrary reasons. . . .\n\n  According to a GAO study of one business combination, they said:\n\n       The net cost reduction certified by DOD represents less \n     than 15 percent of the savings projected to the DOD 2 years \n     earlier when they sought support for the proposed \n     partnership.\n\n  So DOD said, here is the proposed savings. GAO did the study of it \nand said the cost reduction was less than 15 percent of the proposed \nsavings.\n  So, I believe, Mr. President, this practice is clearly an abuse of \ntaxpayers' money. We never passed it in the Congress. I believe that if \nthis had ever come up for a vote in the Senate to say that we are now \ngoing to pay for mergers and acquisitions for these companies who are \ngoing to make these huge profits, I do not think it ever would have \npassed.\n  If these companies are merging for business reasons, why do they need \na handout from the taxpayers? If they are not being ordered to do so by \nthe Government--and they certainly are not; encouraged, yes, not \nordered to do so--but if they are good, the mergers will happen anyway, \nand the taxpayers will receive any savings without paying anything out.\n  I know that is the point that is going to be made. We know that we \ncan see some savings being made by these mergers. Fine. That is a great \nsavings for the taxpayer if that is happening. But there is no reason \nwe should have to pay for these mergers, because the companies are \nmaking much higher profits, much more money than they were before.\n\n  So, therefore, we should not have to pay for them. Lawrence Korb, \nformer Under Secretary of Defense, pointed out that defense contracting \nis still a profitable business. Over the past year, Lockheed Martin \nstock increased 48 percent in value, Northrop Grumman stock is up 50 \npercent, and McDonnell Douglas went up a whopping 80 percent last year. \nThat is fine. That is good. But then why do we have to come in and give \ntaxpayers' money to them to merge?\n  You do not have to take it from me but from a very conservative think \ntank, the Cato Institute, which said, ``The costs associated by mergers \nshould not be absorbed by Federal taxpayers. This is an egregious \nexample of unwarranted corporate welfare in our budget.''\n  Taxpayers for Common Sense said, ``It is time for the Pentagon to \ndrop this ridiculous money-for-nothing policy.''\n  The Project on Government Oversight said, ``The new policy is \nunneeded, establishes inappropriate government intervention in the \neconomy, promotes layoffs of high-wage jobs, pays for excessive CEO \nsalaries, and is likely to cost the government billions of dollars.''\n  Mr. President, it is time for the Pentagon to drop this ridiculous \nmoney-for-nothing policy. This policy is unneeded, it allows \ninappropriate Government intervention in the economy, and is likely to \ncost more because it will limit competition.\n  Mr. President, the GAO recently pointed out that in the last round of \nmergers and acquisitions they found the following: One, GAO was unable \nto account for savings for the Federal Government due to DOD's \nsubsidies for mergers; second, the GAO reported that the mergers have \nled to the layoff of 15,000 workers, with an additional 4,000 expected. \nGAO also offered no evidence that the subsidy had resulted in any \nsavings that would not have been achieved without Federal payments.\n  There is another effect that we have not factored in here: 15,000 \nhard-working blue-color Americans lost their jobs, most of them good \nunion people, making pretty good wages--15,000 of them out of work. I \nsuppose they belong to unions like the machinists and a lot of other \ngood unions, making good money. Fifteen thousand laid off because of \nthese mergers and acquisitions. How many went on food stamps? How many \ndrew unemployment compensation? That is another cost to the taxpayers \nthat was not picked up by these merger and acquisition costs or \nfactored into the studies.\n  Mr. John Deutch, in 1993, made a big mistake. We should not compound \nthat mistake. Already, we have paid out $179 million to pay for mergers \nand acquisitions. There is pending right now on the books about $817 \nmillion that we can see. That is not counting the upcoming Boeing-\nMcDonnell Douglas merger. How many more hundreds of millions of dollars \nwill that add?\n  My amendment, Mr. President, says simply that all of those that we \nhave--and I want to make sure the managers of the bill understand \nthis--all of those with which we have contractual arrangements, \nobviously have to be paid. What my amendment says is that those that \nhave not been contractually made, we will not pay for these mergers or \nacquisitions. So if we have made the contracts, I guess we have to live \nup to it. But my amendment says none in the future.\n  It is time to stop this ridiculous policy of paying highly profitable \ncompanies to do what is in their own best interests and which they \nwould do anyway even if there were no Government subsidy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have discussed this matter with the \ndistinguished Senator. I want to specifically call his attention to two \nsections that are in our bill that were in the bill the year before and \nthe year before. One says:\n\n       None of the funds available to the Department of Defense \n     under this Act shall be obligated or expended to pay a \n     contractor under a contract with the Department of Defense \n     for costs of any amount paid by the contractor to an employee \n     when--\n       (1) such costs are for a bonus or otherwise in excess of \n     the normal salary paid by the contractor to the employee; and\n       (2) such bonus as part of restructuring costs associated \n     with business combination.\n\n  Second, we have a provision in this bill on page 91 section 8090. \n``None of the funds available to the Department of Defense under this \nAct may be obligated or expended to reimburse a defense contractor for \nrestructuring costs associated with business combination of the defense \ncontractor that occurs after the date of enactment''--and it was in \nlast year's bill, also; so it covers all of the mergers and \nconsolidations that the Senator has mentioned--``unless:\n\n       (1) the auditable savings for the Department of Defense \n     resulting from restructuring will exceed the costs allowed by \n     a factor of at least two to one, or\n       (2) the savings for the Department of Defense resulting \n     from restructuring will exceed the costs allowed and the \n     Secretary of Defense determines that the business combination \n     will result in the preservation of a critical capability that \n     might otherwise be lost to the Department, and\n\n[[Page S7419]]\n\n       (3) the report required by section 818(e) of Public Law \n     103-337 be submitted to Congress in 1996 is submitted.\n\n  Now, what we have done in the past is we have said that if clearly \nthere is a two-in-one savings resulting from the combination, the \nbuildings can be paid associated with restructuring. If it is a \nsituation where the savings and the costs are equal, then the \nDepartment can pay costs associated with restructuring where it finds \nthat it is in the interests of the Department and the United States to \nhave the consolidation because of its impact on our industrial base. \nThat is the last part I want to mention to my friend.\n  We have reduced procurement costs by over 60 percent now of the \nDepartment of Defense. In so doing, we faced the problem of what \nhappens to the industrial base. Many people have come to us and talked \nto us about this, come to the committee and talked to us about it. You \nhave to maintain the industrial base that is necessary to provide this \nNation with the systems that will be required in our defense. We have \nseen it in shipbuilding, in submarine building, in aircraft building, \nin tanks; we have seen it across the spectrum of procurement.\n  In order to do that, in some instances, there have been incentives to \nindustry to consolidate in the past. In this time, however, in this go-\nround, there have been no incentives paid, there has been the right of \nthe Department to pay a portion of the restructuring costs when they \nmeet these two tests. If the savings projected are twice as much as the \ncosts, then the Department may pay the costs.\n  I say to my friend, the problem of maintaining the industrial base is \na very difficult one in a global economy. We are part of a global \ndefense economy now, too. There are enormous entities in other nations \nthat are competing with our people to provide new equipment, military \nequipment to nations throughout the world, that are able to purchase \nand maintain sophisticated new technology for their own defense.\n  Senator Inouye and I have visited nations throughout the Pacific \nalmost annually, and we have seen that. We have seen the desire for the \nacquisition of new high-performance aircraft for aircraft carriers, for \nsubmarines. We have seen that in terms of the purchase from the Soviet \nUnion, some of the nations in the Persian Gulf.\n  The point I am making is, if we are to be able to maintain the \ncapability that we must have to compete, if necessary, once again, in \nrestructuring our own industrial base and making it possible to expand \nany of these systems, we have to maintain the minimum amount of \nindustrial base necessary to do that. These restructurings that have \ntaken place, in my judgment, have enhanced the ability of the United \nStates to maintain an industrial base, primarily the ones that my \nfriend is talking about in the field of aviation and that have happened \njust recently. Had those mergers, those consolidations not taken place, \nwe would have seen the problem of the industrial basics exacerbated by \nsome of those companies failing when they were under obligation to the \nUnited States to complete existing contracts.\n\n  These mergers and consolidations have enabled these companies to come \ntogether, and they will, in fact, fulfill existing contracts. There is \nstill enough of a competitive structure within our Nation to assure \ncompetition for future contracts. I understand the Senator has a GAO \nreport on this matter.\n  I think it is premature, really, to assess the impact of the laws we \npassed. By the way, there are other provisions in the authorization \nbill for the years past, and also in this year. I do not have the \nknowledge of every one of the items he mentioned on a personal basis, \nbut I have the belief that the Department has before it a series of \nprovisions that prohibit the reimbursement for the bonuses to start \nwith. They are not part of this at all. They cannot be paid. But beyond \nthat, there are limited cases when restructuring costs may be paid by \nthe Department, either when the savings are 2-to-1 over the costs or \nwhere the Secretary finds it is at least equal savings to the costs, \nthat those costs are in the interests of the Government in maintaining \nthe industrial capacity to provide for our own defense.\n  I say to the Senator, I reluctantly have to again oppose his \namendment and I will do so. I do not stand here to say that there have \nnot been some excesses in American industry per se over the payment of \nbonuses and costs upon merger and consolidations, but I do think in \nterms of those that have taken place within the realm of industrial \nbase and supplies to the Department of Defense we have acted in the \npast and we are maintaining again this year strict controls over what \ncan be paid by the Department from taxpayers' funds as a result of \ncosts resulting from such restructuring.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate my chairman's comments on this. I know that \nthe law was changed last year; Commerce put these provisions in there.\n  Let me respond by saying that I think the GAO report points out that \nthese are ephemeral, at best. It does say that you have to, if I could \njust have the chairman's attention, have the savings, the restructuring \nsavings for DOD just has to be projected by at least 2-to-1.\n  Then here is what the GAO said about estimating these savings. It \nsaid:\n\n       Restructuring savings, on the other hand, are not recorded \n     in a contractor's accounting records. Therefore, neither the \n     amount nor the nature of the savings can be determined by \n     reviewing the accounting records. Consequently, savings have \n     to be estimated. For example, Northrop-Grumman's estimated 5-\n     year savings from closing the Grumman corporate headquarters \n     of about $215 million, of which about $100 million represents \n     the labor and fringe costs that would be avoided over the 5-\n     year period by laying off approximately 250 workers. These \n     savings are, therefore, an estimate of a cost avoidance over \n     the 5 years, the cost of the additional people that would \n     have been needed had the headquarters not been closed.\n       The savings from restructuring activities we examined were \n     generally in the form of such future cost avoidances. The \n     initial estimate of restructuring savings is simple in \n     concept because it makes the critical assumption that \n     everything else, except for the restructuring, is the same \n     after a business combination as before. Because things are \n     never the same, it is difficult to precisely identify actual \n     savings several years after the initial estimate is prepared.\n\n  Basically, what they are saying is, all of this money is fungible. I \nknow the chairman says that we put a provision in there saying they \ncan't use any of this money to pay bonuses. Fine. But they can go ahead \nand pay big bonuses and they can shift the cost over somewhere else, \nand we pay for closing an office and laying off 250 workers, which is a \ncost avoidance.\n  So this money is all fungible. The GAO says there is no accounting \nprinciple that they can look to to determine that. So these are \nprojected savings, not actual.\n  I say to my friend from Alaska, the distinguished chairman, projected \nsavings, well, I can tell you, any defense industry that is going to \nmerge is going to show you that the savings to the taxpayers is much \nmore than 2-to-1 over the amount of money we are going to give them for \nmerging. That is an absolute because they are going to be able to show \nthose kinds of savings. That is not the point. The point is, they are \ngoing to merge because it is in their best business interest to do so.\n  Last week, Northrop-Grumman stock went up $21.12 a share. That is a \nlot of money. The stockholders or shareholders are happy about this. \nThey have the money to go ahead and merge. This is in their best \nbusiness interest to do so. If the taxpayers get savings out of it, \nfine, I am all for it. We should get savings out of it. But why should \nwe pay them to do something that they are going to do anyway? Let us \nget the savings. Let it be 2-to-1. I hope it is 3-to-1, or 4-to-1, or \n5-to-1. But we don't have to give them this money to do it.\n  So that is in response to what the chairman just said. Yes, they have \nto project that the savings will exceed the allowed costs--that is the \nmoney we give them--by a factor of 2-to-1. Believe me, they are going \nto show that without any problem whatsoever. But if they can't, there \nis another loophole because if the projected savings to DOD exceeded \nthe costs allowed, the secretary can determine if the business \ncombination will result in the preservation of a critical capability. \nSo there is another loophole if, in fact, they can't meet that test. \nBelieve me they will meet that test.\n  My bottom line is still this: These defense contractors are merging \nbecause it is in their best business interest to do so. It is not in \nour best interest, I\n\n[[Page S7420]]\n\ndon't think--not all the time--because I think we are destroying a lot \nof competition that was out there. But there is no reason for the \ntaxpayers to subsidize it. That is what this amendment does. It simply \nstops it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I believe the measure before us has \naddressed this problem. The problem in issue is rather painful. On one \nhand, it is our intention, and the intention of our Department of \nDefense, to maintain and retain an industrial base. How do we maintain \nan industrial base if there are too many companies involved in one \nscope of work, adding to the cost of defense? We have found that by \nencouraging restructuring, they can bring about a definite reduction in \ncosts--a reduction in costs to the taxpayers, a reduction in costs to \nthe Department.\n  Mr. President, there is no question that when we do achieve cost \nreduction brought about by restructuring, men and women will find \nthemselves without employment. And so we are faced with this \npredicament: Do we subsidize a company by paying large sums of money \nfor services and products, knowing that it can be done less \nexpensively, but since we don't want men and women to lose their jobs, \nwe subsidize their company to maintain an overloaded work force?\n\n  We have decided that it would be in our national interest, in the \ninterest of the Defense Department, and in the interest of the \ntaxpayers that we bring down the cost of Government. We do have other \nprograms--not in the defense bill, but in other accounts--such as \nlabor, health and human services, Medicare, Medicaid, welfare to help, \nto the extent possible, those who may have become victims of \nrestructuring. But we have, Mr. President--the chairman and I--the \nresponsibility of presenting to the Senate a measure that we are \nconfident would bring about the best service, the best product, at the \nleast cost.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be no \nfurther debate on the Senator's amendment and that it not be subject to \nsecond-degree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 11 a.m. \non Tuesday the Senate resume consideration of this bill, the DOD \nappropriations bill, and that the following be the only remaining \namendments in order with relevant second-degree amendments in order:\n  First, there is a managers' package that we will offer;\n  There is a pending amendment, No. 846;\n  We have the Hutchison amendment on war criminals;\n  McCain amendment to strike section 8097;\n  The McCain amendment; we will call it the ``Buy America'' amendment;\n  The Dorgan amendment on flood relief;\n  A second Dorgan amendment on re-engining authority;\n  A Feinstein amendment on land transfer;\n  A second amendment on NATO expansion cost cap;\n  Graham amendment, which I believe is cosponsored by Senator Mack, on \nelectronic combat testing;\n  The Harkin amendment, which is the second pending amendment for which \nthe yeas and nays were just ordered on, amendment 848;\n  Senator Inouye may have a managers' amendment in addition to mine;\n  The Robb Marc card amendment;\n  And that, following the disposition of those amendments, S. 1005 then \nbe read a third time, the Senate proceed to vote on the passage of the \nbill;\n  That further, when the Senate receives the House companion measure, \nthe Senate immediately proceed to its consideration.\n  I further ask that all after the enacting clause be stricken, and the \ntext of the Senate bill S. 1005 be inserted in lieu of the House-passed \nbill, the bill be read a third time, and passed.\n  I further ask that the Senate insist on its amendment and request a \nconference with the House, and that the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my understanding that, other than \nthose amendments that have now been qualified under this unanimous-\nconsent agreement, no further amendments will be in order.\n  It will be our intention to try to move as quickly as possible once \nwe are on the bill tomorrow morning at 11 o'clock to dispose of the \namendments I have listed. And I would ask that all staff be notified \nthat we shall seek time agreements on those amendments when they are \ncalled up.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A resolution adopted by Manistee County Board of \n     Commissioners, Manistee Michigan relative to the English \n     language; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n       POM-179. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of New Hampshire; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                        House Joint Resolution 4\n\n       Whereas, on May 21, 1996 New Hampshire became the first \n     state in the nation to enact electric utility restructuring \n     legislation, which provides for competitive retail customer \n     choice of electric generation suppliers for all customers in \n     1988: and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress and the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission (FERC) by statute and orders have laid \n     the groundwork for retail competition, by prompting wholesale \n     competition in electricity markets through the adoption of \n     the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the issuance of FERC Order \n     No. 888 promoting open access transmission services; and\n       Whereas, there remain some impediments and ambiguities in \n     federal law relative to states' promotion of retail \n     competition in electricity markets and the restructuring of \n     the electric utility industry, and ambiguities in the \n     boundary between federal and state jurisdiction; and\n       Whereas, divestiture by vertically integrated electric \n     utilities of their electric generation business and their \n     electric transmission and distribution business into separate \n     entities may be a desirable part of electric utility \n     restructuring, some states may want to encourage or mandate \n     such divestiture, and the spinning off of one business or the \n     other to current shareholders may be a desirable method of \n     implementing this goal; and\n       Whereas, New Hampshire has adopted an electric utility \n     restructuring policy principle in law which states, \n     ``Increased competition in the electric industry should be \n     implemented in a manner that supports and furthers the goals \n     of environmental improvement,'' and which continues, ``As \n     generation becomes deregulated, innovative market-driven \n     approaches are preferred to regulatory controls to reduce \n     adverse environmental impacts,'' and\n       Whereas, FERC has indicated a clear desire that the United \n     States Environmental Protection Agency implement appropriate \n     environmental regulation to accompany electric utility \n     restructuring; and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress is considering federal \n     legislation to encourage and promote retail competition and \n     customer choice in electricity supply markets; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate and House of Representatives in \n     General Court convened, That the general court of New \n     Hampshire hereby urges the United States Congress, FERC, and \n     other federal agencies to continue to cooperate with and \n     support state efforts to restructure the electric utility \n     industry and promote retail competition; and\n       That Congress and FERC should affirm state authority to \n     order retail customer choice of electric generation suppliers \n     including the authority to order filing of tariffs for the \n     provision of retail transmission service by electric \n     utilities under state jurisdiction and their affiliates, \n     consistent with needs of retail customers as well as FERC's \n     open access policies and comparability principles; and\n       That Congress should affirm that states have jurisdiction \n     over all retail sales of electricity to end users within the \n     state, so that states can require the imposition of \n     nonbypassable distribution charges on all retail customers, \n     even if there are no distribution facilities under state \n     jurisdiction involved; and\n       That Congress should make clear state authority to order \n     divestiture of generation assets by electric utilities that \n     own distribution; and\n       That Congress should remove tax code obstacles and other \n     barriers to electric utility restructuring, such as barriers \n     to divestiture of generation assets by vertically integrated \n     utilities or holding companies; and\n       That Congress should eliminate mandatory purchase \n     requirements of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of \n     1978 once all customers of a utility have the right to choose \n     their own supplier of electricity; and\n       That Congress and the EPA should pursue policies, including \n     amendments to the Clean Air Act, that promote market based \n     systems which ensure continued and ongoing environmental \n     improvement and reduction of air pollution emissions from \n     electric power generation plants, and provide for fair \n     competition among all generators; and\n       That copies of this resolution be sent by the clerk of the \n     house of representatives to the President of the United \n     States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Secretary of the \n     United States Department of Energy, the chairpersons of the \n     committees of the United States Congress having jurisdiction \n     over electric utility restructuring, and to each member of \n     the New Hampshire congressional delegation.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       POM-180. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Tennessee; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 53\n\n       Whereas, the integrity of Tennessee's infrastructure is \n     dependent upon the continued support of the federal \n     government and its funding mechanisms; and\n\n[[Page S7422]]\n\n       Whereas, the Chickamauga Lock plays a significant role in \n     the Tennessee Valley economy, serving as a getaway for the \n     transporting of goods into and out of the Tennessee Valley; \n     and\n       Whereas, located upstream from Chattanooga on the Tennessee \n     River, the Chickamauga Lock is an integral part of the \n     river's navigational system; and\n       Whereas, in recent years, the Chickamauga Lock has \n     developed serious structural problems, which have caused it \n     to deteriorate at a rapid pace, and, despite close monitoring \n     by the Tennessee Valley Authority, the lock has now \n     deteriorated to the point that repairs are ineffective; and\n       Whereas, TVA's final congressionally appropriated budget \n     contains language prohibiting TVA from using 1997 funds for \n     the new lock and from moving forward with detailed \n     engineering and construction activities this fiscal year; and\n       Whereas, TVA estimates that, if left unchecked, the \n     structural problems will cause the Lock to be closed to \n     traffic by 2005, forcing the abandonment of over 350 miles of \n     navigable waterway above Chattanooga; and\n       Whereas, closing the Chickamauga Lock would also result in \n     the loss of several thousand jobs, an increase in the cost of \n     alternative modes of transportation, a forfeiture of $25 \n     million annually in transportation savings, and pose serious \n     problems for water-dependent industries and burgeoning \n     waterfront development projects; and\n       Whereas, it is incumbent upon the members of this \n     legislative body to ensure the continued welfare of all \n     Tennesseans and to maintain the state's prominent position as \n     a leader in the Southeast's economic development; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the one-hundredth General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee, the House of \n     Representatives concurring, That this General Assembly hereby \n     supports the construction of a new Chickamauga Lock and \n     memorializes the Congress of the United States to proceed \n     expeditiously with engineering studies and to fund the \n     replacement of the Chickamauga Lock on the Tennessee River; \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President and Secretary of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker and the Clerk of the House of Representatives of the \n     United States, and to each member of the Tennessee \n     Congressional Delegation.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       POM-181. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Ohio; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 17\n\n       Whereas, men and women of the United States Armed Forces \n     fought valiantly in the Persian Gulf in 1991 to protect the \n     interests of their country; and\n       Whereas, more than 10,000 of these soldiers who fought for \n     their country in the Persian Gulf are now suffering severe \n     health problems believed to be a direct result of their \n     service in the War and referred to as ``Gulf War Syndrome,'' \n     and by the end of 1993 the Secretary of Veterans Affairs had \n     approved only 79 of 2,500 claims for disability compensation \n     benefits from veterans whose symptoms have been attributed to \n     Gulf War Syndrome; and\n       Whereas, the Department of Defense has recently \n     acknowledged that United States soldiers were exposed to \n     Iraqi chemical weapons during the War and nerve gas during a \n     military operation after the War; and\n       Whereas, experts agree there should be more research into \n     Gulf War Syndrome and its link to chemical agent exposure; \n     now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the General Assembly of the State of Ohio \n     requests the Secretary of Defense to adequately research the \n     cause and symptoms of Gulf War Syndrome and the President and \n     Congress to adequately fund the care and relief of those \n     veterans who have been exposed to the causes of the disease; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislative Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives transmit duly authenticated copies of this \n     Resolution to the President of the United States, to the \n     Secretary of Defense of the United States, to the members of \n     the Ohio Congressional delegation, to the Speaker and Clerk \n     of the United States House of Representatives, to the \n     President Pro Tempore and Secretary of the United States \n     Senate, and to the news media of Ohio.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       POM-182. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; to the \n     Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 38\n\n       Whereas, the biggest water pollution problem facing this \n     Commonwealth today is polluted water draining from abandoned \n     coal mines; and\n       Whereas, over half the streams that do not meet water \n     quality standards in this Commonwealth are affected by mine \n     drainage; and\n       Whereas, this Commonwealth has over 250,000 acres of \n     abandoned mine lands, refuse banks and old mine shafts in 45 \n     of Pennsylvania's 67 counties, more than any other state in \n     the nation; and\n       Whereas, the Department of Environmental Protection \n     estimates it will cost more than $15 billion to reclaim and \n     restore abandoned mine lands; and\n       Whereas, the Commonwealth now receives about $20 million a \n     year from the Federal Government to do reclamation projects; \n     and\n       Whereas, there is now a $1 billion balance in the Federal \n     Abandoned Mine Reclamation Trust Fund that is set aside by \n     law to take care of pollution and safety problems caused by \n     old coal mines; and\n       Whereas, Pennsylvania is the fourth largest coal producing \n     state in the nation, and coal operators contribute \n     significantly to the fund by paying a special fee for each \n     ton of coal they mine; and\n       Whereas, the Department of Environmental Protection and 39 \n     county conservation districts through the Western and Eastern \n     Pennsylvania Coalitions for Abandoned Mine Reclamation have \n     worked as partners to improve the effectiveness of mine \n     reclamation programs; and\n       Whereas, Pennsylvania has been working with the Interstate \n     Mining Compact Commission, the National Association of \n     Abandoned Mine Land Programs and other states to free more of \n     these funds to clean up abandoned mine lands; and\n       Whereas, making more funds available to states for \n     abandoned mine reclamation should preserve the interest \n     revenues now being made available for the United Mine Workers \n     Combined Benefit Fund; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Office of Surface Mining, the United \n     States Environmental Protection Agency and Congress have not \n     agreed to make more funds available to states for abandoned \n     mine reclamation; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of Pennsylvania urge the \n     President of the United States and Congress make the $1 \n     billion of Federal moneys already earmarked for abandoned \n     mine land reclamation available to states to clean up and \n     make safe our abandoned mine lands; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, to the presiding officers \n     of each house of Congress and to each member of Congress.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       POM-183. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Michigan; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 14\n\n       Whereas, The maintenance of a high quality road network is \n     vital to the economic health of our state. As the home of the \n     city that put America on wheels, we in Michigan appreciate \n     this relationship instinctively. Roads of less than excellent \n     quality impede commerce, discourage job formation, and \n     diminish our quality of life. Road maintenance is \n     simultaneously one of the least glamorous of tasks and one of \n     the most important responsibilities that the state carries \n     out; and\n       Whereas, We in Michigan levy a tax on the purchase of \n     gasoline in order to repair and improve our system of roads \n     and highways. As a tax on those who use the highways, it is \n     one of our fairest means of raising revenue. Just as the \n     states levy a tax on gasoline purchases, so too does the \n     federal government. One consequence of the federal \n     government's taxation of gasoline is the effective limit it \n     places on states that need additional revenue for road \n     repair. As maintenance costs rise and as cars become more \n     fuel efficient, the ability of gasoline tax revenue to fund \n     road work is diminished. In addition, increases in federal \n     gasoline taxes effectively block states from raising state \n     taxes on fuel due to the need to avoid too steep of an \n     increase that might stifle economic growth; and\n       Whereas, If the federal government used its revenue from \n     the federal gasoline tax to help states maintain their roads, \n     this dual taxation might not be harmful in practice because \n     the tax money would still repair our roads regardless of who \n     collected the funds. Unfortunately, the 1993 federal gasoline \n     tax increase of 4.3 cents per gallon has been devoted to \n     deficit reduction. While deficit reduction is a valid and \n     admirable goal, utilizing revenue from a source which should \n     be ear-marked for road maintenance effectively deprives the \n     states of an adequate means to repair and expand their roads; \n     now, therefore be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring) That we memorialize the United States Congress to \n     return to the states the revenue collected under the gasoline \n     tax increase of 1993; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       POM-184. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan; to the Committee on \n     Appropriations.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 25\n\n       Whereas, the men and women who served our country in the \n     Persian Gulf War suffered significant economic losses when \n     they were mobilized into active duty from reserve status. \n     Many of these individuals, especially the self-employed, \n     faced great personal difficulties upon their return to \n     civilian life. Some lost businesses, which caused others to \n     lose jobs and wages as well; and\n       Whereas, in recognition of the economic hardship to \n     reservists called to active duty, the Congress included in \n     the 1996 Defense Authorization Act provisions for the Ready \n     Reserve Mobilization Income Insurance Program (RRMIIP). This \n     initiative allows members of the ready reserve not already on \n     active duty the option of buying insurance to provide \n     coverage for income lost when and if they are called to leave \n     their jobs to serve the country; and\n       Whereas, since its establishment, the RRMIIP has been a \n     frustrating experience.\n\n[[Page S7423]]\n\n     The reservists have been faced with confusion in signing up \n     for the coverage. For those administering the program, \n     administrative requirements have created a nightmare of \n     paperwork, especially those mandating verification that those \n     declining the program were indeed offered the opportunity to \n     participate; and\n       Whereas, a glaring example of the problems with the RRMIIP \n     is the question of when a person can sign up and if coverage \n     can be changed. A sixty-day window for enrollment was opened \n     October 1, 1996. Due to administrative complications, another \n     window for enrollment was opened later. However, reservists \n     from the initial sign-up period were not allowed to enhance \n     their coverage, and\n       Whereas, it is unfair to prevent those who signed up for \n     coverage during the initial enrollment period the option of \n     increasing coverage when this opportunity is presented to \n     others. This is certainly not the practice when enrollments \n     for insurance are opened for employees in other governmental \n     agencies or institutions. This worthwhile program needs to be \n     improved to better serve our reservists and their families. \n     Failure to provide these needed improvements is an affront to \n     those who have put themselves in peril for our nation, as \n     well as to everyone who values the sacrifices our military \n     reservists make on behalf of every American; now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Congress of the United States \n     appropriate sufficient funds to ensure that the obligation to \n     current enrollees is satisfied; and be it further\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to make changes \n     in the Ready Reserve Mobilization Income Insurance Program; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/14/senate-section/article/S7421-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. McCAIN, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation, with an amendment in the nature of a \n     substitute:\n       S. 39.

A bill to provide for the exchange of lands within Admiralty \nIsland National Monument, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                   hood bay land exchange act of 1997\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nauthorize and direct a land exchange which will greatly benefit the \ncommunity of Sitka, AK. This bill will: ensure that an important water \nsystem now currently under an easement will be conveyed to the city of \nSitka in order to provide its residents with an assured water supply \ninto the future; provide for a spectacular inholding encompassing \napproximately 50 acres on Admiralty Island to be added to the Admiralty \nIsland National Monument; extinguish a reversionary interest on land \nowned at Sitka by the Alaska Pulp Corp. In return for the \nextinguishment of the reversionary interest, the corporation will \nconvey the 50-acre inholding on Admiralty Island to the Forest Service \nto be included in the monument, as well as the water system lands to \nthe city of Sitka.\n  Mr. President, Admiralty Island is an area with outstanding \nconservation values. The land exchange authorized in the bill I am \nsponsoring will ensure that this private inholding is included in the \nmonument and in the wilderness area as appropriate.\n  This exchange is supported by the city and borough of Sitka, and the \ncity administrator has requested me to sponsor this legislation and \nexpedite the exchange.\n  This exchange is truly in the best interests of all involved. The \nU.S. Government even comes out ahead on value. Recent appraisals for \nthe various lands and interests exchanged show that the Admiralty \nIsland land is valued at more than the reversionary interest which will \nbe exchanged. As a condition of my legislation, the corporation is \nrequired to waive its right to any compensation for this difference in \nvalue.\n  In summary, as a result of this exchange the Admiralty Island \nMonument land ownership pattern will be consolidated, the city of Sitka \nwill receive valuable lands in fee ownership on which parts of its \nwater system are located, and the corporation will be free of a \nproblematic reversionary interest in its property. As a bonus, the \nFederal Government realizes a net benefit in the value of the exchange. \nThis is a sound deal in the best interests of all parties.\n  It is my hope that this legislation can pass this body and the \nCongress in the near future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 1016. A bill to authorize appropriations for the Coastal Heritage \nTrail Route in New Jersey, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n legislation to reauthorize the new jersey coastal heritage trail route\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nreauthorizing the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail Route. The New \nJersey Coastal Heritage Trail is the crown jewel of the Jersey Shore \nand my bill will provide the necessary funding to complete the trail \nand preserve it for future generations of New Jersey residents and \nvisitors.\n  The Coastal Heritage Trail Route was first authorized in 1988 through \nPublic Law 100-515, legislation authored by former Senator Bill \nBradley. I was proud to cosponsor. The legislation allowed the \nSecretary of the Interior to design a vehicular route that would enable \nthe public to appreciate, enjoy, and work to protect, the nationally \nsignificant natural and cultural sites along the New Jersey coastline \nand the Delaware Bay. When completed, the trail system will include \nfive self-discovery theme trails which travel along the coast of New \nJersey. The 275 miles of the trail which will travel through eight \ncounties, will begin north in Perth Amboy, continue down the Atlantic \nCoast to Cape May in the south, and head northwest along the Delaware \nBay shoreline to Deepwater. The trail will be accessible from the \nGarden State Parkway and Route 49, and well-marked routes will lead \nfrom the corridors to regional welcome centers which will include \ninterpretative information.\n  The National Park Service, through a partnership with the State of \nNew Jersey, the Pinelands Commission, and local communities, recorded \nnearly 400 sites and developed alternative concepts for trail \nprotection and interpretation. These activities were documented in the \n``Resource Inventory and Study of Alternatives'', released in November \n1990. In April 1991, after public review and comment of this document, \nthe Park Service established an overall trail concept.\n\n[[Page S7424]]\n\n  The Maritime History Trail, which opened in 1993, celebrates and \nexplores the coastal trade, defense of the Nation, and the fishing and \nship building industries. Visitors to this trail can stop, for example, \nat the Belford Seafood Co-op, a cooperative commercial fishing \noperation located on the shores of Sandy Hook Bay. The community of \nBelford is over 200 years old and is reported to be the oldest fishing \nport on the east coast, with many third- and fourth-generation fishers.\n  The Coastal Habitats Trail, which opens this year, explores barrier \nislands, wetlands, estuaries, and other habitats from sandy beaches to \nmaritime forests that provide homes to many plants and animals. Also \nopening this year is the Wildlife Migrations Trail, which explores \nplaces along the Atlantic Flyway, a critical nesting and feeding area \nfor many species of birds. It also celebrates the habitat of the \nhorseshoe crab along the Delaware Bay.\n  The Historic Settlements Trail explores historic communities whose \neconomies were based on local natural resources such as the bog iron \ncommunity at Allaire State Park, the cranberry and timber industry \nlocated at Double Trouble State Park, and the glassmaking communities \nin Cumberland and Salem Counties.\n  The Relaxation and Inspiration Trail will explore how people used \ntheir leisure time, and includes the religious retreats of Ocean Grove \nand Cape May's historic district and boardwalks, and visits the artists \nwho were inspired by the Jersey shore.\n  Mr. President, the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail Route \nexemplifies how successful the National Park Service has been in \nforging partnerships with State and local governments, and private \nindividuals and organizations. Since its beginning in 1988, the Park \nService has received less than $1 million in Federal assistance. The \nauthorizing legislation appropriately called upon the Park Service to \nmatch 50 percent with non-federal funds. The Park Service has gone well \nbeyond that target, raising over $818,000 in non-federal funds. Yet in \nfiscal year 1998, the authorization ceiling of $1.25 million will have \nbeen reached. My bill would increase the authorization level for the \ntrail to $4 million, and extend the authorization to the year 2004, \nwhich would give the Park Service the additional time it needs to \ncomplete the trail. This is a small investment, I believe, to preserve \nthe richness of New Jersey's and the Nation's history.\n  The Coastal Heritage Trail Route has brought national recognition and \nstature to many of New Jersey's special places, and helps to contribute \nto New Jersey's second largest industry, tourism. I invite my \ncolleagues to join me in support of this legislation which will ensure \nthat many more of these gems of New Jersey and the Nation are \nunderstood, celebrated, and protected.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be included in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1016\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING MISSION CREEP IN BOSNIA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) NATO forces have begun various military operations in \n     Bosnia aimed at capturing other alleged war criminals, \n     including the capture of a Bosnia Serb police chief in \n     northwest Bosnia. In this altercation, at least one British \n     soldier was injured.\n       (2) On July 3, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns \n     stated that a Bosnian Serb television report that NATO \n     peacekeepers had been ordered to arrest Radovan Karadzic and \n     Ratko Mladic on sight was ``absolutely and unequivocally \n     false.''\n       (3) In support of that position, the Supreme Allied \n     Commander in Europe, General George Joulwan, reaffirmed on \n     Monday, July 7, that ``the principal responsibility for \n     [apprehending war criminals] lies with the (Bosnian) parties \n     themselves.''\n       (4) On March 18, 1997, General Joulwan testified before the \n     Senate Armed Service Committee that ``the military are not \n     policemen. And I think, again, the proper responsibility \n     rests on the parties. That is what Dayton says . . . [I]f we \n     are not careful we will go down this slippery slope where the \n     military will be put into hunting down war criminals. That is \n     not within my mandate.''\n       (5) On July 9, 1997, the prospective Supreme Allied \n     Commander in Europe, General Wesley Clark, during his \n     confirmation hearings before the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee, acknowledged his understanding of his \n     predecessor's mandate and affirmed his intention to execute \n     the policy in the same way as General Joulwan has.\n       (6) On November 17, 1996, the Secretary of Defense stated \n     in response to a specific question regarding the apprehension \n     of war criminals in Bosnia that ``the mission [in Bosnia] is \n     to provide a secure environment so that all of the other \n     civil functions can go on . . . It is not to perform \n     [apprehension] functions.''\n       (7) On December 18, 1996, the Secretary of Defense \n     reaffirmed that the apprehension of war criminals ``was not \n     an IFOR mission, [and] it will not be an SFOR mission . . . \n     [L]ocating and arresting the criminals is a mission for a \n     police force.''\n       (8) On March 3, 1997, the Secretary of Defense stated that \n     ``[t]he apprehension of war criminals is not a part of the \n     mission . . . It is a police function . . . it is not a \n     military-type mission.''\n       (9) An expansion of the U.S. mission in Somalia (that \n     expansion being an element of ``nation-building'') \n     specifically being the\n\n[[Page S7425]]\n\n     mandate to hunt down and arrest specific individual(s), \n     resulted in the deaths of 18 U.S. Special Forces in October \n     1993 and precipitated the subsequent withdrawal of all \n     American forces without the primary mission having been \n     accomplished.\n       (10) A change in U.S. and NATO policy regarding alleged war \n     criminals in Bosnia could expose U.S. and NATO troops to \n     direct combat action and ultimately jeopardize the \n     peacekeeping progress, to date, of U.S. and NATO forces in \n     Bosnia and could allow the situation to deteriorate to the \n     conditions that existed before the NATO IFOR/SFOR mission was \n     established.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     U.S. policy in Bosnia, as that relates to the use of our \n     forces as a part of the NATO force, should not be changed to \n     include a NATO military mission to hunt down and arrest \n     alleged war criminals and that there should be no change to \n     U.S. or NATO policy regarding alleged war criminals until the \n     Congress has had the opportunity to review any proposed \n     change in policy and authorize the expenditure of funds for \n     this mission.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       MIKULSKI AMENDMENT NO. 839\n\n  Mr. INOUYE (for Ms. Mikulski) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. \n1005, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 29, line 15, strike out ``$6,375,947,000'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``$6,390,847,000''.\n       On page 33, line 16, strike out ``$14,142,873,000'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``$14,127,873,000''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         DODD AMENDMENT NO. 840\n\n  Mr. INOUYE (for Mr. Dodd) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 1005, \nsupra; as follows:\n\n       On page 32, line 25, after ``1999'' insert the following: \n     ``: Provided, That, of the amount appropriated under this \n     heading, $4,500,000 is available for a joint Department of \n     Defense-Department of Veterans Affairs program of cooperative \n     clinical trials at multiple sites to assess the effectiveness \n     of protocols for treating Persian Gulf veterans who suffer \n     from ill-defined or undiagnosed conditions''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       KENNEDY AMENDMENT NO. 841\n\n  Mr. INOUYE (for Mr. Kennedy) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. \n1005, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 34, before the period on line 3, add the following: \n     ``: Provided, That of the funds appropriated under this \n     heading, $5,000,000 shall be available for a facial \n     recognition technology program''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 SNOWE (AND COLLINS) AMENDMENT NO. 842\n\n  Mr. STEVENS (for Ms. Snowe, for herself and Ms. Collins) proposed an \namendment to the bill, S. 1005, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 34, line 3, at the appropriate place insert the \n     following: ``: Provided, That, $2,000,000 shall be made \n     available only for a joint service core research project to \n     develop a prototype hybrid integrated sensor array for \n     chemical and biological point detection.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       SESSIONS AMENDMENT NO. 843\n\n  Mr. STEVENS (for Mr. Sessions) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. \n1005, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 34, before the period on line 3, add the following: \n     ``: Provided, That of the funds appropriated under this \n     heading, $6,000,000 shall be available for a conventional \n     munitions demilitarization demonstration program''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       GRASSLEY AMENDMENT NO. 844\n\n  Mr. STEVENS (for Mr. Grassley) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. \n1005, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end of title VIII, add the following:\n       Sec.   .

Specifically, the committee \nwill want to look at world energy supply and demand to 2015, what \npercentage of that will be filled by natural gas and how this could be \nimpacted by other large scale energy projects, such as nuclear, that \nare being developed in Asia. Second would be to explore the role of \nGovernment in large scale gas projects in foreign countries, what type \nof assistance the U.S. companies competing for overseas projects \nreceive from the U.S. Government and what can be done in the United \nStates to make American gas more competitive worldwide. Third would be \nto examine the emerging technologies in gas field development that are \nmaking natural gas more economical to market.\n  Those who wish to testify or to submit written testimony should write \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. Senate, \nWashington, DC 20510.

Mr. President, recently, the Senate considered \nhistoric changes to preserve Medicare for future generations. I think \nit is important to outline my views in detail on a few of the key votes \ncast regarding these issues.\n  I believe, as legislators, a chief concern must be protecting \nMedicare solvency for the long term. The Medicare Program is in a \ncrisis situation. As reported in the most recent Medicare trustees \nreport, the hospital insurance trust fund will be bankrupt by the year \n2001. Hence, immediate action must be taken to save this vital program.\n  The change contained in the bill would bring Medicare's eligibility \nage in line with the Social Security's eligibility age and would do it \nover a long period of time. Importantly, the increased eligibility age \ndoes not begin to phase in until 2003 and then increases slowly over 24 \nyears. In essence, this position will not be fully in place for 30 \nyears. This means that the full 2-year increase would only apply to \nindividuals currently 36 years old and younger.\n  This was, for me, a close question. However, as noted, this provision \nwill not begin to be phased in for 6 years. For that reason--to launch \na process that can lead to a positive, permanent solution--I voted in \nsupport, but with significant hesitations. If, in the next several \nyears, my concerns can be alleviated, I will continue to support the \nproposal. If not, I will withdraw my support well in advance of 2003. \nEspecially relevant will be the findings of the Medicare Reform \nCommission, created by this legislation, on how best to maintain the \nlong-term solvency of this program. Specifically, will the Commission \nsupport an increase in the Medicare eligibility age? If the report \nrejects this idea I would withdraw my support. In addition, well before \nany change in age, we need to fully address how the health care needs \nof low-income seniors between the ages of 65 to 67, will be met once \nthis provision is implemented. Failure to do so would also be grounds \nfor rejecting the proposal. And finally, we must develop ways by which \nmiddle-income seniors will be able to purchase and maintain their \ninsurance under such a provision. This may be through medical savings \naccounts or other means, but we must ensure that viable alternatives \nare available to all seniors. If, in the next 2 to 3 years, these \nconcerns are not addressed, or the Medicare Commission disagrees with \nour actions, I will withdraw my support for increasing the eligibility \nage.\n  Another long-term reform proposal debated concerns the bill's plan to \nmeans test Medicare part B premiums. Currently, seniors pay 25 percent \nof their part B premium while the Federal Government pays 75 percent of \ntheir premium. The bill would require seniors with incomes starting at \n$50,000--for a single senior--to pay a larger percent of this premium, \nwith seniors making $100,000 a year required to pay the entire portion \nof their premium--up to $2,160 a year. Senator Kennedy offered an \namendment to strike the means testing of premiums that was included in \nthe Medicare bill. I supported the effort to strike this provision.\n  Unlike the eligibility age issue, the means testing proposal would \nhave immediate effect. I was concerned that before such a fundamental \nchange took place, the issue should be reviewed and the consequences \nclosely examined. We have not had hearings on this issue and I believe \nthat hearings and closer review are necessary before a change of this \nmagnitude is made to the Medicare Program. Further, I do not believe\n\n[[Page S7427]]\n\nwe should consider a proposal such as means testing until we have other \nviable alternatives in place such as medical savings accounts, to give \nmiddle-income seniors a way to better afford their Medicare and health \nservices. In my judgment, to immediately implement the proposal in the \nbill would unfairly pull the rug out from under middle-income seniors \nwithout adequate notice or the provision of a legitimate option. This \nisn't fair.\n  To me, a $50,000 income isn't wealthy. Moreover, many seniors who \nwould have their premiums dramatically increased have carefully \nprepared and planned their retirements. Their incomes may already be \ncommitted to maintaining the mortgage and upkeep of a home, support of \nrelatives, or saving for special nursing home care and so on.

This fine public school was recently selected as a 1997 National \nBlue Ribbon School of Excellence by the U.S. Department of Education. \nIt was 1 of 7 elementary schools in my State to receive this \nprestigious award, and 1 of 38 West Virginia schools that have been \nrecognized since the National Blue Ribbon School Program began in 1982.\n  Schools are judged on curriculum, leadership, teaching environment, \nstudent performance on standardized tests, parent and community \nsupport, graduation rates and post graduation pursuits. Harrisville \nElementary's goal is ``to educate all students to their maximum \nabilities.'' Although 65 percent of the students are from low \nsocioeconomic backgrounds, a high level of achievement is expected of \nall students. Along with Principal Marion Roby; teachers, support \nstaff, parents, and community members work together to provide students \nwith quality learning experiences. This dedication to student success \nand academic excellence is evident in the remarkable growth the \nstudents have achieved. Student total battery scores on the CTBS/4 test \nhave increased from the 47th percentile to the 88th percentile.\n  Located in the north-central part of the State, Harrisville \nElementary School was the first school in Ritchie County to have a \nnetworked computer lab where all students have daily scheduled class. \nThe students also participate in STARS (Special Time with At-Risk \nStudents) and take part in GATORS (Guiding Attitudes Toward Outstanding \nResponsible Students). These two staff designed programs promote life-\nlong decisionmaking skills and build self esteem. The school piloted a \ncomprehensive health program, Know Your Body, which was later adopted \nby the rest of the country. The school's staff is one of the best in \nthe State with four Ritchie County Teachers of the Year, including the \n1996 honoree.\n  As a National Blue Ribbon School, Harrisville Elementary School is a \nrole model for other schools across the country on how teachers, \nadministrators, parents and students can work togther to create an \neducational environment that helps children excel. Everyone in the \nHarrisville community should be proud of the notoriety that their local \ninstitution has achieved. It is my pleasure to publicly congratulate \nthis school for its commitment to academic success. I know that this \nschool will continue its good work and represent West Virginia proudly \non a national level.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/14/senate-section/article/S7427-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY SUMMER AGRICULTURAL INSTITUTE\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, it is with considerable \npride I share with you today an educational program that is bringing \nhope and insight to students in Oregon. It is characterized by \nvoluntarism, authentic educational programs, and community involvement. \nThe program itself, and its individual parts, serves as a model for \neducational reforms throughout our Nation.\n  The Oregon State University Summer Agricultural Institute, which is \ncurrently in its 8th year, consists of teachers taking a week long \ncourse designed to enhance their understanding of agriculture in \nOregon. After a day of initial study at the university, teachers are \nimmersed in authentic, hands-on learning. They visit actual working \nfarms and ranches, processing plants, forestry sites, and dairy farms. \nAdditionally, each teacher spends 1 night with a family that owns and \noperates a farm or ranch. Teachers in the program also experience a day \nof role reversal as they become the students of boys and girls involved \nin Future Farmers of America. The teachers learn how relevant and \nmeaningful learning takes place in the lives of these young people as \nthey farm and raise animals.\n  Teachers must pay a small fee for the class but the overwhelming \nmajority of costs are met through donations. These gifts of money, \ntime, and resources by agricultural communities in Oregon provide the \nfinancial backbone of the program.\n  The institute ends with a dinner where teachers are given the \nopportunity to share their reflections on the week. During this evening \nit is common for teachers to share an increased sense of appreciation \nfor agriculture. The advanced level of education possessed by farmers \nand ranchers, their commitment to responsible stewardship of the land, \nand their incredible work ethic leave the teachers not only impressed \nbut touched. One teacher tearfully remarked, ``Oregon's land is in good \nhands. Thank you.''\n  Teachers leave the week with the necessary knowledge and motivation \nto develop meaningful curricula related to agriculture in Oregon. \nLafona Jensen, the chairwoman of the program, Karen Stephenson, the \ncoordinator of the program, and Dr. Lee Cole, the instructor of record, \nare individuals making a genuine difference in the lives of young \npeople in Oregon.\n  I strongly encourage States with similar agricultural interests as \nOregon to look closely at this program. The Oregon State University \nSummer Agricultural Institute is a model for communities desiring to \ndesign educational programs that promote authentic learning and an \nappreciation for the important role agriculture plays in our \nsociety.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/14/senate-section/article/S7427-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7427-S7428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL CHARACTER COUNTS WEEK\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.
