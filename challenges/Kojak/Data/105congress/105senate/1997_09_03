Today the Senate will resume consideration of the Harkin \namendment No. 1057 to the Agriculture appropriations bill. Under the \nprevious order, there will be 20 minutes for debate on the amendment \nequally divided between Senator Cochran and Senator Harkin. Following \nthe use or yielding back of time, a vote will occur on or in relation \nto the Harkin amendment at approximately 9:50 a.m.\n  Following the disposition of the Harkin amendment and passage of the \nAgriculture appropriations bill, the Senate will resume consideration \nof S. 1061, the Labor-HHS appropriations bill.\n  I remind Senators that this issue, of course, was considered in July. \nThe Harkin amendment was defeated at that time, I believe, by a vote of \n52 to 48. I urge my colleagues to again vote against the Harkin \namendment and to, of course, support passage of the Agriculture \nappropriations bill. I believe Senator Cochran in July outlined clearly \nwhat is involved in this issue, and I think obviously he has stated the \nposition that we should support which is to defeat this Harkin \namendment.\n  Members can expect a number of amendments to be offered today and \nvotes will occur throughout the day on Labor-HHS. We hope to be able to \ncomplete action in short order on the bill. We may not be able to do it \ntonight, but we will stay with the Labor-HHS appropriations bill until \nit is completed, either today or, if necessary, tomorrow. We will \nnotify Members when votes can be expected.\n  In addition, the Senate will recess at 12:30 until 2:15 for the \nweekly policy luncheons to meet. As announced earlier, Members can \nexpect votes each day this week, including the very real possibility of \nat least one vote, maybe more, on Friday of this week.\n  As the Senate continues the session through September and October, we \nwill notify Members, after consultation with the Democratic leadership, \nwhen we will definitely have votes on Mondays or Fridays or if there \nwill not be any votes on a particular Monday or Friday. But if we are \ngoing to be able to complete our work by a reasonable time this fall \nand then go back to our constituencies in our respective States, we are \ngoing to have to work on some Mondays and Fridays.\n  I yield the floor, Madam President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/03/senate-section/article/S8677-4", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison).

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of H.R. 2160, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2160) making appropriations for Agriculture, \n     Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \n     Agencies Programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     1998, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Harkin amendment No. 1057, to provide funding for \n     activities of the Food and Drug Administration relating to \n     the prevention of tobacco use by youth.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Harkin amendment No. 1057 is pending on \nwhich there shall be 20 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. First, I ask unanimous consent that Ms. Lori Turpin, a \ndetailee in the office of Senator\n\n[[Page S8678]]\n\nInouye, be granted floor privileges during deliberations on S. 1061.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I yield myself 3 minutes, after which \ntime I will then yield to Senator Chafee, the majority cosponsor of \nthis amendment.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that Senator Bingaman be added as a \ncosponsor of the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Before I return to the substance of our amendment, I want \nto address a couple of points raised yesterday.\n  The distinguished chairman of the agriculture appropriations \nsubcommittee suggested that my amendment should not be adopted because \nit skirts the rules. Well, the rules governing this body clearly permit \nthis Senator or any other Senator to offer an amendment to the House \nAgriculture appropriations bill once it comes over to us.\n  There was a quotation in AP today of Senator Cochran saying, ``This \nis an unfortunate effort to go around the rules and procedures.''\n  How, I ask, can this Senator, be going around the rules when I am in \nfull compliance with the rules of the Senate? Our amendment is fully \nwithin the Senate rules. There is no point of order that lies against \noffering it. And I will point out that offering this amendment at this \ntime is in full compliance with the unanimous-consent agreement worked \nout with the majority leader during the Senate's consideration of its \nAgriculture appropriations bill.\n  The distinguished chairman, Senator Cochran, was involved in those \ndiscussions also. I did not wait until after the Senate passed its \nversion of the bill and then spring this amendment on the Senate. \nBefore the Senate passed its bill, there was a unanimous consent \nagreement worked out which plainly provided an opportunity for me to \noffer an amendment at this point, an amendment that is clearly \npermitted under the rules. That was all worked out under the rules \nopenly and aboveboard before the Senate passed its Agriculture \nappropriations bill.\n  If, I submit, the argument of the distinguished chairman, Senator \nCochran, prevails and our amendment is defeated on the basis of his \nprocedural argument that this Senator should not be able to rely upon \nthe Senate rules, every Senator should be concerned about the precedent \nthat outcome would set regarding his or her ability to rely upon the \nSenate rules. Senators who are inclined to vote with Senator Cochran \nshould think again and ask themselves what options under the Senate \nrules they may be closing off that they may one day critically need. I \nam not just talking about the rule I am relying on here. I am talking \nabout a whole host of other rules protecting the rights of Senators \nthat could be swept away in the name of expediency, rules that could be \neviscerated as mere trifling inconveniences.\n  This procedural argument made by the distinguished chairman is both \ndangerous and bogus. Let's get to the real issue here. The issue is \nwhether or not kids under the age of 18 should be able to buy tobacco \nand whether we ought to fund efforts to stop such sales. That is what \nthis vote is about. It is about our kids and protecting them from the \nravages of tobacco. With the death toll of over 400,000 a year, smoking \nis killing more Americans than AIDS, alcohol, motor vehicles, fires, \nhomicide, illicit drugs, and suicide combined. And I might add, with \nthe addition of the Byrd language, States will be encouraged to crack \ndown on the illegal sales of alcohol along with the illegal sales of \ntobacco. Teenage smoking rates are climbing--a 17-year high among high \nschool seniors.\n  Why do we need these FDA rules? Because without the ID checks and a \nstrong rule against underage sales, kids will continue to fall prey to \ntobacco.\n  This picture says more than a thousand words about why the FDA rules \nare needed. Here is Melissa on the left, Amy on the right. ``Can you \ntell which one is 16? If they walked into a store, would the clerk know \nwhich one was under 18? To eliminate the guesswork, FDA requires \nretailers to card anyone who is under 27.''\n  You could not tell which one of them is under the age of 18. It just \nso happens the young woman over here, Melissa, is 16 and Amy, over \nhere, is 25. That is why this rule is needed. That is why the court in \nGreensboro, NC, upheld this rule.\n  Our amendment seeks $34 million in funding, minuscule in comparison \nto the $50 billion in smoking-related medical costs in our Nation each \nyear.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent at this point to have \nprinted in the Record the editorial appearing this morning in the \nWashington Post regarding the upcoming vote.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 3, 1997]\n\n                      A Smoking Vote in the Senate\n\n       The Senate is scheduled to vote today on an amendment by \n     Tom Harkin of Iowa to give the administration the entire, \n     modest amount it seeks to enforce new rules meant to prevent \n     the sale of cigarettes to minors. The amendment deserves to \n     pass. This is a clear test of the instincts of the Senate on \n     this issue, which over the years has inspired so many \n     grandiloquent speeches and so little action.\n       The request is for $34 million instead of the $4.9 million \n     voted by the Senate Appropriations Committee and $24 million \n     by the House. Most of the money would fund enforcement action \n     by the states; no heavy federal hand there. The rest would be \n     used by the Food and Drug Administration for an educational \n     campaign aimed mainly at cigarette retailers.\n       The amendment nonetheless was beaten 52 to 48 in July, in \n     part because the money was to come from an increased \n     assessment on tobacco companies. Now it will come from \n     another source--an offsetting cut in a minor Agriculture \n     Department program. The question is whether those, including \n     a number of leading Democrats, who voted no on the earlier \n     grounds, will now vote aye. They should.\n       The rest of the session is likely to include a lot of \n     fights like this, mostly over second- and third-tier issues \n     and small amounts. The same Senate agriculture appropriations \n     bill, for example, contains some $50 million more than the \n     administration sought to pay commissions and otherwise \n     subsidize crop insurance; the House bill contains $30 million \n     more. Critics tried to use some of this money for programs to \n     feed the poor instead. No way, but the issue may still be \n     live in conference.\n       There are likely to be similar struggles when the Senate \n     takes up the Interior appropriations bill, possibly next \n     week. Subcommittee Chairman Slade Gorton included in the bill \n     two provisions that would make major changes in Indian law \n     harmful to the interests of the tribes. They ought to be \n     excised. An effort will be made to limit further logging in \n     the national forests by cutting construction funds for the \n     roads on which such logging depends. That one failed in the \n     House by only two votes when the administration wobbled in \n     support. It ought to pass.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I am delighted to be here today to \nsupport Senator Harkin's important amendment in the fight against \nteenage smoking.\n  The attorney general of my home State of Rhode Island has urged \nCongress to provide the full funding level of $34 million requested by \nthe Food and Drug Administration. Our attorney general believes \nadequate funding is critical to our success in reducing the level of \nsmoking among children and adolescents, and I agree with him.\n  Furthermore, with the evidence that we now have regarding the \nepidemic of teen smoking as outlined by the distinguished Senator from \nIowa, and all the implications this has for the future, it seems to me \nthere is no excuse for delaying full implementation of this critical \nprogram.\n  As has been pointed out, smoking among high school seniors is at a \n17-year high. That is very discouraging. Smoking among 8th and 10th \ngraders has increased by more than 50 percent in the last 6 years. \nState and local officials need this money for enforcement purposes. And \nthe money is also needed to educate retailers about their \nresponsibilities.\n  In my home State, even though we have a law prohibiting retailers \nfrom selling tobacco products to minors, over 70 percent of high school \nsmokers were not asked to show proof of their age when purchasing \ncigarettes.\n  According to our attorney general, Rhode Island stores each year are \nselling--I was stunned by this figure. We are a small State, a million \npeople--11\n\n[[Page S8679]]\n\nmillion dollars' worth of cigarettes to underage consumers, and the \nmain reason, of course, is the lack of resources at the local level to \nenforce the law. We have been able to provide the funds for education. \nWe have to be able, in my judgment, to provide funds for education and \nenforcement of this rule to make it meaningful.\n  Now, there is a little less than $5 million provided thus far by the \nSenate. That is nice, but it just plain is not enough. With the \nimprovement of the sunset provisions in the new offset, I believe there \nis no good reason not to vote for this amendment. Preventing underage \nsmoking should be a national priority and providing full funding of \nthis program is an important step toward achieving that goal. So I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in this effort to eradicate teenage smoking.\n  I thank the Chair and I thank the distinguished Senator from Iowa for \nhis leadership.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for his comments. I thank him for his \nstrong support in the effort to eliminate teenage smoking.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes forty-five seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will yield 1 minute 45 seconds to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague, the Senator from Iowa.\n  I rise in strong support of this amendment. Think about this for a \nmoment. Have you ever met a parent who said, ``I had the greatest news \nlast night; I went home and my daughter came home and announced she had \nstarted smoking.''\n  I have never heard that. I never heard a single parent say how proud \nthey were to learn their children started smoking and yet statistics \nshow us across America the fastest growing group of new smokers is \nchildren, and particularly young women, who decide in high school or \nsometimes earlier to start buying this product illegally to start \nsmoking, to develop a nicotine addiction which can haunt them for a \nlifetime, leading to disease and sometimes to death.\n  What Senator Harkin is doing is just eminently sensible. If there is \nsuch a thing as a family value, this is a family value amendment \nbecause what Senator Harkin is doing with this amendment is to make \nsure that the Food and Drug Administration has the resources to enforce \nexisting law. It is not a new imposition of law from the Federal \nGovernment. It is just common sense. Keep this dangerous addictive \nproduct out of the hands of children. And the people who want to sell \nit to kids illegally have to be stopped.\n  If we are going to do that, it takes more than a speech on the Senate \nfloor. It takes a commitment of resources. I am sorry that Senator \nHarkin's effort lost last time by a handful of votes. There were a lot \nof speeches given and a lot of reasons given. I hope my colleagues have \nhad a chance to go home during this break and talk to a number of \nfamilies, as I have. They should realize, as I do, how critically \nimportant it is to pass the Harkin amendment and give the FDA the \nresources to make sure that our kids are not lured into this dangerous \naddiction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, what is the situation with time? Has \nall the time been used by the proponent of the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 1 minute 35 seconds \nand the Senator from Mississippi controls 9 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Madam President, one comment at the outset has to be made in response \nto the Senator's statement quoting from an Associated Press article \nwhich suggests I said yesterday that the effort to bring this amendment \nto the Senate on a second vote violates the rules of the Senate. I said \nno such thing yesterday. I have just completed reading my remarks as \nreflected in the Congressional Record of yesterday's proceedings of the \nSenate, and that is not contained in my remarks.\n  What I did say was this, and I will read it again for emphasis. ``So \nwhat I am suggesting, Mr. President, as respectfully as I can, is that \nthis is an unfortunate effort to go around the practices and the \nprocedures that have been established for this purpose to facilitate \nthe orderly consideration of appropriations bills, and the Senate ought \nto reject this effort.''\n  Now, let me elaborate on that. The procedure being used by the \nproponent of this amendment creates an unfortunate precedent. If it is \nrewarded by a majority of the votes on his amendment, that precedent \nwill permit a vote on an amendment to a bill after third reading, and, \nafter a unanimous-consent agreement has ripened, as an order limiting \namendments on a bill. Using the tactic employed by the distinguished \nSenator and my friend from Iowa should not be rewarded by the Senate \nand such a precedent should not be established.\n\n  The reason I am making that point as strongly as I can, and repeating \nwhat was said yesterday in the 10 minutes we had to discuss this issue, \nis that we had worked out a procedure for considering appropriations \nbills here in the Senate in advance of their being considered by the \nHouse. We had markups, in subcommittees and the full committee, of \nappropriations bills that had not yet passed the House. That is a \ndeparture from procedures that had been used as a matter of custom and \npractice in the past. The reason was to accelerate and expedite \nconsideration of these bills so that we would not get into a situation \nof winding up at the end of the fiscal year, or right on the brink of \nthe beginning of a new fiscal year, not having passed all \nappropriations bills because of the slowness of that earlier procedure.\n  This was working fine. But one little nuance to permit that to work \nis that when the House-passed bill is received in the Senate, we have \nto get unanimous consent to hold it at the desk, and then call it up, \nsubstitute the Senate action on the appropriations bill for the \nlanguage of the House-passed bill, and have it passed as amended by the \nSenate action. We have already had third reading of the Senate bill; we \nhave already adopted all the amendments; we have had orders limiting \nthose amendments; and then the Senator decides to use this opportunity. \nUnder the Senate rules, he is right. Under the Senate rules, any \nSenator can object to a unanimous-consent request, and that is what he \ndid. The difference is that it was understood that when we completed \naction on the Senate bill, we would then take up the House-passed bill, \nsubstitute the Senate action on it, adopt it, and go to conference. So \nit was at that little point in the procedure that the Senator decided \nto use a new tactic, and that is why we are having to vote another \ntime, a second time, on an amendment that was disposed of during the \nconsideration of the agriculture appropriations bill.\n  We passed the bill on July 24. Here we are in September having to \nvote on an amendment virtually the same with a different offset. The \noffset is described as defective and flawed in a statement made by \nSenator Domenici that is in the Record of yesterday. I invite the \nattention of Senators on that subject. What it does, in effect, is \ninstead of spending money in this next fiscal year, we will postpone it \nto the following fiscal year, and that is scored by CBO as an offset. \nAre you kidding? There is a statutory maximum to spend, a mandate for \ncomputer operations to be funded at the Department of Agriculture. So \nthe offset, while the CBO scores it--and we continue to live under this \nvery interesting obligation to honor, cherish, and obey the decisions \nof CBO on these issues, the wisdom of the Senate or the will of the \nSenate notwithstanding--we are bound to respect the CBO decision on \nwhether or not this is an effective offset of the new spending.\n  The arguments about whether you are for or against smoking--really, \nwe are all for doing everything possible to persuade young people, \nminors, not to smoke. That is not the issue here. This program by FDA \nprovides some funds to States to help enforce State rules and laws and \nFederal regulations on sales of tobacco to minors. Only a few States \nare even getting this money. I mean, the whole point of this argument\n\n[[Page S8680]]\n\nsuggests that the substance of the amendment deals with that issue in \nsome important or dramatic way. It does not.\n  The point is, this money, this account, will be negotiated in \nconference. All Senators understand that. The House has a higher number \nthan the Senate has. We have higher numbers for other things like \nagricultural research and some other important initiatives protecting \nfarmers, trying to do something about production agriculture and the \nefficiency and the yields that our farmers can achieve on their crops \nto remain globally competitive. This is a big bill. It has WIC money, \nwhich is very important. A lot of nutrition programs are funded in this \nbill at higher levels than the House recommends.\n  So, what I am saying is that we don't agree with the House on every \npart of the bill. That is why we are going to conference. But to permit \nthis procedure to prevail and have us vote on the same amendment we \nhave already disposed of, I think should be rejected. We are not going \nto be able to continue the procedures we followed if we reward this \nstrategy, this tactic, this use or abuse of the procedures that we have \nbeen following.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I rise today in strong support of \nthis amendment to restore funding to the Food and Drug Administration \nso it can enforce its rule in the war on teen smoking. At stake are the \nlives of millions of our children.\n  This rule prohibits--nationwide--the sale of tobacco products to \nanyone under the age of 18. It also requires retailers to check the ID \nof any purchaser of tobacco who appears to be under the age of 27.\n  Isn't this just common sense as matters of both public policy and \npublic health? Apparently not.\n  Madam President, if I wasn't seeing this with my own eyes, I would \nnot believe anyone doubted the need to fund FDA enforcement of this \nrule. The rule against teen smoking is overwhelmingly supported by the \nAmerican people. It was validated by a North Carolina judge. Yet, here \nwe are on the floor of the U.S. Senate, trying again to save this rule \nfrom obliteration.\n  Madam President, the tobacco lobbyists have spread a great deal of \nmoney and misinformation about the need for this initiative. I would \nlike to clear the air.\n  The tobacco lobby has been telling Senators that we should wait until \nwe pass settlement legislation before we fund the FDA's teen smoking \nenforcement efforts. That is nonsense. The ultimate disposition of the \nproposed settlement--which is far from being in place--has nothing to \ndo with this fight against teen smoking. Nothing. The settlement \nnegotiations, assumed that these rules would be in place and fully \nfunded.\n  Once you eliminate this nonsense, it comes down to a basic question. \nShould we simply sit back and watch 3,000 kids a day pick up an \naddiction that will kill or cripple many of them? Or should we fund \nthis program and start saving lives? The money we approve today is a \nbargain compared to what we'll be forced to spend in later years on \ntreating smoking-related illness.\n  Everyone, including the tobacco companies, says they are against teen \nsmoking. Our Nation's parents, the medical community, and public \nopinion support the President's fight against teen smoking.\n  And make no mistake about it. If you vote against this funding, you \ngut the President's plan and take a stand for tobacco and against \nAmerica's kids. I therefore urge you to support this amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I will vote against tabling the Harkin \namendment. It is a good amendment with the worthwhile goal of \nprotecting the health and lives of young Americans.\n  Both the tobacco and alcohol industries have received well-deserved \ncriticism in recent years for a variety of questionable or unsavory \npractices, including what many of their critics have identified as the \nuse of advertising campaigns specifically intended to entice young \npeople to try, and then become hooked on, their products. In response, \nthe tobacco industry has been attacked at both the State and Federal \nlevels, but, unfortunately, much less attention has been directed \ntoward the alcohol industry.\n  Certainly, tragedies like the recent alcohol-related death of a \nLouisiana State University student demonstrate that a national effort \nto save our young people from the destructive forces of alcohol is \nwarranted.\n  This amendment to the Agriculture appropriations bill will boost the \nability of the States to enforce age and identification requirements \nfor the purchase of cigarettes, but, importantly, at my request, the \namendment also addresses the need to shore up the enforcement of checks \nfor the purchase by minors of alcohol.\n  The amendment encourages States to couple their youth-smoking \nprevention efforts with State laws that prohibit underage drinking. \nThese issues go hand in hand in preventing our youth from using \ndestructive substances.\n  According to statistics from the Federal Centers for Disease \nControl's National Center for Health Statistics, the three leading \ncauses of death for 15- to 24-year-olds--accidents, homicides, and \nsuicides--often involve the use of alcohol. Efforts to curb the sale of \nalcohol to minors, therefore, can be expected to yield high payoffs to \nour society.\n  Under the original amendment, Federal funding was to be used to \nincrease supervision of retailers to ensure that they examine the \nidentifications of customers purchasing tobacco products. But language \nI added calls for coordinating the oversight of identification checks \nfor alcohol sales along with those tobacco-related programs. It only \nmakes sense that store clerks who are already checking ID's for \ncigarettes also be checking ID's for alcohol. The exercise is called \n``carding,'' checking identification cards to verify that the buyer is \nnot under the legal age. It is such an easy step that can help prevent \na teenager from getting drunk and getting behind the wheel of a car--\n``carding'' for age. Perhaps it would be more aptly described as \n``carding for life.'' I hope that this amendment may indeed result in \nsaving lives.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I am in wholehearted agreement with the \nintent of the amendment before us, and I commend my colleague from Iowa \nfor his sincere attempt to address the crucial issue of youth smoking. \nHowever, I remain unconvinced that FDA control and management of a \nyouth antismoking initiative will solve the problem. Let me be very \nclear, I support a Federal role in restricting teen smoking and in \nfunding a youth antismoking initiative. However, a cursory review of \nour Nation's history shows that the States have the primary \njurisdiction over enforcement over youth smoking laws, just as they do \nwith laws relating to underage consumption of alcohol.\n  In the aftermath of the tobacco settlement negotiations, our Nation's \nattention is focused, as never before, on the problem of teen smoking. \nWe have an unprecedented bipartisan commitment to addressing this \nproblem at all levels of government. Currently, seven committees in the \nSenate alone are tackling the complex issues raised by the settlement. \nIn my opinion, we do the children of America is disservice by thinking \nwe absolve ourselves of responsibility by simply delegating this job to \nFederal bureaucrats. We have a golden opportunity to put these \nfinancial resources to work, and bring about long-overdue solutions. I \nam not a politician by trade or training, and I find that sometimes \nthat works to my advantage. I haven't been in Washington long enough to \nlose my appreciation for the truism that the best solutions are often \nfound at home.\n  Let's talk about some of the initiatives the Federal Government is \nalready funding to prevent youth smoking.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has an Office on \nSmoking and Health [OSH] which conducts scientific research, \ncommunicates health information to the public, and coordinates action \nwith other Federal agencies, State health departments, and other \norganizations. Their programs include the Smoke Free Kids & Soccer \ncampaign, which collaborates with the U.S. women's national soccer team \nto promote smoke-free lifestyles among teenage girls. The OSH budget is \n$21.4 million.\n  At the National Institutes of Health, the National Cancer Institute \nfunds the American Stop Smoking Intervention Study research program in \ncollaboration with the American Cancer Society\n\n[[Page S8681]]\n\nand State and local health departments and other organizations to \ndevelop comprehensive tobacco control programs in 17 States. NCI also \nadministers investigator initiated research projects in smoking \ncessation and education, funded at $94.9 million. The National \nInstitute of Drug Abuse funds research on smoking and nicotine \ndependency.\n  The Health Resources and Services Administration provides funding for \nantismoking education through its health professions education and \nnurse training programs. The Maternal and Child Health Block Grant \nfunds health services to mothers and children, including antismoking \neducation.\n  And let us not forget, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration provides discretionary funding for community-based \ndemonstration projects for the prevention and early intervention of \nalcohol and drug abuse, including tobacco use. Also, SAMHSA is already \nimplementing the Synar amendment, which requires States to enforce laws \nprohibiting the sale of tobacco products to individuals under age 18. \nStates must conduct random unannounced inspections of retail outlets, \nand develop a strategy for achieving an inspection failure rate of less \nthan 20 percent. States that don't comply with these requirements may \nlose their block grants funds, and I would like to point out that these \nfunds may not now be used for enforcement activities.\n  Now, Madam President, I've named a few Federal antismoking efforts, \nbut there are actually over 17, in different departments and agencies. \nThe settlement which has been negotiated between industry, plaintiffs, \nthe attorneys general, and the public health community has been \nreferred to no fewer than seven Senate committees. I think it's time \nfor a little common sense. The FDA, while they have done many wonderful \nthings, have too often demonstrated a tendency to rely on centralized, \nheavyhanded bureaucracy rather than practical solutions. Let's proceed \nwith hearings in the Senate, and let's examine the best possible \navenues for administration of these funds. Most of all, let us not lose \nsight of the goal of our public health efforts.\n  The issue is reducing teen consumption of cigarette smoke. At every \nlevel of government, local, State, and Federal, and in every part of \nour communities, we must commit to do this ourselves. We cannot simply \nlook the other way when a child with a cigarette walks by. Convenience \nstore owners cannot ignore the law, and profit from our children's poor \ndecisions, and legislators cannot allow campaign finances to cloud \ntheir judgment on this issue.\n  We know that one very effective tool is a consistently enforced \nrequirement that retail outlets care young people. This is primarily a \ntask for local law enforcement. Any Federal agency that Congress \nauthorizes to police retail outlets will in the final analysis turn to \nlocal agencies to conduct the compliance checks. As we seek to partner \nwith governments at home, we can and should build in Federal compliance \nstandard for States who refuse to cooperate. Together, we can put some \nteeth into the laxly enforced statutes already on the books.\n  Let me add that I think we should have some concern for what could \nhappen if we stray too far from the obvious connection between personal \nresponsibility and health. Personal responsibility is the key to good \nhealth. As a physician, I urged everyone of my patients and my \nconstituents to stop smoking if they had started, and more importantly \nnot to start. There is a clear link between smoking and many types of \ncancer and other diseases. As a heart and lung transplant surgeon, I \nhave seen firsthand the harmful effects of smoking. I have held tar-\nladen lungs in my hand and removed malfunctioning hearts from failing \nbodies. As the father of three sons, whom I relentlessly urge not to \nsmoke, I agree with columnist James Glassman that ``Kids shouldn't \nsmoke; parents, taxes, and laws should deter them.'' But before we \nentrust $29 million of taxpayers hard-earned money to the Food and Drug \nAdministration, let's make sure that this is the wisest use of our \nresources.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, how much time is remaining on both \nsides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa controls 1 minute 53 \nseconds, the Senator from Mississippi 2 minutes 47 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, Senator Cochran said that only a few \nStates are getting FDA funding right now. That is the point. Six States \nright now are receiving FDA enforcement money, and only 10 States are \nexpected to receive such money in fiscal 1997, because FDA does not \nhave the money for all States. What this amendment provides is enough \nmoney to expand the FDA initiative to all 50 States. I thank my friend \nfrom Mississippi for pointing that out. That is the essence of this \namendment; to expand to all interested States FDA funding for \nenforcement of rules providing for ID checks and prohibiting illegal \nsales to kids who come in to buy cigarettes and tobacco.\n  Madam President, we hear time and time again the tobacco companies \nsaying they want to stop kids from smoking. This amendment does that. \nYet has one tobacco company stepped forward to support this amendment? \nA deafening silence. Not one penny comes out of their pockets under \nthis amendment, and yet not one tobacco company has come forward to \nsay, yes, this amendment by Senators Harkin and Chafee is good because \nit will keep kids from smoking and buying tobacco. They say they want \nto help stop kids from smoking. Not one of them has come forward to \nsupport this amendment. Shame on them.\n  We debated the previous version of this amendment on July 23, and it \nwas tabled 52 to 48. Since that time another 125,000 young Americans \nhave gotten addicted to smoking, and every day that we delay, thousands \nmore kids like these young women here walk into stores, buy cigarettes \nand tobacco products, and get hooked. That's why the tobacco companies \nare not here supporting this amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I will yield to my friend from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend for fighting this battle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. One quick point is the tobacco companies have increased \ntheir contributions to colleagues so they will not support you, and I \nhope we overcome that this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Mississippi controls the remaining time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I have made the arguments that I \nintended to make. If Senators are interested in a little more detailed \ndiscussion of the procedures and why I think it would be such an \nunfortunate precedent for us to reward the strategy being used by the \nproponent of the amendment, I invite attention to yesterday's Record.\n  Let me just say one other thing about the effort to resolve this \nissue. We have plenty of room within the amount provided by the House \nin its version of this bill and the amount provided by the Senate in \nthe bill that passed the Senate 99 to 0 to negotiate an appropriate \nlevel of funding for the FDA's program. We are not suggesting that this \nprogram ought not be funded, that assistance ought not be made \navailable to States which need the assistance. But has it occurred to \nanybody that the States are bringing lawsuits and collecting from the \ntobacco companies money to do this very thing? Our State of Mississippi \nis the first to obtain a cash settlement with the tobacco industries, \nand it can use the money for a wide variety of purposes: to help defray \nexpenses, medical expenses, that have been paid out to those who have \nsuffered health problems because of smoking, antiteenage smoking \ncampaigns and efforts and initiatives--and that is what this program \nis. Here we are asking people around the country to use their tax \ndollars to go to States, whether they have brought law suits, whether \nthey have taken action--these are applicants for funds under a new FDA \nprogram that has just begun.\n  So, I am saying there is more to this than is being discussed. There \nis more to this than is being admitted. Florida has just now undertaken \nto consummate a settlement that is similar to the one in Mississippi, \nand there will be others. Where has been the Department\n\n[[Page S8682]]\n\nof Justice? Where is the Federal Department of Justice on these issues? \nWhere is the proposal of the administration on these issues? We are \nasked to spend more taxpayer dollars, but I am not sure it is for a \ncoherent, comprehensive way to deal with the overall issue. That is \nwhat I am suggesting. The States are doing a much better job and a much \nmore aggressive job getting after this than we are. And an amendment is \nbeing suggested here to solve all those problems. Well, that is just \nnot an accurate reflection of the facts, is it, Madam President?\n  So I urge, when we make a motion to table the amendment, once all \ntime has been used or yielded back, that the Senate vote for the motion \nto table to permit us to continue to consider appropriations bills in \nthis orderly fashion so that we can expedite their consideration and be \nfair to all Senators who offered amendments when the Senate considered \nthe bill. I thank the Senators very much for their careful attention to \nthis discussion.\n  Madam President, if all time has been used----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Then I move the amendment of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Iowa be tabled.\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 1057.

Mr. President, having just returned from a trip to Bosnia, \nI would like to describe my impressions\n\n[[Page S8683]]\n\nand offer my views on American policy there, if I may.\n  As many of my colleagues will remember, and some would rather not \nremember, over the last 6\\1/2\\ years I have been bipartisan in my \ncriticism and my critical statements about our policy toward the states \nof the former Yugoslavia. I began criticizing the Bush administration \nearly in 1991 and continued to criticize the Clinton administration \nuntil September of 1995 when it finally carried out the airstrikes that \nI had called for 3 years earlier and subsequently lifted the immoral \nand illegal arms embargo on Bosnia as part of the Dayton accords.\n  Now, Mr. President, for the first time I find myself in general \nagreement with the direction of American policy. My change of opinion \ndoes not, however, reflect either complete satisfaction or complacency. \nWe have reached a very critical point in our policy toward Bosnia, Mr. \nPresident, as all of my colleagues know. Resolute American action, \ncombined with allied support and local compliance, can turn the corner. \nBut I respectfully suggest, absent any one of those factors--resolute \nAmerican action, combined with allied support and local compliance--we \nwill not only not turn the corner; I believe we will return to the \ngenocide and chaos that prevailed 6 years ago.\n  To that end, we can, Mr. President, and we must, in my opinion, act \ndecisively to bring indicted war criminals to trial before the \nInternational Tribunal in the Hague.\n  We can, and must, Mr. President, induce the authorities in the \nFederation and the Republika Srpska to greatly expand the number of \nrefugees returning to their prewar homes.\n  We can and must, Mr. President, ensure that the countrywide municipal \nelections in mid-September and the parliamentary elections in the \nRepublika Srpska in October, are held and that they are free and fair.\n  We can and must, Mr. President, guarantee free access to electronic \nmedia for all points of view in both the Federation and the Republika \nSrpska. I hope that the agreement on the television transmitter reached \nyesterday with the Karadzic forces is a move in that direction. If they \ngo back on the bargain, SFOR troops should reoccupy that transmitter \nand take it back.\n  We can and must continue to support the Republika Srpska's President \nBiljana Plavsic in her struggle against indicted war criminal Radovan \nKaradzic.\n  We can and must, Mr. President, ensure that the decision of the \narbitrator on Brcko in March 1998 is accepted peacefully.\n  In short, Mr. President, a lot remains to be accomplished in the \ncoming months. But it is critically important for the American people \nand for my colleagues in the Congress to be clear on one fundamental \npoint: Contrary to what is frequently stated, there has been progress \non the civilian provisions of the Dayton accords, as well as on the \nwell-publicized military side of the equation.\n  To guarantee that this progress continues and expands, the \ninternational community must not withdraw its entire military \nstabilization force after June 1998. The negative consequences of \nbacksliding into renewed warfare in Bosnia would far outweigh the cost \nof a continued, if scaled-down commitment with no or much fewer \nAmerican troops.\n  Let me then, Mr. President, discuss the current situation in Bosnia. \nFirst, the war criminals issue. The type of operation carried out in \nPrijedor in July in which British and Czech SFOR troops, supported by \nAmerican forces, captured one indicted criminal and killed another \nindicted war criminal after being fired upon, must be repeated against \nDr. Karadzic and General Mladic.\n  After conversations with leading American military officers in \nBosnia, I am confident that such an operation is feasible. No American \nwishes casualties to occur, but if all other means fail, force must be \nemployed and risk taken in order to arrest these war criminals. I am \nconfident that the opportunity will present itself, and if it is seized \nupon, the operation will succeed.\n  Moreover, I suspect that after an initial angry response, most people \nin the Republika Srpska would be content to go about improving their \nimpoverished lives, relieved of the plague of the authoritarian \nextortionists in Pale. Apprehension of the war criminals will not be a \npanacea for Bosnia's ills, but in my view it is a necessary \nprecondition for the Dayton accords to have a chance of continuing to \nwork.\n  I met with opposition leaders in the Republika Srpska. I met for well \nover an hour with President Plavsic. I met with a Russian military \ncommander. I met with the American military. I met with the French \nmilitary. In fact, I met with most of the major players in Bosnia \nduring the time I was there. There is not anyone who will privately \ntell you that Karadzic and Mladic on the loose and continuing to run \nthe Republika Srpska does anything, anything at all positive. As a \nmatter of fact, all will tell you privately, and most will tell you \npublicly, that these two must be withdrawn from the scene. They will \nsay it in different ways. They will say, ``withdrawn, captured, tried \nand convicted,'' or they will say ``driven out of the country.''\n  But the bottom line is that nobody believes there is any possibility \nof the Dayton accords being fully implemented if, in fact, the most \nnotorious of the war criminals continue to run the Republika Srpska \nlike a thug operation, undermining free elections in the Republika \nSrpska within Bosnia and undermining Mrs. Plavsic. Now Mrs. Plavsic is \nno shrinking violet, is clearly a nationalist, and is not someone we \nwould choose if we could invent a President for the Republika Srpska. \nBut she is, at a minimum, honest and not running the rackets. She has \ngreatly undermined Mr. Karadzic's power by pointing out the corruption \nhe has engaged in and how he is literally robbing the people of the \nRepublika Srpska.\n  There is still 90 percent unemployment there. At least in the \nFederation it has dropped from 90 percent to 50 percent. As I will \ndiscuss in a moment, there is progress being made in the Federation, \nslow as it may be, but there is a gigantic impediment in the Republika \nSrpska, and his name is Karadzic, an indicted war criminal. I have met \nhim in the past. I told him more than 4 years ago that he was--I will \nnot precisely repeat what I said--but I said bluntly to his face that \nhe was a war criminal and should be tried as one. He looked at me and \nresumed talking as if he were saying, ``Lots of luck in your senior \nyear. No problem; thanks for talking to me.'' This guy is a madman, and \nhe is undermining the prospects of any peace for the people of Bosnia--\nSerb, Croat, or Muslim alike.\n  Over the last year, the government of the Federation, comprised \nmainly of Muslims and Croats, has slowly begun to take meaningful \nshape. New national, entity, and cantonal governments were chosen in \nthe September 1996 elections and are starting to function. The Bosnian \nPresidency and the council of ministers meet in regular sessions.\n  In Sarajevo, I had a lengthy discussion with Kresimir Zubak, the Co-\nPresident of the National Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with \nmany leading figures in the Federation administration and the Cabinet, \nand with nonnationalist Muslim and Croat opposition leaders.\n  No one attempted to gloss over the friction that persists, Mr. \nPresident. As a matter of fact, I invited a group--and I will submit \nthe list of people we invited--of leading Muslims, Croats, and Serbs to \na dinner the first night I arrived. The first comment made by, I think, \nFederation Vice President Ejup Ganic, a Muslim, was ``Senator, we have \nnot sat down at a table like this for 6 years. You have accomplished \nsomething all by itself just by getting 15 of us to show up.''\n  I do not want to paint a picture here that things in the Federation \nare rosy and wonderful. They are not. But everybody agreed on two \nthings: First, enormous progress was being made in the Federation; and \nsecond, it is absolutely essential for the international military force \nto remain in Bosnia after June 1998 to guarantee that progress will \ncontinue.\n  I made clear that a partnership is a two-way street. Politicians from \nall three principal religious groups in Bosnia must make redoubled \nefforts to carry out the terms of the Dayton accords, especially the \nreturn of refugees.\n  As Americans see evidence of increased success in civilian \nimplementation, our willingness to stay the course in Bosnia will \nincrease accordingly.\n\n[[Page S8684]]\n\n  And, Mr. President, there is much evidence to support the view that \npositive change is already occurring. Approximately 150,000 refugees \nhave returned to Bosnia from abroad and another 160,000 internally \ndisplaced persons have returned to their homes, including a few to \nareas where they will be a distinct minority.\n  Meanwhile, the Train and Equip Program, led by private American \nmilitary instructors, retired military, is molding a Muslim-Croat \ndefense force for the Government of Bosnia guaranteeing the \nFederation's security in the future. Agreements on the Federation force \nstructure and command have been reached, and over 300 million dollars' \nworth of military equipment has been procured.\n  Remember, Mr. President, the big problem was initially that we could \nnot get the Muslim and the Croats in the Federation to agree to a joint \nmilitary command. They would not train together. Now we have a joint \nmilitary command. Muslims and Croats are sitting in the same \nclassrooms. The officer corps and the enlisted men are all training \ntogether. There has been solid progress.\n  In Hadzici, west of Sarajevo, I visited the headquarters of the Train \nand Equip Program and spoke with the Federation's Minister of Defense \nand his deputy, with the commanders of the Muslim and Croat forces, and \nwith soldiers of both armies. The cooperation is excellent, and their \nAmerican trainers had high praise for their eagerness to learn and \ntheir aptitude.\n  In the Federation, joint police forces are being formed, including in \nthe city of Mostar, site of the worst warfare between Muslim and \nCroats.\n  Within the framework of this modicum of stability, the economy is \nbeginning to revive. Real gross domestic product has nearly doubled \nsince 1995. As I mentioned, unemployment has dropped from 90 percent to \n50 percent. Corruption, though, remains a major problem.\n  Nonetheless, if there is continued security, political progress, and \ninternational technical and financial assistance, the Federation, I \nbelieve, can be a going concern within a few years.\n  One of the nonnational opposition leaders with whom I met, Stjepan \nKljujic, an ethnic Croat, offered the opinion that the Federation had \nto be better than the Republika Srpska politically, economically, and \nmorally. Making an intriguing historical parallel, he continued that \nthe Federation should become Bosnia's West Germany against the \nRepublika Srpska's East Germany, even attracting guest workers from the \nlatter as the economic disparity between the two entities widens. In \nthis way, he felt, the two halves of the country could eventually grow \ntogether.\n  Whatever the validity of this vision, conditions in the Republika \nSrpska are already quite different from those in the Federation because \nof Mr. Karadzic's heavy hand. The Bosnian Serb member of the tripartite \nPresidency, Momcilo Krajisnik, an ally of Karadzic, has refused all but \nminimal fulfillment of the Dayton provisions. As a result, the \ninternational community has withheld most of its development aid from \nthe Republika Srpska.\n\n  The economy there remains in shambles with less than 10 percent of \nthe work force gainfully employed. In the midst of this misery, Dr. \nKaradzic--it is hard to even call him a doctor, but he is a doctor--and \nhis cronies ostentatiously flaunt the wealth they have amassed through \nsmuggling and protection rackets.\n  It is no wonder, then, that Mrs. Plavsic's anticorruption message has \nstruck a chord with wide segments of the population in the Republika \nSrpska. I met with her for an hour and a half in Banja Luka. We must \nnot have any illusions that President Plavsic, who loudly supported \nSerbian ultranationalists and ethnic cleansing during the war, has \nsuddenly become a Jeffersonian Democrat. She is, however, a realist who \nunderstands that the Bosnian Serb entity is in danger of total \ndisintegration unless it rids itself of the lawlessness, corruption, \nand warped religious hatred of the Karadzic gang and begins to \ncooperates with the West.\n  In all likelihood, by seizing the Banja Luka police headquarters, \nSFOR prevented a coup d'etat against Mrs. Plavsic last month. Our \nsupport of her police forces and television journalists may be turning \nthe tide against the thugs in Pale, at least in the western part of the \nRepublika Srpska.\n  Since two-thirds of the population of the Republika Srpska lives in \nthe western part of the entity, there is a good possibility that \nPresident Plavsic's supporters can win control of the Parliament in \nnext month's election. If that occurs, we should be able to leverage \nthe promise of reconstruction assistance to induce President Plavsic to \nbegin to cooperate on refugee returns.\n  Moreover, a lively antinationalist Serbian opposition exists in the \nRepublika Srpska. In Banja Luka, I met with three of its leaders--\nMiodrag Zivanovic, Mladen Ivanic, and Milorad Dodik. They feel that \ndemocracy is unstoppable and that Mrs. Plavsic, of whom they have been \nsworn enemies, is only a transitional figure whom they will support \nduring this election as a step toward genuine democracy.\n  Actually, the beginnings of refugee returns are already occurring, \nincluding some into areas controlled by other religious groups. I \nvisited two such sites, one in the zone of separation near the critical \nnorthern town of Brcko, the other in Vogosca, a suburb of Sarajevo \nwhich was returned to the Federation as part of the Dayton settlement.\n  In the Brcko area, rebuilding is proceeding under the skillful \ndirection of the U.S. supervisor, Ambassador Bill Farrand, and the \nprotection of the local American SFOR contingent, based nearby in Camp \nMcGovern. I might add that I was amazed at how high the morale was in \nCamp McGovern and how greatly impressed I was by Brig. Gen. Mark Curran \nand Lt. Col. Bill Greer, the two senior officers, who were doing a \nphenomenal job there.\n  Hostility in Brcko lies just below the surface, as shown by the riots \norganized by Karadzic loyalists less than 2 days after I left the city. \nThe soldiers from Camp McGovern handled that potentially explosive \nsituation with consummate professionalism, and I am confident they will \ncontinue to do so.\n  I will digress briefly at this point, Mr. President, to mention that \nan important feature of SFOR are the Russian troops under the command \nof General Clark, the SACEUR, the [Supreme Allied Commander Europe]. At \nCamp McGovern, I met with the commanding officer of the Russian SFOR \nairborne brigade who was enthusiastic about the cooperation with our \nforces and totally supportive of our action.\n  To return to refugee resettlement, unlike the palpable hostility in \nBrcko, in the Sarajevo suburb the situation was peaceful. There I saw \nMuslims, Croats, and one or two Serbs who were returning to rebuild \ntheir devastated homes under an imaginative program run by the United \nStates Agency for International Development in cooperation with \nCatholic Relief Services.\n  Mr. President, it is worth underscoring here that not only are our \nmagnificent Armed Forces under the inspired command of Gen. Eric \nShinseki playing the largest single role in SFOR, but our United States \nGovernment development specialists have won universal respect among the \nBosnians for being the international community's most efficient \nproviders of assistance.\n  As a matter of fact, one of the Bosnian Serb opposition leaders said \nto me in Banja Luka that the Europeans are incapable of solving Bosnia \ns problems. By way of contrast he characterized the Americans as ``not \nalways sensitive but very efficient.'' That is just what I would like \nus to be--``not always sensitive but very efficient.''\n  In summation, where do I see Bosnia and Herzegovina heading if the \nUnited States and our allies stay the course? Personally, I would like \nto see a multi-ethnic, multireligious society re-emerge like the one \nthat existed in Sarajevo before the war. I fear, however, that too much \nblood has been shed and too many atrocities committed for that to \nhappen in the near future.\n  More realistic, and politically feasible, is the development of a \nmulti-ethnic state, most likely in the form of a confederation with a \ngood degree of decentralization.\n  My sense from this trip is that the ardor has cooled in the Republika \nSrpska for union with Serbia, since President Milosevic is regarded as \na betrayer of the Serb cause and as a figure totally incapable of \nproviding the basic material prosperity that the Bosnian Serbs so \ndesperately crave.\n\n[[Page S8685]]\n\n  Unreconstructed Croat nationalists in Herzegovina may still long for \nunion with Croatia, but as the leadership changes in Zagreb, the new \ngovernment there will be more intent on integrating with Western Europe \nthan on annexing provincial bandits.\n  In short, for the first time in years, developments are moving in the \nright direction. As I have outlined, much hard political and economic \nwork remains to be done, most of it by the Bosnians themselves. The \nUnited States and its allies can, and must, provide the framework for \nthe Dayton accords to be fully implemented.\n  I do not minimize the cost to the American taxpayer of our efforts. \nNeither, however, can I underestimate the cost of a failure of the \nBosnian operation. In the near future, I will indicate in some detail \nwhat I think the costs would be to the United States if, in fact, \nBosnia were to erupt once again. Suffice it to say now that not only \nwould all that has been accomplished go up in smoke as fighting \nreignited, but a failure in Bosnia would signal the beginning of the \nend for NATO, which is currently restructuring itself to meet Bosnia-\nlike challenges in the 21st century.\n  Therefore, I call upon the Clinton administration immediately to \nbegin discussions with our allies about creating a post-SFOR force \nafter June 1998. For months, I recommended a combined joint task force \nwith our allies, which the Senate overwhelmingly advocated in July in \nthe 1998 defense authorization Bill.\n  The question of whether American participation in a post-SFOR force \nwill be limited to air, naval, intelligence, and communications support \nwith a rapid deployment force in reserve in Hungary, or also might \ninclude a greatly reduced ground contingent can be resolved in these \nnegotiations.\n  The immediate priority is to begin the negotiations now--to make \nclear to all parties in Bosnia that, if they cooperate, the security \nframework will continue for a limited time--and to make clear to the \nskeptics that the new NATO can and will be the driving force in the \nEuropean security architecture of the 21st century.\n  I thank my colleague from Arizona for his indulgence. I thank the \nPresident for the time.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/03/senate-section/article/S8682-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8685-S8692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, yesterday I had announced our hope to be \nable to conclude this bill by this evening. Senator Lott was on the \nfloor when we were talking about scheduling and I discussed it briefly \nwith our distinguished majority leader, and also with Senator Harkin, \nthe ranking Democrat, and asked that anybody who intended to file \namendments to let us know by the close of business yesterday, or in any \nevent no later than noon today. We have been advised of a number of \npossible amendments. I believe it is possible to work some of those \nout. Others will have to go to votes.\n  But I would restate at this time our urging anybody who intends to \nfile an amendment to contact us by noon today so that we may proceed. \nThere is one item which may not be completed by the close of business \ntoday, and that relates to the funding on testing which is now proposed \nby the administration.\n  There was a statement in the media by Congressman William Goodling of \nPennsylvania, chairman of their authorization committee, of his \nintention to oppose funding. And there was comment that a similar \nprohibition may be offered on this bill.\n  Yesterday I was contacted by the Secretary of Education, Richard \nRiley, who urged support of their program, and we had a discussion. \nAfter sleeping on it I decided it would be a good idea to have a \nhearing on the subject, which we have put into effect for tomorrow \nmorning at 9 o'clock, with the concurrence of Senator Harkin and also \nour chairman of the appropriations committee, Senator Stevens. So, if \nthat amendment is offered, that one item of business might most \nappropriately be concluded tomorrow morning. But aside from that one \nitem, it is my hope that we will be able to finish action on this bill \nthis evening.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Kyl, for offering his amendment \nyesterday.\n  I yield the floor so that Senator Kyl may proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1056\n\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate that.\n  I also appreciate the remarks of the Senator from Delaware preceding \nthis. I think he makes very cogent points on a different subject.\n  Mr. President, I don't think the yeas and nays have been ordered on \nmy amendment. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  At this time, let me explain the reasons for my amendment to increase \nPell grant funding. I submitted a statement for the Record yesterday. \nBut I would like to discuss it in a little bit more detail today.\n  There is particular reason for us to take this action which would \nbring us closer to the administration's request and into line with the \nrecommendation from the House of Representatives. It seems odd to me \nthat the Senate would not be willing to support Pell grant funding at \nthe same level as recommended by the Appropriations Committee in the \nHouse of Representatives. This amendment would conform the Senate \nfunding level to the House funding level, and there is a particular \nreason for this amendment coming up. That is, a problem that was \ncreated in a previous law with respect to two different groups of \nstudents that are funded. I would like to discuss that in a little bit \nmore detail.\n  First, let me note the numbers. This amendment would provide an \nadditional $528 million for the Pell Grant Program. It would boost \nfunding to the level recommended by the House Appropriations Committee. \nThe Pell grant funding would go from $6.91 billion to $7.438 billion. \nThe offset is from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which \nI will discuss in just a moment.\n  The Pell grant funding amendment, as I said, is intended to finance \nchanges in eligibility--that is, to correct problems that have arisen \nas a result of the current law phaseout of certain independent students \nat income levels that are lower than those for dependent students. Like \nthe House bill, this funding level is contingent upon the authorization \ncommittee providing authorization.\n  We have letters from both the chairman and ranking members of the \nHouse and Senate authorizing committees indicating that should the \nadditional funding be approved they would work for that authorization \nto be established.\n  It is also my understanding that the administration is in agreement \nwith the House of Representative numbers with respect to the Pell grant \nfunding.\n  So I think we ought to put at least as high a priority on Pell grants \nas the President and the House of Representatives in this version of \nthe Labor-HHS bill.\n  Here is the problem that was created. In the Higher Education \nAmendments of 1992 we established a separate allowance for independent \nstudents without dependents--independent students, not dependent \nstudents--independent students who do not themselves have dependents.\n  The problem is, the separate allowance established under the 1992 \nact. It creates a substantial disparity among these groups of students \nvery much to the disadvantage of the independent students without \ndependents. The proposed change in eligibility which the\n\n[[Page S8686]]\n\nfunding in my amendment is intended to finance would bring the \nproportion of students in this group who would be eligible for Pell \ngrants closer to the proportion that existed prior to the establishment \nof the separate allowance in the 1992 act. Students, incidentally, in \nthis group are typically older students with annual family incomes of \nbetween $10,000 and $20,000.\n  I obtained from the Department of Education a statistical list for \nthe States of the number of students who lost eligibility under the \nseparate allowance that we created in the 1992 act. Just for the \nbenefit of some of the Senators who are here, I might note some of the \nnumbers with respect to the States involved here.\n  In California, for example, 24,314 students lost eligibility as a \nresult of what we did. My amendment would provide a way for these \nstudents to go to school.\n  In Iowa, the State of the distinguished ranking Member, 4,247 \nstudents lost eligibility as a result of what we did. My amendment \nwould reassert their eligibility to provide the funding for that.\n  In the State of Michigan, the number of students who lost \neligibility, according to the Department of Education, is 15,254;\n  In the State of Minnesota, 7,432;\n  In the State of Pennsylvania, the State of the distinguished chairman \nof the committee, 9,535 students lost eligibility as a result of what \nwas done.\n  My amendment will restore the funding so that these students will be \neligible--will have the funding to get the Pell grants to get their \neducation.\n  So we are talking here about a significant number of students that \nwill not be helped if our amendment is not adopted.\n  The offset, as I said, is from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram, the so-called LIHEAP Program. I know there are some Members \nwho rather reflexably react to any reductions in this program because \nthere is a contingent of their constituency that relies on this program \nand that reacts very badly if there is an attempt to cut it. But, Mr. \nPresident, I think in this case we have to balance the interests of \nthose people with the people who have lost their eligibility under the \nPell Grant Program. And, if we do not act, these students are not going \nto have the opportunity to advance their education.\n  So let's talk for just a minute about this tradeoff and about the \nLIHEAP Program.\n  The LIHEAP Program was set up 16 years ago as a temporary program for \njust a few months to help people get over the energy crisis. The energy \ncrisis is long gone. This is a typical program of the liberal welfare \nstate. It gets established, and then can never be disestablished \nnotwithstanding the fact that the reason for it has long ago \ndisappeared.\n  The world is a very different place than it was in 1981. Gone are the \nlong lines at the gas pumps and the skyrocketing energy prices.\n  It seems to me, as we prepare for the 21st century, that we should \nlook beyond programs designed to cope with an energy crisis of nearly \n20 years ago--a crisis that has come and gone --and focus instead on \nhow to prepare young people for the high-tech more competitive economy \nof the future.\n  That is what this amendment does.\n  Mr. President, fuel costs have not only stabilized since 1981, they \nhave declined significantly in real terms; that is, in inflation-\nadjusted terms.\n  For example, I would refer to figures from the Clinton administration \nitself. In its 1995 budget submission the Clinton administration \nrecommended substantial reductions in the LIHEAP Program because it too \nrecognized that the fuel costs had gone down significantly. As noted in \nthe President's budget, ``fuel prices have decreased by 40 percent in \nreal terms; the cost of electricity has dropped by about 13 percent in \nreal terms; and the percent of income spent for home heating for \nhouseholds at or below 150 percent of poverty guidelines has dropped by \nabout one-third.'' The President's budget went on to propose a 50-\npercent reduction in funding for the program that year.\n\n  Last year, President Clinton proposed outyear costs in LIHEAP--a $90 \nmillion reduction in 1999, and a $181 million reduction in the year \n2000. The Office of Management and Budget advised my office that the \ndeclining figures were due to the standard percentage reductions \napplied to programs that were not considered a high priority--because \nof the statistics that I cited earlier from the Clinton administration.\n  So, Mr. President, you have the Clinton administration recognizing \nthat we need to increase the Pell grant funding, you have the Clinton \nadministration recognizing that the LIHEAP Program can no longer be \njustified at its present level, you have the House of Representatives \nAppropriations Committee recommending that we end this disparity \nbetween the two different groups of students funded by Pell grants, and \nit seems to me that we have an opportunity here with very little \ndetriment to increase the funding for these students.\n  The States themselves as I have noted, have already shown a \nsignificant ability to meet the energy needs of those that require \nassistance.\n  For example, many States refuse to allow public utilities to shut off \npower to delinquent customers. And they have set up payment plans and \nother options. So we do not need the old subsidy to deal with the \nproblem that may exist for some people.\n  It just seems to me given the States' track record, obviously, that \nthey care as much about their low-income citizens as people here in \nWashington, DC, do. Given their track records and the stable or \ndeclining price of energy, this is a good time to begin, as the \nPresident recommended a couple of years ago, to begin cutting back on \nLIHEAP so that we can target these resources to other more pressing \nneeds.\n  In closing, Mr. President, the bipartisan budget agreement that we \npassed in July was intended to create new opportunities in education \nfor middle- and upper-income families. It will through a variety of new \ntax breaks and tax credits. But we have the chance today to target \nadditional Pell grant assistance to more lower- and middle-income \npeople so that all American families will have the same opportunity to \nsecure a brighter future.\n  For those, as I said, who react somewhat automatically against this \namendment because, as one friend put it, they come from a cold State, I \nsimply think it is very hard to explain why you voted against the level \nof Pell grant funding recommended by the House of Representatives and \nthe President of the United States simply because you wanted to \npreserve a 16-year-old temporary subsidy program, the justification for \nwhich has long since disappeared.\n  This amendment literally represents a choice between an old welfare \nstate subsidy and a brighter future for more young people through \neducation that they might not otherwise receive.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this amendment to add \nmore money to the Pell Grant Program.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I agree with 50 percent of what the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona has said; that is, the part about \nthe increasing Pell grants. I think he is exactly right about that. I \nwish we had more money to increase the Pell grants.\n  What we have done is to increase the Pell grants by $1 billion. It \nhas moved from fiscal year 1997 where it was at $5.919 billion to \n$6.910 billion which is a very, very substantial increase--in the 16- \nto 17-percent range.\n  Senator Harkin and I, who have looked over these figures, take second \nplace to no one on our concern for education and that created in the \nbudget we have here, and what we have done over the years--most notably \nlast April when we added $2.6 billion over some very considerable \nobjection and instead having those funds go largely to education.\n  As I said yesterday, on a very personal level, my concern about \neducation goes to the roots of my own family. Both of my parents were \nimmigrants. And my brother, my two sisters, and I have been able to \nshare in the American dream because of our educational opportunities.\n  We have not only added to the Pell grants the $1 billion here but \nhave also increased the funding on guaranteed student loans so that \nevery young man and woman--and this goes for the people who are not \nquite so young--would\n\n[[Page S8687]]\n\nhave an opportunity for educational advancement in this country.\n  So that I agree totally with what my distinguished colleague from \nArizona has had to say about the value of the Pell grants. But we have \nstretched and stretched very, very far.\n  It is true that the House has an additional $500 million in the Pell \ngrants, and they have a larger sum of money to work with than we are \nallocated in the Senate. Without going into any extensive explanation, \nthere are different technical rules which apply to the two bodies.\n  I might say to my colleague from Arizona that with the additional \narguments he has advanced today in a very cogent way, to the extent we \ncan yield to the House figure, we will try to do so when we get to \nconference, recognizing his interest and being even more persuaded by \nhis eloquence here this morning.\n  The part of his presentation that I cannot agree with is the part \nrelating to cutting the funding on low-income heat and energy fuel \nassistance. What we have done here, Mr. President, for those who may be \nlistening in-house or on C-SPAN 2, is made an allocation of the almost \n$80 billion here by trying to place the funding on a priority basis, \nand having taken care of other priorities including Pell grants with \nthe additional $1 billion, have made the allocation of $1 billion to \nthe LIHEAP 1998 program and an advanced appropriation of $1.2 billion, \nwhich is slightly different.\n  This program is on the decline from 1985 when it had $2.1 billion. We \nbelieve that this is an appropriate allocation of priorities. Some 55 \nSenators have written to Senator Harkin and myself asking that LIHEAP \nbe preserved. If you add 55 to 2, that is 57, and there may be some \nother votes out there.\n  I make this comment not to prejudge the tabulation of the votes, \nbecause you never know until the votes are counted, but there are 57 \nSenators who have been concerned enough about this one item who have \nspoken up--55 having written to us. And I can tell you how strongly \nSenator Harkin and I feel about this. I know obviously my own sense of \nit, and I have talked to Senator Harkin enough to know his sense.\n  This program is for low-income families. Almost 70 percent of the \nrecipient families have an annual income of less than $8,000--think of \nthat, $8,000; 44 percent have at least one member who is elderly, and \n20 percent have a member disabled. Currently, the number of families \nserved has been reduced to 5 million families, 1 million less than 2 \nyears ago, and this is part of our effort to target those who need it \nthe most. The funding has been cut by more than 50 percent, from $2.1 \nbillion to this figure. There is no replacement for this funding.\n  Thirty-five percent of all recipient households heat their homes by \nusing oil, propane, wood, or coal. These sources of fuel do not have a \nmonopoly control over their territories and cannot raise prices to \ncover the cost of providing discounted or free energy supplies to their \nlow-income members. What we really face here is that in this category, \nmany of the elderly, many of the disabled are faced with an alternative \nof either heating or eating, and that is a choice obviously that no \nAmerican should face.\n  Without LIHEAP, there would not be an opportunity for these low-\nincome families to utilize their other scarce resources for sustaining \nthemselves. Obviously, in a civilized society, if the choice is heating \nor eating, we have to do both, and that is why this funding is so very \nimportant.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I was just going to comment on a couple \nthings very briefly.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Go ahead.\n  Mr. KYL. I certainly appreciate the comments of the Senator from \nPennsylvania, the chairman of the committee. I just wanted to comment \non two of the points he made.\n  It is, indeed, true that the total amount of money to be expended on \nPell grants has been increased by about $1 billion. That goes to \nincrease the maximum Pell grant to $3,000. It does not, as the Senator, \nof course, is well aware, fund this category of people who I contend \nhave been disadvantaged as a result of the 1992 act, the independent \nstudents without dependents. So the increase in the funding in the bill \nhas made it better for those who receive the grants, but it has not \nenabled us to cover the people that I am proposing to cover.\n  Second, with respect to the LIHEAP Program, just to make it very \nclear, this offset does not eliminate the LIHEAP Program. It reduces by \nabout one-half the funding for the LIHEAP Program, which, incidentally, \nis almost the same amount of reduction that was recommended by \nPresident Clinton in his 1995 budget submission.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise--and I am sure this is no surprise \nto anyone--in opposition to the amendment offered by my friend from \nArizona. Again, I would concur with what my distinguished chairman \nsaid. About half I agree with; half I do not agree with in terms of the \nSenator's comments.\n  We are all in favor of increasing Pell grants and making sure \neveryone is covered, but I would say this committee, under the able \nleadership of Senator Specter, has done a great job of increasing the \nPell grants to historically high levels--a maximum grant of $3,000, up \nfrom $2,700 last year. Certainly you always perhaps could have more. \nBut I haven't heard from any institution of higher learning or anyone \nthat is involved in the Pell grant program saying that this is \ninsufficient. I think what I have heard is that they are very, very \nhappy with what this committee has done in meeting these requirements \nand getting the level up.\n  In taking the cut out of LIHEAP for this, though, talk about robbing \nPeter to pay Paul, because we are talking about the same kind of \nuniverse. We are talking about low-income families.\n  Again, just to reiterate and reaffirm what the chairman said, the \nLIHEAP Program has gone down 50 percent in the last decade. We started \nout at about $2.1 billion in 1985 and it is down now to $1 billion--a \n50-percent drop in the amount of money, yet the eligible population for \nLIHEAP has grown by about 30 percent--33 percent in that same period of \ntime. So the eligible number has gone up and the pie piece has gone \ndown. Over 70 percent of the families receiving LIHEAP assistance have \nincomes of less than $8,000 a year; 7 out of every 10 have incomes--\nthat is not individuals--family incomes less than $8,000 a year, and 44 \npercent of the households receiving it are elderly, over age 65. So \nthat is the universe we are talking about.\n  The Senator from Arizona said this is a program that's outlived its \nusefulness; the energy crisis is gone. Well, it may be that for those \nwho are making more money it is gone, but my figures show that the \nprices of natural gas, electricity, if you adjust for inflation, are \nabout as high now as they were in 1979. But if you look at the universe \nof people who are getting LIHEAP, their inflation-adjusted incomes have \nnot gone up. So they are basically in the same position they were in, \nor like families were in, when the energy crisis hit in 1979.\n  As Senator Specter said, 50 percent of these families in LIHEAP use \nnatural gas, 15 percent use electricity, 35 percent use oil, propane, \nwood, and coal. So for these families the energy crisis still exists, \nand it especially exists when the weather gets the coldest.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is in the Chamber, and as we found out \nlast year when we had some extremely cold weather, we found anomalies \nin the upper Midwest where in some States the cost of propane and oil \nspiked, went up 25 percent during the coldest times of the year as \ncompared to some other States. In other words, in those areas where it \nwas the coldest, where it was needed the most, the price went up the \nhighest.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a question? And I say to my \ncolleague from Maine, I will not go with other questions as I know she \nwants to speak, and I had a chance to speak yesterday.\n  Isn't it also true, taking the experience of last winter--and I could \nask this of the chairman as well, Senator Specter--what has been \nhappening, because we have really been underfunded, we depend on the \nemergency funding and we go through this drill every year where then \nwhat we have to do is seek this additional emergency funding? We \ncertainly had to do that last year. And then, of course, States never \nknow what they are going to be able to do. So the last thing we should \nbe doing, am I correct, is cutting $500 million?\n\n[[Page S8688]]\n\n  It would gut the whole program.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It would gut the whole program. To answer the Senator's \nquestion, we always come in for emergency funds. But here is what \nhappens. When you don't fund the LIHEAP Program enough, what happens is \nfamily--let's face it; the average family gets about 215 bucks. It's \nwhat, around 30 percent, I think, of their heating bill. But what \nhappens--and we know this from experience in my State of Iowa \nespecially--when they don't know if they are going to get the money to \npay their heating bills--and you know elderly people are very proud. \nThey don't want to be on welfare and most of them are not on welfare. \nThey are getting Social Security, very small Social Security checks. \nWhat they do is they turn the heat down and they put their shawls on, \nthey put on coats, they wear coats around the house. And then what \nhappens. Well, they get ill and then they have to go to the hospital, \nand they go to the emergency rooms.\n  We have found this time and time and time again. That is what poor \npeople, and especially elderly people, will do when they don't know if \nthey are going to get their heating money. And so again, the crisis is \nreal for these people, very, very real.\n  As I pointed out, last year we had--and I have called for an \ninvestigation of it--in some States, a 25-percent increase, and I do \nnot think there is any need for it other than the demand was there, it \nwas very cold, and a lot of these elderly people simply could not pay \nthese prices.\n  Lastly, let me sort of respond philosophically to the Senator from \nArizona. I couldn't help but notice the comment that this was a program \nof the liberal welfare state; like a lot of programs of the liberal \nwelfare state, it just goes on and on and on even when the need is not \nthere.\n  Well, I could ask the Senator from Arizona, what about the Pell Grant \nProgram? That was a program of the Lyndon Johnson Great Society just as \nwell as--well, not LIHEAP; that came later, but the Pell grant was a \nprogram from under the Great Society, and the need was there and the \nneed is still there for the Pell Grant Program.\n  So I would submit to the Senator from Arizona that this is not a \nprogram of the liberal welfare state. It is a program of a caring and \ncompassionate and fair state. We are, as I said the other day, \nfulfilling our obligation under the Constitution of the United States.\n  A lot of people do not realize this, but twice in the Constitution \nthe word ``welfare'' is mentioned--twice--first, in the preamble when \nit says, ``We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more \nperfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide \nfor the common defence, promote the general Welfare.''\n  ``Promote,'' it does not say just stand by. It says ``promote the \ngeneral Welfare.'' That is why we established the Constitution. So that \nis the first place it is mentioned. And then in article I, section 8 of \nthe Constitution. Article I is, of course, Congress and what Congress \nis supposed to do. Section 8 outlines the responsibilities of Congress: \nTo borrow money, regulate commerce, to establish post offices and \nroads, provide and maintain a Navy, et cetera, et cetera. Here is the \nfirst paragraph of section 8 of article I of the Constitution.\n\n       The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, \n     Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for \n     the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.\n\n  It is our obligation, first, to promote the general welfare and then, \nusing the powers that we have to lay and collect taxes and disburse \nthose moneys, to provide for the general welfare of the people.\n  That is what we are talking about. Whether we are talking about Pell \nGrant Programs or whether we are talking about heating energy \nassistance programs for the elderly and the poor, we are fulfilling our \nobligation as a caring and compassionate state to promote the general \nwelfare and to use our taxing and spending powers outlined in the \nConstitution of the United States to provide for the general welfare of \nour people.\n  So, no, this is not a program of a liberal welfare state. It is a \nprogram of a caring and compassionate and fair state, just as the Pell \nGrants Program is. These are good programs. We should not be robbing \none that hits at the poorest, those with the lowest incomes of our \npeople--70 percent of these families have less than $8,000 a year \nincome--to use that to try to help other low-income people to get an \neducation. Don't tell me there are not other sources of funds here. \nThere are.\n  I might submit that we now have this B-2 bomber we are building that \ncannot even sit out in the rain, $1 billion a copy, and now we have to \nbuild special hangars for them because they cannot sit outside. We \ncan't forward deploy them. All this is coming out now. We are going to \nput money in that, but we are going to take money out of the heating \nenergy assistance programs to help other poor people get an education? \nI am sorry, that doesn't quite compute for this Senator.\n  So I am hopeful--and I know the Senator from Arizona means well. As I \nsaid, I support half of what he is talking about, in terms of getting \nthe Pell grants up. I just think his sources of getting the money are \njust not good for this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Maine, \nwho is going to speak next, but I ask if I can have just 1 minute to \nrespond to one point the Senator from Iowa just made. I think it is \nimportant for me to respond to it.\n  He said, first, that the inflation-adjusted prices are about the same \nand then challenged my assertion that the liberal welfare state \nprogram, as I described the LIHEAP Program, which I said the need for \nhad largely been eliminated, is similar, in terms of welfare, to the \nPell grant funding and suggested perhaps I was failing to appreciate \nthe similarity in both programs being welfare programs.\n  I simply wanted to respond to the Senator from Iowa in this fashion. \nWhat I said was that once a welfare state program is instituted, it is \nvery difficult to get rid of it even if the need for it has been \neliminated or reduced. That, in my opinion--and I know the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa disagrees with this opinion--but in my \nopinion, the LIHEAP Program is a program which was originally intended \nto be temporary. That is a fact. But it has now become permanent \nnotwithstanding, in my opinion, the fact that the need for it has \nlargely been eliminated or reduced, thus demonstrating a program \ninstituted for very good reasons but, in my view, which no longer is \njustified--as distinguished from the Pell Grant Program. I think none \nof us would argue the need for that has been reduced or eliminated.\n  So my point is not that one is welfare and one is not welfare in the \nbroadest sense of the term, as the Senator from Iowa noted, but rather \nthat the need for one has largely been eliminated, yet it is very \ndifficult if not impossible for us to eliminate these programs once \nthey have begun.\n  To the point that the energy costs are about the same as they were, I \ncan only cite the statistics from the Clinton administration budget \nsubmitted in 1995. And I am quoting now.\n\n       [F]uel prices have decreased by 40 percent in real terms; \n     the cost of electricity has dropped by about 13 percent in \n     real terms; and the percent of income spent for home heating \n     for households at or below 150 percent of poverty guidelines \n     has dropped by about one-third.\n\n  That is the reason for my assertion that the energy costs have indeed \ngone down dramatically.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield for this colloquy, just yield \nfor a question. Even taking the Senator's figures, if the real prices \nhave dropped by a third, the fact is that since 1985 the LIHEAP Program \nhas come down 50 percent. So we are spending half as much money today. \nOf course, in real terms it would be even less than that, if you \nadjusted for inflation. I am just talking about the actual dollars. \nIt's $2.1 billion in 1985, it's $1 billion now. So, even if the cost--I \nask the Senator to think about this and see if my reasoning is wrong \nhere--even if the cost of energy has come down by a third, if in fact \nthe amount of money we are putting in the program has come down by over \na half, does that not compute out to the fact that there is less money \ngoing into the program today and that less money is there to meet the \nheating\n\n[[Page S8689]]\n\nneeds of those families who are getting the money?\n  Mr. KYL. Relatively speaking, the Senator from Iowa is certainly \ncorrect. We would simply then engage in a philosophical debate as to \nwhether or not, if that number continued to drop to one-third and one-\ntenth and so on, whether the program should continue. My view would be \nthis was a temporary program designed to meet a temporary need, that it \nwas never designed to pay for 100 percent of the bill for heating, and \ntherefore there is a point at which the need for the program should go \naway, when the prices have been reduced to a certain point. He and I \nobviously simply disagree about what that point would be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the distinguished Senator from Arizona, which would cut \nfunding severely for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program and \nincrease funding for the Pell Grant Program.\n  There is no stronger supporter of the Pell Grant Program in the U.S. \nSenate than I. In fact, very shortly I will be introducing legislation \nto expand working students' eligibility for Pell grants. However, when \nfaced with this amendment, I must ask the question: Are we so poor a \ncountry that some must be cold, go hungry, forgo medications so that \nothers may learn? The answer is obvious. This amendment presents a \nfalse choice.\n  Maine is well known for its cold and very long winters. Many of \nMaine's residents, along with the citizens of other Northern States, \nare heavily dependent on the aid provided by LIHEAP in order to heat \ntheir homes during the cold winter months. Without the assistance of \nLIHEAP, 33,000 of Maine's most vulnerable and needy citizens--I am \ntalking about elderly people, the disabled, and very low-income \nfamilies--will go without adequate heat during the coming winter or \nwill be forced to forgo medications or even food. We must not allow \nthis to happen.\n  As Senator Specter and Senator Harkin have noted, 70 percent of the \npeople receiving this home heating assistance have incomes under $8,000 \na year. We are talking about people who are very needy. This bill's \nfunding for LIHEAP is not excessive. In fact, it's approximately the \namount that was spent last year, and that amount was not adequate to \nserve all of the people needing assistance. Last year this program \nprovided 33,000 Mainers with an average subsidy of $308. That is only \nenough to buy a couple of tanks of heating oil. For many, this small \namount of help is, however, the difference between being in a \ncomfortably heated home and freezing.\n  This is not an excessive expenditure. Failure to appropriate at least \nthis amount will only result in a call for emergency funding later this \nyear, an event that has occurred in each of the past 4 years. I agree \nwith the able and distinguished Senator from Arizona that funding for \nPell grants should be increased, but I cannot support a reduction in \nLIHEAP as a means of accomplishing this.\n  A recent editorial from the Portland Press Herald in my State put it \nwell when it stated:\n\n       The idea of LIHEAP may seem frivolous to lawmakers from \n     warm, southern States. However, the subsidy remains essential \n     to residents in colder climates. That's especially true now \n     when welfare cuts and a rising cost of living have pushed so \n     many poor families so much closer to the edge. Asking low-\n     income and elderly Mainers to choose between filling their \n     fuel tanks or their cupboards is not fair.\n\n  I conclude my remarks by stating that asking the U.S. Senate to \nchoose between LIHEAP and Pell grants is also not fair. It is a false \nchoice and I ask my colleagues to oppose the amendment offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am advised that the vote will not occur \nuntil 3 o'clock under our scheduling. So, if there are any additional \nspeakers who wish to come to the floor at this time, we invite them to \ndo so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am aware the Senator from Minnesota, \nSenator Wellstone, had desired to speak against my amendment here. I am \nnot aware of anyone else who intends to speak on it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  Do I understand there has been an agreement reached to have the vote \nat 3?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as is usually the case, there are absent \nSenators, one not due to return until 1 o'clock. We then have a \nconference until 2:15. Then there are hearings. So it will be our \nexpectation, subject to checking with the distinguished majority \nleader, that the vote on this amendment would occur at 5 o'clock. But \nit would be our expectation that this would conclude the debate on the \namendment. It wouldn't absolutely foreclose somebody who wanted to come \ndown and speak on the matter, perhaps, briefly, but that would conclude \nthe debate and we would hope to set the vote here for 5 o'clock and \nperhaps stack it with other votes at that time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I might just ask the distinguished chairman.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Obviously, we are open for business now. There are other \namendments that I have heard about that are out there. So if other \nSenators have them, now is the time to come over, and perhaps if \namendments are offered now and after the caucuses, after the 2:15 time, \nwe could stack a bunch of votes at 5 o'clock. I know Senators like to \ndo that, because they can schedule their time a little bit better. I \nhope any Senators who have amendments will come over now before we \nbreak for our party caucuses or come over at 2:15 and then we can stack \nthe votes at 5 o'clock.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If my distinguished colleague will yield, Mr. President, \nI think that would be a good arrangement. I said earlier, repeating \nwhat we said yesterday, it is our hope to finish action on this bill \nthis evening. That is what we said yesterday after concurring with the \nmajority leader. There is one possible exception to that, and that \nwould relate to a possible amendment to preclude any funding for the \nadministration testing, and an issue arose yesterday as to whether that \namendment might be offered. Secretary Riley called Senator Harkin, \nmyself and others yesterday, and we have scheduled a hearing for \ntomorrow morning at 9 o'clock so that we may have a better factual \nunderstanding on that matter before the vote comes up, if it does come \nup. It would be our hope we can conclude action on the bill this \nevening, with the exception of that possible vote following the hearing \ntomorrow morning.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside so that we might receive an amendment by the distinguished \nSenator from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, on a matter which I believe is \nacceptable to both sides. This involves an issue which has been \nresolved after laborious debates on related subjects, and it is one \nwhere the House of Representatives has worked out an accommodation. The \namendment will now be offered by our colleague from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania \nand the Senator from Iowa for their allowing me to bring this amendment \nto the floor at this time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1061\n\n (Purpose: To provide for limitations with respect to expenditures for \n                               abortions)\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1061.\n\n\n[[Page S8690]]\n\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 77, strike lines 6 through 11, and insert the \n     following (and redesignate the following section \n     accordingly):\n       Sec. 508. (a) None of the funds appropriated under this Act \n     shall be expended for any abortion.\n       (b) None of the funds appropriated under this Act shall be \n     expended for health benefits coverage that includes coverage \n     of abortion.\n       (c) The term ``health benefits coverage'' means the package \n     of services covered by a managed care provider or \n     organization pursuant to a contract or other arrangement.\n       Sec. 509. (a) The limitations established in the preceding \n     section shall not apply to an abortion--\n       (1) if the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or \n     incest; or\n       (2) in the case where a woman suffers from a physical \n     disorder, physical injury, or physical illness, including a \n     life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from \n     the pregnancy itself, that would, as certified by a \n     physician, place the woman in danger of death unless an \n     abortion is performed.\n       (b) Nothing in the preceding section shall be construed as \n     prohibiting the expenditure by a State, locality, entity, or \n     private person of State, local, or private funds (other than \n     a State's or locality's contribution of medicaid matching \n     funds) for abortion services or coverage of abortion by \n     contract or other arrangement.\n       (c) Nothing in the preceding section shall be construed as \n     restricting the ability of any managed care provider or \n     organization from offering abortion coverage or the ability \n     of a State or locality to contract separately with such a \n     provider for such coverage with State funds (other than a \n     State's or locality's contribution of medicaid matching \n     funds).\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, as a result of this amendment having \nbeen agreed to by both sides, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there debate on the amendment? If not, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1061) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to \nhave updated our appropriations legislation so that the traditional \nHyde amendment, which forbids and prohibits the utilization of Federal \nfunds in abortions, could be a part of what we are doing as it relates \nto HMO's. Government's role is to help people to respond to their \nhighest and best in life. However, I don't believe the highest and best \nutilization of Federal funding would be to fund the destruction of \nchildren in this country. For a long time, the Congress of the United \nStates has agreed that Federal funds would not be used in conducting \nabortions.\n  Yet, as developments transpire in health care, and as we change from \none sort of service delivery system to another, old policies might need \nclarification to make sure that we do not change the prohibition on \nFederal funding for abortions. Let me explain.\n  Twenty-one years ago, Congressman Henry Hyde offered an amendment to \nthe then Labor-HEW bill to ban Federal funding of abortions. Every year \nsince then, Congress has adopted that amendment. While there is \nsubstantial disagreement in America over the practice of abortion--very \nsubstantial disagreement--there has never been majority support in this \nbody for Federal funding of abortions. As a matter of fact, there has \nbeen substantial agreement that we should not force Americans to pay \nwith their Federal tax dollars for elective abortions.\n  Many individuals simply feel that as a matter of conscience, they \nshould not be participants in the destruction of unborn lives. I happen \nto be one of those individuals.\n  The opposition to Federal funding for abortion has been so consistent \nin Congress and in America that normally the Hyde amendment is just \nincluded in Labor-HHS appropriations bills and passed with no \ndiscussion. In fact, that traditional Hyde amendment is in the bill \nwhich we are debating today. However, after 21 years, the language \nneeds to be clarified, and I say ``clarified'' because we are not \nexpanding it nor weakening it, we are just making its meaning crystal \nclear.\n  To keep up with rapidly changing health care delivery modifications \nin Medicaid, and to prevent misinterpretations of the life-of-the-\nmother exception, a technical change to the Hyde amendment is necessary \nif the amendment is to continue to prevent Federal tax dollars from \nsubsidizing elective abortions. Such a subsidy would be a mandate on \nthe U.S. taxpayers to pay for elective abortions. It would literally be \nan affront to the American people to take their money and demand that \nit be used to destroy unborn children. Such a Federal taxpayer subsidy \nwould further sear the American conscience. It would offend the moral \nsensitivity of a great many Americans.\n  The Hyde amendment in its current form may allow such subsidies to \noccur in today's health care environment. Just as other laws have had \nto be tweaked to function appropriately with HMO's, so does the Hyde \namendment.\n  The Medicaid Program has traditionally been a fee-for-service health \ncare delivery system, and the Hyde amendment was written with that kind \nof system in mind. Under the system, it was relatively easy for the \nGovernment to block any utilization of Federal tax resources for \nsubsidizing abortion.\n  However, as the Medicaid structure is rapidly changing, many States \nare experimenting with delivery systems such as managed care, in which \nFederal funds are used to help pay for premiums for complete benefit \npackages instead of reimbursing for specific procedures after the fact.\n  According to HCFA, 9 percent of Medicaid patients were served in \nmanaged care plans in 1991. By 1996, that figure had risen to 40 \npercent, and it is important to make sure that those health care \npackages, which are purchased with Federal resources, do not include \nthe destruction of children in elective abortions. The use of Medicaid \nmanaged care is expected to continue to increase in the future, and \nthere is a legitimate concern that since the Federal Government no \nlonger receives billings for specific medical services under these \nmanaged care contracts, but simply pays for a portion of the overall \npremium, that some States might allow coverage of abortion on demand \nwith these federally funded contracts.\n  For example, under a fee-for-service structure, we would never allow \na bill from a provider to be paid for an elective abortion. However, \nwhen you are paying for medical services in advance in a lump sum to an \norganization like an HMO, and in return for that lump sum they are \nmeeting the medical needs of individuals, you don't get individual \nbills. So there would be no way to make sure that you weren't paying \nfor elective abortions in such a setting, absent the clarifications \nwhich we are placing in the law today.\n  Federal subsidy of elective abortions has never been the intent of \nCongress. The amendment which we have adopted today will make sure that \nwe continue to state with clarity that, regardless of the method of \npayment for Medicaid services, Federal resources are not to be used to \ndestroy the lives of unborn children in elective abortions.\n  How will this new change apply in practice? Federal funds are \ncurrently used to pay the premium or capitation fees to enroll Medicaid \npatients in managed care plans. Without any accountability to the \nFederal Government, those plans could routinely provide abortion \nalongside other benefits as part of their complete packages. The HMO \ngets an amount of money. It provides a complete package of health care \nservice. Technically, under this payment structure, the Federal funds \nare never used to pay for a particular service or a particular \nabortion, but, in practice, they could be used to subsidize abortions \nbeyond those permitted by the Hyde amendment. To prevent this from \nhappening, today we have updated the Hyde amendment to specify that \nStates may not use Federal money to purchase health care coverage that \nincludes abortion coverage.\n  Precedent exists for clarifying such a Federal funding limitation. \nCongress already considered this indirect funding situation when it \ngave almost unanimous approval to similar language in the Assisted \nSuicide Funding Restriction Act which Senator Dorgan and I introduced \nearlier this year. President Clinton signed this legislation on April \n30, so we have an existing law on the books that deals with this issue. \nThe Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act stated that no funds could \nbe appropriated for the purpose\n\n[[Page S8691]]\n\nof paying, directly or indirectly, for health benefit coverage for \nassisted suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing. We are using similar \nhealth benefits coverage language in this bill.\n  In the abortion context itself, we have precedent, in that a similar \nprovision was included in the so-called kid care legislation passed in \nthe reconciliation legislation which the President signed on August 5. \nCongressional leaders and the administration negotiated this language, \nwhich the Senate approved by a vote of 85 to 15.\n  Also, similar language on abortion funding was approved by the 104th \nCongress without controversy as a part of Medicaid revisions in the \nfiscal year 1996 OBRA bill which the President vetoed for reasons \nunrelated to this issue.\n  It is important to point out that we should not have the wrong \nincentives in our Medicaid Program, and it is true that it is cheaper \nto abort a child than it is to care for the mother through the \npregnancy and to deliver the child. I would be very leery about having \na system where the Federal Government provided an amount of money to an \nHMO which, having a financial incentive to do the cheaper thing, aborts \nthe child rather than encouraging the mother to have the child and \nprovide for delivery. And similarly, I have serious reservations about \nthe potential for assisted suicide, where the HMO could deliver lethal \ndrugs to a patient and, as a result, reduce the cost of doing business. \nWe want to have incentives to life and incentives to health, especially \nfor HMO's who might otherwise be tempted by financial situations not to \nencourage individuals to fight the fight for life.\n  Whenever the lives of unborn children are destroyed, I believe there \nis a toll on the American conscience, and I think it is substantial. \nWhen Government provides an opportunity for abortion with Federal \nfunds, we certainly find ourselves in a serious situation where the \nmoral fabric of the country would be stretched, if not permanently \ntorn. I am pleased today that the Senate has agreed to say that we \nshould not provide the opportunity for elective abortions to be funded \nby Federal resources, even in the HMO setting.\n  In each such instance where Government is making a judgment, it needs \nto make a judgment that favors life, that respects the lives of \nchildren, that provides for the dignity of the lives of older Americans \nas well. Any time we unduly disregard and devalue life, we have carved \nsomething important out of the American personality.\n  If we are to indelibly stamp the next century with American values, \nthe values of opportunity and freedom, as we have in this century, if \nwe are to be a leader in the world, as we have in this century--and \nthere are hundreds of millions of people that are free today around the \nglobe because we have been strong and we have been free and we have \nbeen dedicated to freedom--we need all of our resources, we need the \nmoral fabric of America, and we cannot destroy it or unduly sear the \nconscience of Americans by requiring the payment for elective abortions \nout of Federal tax dollars.\n  I say as well that we need our children. As we look to the next \ncentury, America will not survive without our children. Destroying \nchildren is contradictory to preparing for the future.\n  I believe that the assault on the sanctity of life is a moral crisis \nand that any use of taxpayer funds to pay for such an assault and \nperpetuate the destruction of America's children would be disabling to \nthe moral compasses of all Americans.\n  When he wrote on slavery in America, Thomas Jefferson, the South's \nfirst and greatest President, confronted the great moral issue of his \ntime. Jefferson said of slavery, ``I tremble for my country when I \nreflect that God is just and that his justice cannot sleep forever.'' \nSometimes I tremble when I reflect on abortion's terrible toll on lives \nand the siphoning off of our moral indignation and our capacity to \nprepare for the next century.\n  I am pleased the Senate today has taken a very clear step in saying \nthere will be no Federal funding of elective abortions in the Medicaid \nHMO setting, just as we have for over 20 years provided that there \nwould be no Federal funding for elective abortions in Medicaid fee-for-\nservice programs.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank the managers of the bill.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment conforms the provisions of \nthe Hyde amendment, which were developed for fee-for-service, so that \nthe same limitations would apply on Medicaid, on managed care.\n  This has been a very controversial issue for many years and has taken \nup the attention of this Chamber and the House of Representatives. \nAfter many votes and a lot of deliberation and a lot of negotiations, \nthe Hyde amendment has been crafted in its existing form as it applies \nto fee-for-service, and this carries it forward to managed care.\n  I am advised that in the House of Representatives they have worked \nthrough this same amendment and have made the request, through their \nstaff, that we have it accepted here. We had intended to put it in a \nmanagers' package. I have conferred with my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Harkin, who is on the floor at the present time. The \ndistinguished Senator from Missouri discussed it with the managers and \nsought to offer it in the form that it has been offered and to make a \nstatement. I think that concludes the matter in a way that has existed \nfor many, many years as an accommodation of many complex and \nconflicting issues.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his \naccommodation in this respect. He is entirely correct; this extends the \nsame protections and the same regime of Federal funding to the HMO \nsetting that we have had in the fee-for-service setting, and it is \nappropriate that we extend the commitment of the Congress in this \nrespect.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, despite their many disagreements, \nsupporters of both the pro-life and pro-choice positions on abortion \nhave been able to agree on one fundamental point: American taxpayers \nshould not be forced to subsidize abortions. This is a consensus view \nof long standing.\n  Back in 1976, Congress first passed what has come to be called the \nHyde amendment. First introduced by Congressman Henry Hyde of Illinois, \nthis amendment prevents the use of Federal funds to pay for abortions. \nSpecifically, the Hyde amendment prevents Federal Medicaid \nreimbursement for abortion procedures, with certain exceptions. This \nprovision has proven effective without being excessively onerous.\n  Now, however, the nature of health care services is changing. \nTraditional fee-for-service Medicaid programs in many cases are giving \nway to managed care. Indeed, according to the Health Care Financing \nAdministration [HCFA], 40 percent of Medicaid recipients were served by \nmanaged care plans in 1996.\n  This surge in managed care requires that we alter the Hyde amendment \nlanguage to ensure that taxpayer dollars will continue to be protected \nfrom use in abortion procedures. This is necessary, Mr. President, \nbecause, under managed care delivery, Federal funds are used to help \npay premiums for complete benefits packages instead of reimbursing for \nspecific procedures.\n  I would like to thank Senator Ashcroft for offering an amendment that \nwould close this loophole. This updated language specifies that States \nmay not use Federal funds to purchase, in whole or in part, health care \npackages that include abortion coverage. States should be able to use \ntheir own separate funds to purchase additional abortion coverage.\n  Mr. President, this language represents no departure from our \nexisting policies. Rather, it is a measured attempt to maintain current \npolicies, regarding the use of Federal funds for abortion, in the face \nof changing circumstance. Similar language to that being proposed has \nbeen used already, in the Assisted Suicide Funding Restrictions Act, \nand in the Fiscal Year 1998 Budget Reconciliation Act.\n  This language is the product of a compromise reached by Congressman \nHyde and pro-choice Congresswoman Nita Lowey. It should, in my view, be \nnoncontroversial.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, Senator Harkin and I are now looking for \nbusiness. A solicitation, I believe, is appropriate under these \ncircumstances. As we had announced yesterday and today, it is our hope \nwe will finish this\n\n[[Page S8692]]\n\nbill today. We ask that any Senator who intends to offer an amendment \nto let us know by noon today.\n  There may be one amendment which we cannot complete today. That \ninvolves the limitation of funding on testing proposed by the \nadministration. As I had said earlier, Congressman Goodling has stated \npublicly his intention to offer such an amendment on the House \nappropriations bill. It had been suggested that a similar amendment be \noffered on this bill.\n  Secretary of Education Riley contacted Senator Harkin and I, and \nothers, yesterday on this subject. Senator Harkin and I, in \ncollaboration with our committee chairman, Senator Stevens, have \nscheduled a hearing tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock. So if that vote is \nto occur on the bill, it would occur after we have been informed on \nsome of the specifics of the administration's proposal.\n  So we are now looking for amendments.\n  In the absence of any Senator seeking recognition, Mr. President, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I will talk for just a few minutes on the bill before the \nSenate. Of course, we are talking about the Labor, HHS, Education bill, \none of the largest bills before the Senate. As a matter of fact, a \ntotal of about $270 billion of expenditure. Only about $80 billion of \nthat are we really discussing because that is discretionary. The rest \nare entitlements.\n  However, I do think it is illustrative of one of the things I feel \nvery strongly about, and that is the opportunity to have oversight on \nthe expenditure of large amounts of tax money, or small amounts for \nthat matter.\n  I want to make it clear that I will support this bill. I think the \nappropriations folks have worked hard on it. I have no particular \nquarrel with what they have done, but I want to make a point that it \nseems to me this system needs to be reviewed. The system needs to be \nchanged. I cannot think of another institution in the civilized world \nthat spends $270 billion annually and has no more oversight than we do \nin the U.S. Congress. We have a remedy for that. We think we ought to \ngo to a biannual budget so that we would do this on a 2-year basis, \nwhich has some advantages. It allows the agencies to know what their \nfunds will be for a longer period of time. But more importantly, in \nthis instance it allows the Congress to have some oversight of the \nefficiency of the spending of these dollars.\n  For example, Mr. President, we are talking here about drug abuse \nprevention and treatment programs, $2.8 billion. I am for that. We \ncertainly need drug abuse prevention and treatment programs. But how \nare they working? Is the $2.7 billion giving us the kind of results we \nhoped it would? I do not think we know that. Now, certainly there is \nsome oversight.\n  We are also talking about Head Start, $4.3 billion for Head Start. I \nam a fan of Head Start. I think it is a program that brings young \npeople, in their early formative ages, into a position of having some \nhope, to help form their lives. Is it doing the job? Are we spending \nthe money as efficiently as we might? Are the dollars going to the \npeople that really need the help? I do not know that. I do not know \nthat.\n  Job Corps; I am not a particular fan of Job Corps. Nevertheless, we \nare spending $1.3 billion on Job Corps. What are the results? What are \nwe doing? Who is being helped? Is the help getting there? What is the \nadministrative cost and the overhead?\n  It seems to me those are things that we ought to be as interested in \nas we are in providing funding for the programs, and I think taxpayers \nare entitled to have that kind of oversight.\n  Individuals for Disabilities Education, IDEA. I am very, very \nimpressed with that. My wife is a special ed teacher. I was chairman of \nthe Disabilities Council in Wyoming. There is nothing more important. \nBut the question is, are we spending the money as well as we might? I \nfind some administrators in schools who say, ``Look, we have to change \nthis or we will never be able to afford the kinds of services for the \nhandicapped because we are always in court,'' and we do everything to \navoid courts.\n  If that is the case, it seems to me we ought to take a long look at \nwhat is happening to the bucks. Who are they going to? Are they as \nefficient as they possibly could be? Are the regulatory constraints \nsomething that disallow the efficient spending of this money?\n  With respect to the Government Performance and Results Act, which I \nalso support and think may have some merit, this is to improve the \nmanagement of Federal agencies, to require emphasis on planning, \nhopefully on results. Planning, I hope has in it measurable activities \nso we can see if we are making progress. Here is what the committee \nsays: ``We were encouraged the Federal agencies are making an effort to \nfulfill their requirements.'' Frankly, Mr. President, that is not good \nenough--we are hopeful they are making an effort to fulfill the \nrequirements. Give me a break. We are spending $280 billion, $70 \nbillion on the things we are talking about here in discretionary \nspending.\n  Let me make it clear one more time that I am not opposed to these \nideas. These are programs we need to have but we also need to have \noversight. We need to make as sure as we can, as the U.S. Congress, \nthat those dollars are producing the best results that we possibly can.\n  I hope we will take a long look--I think we should--at the idea of \nbiannual budgeting, and give us an opportunity to have oversight. The \nauthorizing committee should, in fact, have the opportunity to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Would the distinguished Senator from Wyoming have the \ngoodness to remain on the floor for a moment--I know he has a party \nconference to go to--just to allow me to congratulate him on his \nremarks.\n  Two of the programs he mentioned, the Job Corps and Head Start, it \nhappens I was a member of the Kennedy-Johnson administration. I was an \nAssistant Secretary of Labor and was on the group that put together the \nEconomic Opportunity Act in 1964 which led to Head Start and to the Job \nCorps. These are not new initiatives. They go back now a third of a \ncentury. I didn't mean to think of myself as that ancient already.\n  It is the case, sir, that we have had very little evaluation, very \nlittle longitudinal evaluation, where we follow things over time--\npersons who entered the Job Corps in the 1960's will now be getting \ninto their own fifties--and what has been the result cumulative, one \nway or the other. This is not something very attractive to governments \nthat live on 2-year cycles, 4-year cycles and, at most, 6-year cycles, \nyet if we want to do something about these matters we ought to attend \nthem in exactly the mode the Senator spoke of. This can be done.\n  The mathematics, if you like, of evaluation have been very much in \nplace since the Civil Rights Act of 1964 authorized the Coleman study. \nIt was called an equality of educational opportunity in which we \nlearned great things which surprised us. We thought we knew all about \neducation in those days and we found out we knew very little. I am not \nsure we have learned much since.\n  I take the opportunity to thank the Senator from Wyoming for what he \nhas said, and I hope he will stay with the issue.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from \nNew York. I suspect there is nobody in this body who has the kind of \nbackground institutional knowledge about these programs as the Senator. \nI appreciate your comments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Moynihan and Mr. D'Amato pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1144 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/03/senate-section/article/S8685-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8692-S8693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The pending business is amendment 1056, \noffered by Senator Kyl of Arizona.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1056\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Kyl \namendment to the fiscal 1998 Labor, Health and Education appropriations \nbill, which would devastate an already underfunded Low-Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program. Although I am a strong supporter of the Pell \nGrant Program, which provides critical assistance and access for needy \nstudents, I cannot support the Kyl amendment, knowing that it will \nreduce the low-income fuel assistance limited funding.\n  I regret the Senator from Arizona has offered this amendment to \nreduce the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program in order to \nprovide an increase to the Pell Grant Program. I hope we can follow the \nHouse lead in this regard, by providing an increase in the Pell Grant \nProgram but without affecting the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram. The bottom line is LIHEAP provides invaluable assistance to \nlow-income and elderly households in America that must not be \nsacrificed. Make no mistake about it, this means-tested program is \nspecifically targeted to those who already are in desperate need of \nfinancial assistance. To be precise, according to the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, more than two-thirds of the households \nreceiving Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program assistance have \nannual incomes of less than $8,000 a year, and more than half have \nincomes below $6,000 a year.\n  While I believe that all programs must be asked to contribute their \nfair share in our efforts to balance the budget, it is worth noting \nthat the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program has already taken \nmore than its fair share of budget cuts in recent years. Overall, the \nfunding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program has fallen \nconsistently and dramatically since 1985. In fiscal year 1985, the \nprogram received $2.1 billion. This year, it will receive $1 billion. \nIn real terms, this represents a cut of more than 65 percent. Yet, \ndespite this dramatic cut, the Senator from Arizona is proposing we \nfurther reduce this critically important but limited low-income \nassistance funding by an additional $528 million, or 53 percent of its \nalready paltry budget.\n  Furthermore, we should not be proposing a cut to a program that is \nalready woefully underfunded and serves only a minority of its eligible \nrecipients. Because of past spending cuts, LIHEAP now provides benefits \nto only 20 percent of all eligible households. This means that 80 \npercent of America's households meet the income qualifications to \nreceive benefits, but there is simply not enough money to provide \nassistance to them all. Needless to say, this proposed $528 million \nreduction represents a very real risk of keeping many low-income \nfamilies from being able to heat their homes in the winters ahead, even \nas it eviscerates a program that has already contributed more than its \nfair share to deficit reduction.\n  It is also worth noting that even for those families that do receive \nLow-Income Home Energy Assistance Program benefits, it is not a very \nhigh sum. In my home State of Maine, the average benefit last year was \n$308. In the midst of a severely cold winter, that $308 was the only \nway that 33,000 low-income and elderly Mainers were able to heat their \nhomes. So, although a $528 million reduction may seem small in the \noverall budget of the U.S. Government, and $308 may not sound like much \nto many people, it means a great deal to the residents of my State who \ndo not want to be forced this winter into the position of choosing \nbetween heat and food.\n  The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program has already taken more \nthan its fair share of reductions since its inception back in 1981, and \nsimply cannot afford any further reductions in this very critical \nprogram. Any additional cut in this already underfunded program \nrepresents a very serious risk to low-income and elderly households in \nmy State of Maine and all the cold weather regions of this country that \nrely on this very important, essential program.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the Kyl \namendment and adopting the approach that has been taken by the House \nthat provides for increased support for the Pell Grant Program but \nwithout reducing LIHEAP that is so critical to many people in my State \nand so many other States who are located in cold weather areas of our \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to begin by thanking Senator \nSpecter and the members of the Labor, Education, HHS appropriations \nsubcommittee for bringing this bill to the floor.\n  This bill contains a much needed funding increase for the National \nInstitutes of Health. Earlier this year I joined with 97 of my \ncolleagues in this Senate body in voting for a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment calling for a doubling of NIH funding over the next 5 years. \nThe bill that we have in front of us today represents a substantial \nstep forward. It increases funding for NIH from $12.7 to $13.69 \nbillion. This funding, simply, Mr. President, will save lives.\n  There are two measures in this bill that I would like to call to the \nattention of my colleagues, and that I believe deserve special mention. \nEarlier this year I introduced, along with Senator Kennedy and Senator \nBond, a bill which would establish a pediatric research initiative \nwithin the Office of the Director of NIH. Senator Kennedy and I and \nSenator Bond, along with many sponsors of that bill, have worked hard \nto develop a proposal that we feel helps place appropriate emphasis on \npediatric research while at the same time supporting the scientific \njudgment so important to the success of NIH.\n  The value of this initiative really is without question. Research \nbreakthroughs to treat pediatric illnesses have been enormously \neffective both in reducing costs and, more important, in freeing young \nchildren from a lifetime of illness and disability. From vaccines to \ntreat polio to surfactant replacement to prevent respiratory distress \nsyndrome, research has saved hundreds of millions of dollars and \nimproved the lives of millions of children.\n  Recently, the Public Health and Safety Subcommittee of the Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee held a hearing on NIH reauthorization. During \nthe hearing, a distinguished panel of pediatric researchers from NIH \nand also from the private sector described some of the enormous \nopportunities that now exist for scientific progress in combating and \nin preventing diseases affecting children. Their testimony dramatically \nunderscored the critical need for additional emphasis and increased \nsupport for pediatric research.\n  Last year, the Labor, Education, and HHS appropriations subcommittee, \nchaired by Senator Specter, allocated $5 million as an initial \ndownpayment toward the pediatric research initiative. This year the \nappropriations subcommittee has allocated $20 million toward this \ninitiative. I personally thank Chairman Specter and the members of his \nsubcommittee for their continued commitment to pediatric research. By \nrecognizing the critical need to encourage and promote pediatric \nresearch, the committee has really helped ensure the next generation of \nAmericans grows up to be healthy, productive members of our society.\n  Mr. President, the second provision I would like to talk about in \nthis bill is the funding for substance abuse and mental health \nservices. Without the provision contained in this bill, some States \nwould have faced massive cuts in the funding for their programs to help \npeople with substance abuse and/or mental health problems. My own State \nof Ohio would have faced a devastating funding cut of more than 20 \npercent, our neighboring State to the north, Michigan, would have \nreceived a cut of 19 percent, and other States would have also been \nseriously hurt. Among the important programs threatened by these cuts \nwould have been the\n\n[[Page S8694]]\n\nagencies promoting early intervention with young people to help them \nfind alternatives to getting involved with drugs and crime. I have long \nbelieved that the problem of at-risk youth in this country is one for \nwhich an ounce of prevention truly is worth a pound of cure. The sooner \nwe can reach these young people, the better off we will be in our \nefforts to help them avoid the tragedy of lifetime addiction.\n  The SAMHSA provision contained in this bill averts the awful \nconsequences of the proposed funding cuts. It is a good measure and \ndeserves strong support of the entire U.S. Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, starting yesterday morning at 11 o'clock, \nin conjunction with scheduling from the majority leader, Senator Lott, \nand the ranking member on this subcommittee, Senator Harkin, we asked \nthat amendments be brought with the hope of concluding action on this \nbill today, and that all amendments be submitted, first, by the end of \nbusiness yesterday or no later than noon today. We have not had a great \ndeal of business.\n  The one exception would be an amendment which would deal with \nprohibiting Federal funding for testing, which the administration has \nin mind. Congressman Goodling had announced his intention to seek that \nkind of prohibition in the House.\n  There had been comments yesterday that someone would offer that kind \nof legislation on the Senate side. The distinguished presiding officer, \nSenator Judd Gregg, said, with a pointed finger, it was he. I don't \nwant to name names here, but I am prepared to identify those who are \nwilling to be identified.\n  I received a telephone call from the Secretary of Education, Richard \nRiley, yesterday afternoon, as did Senator Harkin and others. It seems \nto me that might be one matter we might put over until tomorrow and \nschedule the hearing at 9 o'clock to find the specifics as to whether \nthat ought to be done. There is a sense that testing, in general, would \nbe a good idea, but maybe it ought not to be done by the Federal \nGovernment. There is a great deal of concern about having the Federal \nGovernment move into the field of education. So we are going to move \nahead at that time.\n  Mr. President, I intend to offer an amendment later this afternoon \ncalling for a sense of the Senate for the appointment of independent \ncounsel. Although that is obviously not germane to an appropriations \nbill on Labor, Health, Human Services and Education, it is a practice \nin the Senate, with some repetition, to offer extraneous amendments, \ncertainly sense-of-the-Senate resolutions.\n  I had stated my intention to deal with this issue last July 24 and \nspoke extensively on the Senate floor on the appropriations bill \npending at that time about my concern that independent counsel ought to \nbe appointed based on the state of the record. Then when it was \napparent that would tie up that bill, and the majority leader and the \nminority leader both wanted to move ahead, I said on July 25 that I \nwould not pursue this sense-of-the-Senate resolution at that time and \nwaited an additional month.\n  I do believe that we urgently need appointment of independent counsel \nat the present time. I base that judgment on a series of letters which \nhave been written by a variety of Members of Congress to the Attorney \nGeneral, and she has declined to do so--a formal letter written by the \nmajority members of the Judiciary Committee calling on the Attorney \nGeneral to appoint independent counsel, and she has declined to do so.\n  Then we had extensive hearings last April 30 on the Judiciary \nCommittee where I questioned Attorney General Reno about the \nwithholding of information from the President on national security \nmatters, which appear to me to be a highly questionable thing to do, \nand that the President was publicly quoted saying that those national \nsecurity matters had been withheld from him and he thought he should \nhave been given access to those matters.\n\n  In our constitutional Government it is my judgment that the rule is \nplain, that those are matters for the President as long as he is the \nPresident. There are ways to alter his status as President, but as long \nas he is the President, it is not up to an appointed Attorney General \nto make the decision that the President does not get national security \ninformation because, as the Attorney General testified, he was a \npotential suspect in a pending investigation. The damage about such a \ndisclosure to a potential subject, in my view, is far, far less \ndangerous than having national security information withheld from the \nPresident of the United States.\n  But it did seem to me that in that context that if the matter was \nserious enough to withhold information from the President, that \ncertainly the independent counsel statute ought to be triggered. That \nis the statute which provides for an independent lawyer to come in and \nhandle the case where it involves certain levels of Federal Government \nenumerated officials such as the President and the Vice President and \nCabinet officers, especially in the context where Attorney General Reno \ntestified in her confirmation hearings about her view of the importance \nof independent counsel.\n  There is also the question about the advertisements. According to \nChief of Staff Leon Panetta, and also Dick Morris, the President's \npolitical adviser, advertisements had been edited, drafted, essentially \nwritten by the President himself. There would be no question that there \nwould be coordination in violation of the Federal statute prohibiting \ncoordination if those in fact were advocacy commercials. We went \nthrough the commercials with the Attorney General. This was done on \nboth sides. But the ones that were edited by the President extolled the \nPresident's virtues and decried his opponent's alleged failings, but \nfell short of saying vote for x or vote against y. By any reasonable \nstandard, those were advocacy commercials, but they were viewed as \nbeing instead issue commercials and did not constitute a violation of \nthe statute which prohibits coordination.\n  Well, that plus a great many other factors, I think, have set the \nstage for the need for independent counsel. We have had disclosures in \nthis morning's Washington Post about funds being raised by the Vice \nPresident which were hard money and not soft money. The Attorney \nGeneral had previously said that if it is soft money it is not a \ncontribution under the Federal election laws, a judgment or \ninterpretation which is inexplicable, in my opinion. It is a \ncontribution nonetheless.\n  Hundreds of millions of dollars were put into the campaigns on both \nsides, Democrats and Republicans. But now there has been the forceful \nallegation made, information that a good bit of the money raised by the \nVice President was hard money, and that would take away the last \nvestige as to what Attorney General Reno had said justified her refusal \nto appoint independent counsel.\n  So it is my intention, Mr. President, to call for a vote on this \namendment that I send to the desk at this time so that it may be filed \nand reviewed by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Later this \nafternoon I do intend to offer it, and in fact had thought I would \noffer it when I sought recognition. But I see my colleague, Senator \nDorgan, has come to the floor. I understand he intends to offer an \namendment of his own. So I will defer offering this amendment at this \ntime, but I will speak about it to this extent, to put my colleagues on \nnotice that this issue will be on the floor at the conclusion of the \nDorgan amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor so my colleague, Senator \nDorgan, may proceed.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins).

Madam President, I rise to offer an amendment.\n  I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe laid aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1068.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 30, line 21, strike ``$1,531,898,000.'' and insert \n     ``$1,539,898,000''.\n       On page 35, line 22, strike ``$211,500,000'' and insert \n     ``$203,500,000''.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that floor \nprivileges be granted to Jeff Hoffman of my staff.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator from \nPennsylvania allowing me to offer this amendment at this time. I \nappreciate the cooperation of the Senator from Pennsylvania and the \nSenator from Iowa for their work on this legislation. I am going to \ntalk just a bit about my amendment. Before I do, however, let me \ncommend both Senator Specter and Senator Harkin for the work they have \ndone on this piece of legislation.\n  My amendment specifically deals with funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and \nspecifically an interest I have in trying to provide additional \nresources for NHLBI to be used to provide funding vitally needed for \ncardiovascular disease research.\n  I am proposing $8 million be added to the Heart, Lung, and Blood \nInstitute that I hope would be used for that purpose. The offset is \nfrom a corresponding reduction in the NIH buildings and facilities \naccount. I believe that both the chairman and the ranking member, at \nthe conclusion of my comments, will accept this amendment and for that \nI am grateful.\n  It is undoubtedly true, as people watch the proceedings of the U.S. \nSenate, that many of us come to the floor of the Senate to talk about \nlegislation that we think is necessary based on our personal \nexperiences and observations. That has certainly been true with respect \nto a couple of issues I have worked on, including cardiovascular \ndisease research.\n  Madam President, I have a very personal interest in this, as others \ndo. I have lost a daughter to heart disease. I have another daughter \nwho has a heart defect that we hope, God willing, will not need surgery \nin the future. But I have spent enough time in cardiologists' offices \nand I have spent enough time talking about cardiovascular disease to \nunderstand that we must continue to substantially increase funding for \nresearch on cardiovascular disease.\n  I have been involved, along with Senator Frist, as a Senate cochair \nof the Congressional Heart and Stroke Coalition to try to provide \nadditional attention to the issue of heart disease and stroke and the \nneed for greater research into these diseases.\n  Many Americans are unaware of the extent and scope of heart disease \nand stroke, even though virtually all of us has a friend or loved one \nwho has been affected by cardiovascular disease, so I would like to \nshare some startling facts.\n  Heart disease has been this country's No. 1 killer since 1919 for \nboth men and women.\n  Stroke continues to be the No. 3 killer in this country and the \nleading cause of disability in America.\n  One in five Americans, more than 57 million people, suffer from one \nor more types of cardiovascular disease, including close to 14 million \nliving with symptomatic coronary heart disease.\n  One in two women will eventually die of heart disease or stroke.\n  About one-sixth of cardiovascular disease deaths are among people \nunder the age of 65.\n  In 1979 there were 1.2 million cardiovascular operations and \nprocedures performed in this country. That number climbed to 4.65 \nmillion in 1994, close to a fourfold increase.\n  The number of Americans suffering from congestive heart failure has \ngrown to about 5 million, with hospital discharges rising from 377,000 \nin 1979 to 874,000 in 1994.\n  More Americans die from heart attack and stroke each year than from \nAIDS, cancer, and diabetes combined. Let me repeat that because I think \nit is important. More Americans die from heart attack and stroke each \nyear than from AIDS, cancer, and diabetes combined.\n  I do not come to the floor of the Senate to in any way suggest that \nwe ought to enhance research funding on one disease at the expense of \ncritically needed research funding for others. I have supported \nsubstantial research for AIDS, supported efforts to improve research \nand treatment of diabetes and cancer. In fact, I have supported a \nsubstantial increase in funding for the National Institutes of Health \nand I voted earlier this year to double funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health over the next five years. I think this would be a \nwonderful investment for our country.\n  I have become increasingly concerned, however, with what has been \nhappening with respect to the amount of money spent on heart disease \nresearch. Even with the significant increases that Congress has been \ngiving the National Institutes of Health over the past decade, funding \nfor heart disease research specifically has simply not kept pace. In \nfact, heart disease research at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood \nInstitute has decreased by 4.8 percent in constant dollars over the \nlast decade, while the NIH overall budget has increased by 31 percent \nin constant dollars.\n  A step toward rectifying this concern was taken this year. For that I \ncommend Senator Specter and Senator Harkin. They have provided in this \nbill a $99.4 million increase for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood \nInstitute, the third largest dollar increase among the NIH institutes. \nBut even with this increase, if we look beyond the surface, we can see \nthat, without my amendment, the funding for cardiovascular disease \nresearch would continue to decrease relative to the overall budget.\n  The $8 million that my amendment would add would bring the National \nHeart, Lung, and Blood Institute budget up to the same 7.5-percent \nlevel of increase as the overall budget at the National Institutes of \nHealth. It is my hope that this funding would be devoted to \ncardiovascular disease research.\n  It is interesting to visit the Bethesda campus of the National \nInstitutes of Health. I encourage my colleagues to do so. There are \nwonderful men and women working there doing remarkable, breathtaking \nresearch on a wide range of issues. I have talked to physicians doing \nresearch in the area of cardiovascular disease and what they are doing \nis remarkable. It has already saved lives and can save even more lives \nwith additional resources.\n  We now routinely see people with advanced heart disease with symptoms \nthat in previous decades would have caused death. Today, these patients \nare able to undergo procedures and operations that allow them to \ncontinue to lead productive, active lives. These advances are the \nwonderful result of an investment in research. We can do much, much \nmore.\n\n  I said I don't want to decrease research funding for other diseases. \nIn fact, I would like to substantially increase the amount of funding \nfor the NIH generally, far above its current level, because I think the \nrewards for the people in our country and around the world would be \nsubstantial.\n  It should be noted, however, that heart disease and stroke receive \none-twentieth of the research funding per death of AIDS, cancer, and \ndiabetes combined. Now if you divide the amount spent on research into \nthe number of people who are dying from various diseases, it is clear \nthat the amount of research funding invested in cardiovascular disease \nis not keeping pace. That is why I offer this amendment.\n  This amendment has the strong support of the American Heart \nAssociation, the Association of Black Cardiologists, Mended Hearts, \nInc., and the\n\n[[Page S8696]]\n\nNational Coalition for Heart and Stroke Research. I ask unanimous \nconsent that letters from these organizations in support of my \namendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   American Heart Association,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 29, 1997.\n     Hon. Byron Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: On behalf of the 57.5 million \n     Americans suffering from heart attack, stroke and other \n     cardiovascular diseases, the American Heart Association \n     strongly supports your amendment to the Labor-HHS-Education \n     Appropriation bill. The AHA commends your leadership and \n     initiative in offering an amendment to increase the funding \n     pool for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute \n     (NHLBI) by $8 million, targeted specifically for additional \n     heart and stroke-related research. Cardiovascular diseases, \n     America's No. 1 killer and a leading cause of disability, \n     suffer from disproportionately low research funding.\n       As various indicators show, there has been a dramatic \n     increase in the prevalence of heart disease and stroke, with \n     an unparalleled cost to our society that threatens our \n     future. More than 1 in 5 Americans of all ages suffer from \n     heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases. These \n     diseases consume about 1 of 6 health care dollars, with a \n     price tag of an estimated $259 billion in medical expenses \n     and lost productivity in 1997. Heart diseases and stroke \n     represent 4 of the top 5 hospital costs to the health care \n     system for all payers, excluding childbirth and its \n     complications, and 4 of the top 5 Medicare hospital costs.\n       In constant dollars from FY 1986 to FY 1996 funding for the \n     NHLBI extramural Heart Program decreased 5.5 percent. In a \n     recent nationwide survey 79 percent and 77 percent of \n     respondents support more federal funding for heart and stroke \n     research, respectively.\n       Our government's response to the heart disease and stroke \n     problem today will help define the health and well being of \n     Americans in the next century. Now is the time to capitalize \n     on progress in understanding cardiovascular diseases when \n     breakthroughs are on the horizon. Promising research \n     opportunities will result in better treatment, prevention and \n     even cures for heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular \n     diseases. A significant increase in research funding will \n     reduce premature death, improve quality of life, cut health \n     care costs and enhance America's scientific competitiveness.\n       Thank you for your consistent leadership in the battle \n     against heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular \n     diseases.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         Martha Hill, Ph.D., R.N.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Association of Black\n\n\n                                          Cardiologists, Inc.,\n\n                                   Atlanta, GA, September 2, 1997.\n     Hon. Byron Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: The Association of Black Cardiologists \n     (ABC), is pleased that you have offered amendment S. 1061, \n     the FY 1998 Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill to \n     increase resources for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood \n     Institute (NHLB) by $8 million, targeted specifically for \n     additional heart and stroke-related research. The Association \n     of Black Cardiologists (ABC), enthusiastically supports your \n     amendment. Our 600 plus members vigorously support this \n     amendment, and believe it is vital to the health of our \n     constituents.\n       Despite progress, heart attack, stroke and other \n     cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of death in \n     the United States and a main cause of disability. Over 57 \n     million Americans . . . more than 1 in 5, are afflicted by \n     one or more cardiovascular diseases. It is even severe \n     contact more in African Americans. Heart attack, stroke and \n     other cardiovascular diseases will cost this nation an \n     estimated $259 billion in medical expenses and loss of work \n     place productivity in 1997.\n       An increase in research funding for NHLB heart and stroke-\n     related research is critical to reduce premature death, \n     improve quality of life, cut health care costs and enhance \n     America's economic competitiveness. An overwhelming number of \n     respondents in a recent nationwide survey supports more \n     federal funding of heart and stroke research, 79% and 77% \n     respectively. However, in FY 1986 constant dollars, funding \n     for the NHLBI Heart Program decreased 5.5% from FY 1986 to FY \n     1996.\n       Promising scientific opportunities in the battle against \n     cardiovascular diseases could be realized with more resources \n     for research. This is the time to capitalize on the progress \n     in understanding cardiovascular diseases.\n       The Association of Black Cardiologists applauds your \n     leadership in the fight against these killer diseases and \n     commends your initiative in offering this amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       B. Waine Kong, Ph.D., M.D.,\n     Chief Operating Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      The Mended Hearts, Inc.,\n\n                                    Dallas, TX, September 2, 1997.\n     Hon. Byron Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: Mended Hearts is a national voluntary \n     organization of people who have heart disease, their spouses, \n     family members, caregivers and medical professionals. Mended \n     Hearts actively supports your floor amendment to the FY 1998 \n     Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related \n     Agencies Appropriation bill that increases the funding pool \n     for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) by \n     $8 million, targeted specifically for additional heart and \n     stroke-related research.\n       About 20 million Americans of all ages live with the \n     ramifications of heart disease. Of this group, nearly 13.7 \n     million, including about 7 million under age 60, live with \n     the effects of heart attack and about 5 million suffer from \n     congestive heart failure, the leading cause of \n     hospitalization for Americans age 65 and older. Heart defects \n     are the most common birth defect, the major cause of birth \n     defects-related infant deaths and a considerable cause of \n     childhood disability.\n       The prevalence of heart disease is rising rapidly, with a \n     tremendous economic toll on the economy of the United States. \n     For example, in 1994 there were 4.7 million cardiovascular \n     operations and procedures, compared to 1.2 million in 1979--a \n     fourfold increase.\n       It is estimated that heart attack, stroke and other \n     cardiovascular diseases will cost this nation $259 billion in \n     medical expenses and lost output in 1997. Despite the \n     seriousness and overwhelming costs of these diseases, in \n     constant dollars from FY 1986 to FY 1996 funding for the \n     NHLBI Heart Program decreased 5.5 percent.\n       On behalf of the 24,000 members of Mended Hearts in 220 \n     chapters nationwide, I commend your championship and \n     leadership in the battle against heart disease. Your \n     amendment will have a far reaching impact on the main cause \n     of death in the United States--heart disease. Promising \n     research opportunities for innovative cost-effective \n     approaches to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of \n     heart disease can be developed with these needed resources.\n       Thank you for your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Charles Christmas,\n     National President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            National Coalition for\n\n\n                                    Heart and Stroke Research,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 2, 1997.\n     Hon.

These diseases place a heavy burden on \n     America's health care system, absorbing about 1 of 6 health \n     care dollars. Excluding childbirth and its complications, \n     heart diseases and stroke make up 4 of the top 5 hospital \n     costs for all players, and 4 of the top 5 Medicare hospital \n     costs.\n       Despite progress, heart attack, stroke and other \n     cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of death in \n     the United States and a main cause of disability.\n       An increase in research funding for NHLBI heart and stroke-\n     related-research is critical to reduce premature death, \n     improve quality of life, cut health care costs and enhance \n     America's economic competitiveness.

Madam President, it is my hope that in some small way, \nwith this small step, a researcher will now unlock one more mystery of \nhow the human heart works.\n  I mentioned the wonderful discoveries that are made through research \nand the wonderful treatments that are provided in our hospitals in the \narea of cardiology, and yet there is so much we still do not know. \nThose of us who have waited through heart surgery with members of our \nfamily know that when you talk to the cardiovascular surgeons they will \ntell you that there are times when they simply don't know what has \ncaused this or that condition.\n\n[[Page S8697]]\n\n  It seems to me more and more research can unlock those mysteries and \ngive us the opportunity to save more and more lives in this country \nthat otherwise would be lost to this insidious enemy called heart \ndisease.\n  With that, I thank very much the chairman and the ranking member and \nask that my amendment be favorably considered. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nNorth Dakota for offering this amendment. I agree with him about the \nimportance of additional funding for pulmonary research, for heart \nresearch. It is a major killer in the United States. We ought to be \ndoing everything we can to investigate, find cures and implement them.\n  The amendment which has been offered carries an offset on \nadministration and it has been modified from what the Senator from \nNorth Dakota had originally suggested, which would have been \nearmarking, which poses problems, because we do not earmark but instead \nleave that designation to the National Institutes of Health so we do \nnot have excessive management or micromanagement by the Congress as to \nwhat the NIH funds must have. I think Senator Dorgan made a forceful \nstatement that those funds ought to be directed in that way, and the \nofficials at NIH will have that before them. I am confident they will \nmake every effort they can to carry out the intent with which my \ncolleague has expressed here.\n  We have vast sums of money at NIH. We are increasing it. It is $952 \nmillion now, and is up to $13.7 billion. Notwithstanding all that \nfunding, there are many applications which are not granted. This one \nexpresses what the Senator from North Dakota thinks ought to be done.\n  I am advised Senator Harkin is off the floor now attending a \ncommittee meeting and necessarily absent, but I am advised by his staff \nthat Senator Harkin finds this amendment acceptable, as do I, as \nmanager for the majority. We accept the amendment.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1068) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1070\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent the pending amendment be set \naside, and I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1070.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, insert after the last section \n     (preceding the short title) the following new section:\n       Sec.   . (a) Prohibition of Funds for National Testing in \n     Reading and Mathematics.--None of the funds made available in \n     this Act may be used to develop, plan, implement, or \n     administer any national testing program in reading or \n     mathematics.\n       (b) Exceptions.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to the \n     following:\n       (1) The National Assessment of Educational Progress carried \n     out under sections 411 through 413 of the Improving America's \n     Schools Act of 1994 (20 U.S.C. 9010-9012).\n       (2) The Third International Math and Science Study (TIMSS).\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, as the excellent chairman of the labor \nsubcommittee of the Appropriations Committee mentioned earlier, there \nis a pending issue which is of considerable significance which has \narisen in the last few weeks as a result of the question of how we are \ngoing to pursue national testing. The chairman of the committee has \nmentioned he would hope this issue, from the standpoint of an amendment \nto the bill, would be taken up for final vote tomorrow sometime. I am \ncertainly agreeable to that.\n  However, it had been my intention, along with Senator Coats, to offer \nan amendment today on this issue, and in talking it over with the \nchairman he suggested we offer the amendment and then hold the vote \nuntil tomorrow. That certainly is an approach which I am perfectly \nhappy to follow.\n  This amendment, which is basically directed at codifying what we \nunderstand now to be the President's position--and we say ``now'' \nbecause the President's position on national testing appears to have \nundergone a transformation at some fairly high level of significance. \nIt reflects that decision by the President to no longer push national \ntesting as something that should be controlled and directed by the \nDepartment of Education but rather to have national testing to the \nextent it be developed by independent agencies. Using the term \n``independent,'' I mean agencies which are independent of the Federal \nGovernment and which are not under the Federal Government or even under \nthe Federal Government's control through the use of the appropriations \nprocess.\n  Why is this important? There are a large number of us involved in the \nissue of reforming education who feel very strongly that national \ntesting makes sense, but to have it controlled by, designed by or in \nany way managed by the Department of Education here in Washington does \nnot make sense. That would be a fundamental flaw.\n  We are encouraged, and we think it is appropriate that the President \nappears to have come to this conclusion himself over the weekend. \nAlthough his initial reaction was to have the Department of Education \nrun this type of a national testing program, his decision now is to \nmove it to the private sector and allow the private sector and the \nprivate nonprofits to develop the proper testing standards.\n  Why is this important? Because the issue of national testing is \nimportant at a variety of different levels. In a positive way it is \nimportant because it will give communities an opportunity to compare \nhow their students are doing with other students, to compare how their \nschools are doing with other schools, compare how their educators are \ndoing with other educators across the country. That is very \nsignificant.\n  It is not unique, national testing. We have in this country one of \nthe most expansive national testing programs probably anywhere in the \nworld called the SAT test. It comes at the end of the school system, \nthe end of the educational experience, at least as far as elementary \nand secondary schools are concerned, and juniors and seniors and \nsometimes sophomores, students in their high school years, will take \ntests. They have the SAT, the SAT 2, they have achievements, they have \nadvanced placement tests, a whole series of tests which they take, \nquite a battery of tests. Anybody who has a child going through the SAT \nexperience understands its intensity and recognizes this is one heck of \na testing system which we have which is nationally driven which is, in \nfact, nationally directed, which is, in fact, nationally developed, and \nwhich is, in fact, a heck of a good system. I think the reason it \nworked so well is it has been energized and directed by the private \nsector of our country, not by the Federal Government.\n  The downside of national testing is that if it is done by the Federal \nGovernment, at the direction of the Federal Government, under the \ncontrol of the Federal Government or funded by the Federal Government, \nyou are stepping, in my opinion, and I think in the opinion of many of \nus who view education as a critical asset of the community, of the \nState, of people at the lowest level of government who have the right \nto control how their children's lives are determined in their school \nsystems rather than having it be controlled from Washington, those of \nus who view that education should be directed locally and not \nnationally, you are stepping on the slippery slope of once again the \nissue of national control over curriculum, national control over \ncontents, national control over teachers' standards in the educational \nsystem because a federally designed, federally paid for, federally \ncontrolled national educational testing system would be, in my opinion \nand I think the opinion of many people who view this issue and who have \nlooked at it for a while as I have, as being one of the first steps \ntoward a nationally directed curriculum, a nationally directed content \nin education, and a nationally directed standard for our teachers.\n\n[[Page S8698]]\n\n  That is something that I would most vehemently object to and have \nobjected to, and in fact when we went through Goals 2000, raising the \nissue of national curriculum was the core question. We amended that law \ndramatically from its initial structure so that it would not end up as \na national curriculum exercise.\n  Now that we have pushed forward onto the playing field a national \ntesting system, at something other than the end of your high school \nyears, a national testing system which will probably be targeted on the \nthird grade or the eighth grade or maybe both grades, to determine \ncompetency, especially in objective types of discipline such as \nmathematics and science, such a national testing system has to be \nentered into with some caution to be sure that we do not end up going \ndown the wrong path, that we use it for the purposes for which it \nshould be used, which is to give our local communities the capacity to \nevaluate how their local school systems are doing in educating their \nchildren--not use it with the capacity of taking away from our local \ncommunities the capacity to control their local school systems by \ntaking away control over curriculum or taking away control over \ncontent.\n  So this amendment is basically directed at saying it is not \nappropriate for the Department of Education to be an aggressive \nparticipant, a funded participant in the designing of a national \ntesting system. Rather, that should be left to the private or \nquasiprivate or nonprofit sector which presently does such a good job \nin areas such as SAT's.\n  The view, which was not the original view of the President and now is \nthe view of the President, is something which we congratulate him on \nchanging his position on and coming to a conclusion that is of that \nposition and which we want to support by passing this amendment.\n  Senator Coats and I have put this amendment together. It tracks what \nwas passed in the House, or what is being proposed in the House--I am \nnot sure it has been passed yet--by Representative Goodling from \nPennsylvania, chairman of the authorizing committee which deals with \neducation in the House.\n  I appreciate the courtesy of the chairman of the committee in \nallowing us to go forward with it and in his support in going forward \nwith it. We are certainly sensitive to his desire to have the vote \ntomorrow if there is to be a formal vote, if it is not adopted by \nagreement, which I hope would be because it does reflect, we believe, \nthe administration position.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I expect we will have a rather spirited \ndebate about this amendment, and we should have. I think this is an \ninteresting, timely, and important subject for the Senate at this \npoint. My understanding is that there will be lengthy debate and a \nhearing in the Senate tomorrow morning, followed by a vote tomorrow on \nthis subject.\n  This debate is not about developing some sort of enforced Federal \nstandard. Rather, this is a very important question about this \ncountry's educational system and whether parents, no matter where they \nlive, have an opportunity and the ability to measure how well their \nchildren are doing at two levels. Can they read at the fourth-grade \nlevel, and how do they read relative to other kids in this country, and \ncan they achieve basic proficiency in mathematics at the eighth-grade \nlevel?\n  We have some significant choices to make in this country on the \nsubject of education. No one that I know of suggests that we wrest the \ncontrol of educating our kids in the elementary and secondary schools \nfrom the local school boards. No one. That is where we make decisions \nabout how to educate our kids. But we do as a country have an \nobligation, I think, to begin asking the question: Should we not have \nsome basic standard of measurement to find out what our children are \nachieving in our schools to be able to measure community to community, \nschool to school, State to State? How are they doing? Are they able to \nread at the fourth grade level? Are they proficient in mathematics at \nthe eighth grade level?\n  I want to read a couple of comments as we begin.\n  Jim Barksdale, the CEO and president of Netscape Communications, one \nof the new communications companies in our country, and L. John Doerr, \na partner in the firm of Kleiner, Perkins, Caulfield & Byers, on behalf \nof 240 technology industry leaders in a bipartisan call for high \nnational education standards in reading and math, say this:\n\n       Every State should adopt high national standards, and by \n     1999, every State should test every fourth grader in reading \n     and eighth grader in math to make sure these standards are \n     met. President Clinton's national testing initiative offers a \n     new opportunity to use widely accepted national benchmarks in \n     reading and math against which States, school districts, and \n     parents can judge student performance.\n\n  This national testing initiative is not about suggesting a national \nor Federal system by which anyone from up here can control someone down \nthere.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire, I think, began by saying he was not \nopposed to developing some kind of national testing program. I think \nfrom that statement we ought to be able to find a way to develop a \nprogram of achievement standards. I am not wedded to the notion that it \nbe here or there or with this money or that money. I am wedded to the \nnotion that this country deserves to know what it is getting for the \nmoney it is spending for elementary and secondary education.\n  We spend a substantial amount of money sending our children to \nschool. A substantial amount of money is spent sending our children \ninto the classrooms of our country. The question is, what are we \ngetting for that? What are we achieving? What kind of accomplishments \nexist at the fourth grade level? Are our fourth graders able to read? \nIn which schools? In which States? And if not, why not? Before one can \nembark on a plan to improve education, you must first know where you \nare. And we don't have a basic approach by which we can measure \nachievement.\n  You get to 17 or 18 years of age, and guess what? You want to go to \ncollege. You are going to show up someplace, and you are going to have \nto take a test. That test is going to measure what you have achieved, \nwhat you know, what you have studied, and what you have retained from \nthat. So when you get to be 17 or 18 and begin to take the college \nentrance tests, then at that point somebody is going to measure what \nyou have been given, what you have learned, and what you are prepared \nto do. But by that point, we have spent a substantial amount of money.\n  Why don't we decide, as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and literally \nhundreds of other business leaders in this country have, that we ought \nto get more for our education system by measuring whether our students, \nstudent to student and school to school and State to State, are \nreaching certain levels of achievement?\n  I am a parent. I have two little children sitting this afternoon in a \npublic school classroom. They are the most wonderful kids in the world. \nI assume that every father would say that about their children. I want \nthose children to have the best possible education that our school \nsystem can give them. But I, as one parent, believe that it is \nimportant for us to measure as we go along what our children have \nlearned from that school system.\n  Things have changed. This is not 40 years ago when we as a country \ncould tie one hand behind our back and beat anybody else in the world \nat almost anything, and do it easily. We now face shrewd, tough \ninternational competition in every direction that we look. We now face \ncompetition, yes, in the job market, yes, in our economies, in our \nschools, and we face competition with countries who send their kids to \nschool 240 days a year. We send our kids to school 180 days a year.\n  You have seen and I have seen some of the comparisons of students in \nthe United States with students from Japan, students from Korea, \nstudents from Jordan, and students from around the world.\n  What the business leaders in this country, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, technology industry leaders, and others, including education \nleaders, are saying, is let us find a way by which we establish a \nmeasurement of achievement, by which we aspire to a goal that says that \nby the fourth grade children ought to be able to read competently, and \nlet's measure to make\n\n[[Page S8699]]\n\nsure that our school system makes that happen so that by the eighth \ngrade they have certain proficiency in math. That is what this is \nabout.\n  From the discussion I just heard--I expect there will be a lot of it \ntoday--the issue is, should there be a Federal mandate by a Federal \nagency that federally enforces some Federal test? No, of course not. No \none has proposed that. I would not support that.\n  If you say, however, that with the money we spend for education, we \nought to measure the output as taxpayers, and as parents we ought to \nfind out what are we getting, if you say that ought to be the goal--it \nis my goal, I expect it is probably your goal--then let's find a way to \ndo that. Parents have a right to know whether their kids have mastered \nthe basics in education, no matter what State they live in, no matter \nwhat city or school district they live in.\n  Those in this country who are concerned about our education system \nknow that we must make some improvements. How do we make improvements? \nYou create a blueprint, a plan, or a design for how you fix what is \nwrong. But before you can do that, you must assess what you have. What \nare the achievement levels? What are you getting for what you are now \nspending? That is what this is about.\n  I think that the debate--I guess I shouldn't prejudge; I will listen \nto it--will not be so much about whether it is useful for parents to \nlearn how their kids or how their schools stack up against other kids \nor other schools in other cities or in other States. I think the debate \nwill not be about that because I would expect most parents and \ntaxpayers would want that kind of information.\n  Incidentally, this effort to develop tests to measure achievement is \nall voluntary. There is nothing here that is mandatory. Any school can \nopt out. Any student can opt out. Any State can opt out.\n  If there is heartburn over the question of who develops these \nbenchmarks, let us find agreement on some independent entity that would \nestablish appropriate goals for ourselves and for our children.\n  Occasionally, I--as I am sure everybody in the Senate does--get on a \nradio call-in show. Inevitably, someone will call in and say, ``This is \nsome one-world international conspiracy. This is the Federal Government \nwanting to run the local school system.'' You have heard all of the \ndebate about all of these issues. In fact, going back, that became the \nargument that was used to say, ``Let's get rid of the Department of \nEducation at the Federal level.'' We do not hear much about that \nanymore. I don't expect we will see an amendment about that, although \nthere may be Members in the Chamber who believe that we should offer \nthat amendment and have that debate.\n  Does education reach a level of national importance sufficiently so \nthat we have a Department of Education? I think so. Most of the \nAmerican people think so. But we have had in the not-too-distant past \nthose who say, ``Let's abolish the Department of Education. What on \nEarth should we be doing thinking nationally about education?'' Well, \nthe American people know what we should be doing nationally about \neducation. It is not running the school systems--not at all. What we \nshould be doing nationally is worrying about whether we as a country \nare able to measure achievement--basic achievement in a range of areas, \nespecially reading and mathematics, sufficient so that our students are \nprepared to be everything they can possibly be. Achievement that allows \nthem to contribute not only to themselves but to this country, and to \nhelp us compete internationally. That is what all of this is about.\n  We are faced with tougher and tougher tests as a country. We are \nfaced with a changing world economy and global markets. Companies these \ndays are not national companies. They are international conglomerates. \nThey want to produce where it is cheaper to produce. They want to go \nwherever they can find the skilled labor at the least cost, and so on. \nSo it is tougher competitively for us than it was before. That is why \nour education system is so much more important now than it was. That is \nwhy it is so important that the education system work well. It is \nimportant that we as parents have information with which to measure \nwhat we are getting from this education system.\n  So let me, so that no one misinterprets what I have just said, say it \nagain. I think parents and taxpayers have every reason to believe that \nwe ought to be able to measure what we are getting from our education \nsystem student to student, school to school, school district to school \ndistrict, or State to State. We ought to be able to measure that. The \nfirst standard ought not be when you reach 18 decide to take a test to \ngo to college. But the development of achievement standards ought not \nbe confused with some of the discussion about a Federal agency \ndeveloping a federally enforced standard that they will use to mandate \nFederal policy for local education. That is totally hogwash. That is \nnot what this effort is about.\n  I will be interested in listening to the later debate because my hope \nis that through this discussion perhaps we can find common ground to \nsay, Yes, let's aspire to some achievement levels that we can measure \nacross this country in order to better prepare our children for the \nfuture. If you measure achievement levels, you know how your children \nare doing relevant to other children; you know how your schools are \ndoing; you know how your teachers are doing. If we aspire to do that \nand have the tools that give parents the ability to better manage the \nschool, to better help their children, then we will be better off as a \ncountry. If that is a goal--and I hope it is--then we should be able to \nfind a way to cooperate in reaching that goal through the development \nof some kind of entity that does not impose the specter of Federal \ncontrol over local schools, because that is not the desire at all.\n  The proposal originally by the President was a proposal for a \nvoluntary system in which any State, any school, or any student can opt \nout. But even if that causes heartburn because it has the specter of a \nFederal entity creating the tests, then let us find a method by which \nwe create that same kind of measurement and give parents the same kind \nof opportunity without inciting the fear that some would ascribe to it \nas representing a Federal initiative. We can do that. I think we can do \nthat. But we cannot do that if we stand up and mischaracterize the \ninitiative in the first place. This is not about Federal control and a \nfederally enforced test and Federal usurpation of local prerogatives \nwith respect to education.\n\n  Having given that initial discussion, I will anxiously listen to the \ndebate by two of the Members for whom I have the greatest respect. I \nthink both are bright and interesting people who have contributed a \ngreat deal to this Senate, and while we might disagree on this, the \npurpose of my standing up is that my hope is perhaps we can find an \narea of agreement. Both of my colleagues are parents. I think they \nprobably want the same output here that I want from this system, the \nbest possible education our schools can give our children and along the \nway as parents the best opportunity to measure how our kids are doing \nand how our schools are doing. If we have those opportunities, we will \nimprove not only our children's future but the future of this country.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1071 to Amendment No. 1070\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit the development, planning, implementation, or \n     administration of any national testing program in reading or \n mathematics unless the program is specifically authorized by Federal \n                                statute)\n\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, let me first say I very much appreciate \nthe efforts of the Senator from New Hampshire in addressing this issue. \nI think it is an important issue and one which goes to a topic which \ndeserves and needs a great deal of discussion and debate.\n  Clearly, our public education system in this country has many cracks \nin the once solidly supported and, I think, respected position that it \nonce had. We have many failing public schools, not just in our major \ncities, but across our land. The goal that we share, whether you are \nRepublican, Democrat, liberal or conservative, is that we want to \nimprove education in this country and we want to address some of the \nshortcomings that we find in education.\n\n[[Page S8700]]\n\n  The Senator from North Dakota raised a point which in many instances \nI think I do not disagree with. We do want to find ways of assessing \nwhere we are educationally, and giving parents a better idea of where \ntheir schools are in terms of preparing their children for a successful \nfuture.\n  The proposal to look at reading levels of achievement at the end of \nthe third grade in reading and in eighth grade in math is not \nnecessarily a goal that we should not attempt to reach. The concern \nthat was raised by the Senator from New Hampshire is that if we address \nthis in a way in which the Department of Education controls and designs \nthe way this will be tested and then potentially uses this to establish \nstandards, we continue a process of Federal Government knows best in \nterms of how to fix the education system in this country.\n  Frankly, the positive changes that are being brought about in the \neducation of the young people in this country are not coming from \nWashington. They are coming from local and State initiatives. We do not \nwant to do anything that deters that. In fact, we want to do everything \nwe can to encourage that. I think it is safe to say if the initiatives \nthat have been proposed and tried and are being tested and used in a \nnumber of our local educational jurisdictions and in a number of our \nStates had to have the approval of the Federal Government, we would \nhave gotten nowhere. We would not have charter schools in this country \nif the Department of Education had to approve it. We would not have had \nmany of the experimental programs aimed at better addressing the \nsituation of our at-risk children who are learning very little, or not \nat all, in many of our public schools, and particularly our public \nschools in urban areas across this country, because the national \neducation unions have a lock on the public school process and a lock on \nthe Department of Education.\n  I have been in the Chamber proposing a number of new initiatives, \nmost in the form of demonstration programs which merely ask that we \ntest a new idea to gauge its effectiveness. I do this so often because \nthe only thing we know about the current system for sure is that it is \nfailing many of our children. So why not try something new, why not \nexperiment with some new ideas? And if it works, then decide how we \nwant to encourage it. And if it does not work, throw it out and try \nsomething else. But what we have is a Department of Education locked \ninto a no-change system because the teachers unions, not merely the \nteachers but the teachers unions, say don't touch it--no merit pay for \nteachers, no changes in the rules on tenure. They just fight every \nchange that is proposed.\n  And so when the idea comes along of OK, let's set a testing standard \nso that we know where we stand, it looks good on its face--I think we \nall want that information; it can be useful to local jurisdictions and \nuseful to States. But what we do not want is to get into the situation \nwe got into with the national history standards whereby Federal \nbureaucrats and the organizations that currently control funding for \npublic education basically say we will define what those standards \nought to be, and we will set those standards and then we will measure \nthe test against those standards.\n  We don't want to get into that trap again. We went through that not a \nshort time ago, and those standards were soundly rejected because they \nwere taking us in absolutely the wrong direction.\n  Now, I think that we can address the goals raised by the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, which I think Senator Gregg and I share in, of trying to \nfind a way to provide local educational institutions and States with \ninformation about where students stand relative at least to reading and \nto math at fourth and eighth grade levels without falling into the \nproblem that we would have if the administration were allowed to go \nforward with its original plan.\n  What the Senator from North Dakota apparently was not aware of was \nthat the Department of Education has already begun developing tests, \nand has already contracted with a consortium of testing agencies \nwhereby the Department of Education defines how this is going to be \ndone, without using an independent agency.\n  Now, the President just this past Saturday in his national radio \naddress wisely concluded that was not the direction the American people \nwanted to go, or that was not the way in which we ought to pursue this \nconcept of trying to find where we stand at certain levels in regard to \nthe subjects of reading and mathematics. And so the President announced \non Saturday that he would defer to the critics' complaints that this \nshould be done by an independent agency and should not be administered \nor controlled by the Department of Education.\n  What Senator Gregg and I are trying to do is to hold the President to \nhis word, so that it is not just something said on a radio address but \nit is something that is actually fulfilled by members of his own \nDepartment of Education. So the amendment that was offered was intended \nto prohibit the use of funds in this act, or any act, for the \ndevelopment or implementation of a national testing program.\n  Now, we know that the Department has already signed a contract to \nbegin developing this testing program, and as a consequence of that we \nare now trying to send a signal to the Department encouraging them to \nslow down. This is something that the Congress should debate, as the \nSenator from North Dakota said. This is something that the Congress \nshould authorize. This is something on which the will of the people \nshould be heard, that the input from the education institutions at the \nlocal and State levels ought to be heard before we proceed with this \nnational effort. This truly should be a decision that is not first made \nin Washington and imposed on the States, but rather one that is first \nsupported in State capitols and local jurisdictions around the country \nand only then decided on by Congress.\n  Because there is a question raised about what the underlying \namendment is intended to accomplish, I propose that we pause here, and \nagree to work together, as the Senator from North Dakota said, to \nachieve what many feel is a desirable goal. I think it would be helpful \nfor local educational agencies and for States to have an assessment of \nwhere their students are. I think it would be helpful for parents to \nknow how their schools are performing and measuring up in relation to \nother schools. I think that puts pressure for change on the system.\n  I am trying to avoid the situation that we have frequently \nencountered after the passage of education legislation of parents \ngetting involved because they don't like what is going on in \nWashington. For instance, if we don't take the time to check whether \nparents really want national testing, if they are unhappy, they will \ncall up their Congressman and they will call up their Senators. They'll \nsay, wait a minute; we are not so sure about this new Federal \ninitiative to fix the problem of poor student performance because it \nlooks like more Federal control. Federal control in education hasn't \nworked very well in the past, and we are not sure it is going to work \nin the future. Besides how does the Department of Education conclude it \nknows what is best for the education system when it has been over 15 \nyears since a blue ribbon commission came out with a shocking report \ntalking about the mediocrity of public education in America, and since \nthen the only real reforms that have taken place have not been at the \nFederal level; reforms have been at the local and the State level, and \nwe want to preserve the right of local jurisdictions and States to make \nthose reforms.\n\n  So I am offering a second-degree amendment to the underlying \namendment which says that no Federal funds can be used for national \ntesting until Congress has specifically authorized those tests. It does \nnot say that we should not pursue the goal of some type of national \ntesting. But what it does say is that the Congress ought to debate this \nand it ought to be authorized by the Congress before the \nadministration, through the Department of Education, simply goes \nforward.\n  My second-degree amendment says that none of the funds made available \nin this act, or any other act, will be used to develop, plan, \nimplement, or administer any national testing program in reading or \nmathematics unless the program is specifically authorized by Federal \nstatute.\n\n[[Page S8701]]\n\n  The operative phrase is that you can't go forward with this and use \nFederal funds unless it is specifically authorized by the Congress. \nThat allows us to engage in the debate that the Senator from North \nDakota thought we ought to engage in, and I agree that allows us to \ndefine how this testing will take place, that allows us to acknowledge \nthe concern that the Senator from North Dakota expressed that maybe we \ndo not want the Department of Education running this.\n  Having been involved in the issue of student loans over the past \nseveral years and raising objections to the Department of Education \ntaking over the student lending business, which it says it can do more \neffectively and more efficiently than the private sector, I find it \nironic that Congress Daily reports that the Department of Education has \nhad to suspend all direct loan consolidation efforts because it is \noverwhelmed by the effort. It cannot handle the work. And so students \nwho want to consolidate their loans in terms of paying them back are \nnow not able to do so because the Department of Education cannot handle \nit.\n  A number of us, including Senator Gregg and many others, have raised \nconcerns about the ability of the Department of Education to properly \nmanage and administer the very complex business of making and \ncollecting student loans. Frankly, we have never thought that they have \nthe capacity to handle it. It is not that they are not well intended. \nThe problem is there are no competitive pressures. They do their own \nthing. And it is the nature of bureaucracy--that is why it is called \nbureaucracy--to become bureaucratized and inefficient.\n  I remember when the First Lady was here promoting her health plan, \nand in her first presentation to the Congress to two of the committees \nhere, one of which I sit on, I said it seems to me that this massive \nnational health plan is based on a number of faulty assumptions, one of \nwhich is that Government can accomplish an objective more efficiently \nand effectively than the private sector. I said that in my experience \nin 18 years in government and in my reading over the history of this \nGovernment, I have not been able to identify an area where the Federal \nGovernment has performed a service more effectively or efficiently than \nthe private sector. I said, can you name me one? And the First Lady \nsaid, ``Well, Senator, I think you are correct in terms of past \nperformance of the Federal Government, but this time we think we have \nit right.'' We think, in terms of the health care plan that was being \nproposed here by Mr. Magaziner and herself, that we can avoid that \nproblem.\n  As we have learned, that health care plan was rejected overwhelmingly \nby the American people because they had no faith that the Federal \nGovernment could take 15 percent of our economy, the entire health care \nsystem of the United States, and turn it over to Government to run with \nany assurance that it would be run effectively and efficiently. And, \ntherefore, those of us who have a philosophy grounded in the free \nenterprise system are very skeptical about new proposals to inject the \nFederal Government further and further into those efforts handled by \nthe private sector.\n\n  So, at the very time the Department of Education now admits that it \ncan't handle a small fraction of the lending business that is the \nconsolidation of loans, and that it is going to take months and months \nand months for it to get its act together, if then, it now wants to \nenter into a new area of national testing, who knows where this is \ngoing to take us. And of course, who knows how many additional people \nwill have to be assigned to have to administer this, to oversee the \ncontracts and define the standards.\n  Those are the concerns that Senator Gregg and I have, and those are \nthe concerns we are trying to address. What we would like to do with \nthis amendment, then, is simply follow up on the President's concession \nlast Saturday and basically say, No. 1, this should not be done by the \nFederal Government, should not be done by the Department of Education, \nit ought to be done, if done at all, through an independent agency. And \nsince we are dual players in this town, both the administration and the \nCongress, in doing the people's business, this is something the \nCongress ought to authorize. Therefore my second-degree amendment would \nprohibit funds from being used to further this national testing program \nuntil it is authorized by Federal statute.\n  The chairman of the relevant appropriations committee, Senator \nSpecter, will be holding hearings as early as tomorrow whereby the \nSecretary of Education will come forward, as well as Mr. Goodling, whom \nI deeply respect in terms of his experience with education. They will \nboth come to testify as to the pros and cons of national testing. I \nthink we need hear those pros and cons. I think we need to debate those \npros and cons, and then I think we need to go forward and make a \ndecision as to how we proceed.\n  Again, I say this as someone who is not unalterably opposed to \nnational testing for reading in fourth grade and math at eighth grade. \nFrankly, one of the reasons I want these tests is because I think it \nwill draw more attention to the failure of the public system to educate \nour children. When we look at the disparities that exist in public \neducation in some of our schools and we look at some of our efforts, I \nthink it will put additional pressure on the public system to open up, \nto try new alternatives, and parents will be demanding that we provide \nbetter education for their children and different ways of providing \nthat education. So, from that standpoint, I think national testing can \nbe of benefit.\n  With that, Madam President, I send my second-degree amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Coats], for himself and Mr. \n     Gregg, proposes an amendment numbered 1071 to amendment 1070.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the pending amendment, add the following:\n       Sec. .

The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the second-degree \namendment offered by the Senator from Indiana, Senator Coats, to \nSenator Gregg's amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nbe temporarily set aside and the Kyl amendment, No. 1056, be \ntemporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1072\n\n  (Purpose: To fund demonstration projects on Medicaid attendant care \n                  services, within amounts available)\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I now offer an amendment and send it to \nthe desk for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1072.\n\n\n[[Page S8702]]\n\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 39, before the period on line 25, insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That $2,000,000 of the \n     amount available for research, demonstration, and evaluation \n     activities shall be available for carrying out demonstration \n     projects on Medicaid coverage of community-based attendant \n     care services for people with disabilities which ensures \n     maximum control by the consumer to select and manage their \n     attendant care services''.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, as noted, that $2 million will be \nutilized from an existing fund for a demonstration project to test the \neffectiveness of providing attendant care services to individuals with \ndisabilities, regardless of age.\n  Every State in the country currently provides long-term services to \neligible individuals who require the assistance of an attendant in \nnursing homes or other institutions. However, under a curious provision \nof the current Medicaid law, these individuals are not guaranteed the \nright to remain in their own homes and communities while receiving the \nassistance of an attendant as an alternative to institutional care.\n  I have sought to persuade the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto change this provision in the Medicaid Program, and I wrote to \nSecretary Shalala accordingly on February 28, 1997. I ask unanimous \nconsent a copy of that letter be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. The amendment that I am introducing today directs the \nDepartment to test the cost effectiveness of this policy option to \nallow the disabled to remain at home and to obtain the Federal Medicaid \nbenefits. It is clear that the current long-term care system is highly \nregulated and very costly. It is my thought that there is a clear-cut \nneed for a program to be put into effect which will enable the disabled \nto stay at home or in the community as an alternative to institutional \ncare.\n  On February 17 of this year, I had the privilege of visiting a group \nof disabled individuals, many of whom have substantial disabilities, \nstruggling to live independent lives. They gave me a sweatshirt, and I \nnow display it for my colleagues and for those on C-Span II, showing, \n``Our Homes, Not Nursing Homes.'' And it is the symbol of someone who \nis disabled.\n  When I met with these individuals, who were struggling in their \nwheelchairs, with enormous disabilities, and found that they could not \nreceive Medicaid benefits unless they were in an institution, it seemed \nto me manifestly unfair. It is clear that it would be less costly to \nhave the disabled remain in their communities or in their own homes so \nthey could care for themselves and could receive the Medicaid benefits.\n  So I said to these people in North Philadelphia that I would bring \nthe matter to the Secretary of Health and Human Services with the view \nof having an administrative change. But I find that it is very \ncomplicated because the preliminary estimates from the Congressional \nBudget Office say that this would be an enormously expensive change to \nenable the disabled to have benefits to live in their communities or in \ntheir homes.\n  I wondered why. The best explanation which I have been able to \nreceive so far is that, at the present time, these people, the \ndisabled, are cared for by their relatives, by friends or somehow by \nthemselves because they don't want to go into an institution, so they \nforgo the assistance which Medicaid offers the disabled. The \nCongressional Budget Office asserts that if these individuals were to \nhave the ability to have this care outside of the institution, the \ncosts would skyrocket.\n  It seems to me, Madam President, unfair that where the Medicaid law \nsays the disabled are entitled to certain benefits if they are in an \ninstitution, that they should be compelled to be institutionalized when \nthey want to live in their homes or their own communities. This is \nquite a conundrum, quite a Catch-22. So the best course that I see at \nthe present time would be for us to undertake this program on a test \nbasis, and to have a study, made to see what the costs would be in \norder to try to arrive at some fair determination.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 28, 1997.\n     Hon. Donna Shalala,\n     Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Shalala: I am writing to alert you that I \n     intend to raise with your at next week's Subcommittee hearing \n     a matter concerning Medicaid coverage of attendant care \n     services for people with disabilities.\n       It has been brought to my attention that considerable \n     savings to the Medicaid program could be achieved by \n     redirecting long-term care funding toward community-based \n     attendant services, and by requiring States to develop \n     attendant service programs meeting national standards to \n     assure that people of all ages with disabilities have full \n     access to such services. Please be prepared to summarize the \n     current status of Medicaid services to the disabled \n     population, and to discuss your views on establishing a \n     national program of community-based attendant services. I \n     would also appreciate your thoughts on what further could be \n     done, both administratively and through legislative action, \n     to better enable people with mental and physical disabilities \n     to live independently.\n       I look forward to discussing this and other issues with you \n     next Tuesday when you appear to present the Administration's \n     fiscal year 1998 budget request for your Department.\n       My best.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter,\n           Chairman, Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human \n     Services, and Education.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, Senator Harkin is now attending a \ncommittee meeting, and I have been advised by his staff that this \namendment is agreeable to him, so I ask unanimous consent that it be \nadopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1072) was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 1070 and Amendment No. 1071\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, now briefly addressing the amendments \noffered by Senator Gregg and Senator Coats, it is my hope that the \namendments will be debated today for all those who have views and care \nto express them; that is, as I said earlier, because this is a \ncomplicated matter. In my conversation yesterday in a telephone call \nwhich I received from the Secretary of Education, he asked for my \nsupport, and I told him that I did not know enough about the matter to \nrender a judgment and had said earlier it seems to me that testing is \ndesirable, but I do not know that it ought to be undertaken by the \nFederal Government.\n  We have scheduled a hearing tomorrow which we have advanced from 9 \no'clock to 8:30 in the morning because we have since had a request from \nCongressman Goodling to testify at the hearing. So we are now going to \nhave the Secretary of Education, Richard Riley, we are going to have \nthe chairman of the House Education Committee, and we are looking, as a \nmatter of balance, to find someone in opposition to the Department of \nEducation program. So that hearing will be conducted from 8:30, \nhopefully until 10 a.m. It is my hope that we will complete action on \nthe remainder of this bill today, with the exception of the vote on the \nGregg amendment, and take that up tomorrow.\n  Madam President, I now call up amendment No. 1069.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1069\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the Attorney General \nhas abused her discretion by failing to appoint an independent counsel \n   on campaign finance matters and that the Attorney General should \n      proceed to appoint such an independent counsel immediately)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside, and the clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1069.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING APPOINTMENT OF \n                   INDEPENDENT COUNSEL.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) press reports appearing in the early Spring of 1997 \n     reported that the FBI and the\n\n[[Page S8703]]\n\n     Justice Department withheld national security information \n     from the Clinton administration and President Clinton \n     regarding information pertaining to the possible involvement \n     by the Chinese government in seeking to influence both the \n     administration and some members of Congress in the 1996 \n     elections;\n       (2) President Clinton subsequently stated, in reference to \n     the failure by the FBI and the Justice Department to brief \n     him on such information regarding China: ``There are \n     significant national security issues at stake here,'' and \n     further stated that ``I believe I should have known'';\n       (3) there has been an acknowledgment by former White House \n     Chief of Staff Leon Panetta in March 1997 that there was \n     indeed coordination between the White House and the DNC \n     regarding the expenditure of soft money for advertising;\n       (4) the Attorney General in her appearance before the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee on April 30, 1997 acknowledged a \n     presumed coordination between President Clinton and the DNC \n     regarding campaign advertisements;\n       (5) Richard Morris in his recent book, ``Behind the Oval \n     Office,'' describes his firsthand knowledge that ``the \n     president became the day-to-day operational director of our \n     [DNC] TV ad campaign. He worked over every script, watched \n     each ad, ordered changes in every visual presentation and \n     decided which ads would run when and where;''\n       (6) there have been conflicting and contradictory \n     statements by the Vice President regarding the timing and \n     extent of his knowledge of the nature of a fundraising event \n     at the Hsi Lai Buddhist Temple near Los Angeles on April 29, \n     1996;\n       (7) the independent counsel statute requires the Attorney \n     General to consider the specificity of information provided \n     and the credibility of the source of information pertaining \n     to potential violations of criminal law by covered persons, \n     including the President and the Vice President;\n       (8) the independent counsel statute further requires the \n     Attorney General to petition the court for appointment of an \n     independent counsel where the Attorney General finds that \n     there is a reasonable likelihood that a violation of criminal \n     law may have occurred involving a covered person;\n       (9) the Attorney General has been presented with specific \n     and credible evidence pertaining to potential violations of \n     criminal law by covered persons and there is a reasonable \n     likelihood that a violation of criminal law may have occurred \n     involving a covered person; and\n       (10) the Attorney General has abused her discretion by \n     failing to petition the court for appointment of an \n     independent counsel.\n       (b) It is the Sense of the Senate that the Attorney General \n     should petition the court immediately for appointment of an \n     independent counsel to investigate the reasonable likelihood \n     that a violation of criminal law may have occurred involving \n     a covered person in the 1996 presidential federal election \n     campaign.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, this is the amendment that I had \nreferred to earlier on sense of the Senate for independent counsel.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Senator McCain to Attorney \nGeneral Reno dated October 11, 1996, requesting independent counsel be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                                 October 11, 1996.\n     Hon. Janet Reno,\n     Attorney General, Department of Justice, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Attorney General Reno: I am writing to you to request \n     that you use the authority granted to you in the Independent \n     Counsel Reauthorization Act to immediately appoint an \n     Independent Counsel to investigate charges raised in the \n     media regarding the Democratic Party and Clinton-Gore \n     Reelection Committee's use of soft money contributions which \n     appear to have been in violation of election law.\n       These allegations charge that foreign nationals have been \n     circumventing the law in order to funnel large campaign \n     contributions to the Democratic party. I have enclosed copies \n     of recent New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street \n     Journal articles regarding this situation.\n       During this election season, I believe it is impossible for \n     any Administration officials to determine whether any \n     illegalities or ethical lapses have been committed regarding \n     this situation. Therefore, it is crucial for the sake of the \n     integrity of the Office of the President and the political \n     party fundraising apparatus that this matter be investigated \n     by an Independent Counsel.\n       Your immediate attention to this matter is appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John McCain,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated October 29, \n1996, from five Members of the House of Representatives requesting \nindependent counsel be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 29, 1996.\n     Hon. Janet Reno,\n     Attorney General, Department of Justice, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Attorney General Reno: We are writing to request that \n     you immediately apply for the appointment of an Independent \n     Counsel to investigate the serious allegation that Federal \n     criminal laws may have been violated by a number of high \n     ranking officials in the Clinton Administration and at the \n     Democratic National Committee (``DNC'').\n       This investigation should include, but not be limited to, \n     the following specific reports that indicate violations of \n     Federal law may have taken place:\n       1. The involvement of President Clinton, Vice President \n     Gore, and officials of the Democratic National Committee in \n     the solicitation, acceptance, and receipt of $250,000 from \n     Cheong Am America, when the corporation had little or no \n     domestic income, in direct violation of the Federal Election \n     Campaign Act, and in the solicitation or receipt of over \n     $300,000 from Arief and Soraya Wiriadinata at a time when the \n     Wiriadinatas no longer resided in the United States, \n     violating the plain language in Federal law prohibiting \n     contributions by non-citizens outside the United States. \n     Although the Cheong Am America contribution was returned \n     following media inquiries, the $300,000 from the Wiriadinatas \n     has been retained by the DNC for use in influencing American \n     elections.\n       2. Incorrect reporting to the Federal Election Commission \n     by officials of the DNC of the residence address of Arief and \n     Soraya Wiriadinata, which presented the public appearance \n     that the Wiriadinatas were in the United States and \n     potentially intended to conceal the fact that their \n     contributions were in fact unlawful. News reports indicate \n     that the contributions apparently came after the Wiriadinatas \n     had returned to Indonesia and that the Vice Chairman of \n     Finance of the Democratic National Committee knew that the \n     Wiriadinatas were out of the country (Los Angeles Times, 10/\n     14/96). Property records on file in Fairfax County, Virginia \n     show that the home reported on DNC Federal Election \n     Commission (``FEC'') Reports as the Wiriadinata home address \n     was sold by the Wiriadinata family on December 15, 1995, yet \n     contributions received as late as July, 1996 continued to be \n     reported as coming from that address.\n       3. The solicitation, acceptance and receipt of \n     contributions from individuals, including Arief and Soraya \n     Wiriadinata ($450,000), Yogesh Gandhi ($325,000), and \n     individuals who made contributions in connection with the \n     April 29, 1996 event at the Hsi Lai Temple in \n     Hacienda Heights, California (an estimated $140,000) and a \n     fundraiser at the Hay-Adams Hotel in Washington, D.C., in \n     February 1996 (an estimated $1,000,000), when DNC \n     officials involved in fundraising may have had good reason \n     to know that these contributors did not have the financial \n     resources to make contributions in the large amounts \n     reported, and the contributors may therefore have been \n     conduits for prohibited funds from foreign sources.\n       4. Fundraising activities on behalf of the DNC by John \n     Huang while he was a Presidential appointee at the Department \n     of Commerce, possibly with the knowledge of officials of the \n     DNC, in violation of the Hatch Act. Contributions from the \n     Wiriadinatas to the DNC were received in November of 1995, \n     while Huang was serving as Deputy Assistant Secretary of \n     Commerce for International Economic Policy. DNC Press \n     Secretary Amy Weiss Tobe has stated to the press (Washington \n     Post, October 12, 1996) that Arief and Soraya Wiriadinata \n     contributed to the DNC after meeting John Huang in 1995, \n     during the time he was employed at the U.S. Department of \n     Commerce.\n       5. Possible improper influence on official government \n     decisions as a result of large contributions made to the DNC \n     or other entities by associates and allies of the Riady \n     family and the Lippo group of foreign-owned and foreign-\n     controlled corporations. Press reports indicate that a series \n     of events, which would economically benefit the Lippo Group \n     and the Riady family, took place after meetings between \n     President Clinton, Clinton Administration officials, John \n     Huang and James Riady. Federal bribery statutes prohibit the \n     performing of any official government act in return for \n     campaign contributions or other payments.\n       6. Knowing use of tax-exempt facilities at the Hsi Lai \n     Temple by the DNC for fundraising purposes and knowing \n     solicitation and acceptance of prohibited in-kind \n     contributions from a non-profit entity to a political \n     campaign through the DNC's failure to reimburse the Temple \n     for its expenses in connection with the event until \n     questioned by the media. Further, despite statements by Vice \n     President Gore that the event was not a fundraiser, news \n     reports have indicated that Mr. Huang called it a fundraiser, \n     contributions were collected at the event, and attendees \n     believed that they had to pay to attend.\n       7. The possible attempt by Mr. John Huang, an employee of \n     the DNC, with either the knowledge or implicit approval of \n     the DNC, to obstruct any investigation of his activities by \n     evading the service of a subpoena for the purpose of \n     preventing the release of information about his fundraising \n     activities until after the November 5, 1996 election. Mr. \n     Huang is reported to have raised as much as\n\n[[Page S8704]]\n\n     $5 million in contributions for the DNC, and has so far \n     refused to answer questions in public about his fundraising \n     activities. Until a U.S. District Court Judge intervened, the \n     DNC refused to cooperate or assist in having its employee, \n     John Huang, provide information which would resolve questions \n     as to the legality of the contributions which he solicited \n     and which the DNC is now using to influence American \n     elections.\n       8. Reports filed by the DNC with the Federal Election \n     Commission for the period ending September 30, 1996 list the \n     home address of at least thirty-one contributors to the DNC \n     (with contributions totaling over $225,000) as 430 South \n     Capitol Street SE, Washington, D.C. This address is not a \n     residence, it is the address of the business offices of the \n     DNC. By filing false and misleading information with the FEC, \n     DNC officials may have sought to conceal and impede \n     investigation into the true source and nature of these \n     contributions.\n       Equally important as each of these individual acts is the \n     overall pattern of questionable fundraising activity and the \n     apparent deliberate flaunting of federal election law and \n     usurpation of power and official privilege by the DNC's Vice \n     Chairman of Finance, John Huang, for the benefit of and with \n     the apparent cooperation of President Bill Clinton, Vice \n     President Gore, and the Democratic National Committee. The \n     magnitude of the funds involved, the high-rank of the \n     officials involved and the potential knowing and willful \n     violations committed make it impossible for any officials of \n     this Administration's Justice Department to carry out an \n     investigation that will be considered fair and free of \n     outside influence!\n       Therefore it is crucial for the sake of the integrity of \n     the Office of the President and the Office of the Vice \n     President that this matter be investigated promptly by an \n     independent counsel.\n       We look forward to a reply to this communication by Friday, \n     November 1, 1996. Your early reply will reassure the American \n     people that you are committed to preserving the integrity and \n     independence of the Department of Justice.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bill Thomas,\n                           Chairman, Committee on House Oversight.\n     Ben Gilman,\n                                            Chairman, Committee on\n                                          International Relations.\n     Bill Clinger,\n                                            Chairman, Committee on\n                                  Government Reform and Oversight.\n     Gerald B. Solomon,\n                                     Chairman, Committee on Rules.\n     John McCain,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated March 13, \n1997, from the 10 Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nrequesting independent counsel be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 1997.\n     Hon. Janet Reno,\n     Attorney General of the United States, U.S. Department of \n         Justice, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Attorney General: This letter serves as a formal \n     request, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 592(g)(1), that you apply \n     for the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate \n     possible fundraising violations in connection with the 1996 \n     presidential campaign. The purpose of this letter is not to \n     provide an exhaustive list of the particular allegations \n     that, we believe, warrant further investigation. Indeed, \n     since the Department of Justice has been conducting an \n     extensive investigation into fundraising irregularities for \n     several months now, you presumably have far greater knowledge \n     than do we of the various matters that are being, and will \n     need to be, investigated, and we presume that your judgment \n     as to the necessity of an independent counsel is based on all \n     of the information before you. Rather, the purpose of this \n     letter is to articulate why we believe this investigation \n     should be conducted by an independent counsel. As you know, \n     the Senate Committee on the Judiciary has, to date, refrained \n     from joining the assortment of other individuals who have \n     called upon you to initiate an independent counsel \n     appointment. Recent developments over the past few weeks, \n     however, have persuaded us that such an appointment is now \n     necessary.\n       When you appeared before the Senate in 1993 when we were \n     considering reenactment of the Independent Counsel statute, \n     you stated:\n       ``There is an inherent conflict of interest whenever senior \n     Executive Branch officials are to be investigated by the \n     Department of Justice and its appointed head, the Attorney \n     General. The Attorney General serves at the pleasure of the \n     President. Recognition of this conflict does not belittle or \n     demean the impressive professionalism of the Department's \n     career prosecutors, nor does it question the integrity of the \n     Attorney General and his or her political appointees. \n     Instead, it recognizes the importance of public confidence in \n     our system of justice, and the destructive effect in a free \n     democracy of public cynicism.''\n       You further testified that:\n       ``It is absolutely essential for the public to have \n     confidence in the system and you cannot do that when there is \n     conflict or an appearance of conflict in the person who is, \n     in effect, the chief prosecutor. * * * The Independent \n     Counsel Act was designed to avoid even the appearance of \n     impropriety in the consideration of allegations of misconduct \n     by high-level Executive Branch officials and to prevent * * * \n     the actual or perceived conflicts of interest. The Act thus \n     served as a vehicle to further the public's perception of \n     fairness and thoroughness in such matters, and to avert even \n     the most subtle influences that may appear in an \n     investigation of highly-placed Executive officials.''\n       We believe that, in light of recent developments, a \n     thorough Justice Department investigation into possible \n     fundraising violations in connection with the 1996 \n     presidential campaign will raise an inherent conflict of \n     interest, and that the appointment of an independent counsel \n     is therefore required to ensure public confidence in the \n     integrity of our electoral process and system of justice.\n       First recent revelations have demonstrated how officials at \n     the highest level of the White House were involved in \n     formulating, coordinating and implementing the DNC's \n     fundraising efforts for the 1996 presidential campaign. \n     Recent press reports, the files released by Mr. Ickes, and \n     public statements by very high ranking present and former \n     Clinton Administration officials indicate how extensively the \n     Administration was involved in planning, coordinating, and \n     implementing DNC fundraising strategy and activities. All \n     this has led The New York Times to a conclusion which we find \n     hard to challenge; namely, that ``the latest documentation \n     shows clearly that the Democratic National Committee was \n     virtually a subsidiary of the White House. Not only was \n     [President] Clinton overseeing its fund-raising efforts, not \n     only was he immersed in its ad campaigns, but D.N.C. \n     employees were installed at the White House, using White \n     House visitors' lists and communicating constantly with \n     [President] Clinton's policy advisers.'' The New York Times, \n     February 27, 1997. As a consequence, we believe that a \n     thorough investigation of all but the most trivial potential \n     campaign fundraising improprieties necessarily includes an \n     inquiry into the possible knowledge and/or complicity of very \n     senior White House officials in these improprieties. We \n     believe that, without questioning in the slightest the \n     integrity, professionalism or independence of the Attorney \n     General or the individuals conducting the present Justice \n     Department fundraising investigation, the fact that the \n     Department's investigation will inescapably take it to the \n     highest levels of the Executive Branch presents an inherent \n     conflict of interest calling for the appointment of an \n     independent counsel under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 591(c).\n       Moreover, these revelations raise new questions of possible \n     wrongdoing by senior White House officials themselves, \n     including but not limited to whether federal officials may \n     have illegally solicited and/or received contributions on \n     federal property; whether specific solicitations were ever \n     made by federal officials at the numerous White House \n     overnights, coffees, and other similar events, and whether \n     these events themselves, often characterized in White House \n     and DNC memoranda as ``fundraising'' events, constituted \n     improper ``solicitations'' on federal property; whether \n     government property and employees may have been used \n     illegally to further campaign interests; and whether the \n     close coordination by the White House over the raising and \n     spending of ``soft''--and purportedly independent--DNC \n     funds violated federal election laws, and/or had the legal \n     effect of rendering those funds subject to campaign \n     finance limitations they otherwise would not be subject \n     to. It seems to us that, even accepting the narrow \n     constructions of some of the governing statutes that have \n     been suggested--which are not necessarily the \n     constructions an independent counsel would render--the \n     answer to whether criminal wrongdoing has occurred will of \n     necessity turn on the resolution of disputed factual, \n     legal, and state of mind determinations. Because the \n     inquiry necessary to make these determinations will \n     inescapably involve high level Executive Branch officials, \n     we believe they should be left to an independent counsel \n     in order to avoid a real or apparent conflict of interest. \n     Moreover, where individuals covered by the independent \n     counsel statute are involved, as they plainly were here, \n     see 28 U.S.C. Sec. 591(b), the Ethics in Government Act \n     requires that these inquiries be conducted by an \n     independent counsel. Whether the Act simply permits or \n     requires the appointment of an independent counsel, \n     however, we believe that prudence and the American \n     people's ability to have confidence that the investigation \n     remains free of a conflict of interest, requires it.\n       Second, the emerging story regarding the possibility that \n     foreign contributions were funneled into U.S. election \n     coffers to influence U.S. foreign policy further highlights \n     the conflict of interest your ongoing investigation \n     inescapably confronts. A March 9, 1997, Washington Post \n     article quoted ``U.S. government officials''--presumably \n     familiar with the Department's ongoing investigation--as \n     stating that investigators have obtained ```conclusive \n     evidence' that Chinese government funds were funneled into \n     the United States last year,'' and quoted one official as \n     stating that ``there is no question that money was \n     laundered.'' This article reported that U.S. officials \n     described a plan by China ``to spend nearly $2 million to buy \n     influence not only in Congress but also within\n\n[[Page S8705]]\n\n     the Clinton Administration.'' If the FBI truly is \n     investigating these allegations, as is reported, and this \n     investigation extends to high level Executive Branch \n     officials, it raises an inherent conflict of interest.\n       Moreover, a closer look at the activities and associations \n     of some of the particular individuals who are reported to be \n     the principal figures in the ongoing investigation further \n     illustrates why this investigation ultimately must involve \n     high levels of the Executive Branch. Especially troubling is \n     the information revealed to date regarding the Riady family \n     and their associate, Mr. John Huang, but serious questions \n     are also raised by the activities and associations of Mr. \n     Charles Yah Lin Trie, Ms. Pauline Kanalanchak, and Mr. Johnny \n     Chung, among others. Taken together, these reported events \n     raise a host of serious questions warranting further \n     investigation: To what extent were illegal contributions from \n     foreign sources, in particular China, being funneled into the \n     United States, and with whose knowledge and involvement? To \n     what extent was U.S. policy influenced by these \n     contributions, and with whose knowledge and/or involvement? \n     To what extent were the decisions to hire Huang at the \n     Commerce Department, to support most-favored-nation status \n     for China and Chinese accession to the World Trade \n     Organization, or to normalize relations with Vietnam, \n     influenced by contributions, and with whose knowledge and/\n     or involvement? To what extent was the standard NSC \n     screening process for admission to the White House waived \n     or modified so as to permit special access to large donors \n     and their guests where it would ordinarily be denied, and \n     with whose knowledge and/or involvement? To what extent \n     was John Huang placed at the DNC to raise money in \n     exchange for past and future favors, and with whose \n     knowledge and/or involvement?\n       It is evident that these questions cannot be properly \n     investigated without a conflict of interest, since \n     investigating most of these questions will require inquiring \n     into the knowledge and/or conduct of individuals at the \n     highest levels of the Executive Branch. Moreover, several of \n     the principal figures in this investigation, including the \n     Riadys and the Lippo Group and Charlie Trie, reportedly have \n     longstanding ties to President Clinton.\n       Indeed, the conflicts at issue here are precisely the sort \n     of ``inherent conflict[s] of interest'' to which you \n     testified during Senate hearings in 1993 on the re-enactment \n     of the Independent Counsel Act. Avoiding an actual or \n     perceived conflict of interest was the basis not just for \n     your application for the appointment of an independent \n     counsel to investigate James McDougal, but also for your \n     recent requests to extend that counsel's jurisdiction to \n     include investigations of Anthony Marceca and Bernard \n     Nussbaum. The same concern warrants your application for an \n     independent counsel here, where public confidence can be \n     assured only by the appointment of an independent counsel to \n     investigate any alleged wrongdoing in connection with DNC, \n     Clinton Administration, and Clinton/Gore Campaign fundraising \n     during the 1994-1996 election cycle. As you yourself \n     testified, applying for an independent counsel, and our \n     request that you make such an application, in no way detracts \n     from the integrity and independence of the Attorney General \n     or the career prosecutors presently investigating these \n     allegations.\n       Pursuant to the statute, please report back to the \n     Committee within 30 days whether you have begun or will begin \n     a preliminary investigation, identifying all of the \n     allegations you are presently investigating or as to which \n     you have received information, and indicating whether you \n     believe each of these allegations are based on specific \n     information from credible sources, and either pertain to a \n     covered individual or present a conflict of interest. Please \n     also provide your reasons for those determinations. See 28 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 592(g)(2). In the event you conduct a preliminary \n     investigation, but do not apply for the appointment of an \n     independent counsel, or apply for an independent counsel but \n     only with respect to some of the various allegations on which \n     you have received information, please identify all those \n     allegations which in your view do not warrant appointment of \n     an independent counsel, and explain your view whether those \n     allegations warrant further investigation, pertain to a \n     covered individual, and/or present a conflict of interest. \n     See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 592(g)(3).\n           Sincerely,\n         Orrin Hatch, Chuck Grassley, John Ashcroft, Spencer \n           Abraham, Mike DeWine, Strom Thurmond, Arlen Specter, \n           Jon Kyl, Fred Thompson, Jeff Sessions.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. And I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter \nfrom Attorney General Reno dated April 14, 1997, responding to Senator \nHatch be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 14, 1997.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n               Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n                                                   Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On March 13, 1997, you and nine other \n     majority party members of the Committee on the Judiciary of \n     the United States Senate wrote to me requesting the \n     appointment of an independent counsel to investigate possible \n     fundraising violations in connection with the 1996 \n     presidential campaign. You made that request pursuant to a \n     provision of the Independent Counsel Act, 28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 592(g)(1), which provides that ``a majority of majority \n     party members [of the Committee on the Judiciary] * * * may \n     request in writing that the Attorney General apply for the \n     appointment of an independent counsel.'' The Act requires me \n     to respond within 30 days, setting forth the reasons for my \n     decision on each of the matters with respect to which your \n     request is made. 28 U.S.C. Sec. 592(g)(2).\n       I am writing to inform you that I have not initiated a \n     ``preliminary investigation'' (as that term is defined in the \n     Independent Counsel Act) of any of the matters mentioned in \n     your letter. Rather, as you know, matters relating to \n     campaign financing in the 1996 Federal elections have been \n     under active investigation since November by a task force of \n     career Justice Department prosecutors and Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation (FBI) agents. This task force is pursuing the \n     investigation vigorously and diligently, and it will continue \n     to do so. I can assure you that I have given your views and \n     your arguments careful thought, but at this time, I am unable \n     to agree, based on the facts and the law, that an independent \n     counsel should be appointed to handle this investigation.\n\n\n                     1. The Independent Counsel Act\n\n       In order to explain my reasons, I would like to outline \n     briefly the relevant provisions of the Independent Counsel \n     Act. The Act can be invoked in two circumstances that are \n     relevant here:\n       First, if there are sufficient allegations (as further \n     described below) of criminal activity by a covered person, \n     defined as the President and Vice President, cabinet \n     officers, certain other enumerated high Federal officials, or \n     certain specified officers of the President's election \n     campaign (not party officials), see 28 U.S.C. Sec. 591(b), I \n     must seek appointment of an independent counsel.\n       Second, if there are sufficient allegations of criminal \n     activity by a person other than a covered person, and I \n     determine that ``an investigation or prosecution of [that] \n     person by the Department of Justice may result in a personal, \n     financial or political conflict of interest,'' see 28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 591(c)(1), I may seek appointment of an independent \n     counsel.\n       In either case, I must follow a two-step process to \n     determine whether the allegations are sufficient. First, I \n     must determine whether the allegations are sufficiently \n     specific and credible to constitute grounds to investigate \n     whether an individual may have violated Federal criminal law. \n     28 U.S.C. Sec. 591(d). If so, the Department commences a \n     ``preliminary investigation'' for up to 90 days (which can be \n     extended an additional 60 days upon a showing of good cause). \n     28 U.S.C. Sec. 592(a). If, at the conclusion of this \n     ``preliminary investigation,'' I determine that further \n     investigation of the matters is warranted, I must seek an \n     independent counsel.\n       Certain important features of the Act are critical to my \n     decision in this case:\n       First, the Act sets forth the only circumstances in which I \n     may seek an independent counsel pursuant to its provisions. I \n     may not invoke its procedures unless the statutory \n     requirements are met.\n       Second, the Act does not permit or require me to commence a \n     preliminary investigation unless there is specific and \n     credible evidence that a crime may have been committed. In \n     your letter, you suggest that it is not the responsibility of \n     the Department of Justice to determine whether a particular \n     set of facts suggests a potential Federal crime, but that \n     such legal determinations should be left to an independent \n     counsel. I do not agree. Under the Independent Counsel \n     Act, it is the Department's obligation to determine in the \n     first instance whether particular conduct potentially \n     falls within the scope of a particular criminal statute \n     such that criminal investigation is warranted. If it is \n     our conclusion that the alleged conduct is not criminal, \n     then there is no basis for appointment of an independent \n     counsel, because there would be no specific and credible \n     allegation of a violation of criminal law. See 28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 592(a)(1).\n       Third, there is an important difference between the \n     mandatory and discretionary provisions of the Act. Once I \n     have received specific and credible allegations of criminal \n     conduct by a covered person, I must commence a preliminary \n     investigation and, if further investigation is warranted at \n     the end of the preliminary investigation, seek appointment of \n     an independent counsel. If, on the other hand, I receive \n     specific and credible evidence that a person not covered by \n     the mandatory provisions of the Act has committed a crime, \n     and I determine that a conflict of interest exists with \n     respect to the investigation of that person, I may--but need \n     not--commence a preliminary investigation pursuant to the \n     provisions of the Act. This provision gives me the \n     flexibility to decide whether, overall, the national interest \n     would be best served by appointment of an independent counsel \n     in such a case, or whether it would be better for the \n     Department of Justice to continue a vigorous investigation of \n     the matter.\n       Fourth, even this discretionary provision is not available \n     unless I find a conflict of interest of the sort contemplated \n     by the Act. The Congress has made it very clear that this \n     provision should be invoked only in certain narrow \n     circumstances. Under the Act, I must conclude that there is a \n     potential for an actual conflict of interest, rather than \n     merely an appearance of a conflict of interest. The Congress \n     expressly adopted this higher standard to ensure that the \n     provision\n\n[[Page S8706]]\n\n     would not be invoked unnecessarily. See 128 Cong. Rec. H 9507 \n     (daily ed. December 13, 1982) (statement of Rep. Hall). \n     Moreover, I must find that there is the potential for such an \n     actual conflict with respect to the investigation of a \n     particular person, not merely with respect to the overall \n     matter. Indeed, when the Act was reauthorized in 1994, \n     Congress considered a proposal for a more flexible standard \n     for invoking the discretionary clause, which would have \n     permitted its use to refer any ``matter'' to an Independent \n     Counsel when the purposes of the Act would be \n     served. Congress rejected this suggestion, explaining that \n     such a standard would ``substantially lower the threshold \n     for use of the general discretionary provision.'' H.R. \n     Conf. Rep. No. 511, 103rd Cong., 2nd Sess. 9 (1994).\n\n\n        2. covered persons--the mandatory provisions of the act\n\n       Let me now turn to the specific allegations in your letter. \n     You assert that there are ``new questions of possible \n     wrongdoing by senior White House officials themselves,'' and \n     you identify a number of particular types of conduct in \n     support of this claim. While all of the specific issues you \n     mention are under review or active investigation by the task \n     force, at this time we have no specific, credible evidence \n     that any covered White House official may have committed a \n     Federal crime in respect of any of these issues. \n     Nevertheless, I will discuss separately each area that you \n     raise.\n       a. Fundraising on Federal Property. First, you suggest that \n     ``federal officials may have illegally solicited and/or \n     received contributions on federal property.'' The conduct you \n     describe could be a violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 607. We are \n     aware of a number of allegations of this sort; all are being \n     evaluated, and where appropriate, investigations have been \n     commenced. The Department takes allegations of political \n     fundraising by Federal employees on Federal property \n     seriously, and in appropriate cases would not hesitate to \n     prosecute such matters. Indeed, the Public Integrity Section, \n     which is overseeing the work of the campaign financing task \n     force, recently obtained a number of guilty pleas from \n     individuals who are soliciting and accepting political \n     contributions within the Department of Agriculture.\n       The analysis of a potential section 607 violation is a \n     fact-specific inquiry. A number of different factors must be \n     considered when reviewing allegations that this law may have \n     been violated:\n       First, the law specifically applies only to contributions \n     as technically defined by the Federal Election Campaign Act \n     (FECA)--funds commonly referred to as ``hard money.'' The \n     statute originally applied broadly to any political \n     fundraising, but in 1979, over the objection of the \n     Department of Justice, Congress narrowed the scope of section \n     607 to render it applicable only to FECA contributions. \n     Before concluding that section 607 may have been violated, we \n     must have evidence that a particular solicitation involved a \n     ``contribution'' within the definition of the FECA.\n       Second, there are private areas of the White House that, as \n     a general rule, fall outside the scope of the statute, \n     because of the statutory requirement that the particular \n     solicitation occur in an area ``occupied in the discharge of \n     official duties.'' 3 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 31 (1979). The \n     distinction recognizes that while the Federal Government \n     provides a residence to the President, similar to the housing \n     that it might provide to foreign service officers, this \n     residence is still the personal home of an individual within \n     which restrictions that might validly apply to the Federal \n     workplace should not be imposed. Before we can conclude that \n     section 607 may have been violated, we must have evidence \n     that fundraising took place in locations covered by the \n     provisions of the statute.\n       Thus, while you express concerns about the possibility of \n     ``specific solicitations * * * made by federal officials at \n     the numerous White House overnights, coffees, and other \n     similar events,'' we do not at this time have any specific \n     and credible evidence of any such solicitation by any covered \n     person that may constitute a violation of section 607.\n       We do not suggest, of course, that our consideration of \n     information concerning fundraising on Federal property is \n     limited to whether the conduct constituted a violation only \n     of section 607. However, at this point in time, we have no \n     specific and credible evidence to suggest that any crime was \n     committed by any covered person in connection with these \n     allegations.\n       b. Misuse of Government Resources. You next assert that \n     Government property and employees may have been used \n     illegally to further campaign interests--conduct which might, \n     in some circumstances, constitute a theft or conversion of \n     Government property in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 641. \n     Again, we are actively investigating allegations that such \n     misconduct may have occurred. However, we are unaware at this \n     time of any evidence that any covered person participated in \n     any such activity, other than use of Government property that \n     is permitted under Federal law, such as the reports that the \n     Vice President used a Government telephone, charging the \n     calls to a nongovernment credit card. Federal regulations \n     permit such incidental use of Government property for \n     otherwise lawful personal purposes. See, e.g., 5 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 2635.704; 41 C.F.R. Sec. 201-21.601 (personal long \n     distance telephone calls). Thus, for example, allegations \n     that a Government telephone or telefacsimile machine may have \n     been used on a few occasions by a covered person for personal \n     purposes does not amount to an allegation of a Federal crime. \n     To the extent that there are allegations warranting \n     investigation that individuals not covered by the Independent \n     Counsel Act diverted Government resources, it is my \n     conclusion, as I explain below, that there is at present \n     no conflict of interest for the Department of Justice to \n     investigate and, if appropriate, prosecute those involved \n     in any such activity.\n       c. Foreign Efforts to Influence U.S. Policy. You next cite \n     reports suggesting the possibility that foreign contributions \n     may have been made in hopes of influencing American police \n     decisions. These allegations are under active investigation \n     by the task force. The facts known at this time, however, do \n     not indicate the criminal involvement of any covered person \n     in such conduct.\n       It is neither unique nor unprecedented for the Department \n     to receive information that foreign interests might be \n     seeking to infuse money into American political campaigns. \n     That was precisely the scenario that underlay the criminal \n     investigations, prosecutions and congressional hearings \n     during the late 1970s involving allegations that a Korean \n     businessman was making illegal campaign contributions, among \n     other things, to Members of Congress to curry congressional \n     support for the Government of South Korea. In a more recent \n     example, in 1996 an individual was prosecuted and convicted \n     for funneling Indian Government funds into Federal elections \n     through the cover of a political action committee.\n       Absent specific and credible evidence of complicity by a \n     covered person, it has never been suggested that the mere \n     allegation that a foreign government may have been trying to \n     provide funds to Federal campaigns should warrant appointment \n     of an independent counsel. Nor can it be the case that an \n     independent counsel is required to investigate because \n     campaign contributors or those who donated to political \n     parties believed their largesse would influence policy or \n     achieve access. The Department of Justice routinely handles \n     such allegations, and because of its experience in reviewing \n     and investigating these sensitive matters, embracing, among \n     other things, issues of national security, is particularly \n     well-equipped to do so.\n       d. Coordination of Campaign Fundraising and Expenditures. \n     You also suggest that the ``close coordination by the White \n     House over the raising and spending of `soft'--and \n     purportedly independent--DNC funds violated Federal election \n     laws, and/or had the legal effect of rendering those funds \n     subject to campaign finance limitations they otherwise would \n     not be subject to.'' We believe this statement misapprehends \n     the law. The FECA does not prohibit the coordination of \n     fundraising or expenditures between a party and its \n     candidates for office. Indeed, the Federal Election \n     Commission (FEC), the body charged by Congress with \n     primary responsibility for interpreting and enforcing the \n     FECA, has historically assumed coordination between a \n     candidate and his or her political party.\n       Of course, coordinated expenditures may be unlawful under \n     the FECA if they are made with funds from prohibited sources, \n     if they were misreported, or if they exceeded applicable \n     expenditure limits. However, we presently lack specific and \n     credible evidence suggesting that any covered person \n     participated in any such violations, if they occurred.\n       With respect to coordinated media advertisements by \n     political parties (an area that has received much attention \n     of late, the proper characterization of a particular \n     expenditure depends not on the degree of coordination, but \n     rather on the content of the message. Indeed, just last year \n     the FEC and the content of the message. Indeed, just last \n     year the FEC and the Department of Justice took this position \n     in a brief filed before the Supreme Court, in a case decided \n     on other grounds. See generally, Brief for the Respondent, \n     Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC (S. Ct. \n     No. 95-489), at 2-3, 18 n. 15, 23-24. In this connection, the \n     FEC has concluded that party media advertisements that focus \n     on ``national legislative activity'' and that do not contain \n     an ``electioneering message'' may be financed, in part, using \n     ``soft'' money, i.e., money that does not comply with FECA's \n     contribution limits. FEC Advisory Op. 1995-25, 2 Fed. Elec. \n     Camp. Fin. Guide (CCH)   6162, at 12,109-12,110 (August 24, \n     1995); FEC Advisory Op. 1985-14, 2 Fed. Elec. Camp. Fin. \n     Guide (CCH)   5819, at 11,185-11,186 (May 30, 1985). \n     Moreover, such advertisements are not subject to any \n     applicable limitations on coordinated expenditures by the \n     party on behalf of its candidates. AO 1985-14 at 11-185-\n     11,186.\n       We recognize that there are allegations that both \n     presidential candidates and both national political parties \n     engaged in a concerted effort to take full advantage of every \n     funding option available to them under the law, to craft \n     advertisements that took advantage of the lesser regulation \n     applicable to legislative issue advertising, and to raise \n     large quantities of soft political funding to finance these \n     ventures. However, at the present time, we lack specific and \n     credible evidence suggesting that these activities violated \n     the FECA. Moreover, even assuming that, after a thorough \n     investigation, the FEC were to conclude that regulatory \n     violations occurred, we presently lack specific and credible \n     evidence suggesting that any covered person participated in \n     any such violations.\n\n[[Page S8707]]\n\n    3. Conflict of Interest--The Discretionary Provisions of the Act\n\n       In urging me to conclude that the investigation poses the \n     type of potential conflict of interest contemplated by the \n     Act, you rely heavily on my testimony before the Senate \n     Committee on Government Affairs in 1993 in support of \n     reauthorization of the Independent Counsel Act. I stand by \n     those views and continue to support the overall concept \n     underlying the Act. My decisions pursuant to the Act have \n     been, I believe, fully consistent with those views.\n       The remarks you quote from my testimony should be \n     interpreted within the context of the statutory language I \n     was discussing. When, for example, I referred to the need for \n     the Act to deal with the inherent conflict of interest when \n     the Department of Justice investigates ``high-level Executive \n     Branch officials,'' I was referring to persons covered under \n     the mandatory provisions of the Act. With respect to the \n     conflict of interest provision, my testimony expressed the \n     conviction that the Act ``would in no way preempt this \n     Department's authority to investigate public corruption,'' \n     and that the Department was clearly capable of ``vigorous \n     investigations of wrongdoing by public officials, whatever \n     allegiance or stripes they may wear. I will vigorously defend \n     and continue this tradition.'' While I endorsed the concept \n     of the discretionary clause to deal with unforeseeable \n     situations, I strongly emphasized that ``it is part of the \n     Attorney General's job to make difficult decisions in tough \n     cases. I have no intention of abdicating that \n     responsibility[.]'' These principles continue to guide my \n     decisionmaking today.\n       There are times when reliance on the discretionary clause \n     is appropriate, and indeed, as you point out, I have done so \n     myself on a few occasions. However, in each of those cases, I \n     considered the particular factual context in which the \n     allegations against those persons arose and the history of \n     the matter. Moreover, even after finding the existence of a \n     potential conflict, I must consider whether under all the \n     circumstances discretionary appointment of an independent \n     counsel is appropriate. In each case, therefore, the final \n     decision has been an exercise of my discretion, as provided \n     for under the Act.\n       I have undertaken the same examination here. Based on the \n     facts as we know them now, I have not concluded that any \n     conflict of interest would ensue from our vigorous and \n     thorough investigation of the allegations contained in your \n     letter.\n       Your letter relies upon press reports, certain documents \n     and various public statements which you assert demonstrate \n     that ``officials at the highest level of the White House were \n     involved in formulating, coordinating and implementing the \n     [Democratic National Committee's (DNC's)] fundraising efforts \n     for the 1996 presidential campaign.'' You suggest that a \n     thorough investigation of ``fundraising improprieties'' will \n     therefore necessarily include an inquiry into the ``knowledge \n     and/or complicity of very senior White House officials,'' and \n     that the Department of Justice would therefore have a \n     conflict of interest investigating these allegations.\n       To the extent that ``improprieties'' comprise crimes, they \n     are being thoroughly investigated by the agents and \n     prosecutors assigned to the task force. Should that \n     investigation develop at any time specific and credible \n     evidence that any covered person may have committed a crime, \n     the Act will be triggered, and I will fulfill my \n     responsibilities under the Act. In addition, should that \n     investigation develop specific and credible evidence that a \n     crime may have been committed by a ``very senior'' White \n     House official who is not covered by the Act, I will decide \n     whether investigation of that person by the Department might \n     result in a conflict of interest, and, if so, whether the \n     discretionary clause should be invoked. Until then, however, \n     the mere fact that employees of the White House and the DNC \n     worked closely together in the course of President Clinton's \n     reelection campaign does not warrant appointment of an \n     independent counsel. As I have stated above, the Department \n     has a long history of investigating allegations of criminal \n     activity by high-ranking Government officials without fear or \n     favor, and will do so in this case.\n       I also do not accept the suggestion that there will be \n     widespread public distrust of the actions and conclusions of \n     the Department if it continues to investigate this matter, \n     creating a conflict of interest warranting the appointment of \n     an independent counsel. First, unless I find that the \n     investigation of a particular person against whom specific \n     and credible allegations have been made would pose a \n     conflict, I have no authority to utilize the procedures of \n     the Act. Moreover, I have confidence that the career \n     professionals in the Department will investigate this matter \n     in a fashion that will satisfy the American people that \n     justice has been done.\n       Finally, even were I to determine that a conflict of \n     interest of the sort contemplated by the statute exists in \n     this case--and as noted above I do not find such a conflict \n     at this time--there would be a number of weighty \n     considerations that I would have to consider in determining \n     whether to exercise my discretion to seek an independent \n     counsel at this time. Because invocation of the conflict \n     of interest provision is discretionary, it would still be \n     my responsibility in that circumstance to weigh all the \n     factors and determine whether appointment of an \n     independent counsel would best serve the national \n     interest. If in the future this investigation reveals \n     evidence indicating that a conflict of interest exists, \n     these factors will continue to weigh heavily in my \n     evaluation of whether or not to invoke the discretionary \n     provisions of the Act.\n       I assure you, once again, that allegations of violations of \n     Federal criminal law with respect to campaign financing in \n     the course of the 1996 Federal elections will be thoroughly \n     investigated and, if appropriate, prosecuted. At this point \n     it appears to me that that task should be performed by the \n     Department of Justice and its career investigators and \n     prosecutors. I want to emphasize, however, that the task \n     force continues to receive new information (much has been \n     discovered even since I received your letter), and I will \n     continue to monitor the investigation closely in light of my \n     responsibilities under the Independent Counsel Act. Should \n     future developments make it appropriate to invoke the \n     procedures of the Act, I will do so without hesitation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Janet Reno.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have circularized my intent to pursue \nthis amendment, and there is no other Senator on the floor now who \nseeks recognition. Before suggesting the absence of a quorum, let me \nsay that we had talked earlier about having a vote on the Kyl mendment \nat 5 o'clock this afternoon. We have not yet locked in that amendment, \nbut it is now being hot lined. It is my expectation that we will vote \nat 5 o'clock this afternoon on the Kyl amendment.\n  I now ask, Madam President, that anybody who opposes the sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution for independent counsel come to speak, anybody \nwho favors it come to speak, or if somebody has another amendment, come \nto speak. We will be glad to set this aside and proceed with the \nbusiness.\n  We also ask there be a hot line looking for a unanimous consent \nagreement later this afternoon, perhaps early evening, 6 o'clock, 6:30, \nto limit any further amendments which may be offered so that we may get \na calendar as to what we are going to do on this bill to proceed to \nthird reading and final disposition, because it is the intention of the \nmanagers to move for third reading if no other amendments are pending.\n  I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Ann McKinley, \na fellow on my staff, be granted the privilege of the floor during \nconsideration of the fiscal year 1998 Labor-HHS appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1056\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I actually will be \nbrief. I had a chance yesterday to speak in opposition to the amendment \nof my colleague from Arizona, Senator Kyl. I know that other Senators \nhave spoken about this as well.\n  I was on the floor early this morning when both Senator Specter and \nSenator Harkin spoke about it. Mr. President, the part of the Kyl \namendment which I am sympathetic to, and my guess is that a good many \nother Senators are sympathetic to it as well, would be the effort to \ntry to expand funding for the Pell Grant Program. And, Mr. President, \nas my colleague, Senator Harkin from Iowa, said earlier this morning, \ninterestingly enough, the Pell Grant Program, named after Claiborne \nPell, our Senator--I think all of us really came to admire and believe \nin Claiborne Pell--really does represent a kind of positive role for \nthe public sector, for Government, because what we as a country have \ndecided is that there are certain decisive areas of life in a\n\n[[Page S8708]]\n\nnation where you do not just leave it up to a market verdict.\n  If, in fact, you have a family, a young person or not such a young \nperson who cannot afford higher education, there is a role to make sure \nthat man or that woman can afford to go on to college, especially since \nthis is becoming more and more important in determining how they will \ndo economically or how their families will do.\n  Indeed, there is a statistic that is a shameful statistic that we \nhave had since the late 1970's, about an 8-percent graduation rate from \ncolleges and universities of those men and women from families with \nincomes under $20,000 a year, the main reason being that they have not \nbeen able to afford to go on and get their higher education.\n  I said this yesterday--and I will have an amendment that will try to \nspeak to this today or tomorrow--it is also true that with all the \ndiscussion about HOPE scholarships and tax credits, since they are not \nrefundable, all families with incomes below $28,000 a year are not \ngoing to become eligible. So we still have a huge hole, especially for \nthose students from moderate- and low-income families. So it seems to \nme, if we are going to be talking about providing support for higher \neducation and for families and for young men and women and older men \nand women--many of our students are older now in our community \ncolleges--we ought to make sure that low-income are included.\n  The problem with the Kyl amendment is that he takes the funding from \nthe LIHEAP, the Low-Income Energy Assistance Program, which is a \nlifeline program for very vulnerable families, especially for those of \nus who represent cold weather States, although part of low-income \nenergy assistance is also, I say to the Chair, since he is from the \ngreat State of North Carolina, some of it also is for cooling \nassistance. I think it was two summers ago that we had a number of \npeople in Chicago, poor people, who died, elderly people, from exposure \nto heat. They just could not afford air conditioning.\n  So, Mr. President, what the Kyl amendment does is it rescinds about \n$500 million, takes about half of what is in a $1 billion program--it \nhas already been cut way down--and it essentially ends the program.\n  Mr. President, I just want people to know, my colleagues to know--I \nthink they do--I think we are going to have a strong vote in opposition \nto the amendment, and that the vast majority of the recipients of an \nenergy grant is maybe $300 a year, or thereabouts. It is a lifeline \nprogram. It just enables an elderly person to be able to afford heat \nand not have to then spend more than she can afford and, therefore, not \nbe able to get ahold of a prescription drug she needs or maybe have to \ncut back on food on the table.\n  It is not much. It is extremely important. The vast majority of the \ncitizens--there are about 110,000 households in Minnesota that have \nparticipated, have incomes under $8,000 a year. These are not wealthy \npeople or middle-income people. These are people who are hard pressed. \nThis is a lifeline program. It represents the goodness in us. And we \ncannot be gutting this program.\n  I have been involved in this fight to kind of maintain or protect the \nLIHEAP program for the last 3 or 4 years. I do not know why we have to \ngo through this every time.\n  Mr. President, let me just make it clear that if you wanted to expand \nthe Pell Grant Program, I can think of other ways to do it. I mean, now \nwe know that with the B-2, the stealth bomber program, we have planes \nthat cannot fly in the rain or the snow. I mean, I will have an \namendment later on that will say, let us not build any more of these \nturkeys. And you can just transfer that funding for the Pell Grant \nProgram. But do not take it out of low-income energy assistance.\n  I see my colleague from Pennsylvania here. I thank him for his \ngraciousness in allowing me to have some time to speak about this. But \nagain, colleagues have heard it from the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nSenator Specter, Senator Harkin, any number of Senators who have come \nto the floor on this. And, again, I hope there will be a strong vote \nagainst the amendment.\n  It is extremely important. It is a matter of elementary decency, if \nyou will, to provide people with some support that they need. It is a \nlifeline support program. And I tell you, to a cold weather State like \nMinnesota, it is very important. We already know in Minnesota right now \nthat we are going to have to ask for some additional emergency energy \nassistance. We did last winter. That is what happens. This is an \nunderfunded program, not overfunded. The only reason I do not have an \namendment calling for more funding is I know the White House, the \nadministration, has been good about providing that emergency funding \nfor States that need it.\n  So, Mr. President, the last thing in the world that makes any sense \nis to essentially gut this program by rescinding $500 million. To all \nmy colleagues, I hope you will vote against this amendment. To Senator \nKyl, who is a Senator that I like and respect, I think you are \nprofoundly mistaken with this amendment, as much as I appreciate your \ngood work here. I hope that we will have a very strong bipartisan vote \nagainst this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by Senator \nKyl. I am reluctant to do so because I strongly support changes in the \neligibility rules for independent and dependent students for Pell \ngrants.\n  Congress needs to make changes in the eligibility rules for these \nstudents. Both independent students and dependent students are unfairly \ndisadvantaged by the rules now in effect. Today, single independent \nstudents at public 4-year institutions are not eligible for a Pell \ngrant if their income is over $10,000. Many of these students will not \nbenefit from the HOPE tax credit and the tax credit for lifelong \nlearning. Federal funds should be available to help them meet their \nmost basic college expenses.\n  A similar problem faces dependent students. The income protection \nallowance is so low for them that it has become a disincentive for \ncollege students to work part-time to help them contribute to college \ncosts. Over three-quarters of undergraduates work part-time while \nenrolled in college. The current system penalizes students who work \nduring the summer and part-time through the school year by reducing \ntheir Pell grant eligibility. We should be encouraging students to take \npart-time jobs, rather than take out additional loans.\n  The budget agreement contains a commitment to allocate $700 million \nfor changes to the needs analysis formula under the Pell grants. The \nHouse appropriations subcommittee provided over $500 million toward \nthis commitment, but the Senate bill contains no funds for this needed \nchange.\n  I am working with others in Congress and with the Department of \nEducation to ensure that a satisfactory appropriation level is \ncontained in the final bill.\n  Senator Kyl supports making funds available to reform the needs \nanalysis. But unfortunately, to pay for the reform, he makes a deep cut \nin the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program.\n  For the 5 million beneficiaries of LIHEAP across the Nation, \nincluding 120,000 in Massachusetts, it will be an unnecessarily harsh \nwinter if this important program is slashed.\n  Some 95 percent of the households receiving LIHEAP assistance have \nannual incomes below $18,000. They spend an extremely burdensome 18 \npercent of their income on energy, compared to the average middle-class \nfamily, which spends only 4 percent.\n  Researchers at Boston City Hospital have documented a ``heat or eat \neffect.'' Higher utility bills during the coldest months force low-\nincome families to spend less money on food. The result is increased \nmalnutrition among children.\n  Almost twice as many low-weight and undernourished children were \nadmitted to Boston City Hospital's emergency room immediately following \nthe coldest month of the winter. No family should have to choose \nbetween heating and eating.\n  Low-income elderly will be at the greatest risk if LIHEAP funds are \nslashed, because they are the most vulnerable to hypothermia. In fact, \nolder Americans accounted for more than half of all hypothermia deaths \nin 1991.\n  In addition, the elderly are much more likely to live in homes built \nbefore 1940, which are less energy efficient and put them at greater \nrisk.\n  Low-income elderly who have trouble paying their fuel bills are often \ndriven\n\n[[Page S8709]]\n\nto rely on room heaters, fireplaces, ovens, and wood-burning stoves to \nsave money. Between 1986 and 1990, these higher-risk heating sources \nwere the second leading cause of fire deaths among the elderly. In \nfact, elderly citizens are up to 12 times more likely to die in \nheating-related fires than adults under 65.\n  LIHEAP is a lifeline for Massachusetts and many other cold weather \nStates. I hope we can work together to make the needs analysis changes \nin the Pell grants, without denying this lifeline to a very vulnerable \ngroup. I urge that the Kyl amendment be defeated.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to join with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Specter and the \nsubcommittee's ranking member Senator Harkin, in opposition to Senator \nKyl's amendment to cut funding for the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program [LIHEAP]. While I applaud the Senator from Arizona's \ngoal to increase funding for Pell grants, I can not sanction a move \nthat would essentially gut the LIHEAP program, effectively depriving \nmillions of the disadvantaged, elderly, and disabled of critical \nassistance.\n  Mr. President, the appropriation for LIHEAP has declined more than 50 \npercent over the past decade, down from $2.1 billion in fiscal 1985. \nDuring that time, the eligible population has grown from 23 to 30 \nmillion. In Vermont, Federal cutbacks have forced the State to push \nback the deadline for applying for fuel aid to September 2. Mr. \nPresident, I strongly disagree with the contention that the need for \nfuel assistance has declined since the program's founding. Last winter, \ntwo-thirds of the 1,400 Vermonters who missed the State's benefits \ndeadline were denied assistance; and the number of people who ran out \nof fuel and requested emergency aid doubled.\n  Mr. President, Federal cutbacks since 1995 have reduced the number of \nfamilies in Vermont that receive assistance from over 24,000 to around \n12,000 this year. These families should not face the prospect of \nfurther cutbacks.\n  Mr. President, I want to emphasize to the program's critics that \nLIHEAP helps the neediest of the needy. As others have already stated, \nalmost 70 percent of recipient families have an annual income of less \nthan $8,000, and 44 percent have at least one member who is elderly and \n20 percent have one member who is disabled. Currently, only 5 million \nfamilies are being served nationally, a million less than 2 years ago.\n  Mr. President, this is a time to increase funding for LIHEAP not \ndecrease it. Last month, as cochair of the Northeast-Midwest Senate \nCoalition, I spearheaded a letter to Senators Specter and Harkin that \nasked for an increase in regular funding for LIHEAP so that the program \nis not forced to rely on releases of emergency funds to meet basic \nneeds. Fifty-five Senators signed on to this letter.\n  Mr. President, the Appropriations Committee should be commended for \nrecognizing that the need for LIHEAP is greater than current resources. \nThe committee has included $1.2 billion in so-called advance funds for \nfiscal 1999. I urge my colleagues to overwhelmingly reject this \namendment to cut LIHEAP and support Senators Specter and Harkin in \ntheir effort to increase LIHEAP funding in fiscal 1999.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there has been a hotline run, that is to \nsay, Senators on both sides of the aisle have been notified, and I now \nask unanimous consent that a vote occur on or in relation to the \npending Kyl amendment at 5 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I again renew the request that any \nSenator who has an amendment to offer should come to the floor. And \nagain I say that we are going to be seeking a unanimous-consent \nagreement to limit amendments which were filed, trying to get that \naccomplished by late afternoon or early evening.\n  Again, in the absence of any Senator on the floor seeking \nrecognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the pending amendment. I \nunderstand we will soon vote on the amendment of the Senator from \nArizona, Senator Kyl. I wanted to take just a moment to address that \namendment that is before the body.\n  Mr. President, Senator Kyl has suggested that we increase Pell grant \nfunding by $528 million. That is a worthy goal. That is something that \nI would like to see done. But he suggests paying for it by taking that \nmoney out of the low-income heating assistance program.\n  The Senator from Arizona experiences a different reality than the one \nI experience. The Senator from Arizona says the energy crisis is over; \nthe need for low-income heating assistance has ended. I could not \ndisagree more. We have just had in my State the worst winter in our \nhistory. In fact, we saw heating oil prices spike significantly, with \nnatural gas hitting an all-time high. Propane spiked dramatically, \nhitting an all-time high.\n  Mr. President, this is not the time to end the low-income heating \nassistance program. We just went through a winter in which not only did \nwe have the worst winter in terms of snowfall in our history, but we \nhad, if I am not mistaken, eight blizzards and nine major winter \nstorms. We also had the most powerful winter storm in 50 years in the \nfirst week of April.\n  Mr. President, that was devastating in my State. In fact, this \ncollection of storms was devastating in my State. Low-income heating \nassistance played a key role in helping people who are faced with the \nchoice between heating and eating. That is not a choice anybody should \nhave to make in this country.\n  So, while I certainly support the underlying intention of the Senator \nfrom Arizona to increase assistance for Pell grants, I would simply \npoint to the record of what we have already done.\n  We have a $1 billion increase for Pell grants in this legislation; \nfunding of $6.9 billion for Pell grants. Again, I would like to see \nthat increased further. But I don't think the way to fund it is to \ndramatically reduce what is available for low-income heating \nassistance. This bill has $1 billion for fiscal year 1998 in low-income \nheating assistance and $300 million in an emergency contingency fund. \nTo cut back by $528 million to add to Pell grants I don't think can be \njustified.\n  So I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing the Kyl amendment, not \nbecause I am opposed to an increase in Pell grants but because I am \nopposed to taking it out of low-income heating assistance at a time \nwhen we have just experienced in the northern plains the worst winter \nin our history, and, if the almanac is to be believed, we may be faced \nwith another tough winter this year. I hope that is not the case, but \nif it is, low-income heating assistance may make the difference between \npeople making a decision of heating versus eating. Again, that is not a \ndecision anybody should have to make.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we be given an \nextra 5 minutes past 5 o'clock to make statements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S8710]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/03/senate-section/article/S8693-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8693-S8710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is amendment 1056, \noffered by Senator Kyl of Arizona.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1056\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Kyl \namendment to the fiscal 1998 Labor, Health and Education appropriations \nbill, which would devastate an already underfunded Low-Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program. Although I am a strong supporter of the Pell \nGrant Program, which provides critical assistance and access for needy \nstudents, I cannot support the Kyl amendment, knowing that it will \nreduce the low-income fuel assistance limited funding.\n  I regret the Senator from Arizona has offered this amendment to \nreduce the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program in order to \nprovide an increase to the Pell Grant Program. I hope we can follow the \nHouse lead in this regard, by providing an increase in the Pell Grant \nProgram but without affecting the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram. The bottom line is LIHEAP provides invaluable assistance to \nlow-income and elderly households in America that must not be \nsacrificed. Make no mistake about it, this means-tested program is \nspecifically targeted to those who already are in desperate need of \nfinancial assistance. To be precise, according to the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, more than two-thirds of the households \nreceiving Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program assistance have \nannual incomes of less than $8,000 a year, and more than half have \nincomes below $6,000 a year.\n  While I believe that all programs must be asked to contribute their \nfair share in our efforts to balance the budget, it is worth noting \nthat the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program has already taken \nmore than its fair share of budget cuts in recent years. Overall, the \nfunding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program has fallen \nconsistently and dramatically since 1985. In fiscal year 1985, the \nprogram received $2.1 billion. This year, it will receive $1 billion. \nIn real terms, this represents a cut of more than 65 percent. Yet, \ndespite this dramatic cut, the Senator from Arizona is proposing we \nfurther reduce this critically important but limited low-income \nassistance funding by an additional $528 million, or 53 percent of its \nalready paltry budget.\n  Furthermore, we should not be proposing a cut to a program that is \nalready woefully underfunded and serves only a minority of its eligible \nrecipients. Because of past spending cuts, LIHEAP now provides benefits \nto only 20 percent of all eligible households. This means that 80 \npercent of America's households meet the income qualifications to \nreceive benefits, but there is simply not enough money to provide \nassistance to them all. Needless to say, this proposed $528 million \nreduction represents a very real risk of keeping many low-income \nfamilies from being able to heat their homes in the winters ahead, even \nas it eviscerates a program that has already contributed more than its \nfair share to deficit reduction.\n  It is also worth noting that even for those families that do receive \nLow-Income Home Energy Assistance Program benefits, it is not a very \nhigh sum. In my home State of Maine, the average benefit last year was \n$308. In the midst of a severely cold winter, that $308 was the only \nway that 33,000 low-income and elderly Mainers were able to heat their \nhomes. So, although a $528 million reduction may seem small in the \noverall budget of the U.S. Government, and $308 may not sound like much \nto many people, it means a great deal to the residents of my State who \ndo not want to be forced this winter into the position of choosing \nbetween heat and food.\n  The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program has already taken more \nthan its fair share of reductions since its inception back in 1981, and \nsimply cannot afford any further reductions in this very critical \nprogram. Any additional cut in this already underfunded program \nrepresents a very serious risk to low-income and elderly households in \nmy State of Maine and all the cold weather regions of this country that \nrely on this very important, essential program.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the Kyl \namendment and adopting the approach that has been taken by the House \nthat provides for increased support for the Pell Grant Program but \nwithout reducing LIHEAP that is so critical to many people in my State \nand so many other States who are located in cold weather areas of our \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to begin by thanking Senator \nSpecter and the members of the Labor, Education, HHS appropriations \nsubcommittee for bringing this bill to the floor.\n  This bill contains a much needed funding increase for the National \nInstitutes of Health. Earlier this year I joined with 97 of my \ncolleagues in this Senate body in voting for a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment calling for a doubling of NIH funding over the next 5 years. \nThe bill that we have in front of us today represents a substantial \nstep forward. It increases funding for NIH from $12.7 to $13.69 \nbillion. This funding, simply, Mr. President, will save lives.\n  There are two measures in this bill that I would like to call to the \nattention of my colleagues, and that I believe deserve special mention. \nEarlier this year I introduced, along with Senator Kennedy and Senator \nBond, a bill which would establish a pediatric research initiative \nwithin the Office of the Director of NIH. Senator Kennedy and I and \nSenator Bond, along with many sponsors of that bill, have worked hard \nto develop a proposal that we feel helps place appropriate emphasis on \npediatric research while at the same time supporting the scientific \njudgment so important to the success of NIH.\n  The value of this initiative really is without question. Research \nbreakthroughs to treat pediatric illnesses have been enormously \neffective both in reducing costs and, more important, in freeing young \nchildren from a lifetime of illness and disability. From vaccines to \ntreat polio to surfactant replacement to prevent respiratory distress \nsyndrome, research has saved hundreds of millions of dollars and \nimproved the lives of millions of children.\n  Recently, the Public Health and Safety Subcommittee of the Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee held a hearing on NIH reauthorization. During \nthe hearing, a distinguished panel of pediatric researchers from NIH \nand also from the private sector described some of the enormous \nopportunities that now exist for scientific progress in combating and \nin preventing diseases affecting children. Their testimony dramatically \nunderscored the critical need for additional emphasis and increased \nsupport for pediatric research.\n  Last year, the Labor, Education, and HHS appropriations subcommittee, \nchaired by Senator Specter, allocated $5 million as an initial \ndownpayment toward the pediatric research initiative. This year the \nappropriations subcommittee has allocated $20 million toward this \ninitiative. I personally thank Chairman Specter and the members of his \nsubcommittee for their continued commitment to pediatric research. By \nrecognizing the critical need to encourage and promote pediatric \nresearch, the committee has really helped ensure the next generation of \nAmericans grows up to be healthy, productive members of our society.\n  Mr. President, the second provision I would like to talk about in \nthis bill is the funding for substance abuse and mental health \nservices. Without the provision contained in this bill, some States \nwould have faced massive cuts in the funding for their programs to help \npeople with substance abuse and/or mental health problems. My own State \nof Ohio would have faced a devastating funding cut of more than 20 \npercent, our neighboring State to the north, Michigan, would have \nreceived a cut of 19 percent, and other States would have also been \nseriously hurt. Among the important programs threatened by these cuts \nwould have been the\n\n[[Page S8694]]\n\nagencies promoting early intervention with young people to help them \nfind alternatives to getting involved with drugs and crime. I have long \nbelieved that the problem of at-risk youth in this country is one for \nwhich an ounce of prevention truly is worth a pound of cure. The sooner \nwe can reach these young people, the better off we will be in our \nefforts to help them avoid the tragedy of lifetime addiction.\n  The SAMHSA provision contained in this bill averts the awful \nconsequences of the proposed funding cuts. It is a good measure and \ndeserves strong support of the entire U.S. Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, starting yesterday morning at 11 o'clock, \nin conjunction with scheduling from the majority leader, Senator Lott, \nand the ranking member on this subcommittee, Senator Harkin, we asked \nthat amendments be brought with the hope of concluding action on this \nbill today, and that all amendments be submitted, first, by the end of \nbusiness yesterday or no later than noon today. We have not had a great \ndeal of business.\n  The one exception would be an amendment which would deal with \nprohibiting Federal funding for testing, which the administration has \nin mind. Congressman Goodling had announced his intention to seek that \nkind of prohibition in the House.\n  There had been comments yesterday that someone would offer that kind \nof legislation on the Senate side. The distinguished presiding officer, \nSenator Judd Gregg, said, with a pointed finger, it was he. I don't \nwant to name names here, but I am prepared to identify those who are \nwilling to be identified.\n  I received a telephone call from the Secretary of Education, Richard \nRiley, yesterday afternoon, as did Senator Harkin and others. It seems \nto me that might be one matter we might put over until tomorrow and \nschedule the hearing at 9 o'clock to find the specifics as to whether \nthat ought to be done. There is a sense that testing, in general, would \nbe a good idea, but maybe it ought not to be done by the Federal \nGovernment. There is a great deal of concern about having the Federal \nGovernment move into the field of education. So we are going to move \nahead at that time.\n  Mr. President, I intend to offer an amendment later this afternoon \ncalling for a sense of the Senate for the appointment of independent \ncounsel. Although that is obviously not germane to an appropriations \nbill on Labor, Health, Human Services and Education, it is a practice \nin the Senate, with some repetition, to offer extraneous amendments, \ncertainly sense-of-the-Senate resolutions.\n  I had stated my intention to deal with this issue last July 24 and \nspoke extensively on the Senate floor on the appropriations bill \npending at that time about my concern that independent counsel ought to \nbe appointed based on the state of the record. Then when it was \napparent that would tie up that bill, and the majority leader and the \nminority leader both wanted to move ahead, I said on July 25 that I \nwould not pursue this sense-of-the-Senate resolution at that time and \nwaited an additional month.\n  I do believe that we urgently need appointment of independent counsel \nat the present time. I base that judgment on a series of letters which \nhave been written by a variety of Members of Congress to the Attorney \nGeneral, and she has declined to do so--a formal letter written by the \nmajority members of the Judiciary Committee calling on the Attorney \nGeneral to appoint independent counsel, and she has declined to do so.\n  Then we had extensive hearings last April 30 on the Judiciary \nCommittee where I questioned Attorney General Reno about the \nwithholding of information from the President on national security \nmatters, which appear to me to be a highly questionable thing to do, \nand that the President was publicly quoted saying that those national \nsecurity matters had been withheld from him and he thought he should \nhave been given access to those matters.\n\n  In our constitutional Government it is my judgment that the rule is \nplain, that those are matters for the President as long as he is the \nPresident. There are ways to alter his status as President, but as long \nas he is the President, it is not up to an appointed Attorney General \nto make the decision that the President does not get national security \ninformation because, as the Attorney General testified, he was a \npotential suspect in a pending investigation. The damage about such a \ndisclosure to a potential subject, in my view, is far, far less \ndangerous than having national security information withheld from the \nPresident of the United States.\n  But it did seem to me that in that context that if the matter was \nserious enough to withhold information from the President, that \ncertainly the independent counsel statute ought to be triggered. That \nis the statute which provides for an independent lawyer to come in and \nhandle the case where it involves certain levels of Federal Government \nenumerated officials such as the President and the Vice President and \nCabinet officers, especially in the context where Attorney General Reno \ntestified in her confirmation hearings about her view of the importance \nof independent counsel.\n  There is also the question about the advertisements. According to \nChief of Staff Leon Panetta, and also Dick Morris, the President's \npolitical adviser, advertisements had been edited, drafted, essentially \nwritten by the President himself. There would be no question that there \nwould be coordination in violation of the Federal statute prohibiting \ncoordination if those in fact were advocacy commercials. We went \nthrough the commercials with the Attorney General. This was done on \nboth sides. But the ones that were edited by the President extolled the \nPresident's virtues and decried his opponent's alleged failings, but \nfell short of saying vote for x or vote against y. By any reasonable \nstandard, those were advocacy commercials, but they were viewed as \nbeing instead issue commercials and did not constitute a violation of \nthe statute which prohibits coordination.\n  Well, that plus a great many other factors, I think, have set the \nstage for the need for independent counsel. We have had disclosures in \nthis morning's Washington Post about funds being raised by the Vice \nPresident which were hard money and not soft money. The Attorney \nGeneral had previously said that if it is soft money it is not a \ncontribution under the Federal election laws, a judgment or \ninterpretation which is inexplicable, in my opinion. It is a \ncontribution nonetheless.\n  Hundreds of millions of dollars were put into the campaigns on both \nsides, Democrats and Republicans. But now there has been the forceful \nallegation made, information that a good bit of the money raised by the \nVice President was hard money, and that would take away the last \nvestige as to what Attorney General Reno had said justified her refusal \nto appoint independent counsel.\n  So it is my intention, Mr. President, to call for a vote on this \namendment that I send to the desk at this time so that it may be filed \nand reviewed by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Later this \nafternoon I do intend to offer it, and in fact had thought I would \noffer it when I sought recognition. But I see my colleague, Senator \nDorgan, has come to the floor. I understand he intends to offer an \namendment of his own. So I will defer offering this amendment at this \ntime, but I will speak about it to this extent, to put my colleagues on \nnotice that this issue will be on the floor at the conclusion of the \nDorgan amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor so my colleague, Senator \nDorgan, may proceed.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S8695]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 1068\n\n(Purpose: To increase the funding for heart and stroke research by the \nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of \n   Health, with an offset relating to funding for the buildings and \n            facilities of the National Institutes of Health)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that floor \nprivileges be granted to Jeff Hoffman of my staff.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator from \nPennsylvania allowing me to offer this amendment at this time. I \nappreciate the cooperation of the Senator from Pennsylvania and the \nSenator from Iowa for their work on this legislation. I am going to \ntalk just a bit about my amendment. Before I do, however, let me \ncommend both Senator Specter and Senator Harkin for the work they have \ndone on this piece of legislation.\n  My amendment specifically deals with funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and \nspecifically an interest I have in trying to provide additional \nresources for NHLBI to be used to provide funding vitally needed for \ncardiovascular disease research.\n  I am proposing $8 million be added to the Heart, Lung, and Blood \nInstitute that I hope would be used for that purpose. The offset is \nfrom a corresponding reduction in the NIH buildings and facilities \naccount. I believe that both the chairman and the ranking member, at \nthe conclusion of my comments, will accept this amendment and for that \nI am grateful.\n  It is undoubtedly true, as people watch the proceedings of the U.S. \nSenate, that many of us come to the floor of the Senate to talk about \nlegislation that we think is necessary based on our personal \nexperiences and observations. That has certainly been true with respect \nto a couple of issues I have worked on, including cardiovascular \ndisease research.\n  Madam President, I have a very personal interest in this, as others \ndo. I have lost a daughter to heart disease. I have another daughter \nwho has a heart defect that we hope, God willing, will not need surgery \nin the future. But I have spent enough time in cardiologists' offices \nand I have spent enough time talking about cardiovascular disease to \nunderstand that we must continue to substantially increase funding for \nresearch on cardiovascular disease.\n  I have been involved, along with Senator Frist, as a Senate cochair \nof the Congressional Heart and Stroke Coalition to try to provide \nadditional attention to the issue of heart disease and stroke and the \nneed for greater research into these diseases.\n  Many Americans are unaware of the extent and scope of heart disease \nand stroke, even though virtually all of us has a friend or loved one \nwho has been affected by cardiovascular disease, so I would like to \nshare some startling facts.\n  Heart disease has been this country's No. 1 killer since 1919 for \nboth men and women.\n  Stroke continues to be the No. 3 killer in this country and the \nleading cause of disability in America.\n  One in five Americans, more than 57 million people, suffer from one \nor more types of cardiovascular disease, including close to 14 million \nliving with symptomatic coronary heart disease.\n  One in two women will eventually die of heart disease or stroke.\n  About one-sixth of cardiovascular disease deaths are among people \nunder the age of 65.\n  In 1979 there were 1.2 million cardiovascular operations and \nprocedures performed in this country. That number climbed to 4.65 \nmillion in 1994, close to a fourfold increase.\n  The number of Americans suffering from congestive heart failure has \ngrown to about 5 million, with hospital discharges rising from 377,000 \nin 1979 to 874,000 in 1994.\n  More Americans die from heart attack and stroke each year than from \nAIDS, cancer, and diabetes combined. Let me repeat that because I think \nit is important. More Americans die from heart attack and stroke each \nyear than from AIDS, cancer, and diabetes combined.\n  I do not come to the floor of the Senate to in any way suggest that \nwe ought to enhance research funding on one disease at the expense of \ncritically needed research funding for others. I have supported \nsubstantial research for AIDS, supported efforts to improve research \nand treatment of diabetes and cancer. In fact, I have supported a \nsubstantial increase in funding for the National Institutes of Health \nand I voted earlier this year to double funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health over the next five years. I think this would be a \nwonderful investment for our country.\n  I have become increasingly concerned, however, with what has been \nhappening with respect to the amount of money spent on heart disease \nresearch. Even with the significant increases that Congress has been \ngiving the National Institutes of Health over the past decade, funding \nfor heart disease research specifically has simply not kept pace. In \nfact, heart disease research at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood \nInstitute has decreased by 4.8 percent in constant dollars over the \nlast decade, while the NIH overall budget has increased by 31 percent \nin constant dollars.\n  A step toward rectifying this concern was taken this year. For that I \ncommend Senator Specter and Senator Harkin. They have provided in this \nbill a $99.4 million increase for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood \nInstitute, the third largest dollar increase among the NIH institutes. \nBut even with this increase, if we look beyond the surface, we can see \nthat, without my amendment, the funding for cardiovascular disease \nresearch would continue to decrease relative to the overall budget.\n  The $8 million that my amendment would add would bring the National \nHeart, Lung, and Blood Institute budget up to the same 7.5-percent \nlevel of increase as the overall budget at the National Institutes of \nHealth. It is my hope that this funding would be devoted to \ncardiovascular disease research.\n  It is interesting to visit the Bethesda campus of the National \nInstitutes of Health. I encourage my colleagues to do so. There are \nwonderful men and women working there doing remarkable, breathtaking \nresearch on a wide range of issues. I have talked to physicians doing \nresearch in the area of cardiovascular disease and what they are doing \nis remarkable. It has already saved lives and can save even more lives \nwith additional resources.\n  We now routinely see people with advanced heart disease with symptoms \nthat in previous decades would have caused death. Today, these patients \nare able to undergo procedures and operations that allow them to \ncontinue to lead productive, active lives. These advances are the \nwonderful result of an investment in research. We can do much, much \nmore.\n\n  I said I don't want to decrease research funding for other diseases. \nIn fact, I would like to substantially increase the amount of funding \nfor the NIH generally, far above its current level, because I think the \nrewards for the people in our country and around the world would be \nsubstantial.\n  It should be noted, however, that heart disease and stroke receive \none-twentieth of the research funding per death of AIDS, cancer, and \ndiabetes combined. Now if you divide the amount spent on research into \nthe number of people who are dying from various diseases, it is clear \nthat the amount of research funding invested in cardiovascular disease \nis not keeping pace. That is why I offer this amendment.\n  This amendment has the strong support of the American Heart \nAssociation, the Association of Black Cardiologists, Mended Hearts, \nInc., and the\n\n[[Page S8696]]\n\nNational Coalition for Heart and Stroke Research. I ask unanimous \nconsent that letters from these organizations in support of my \namendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   American Heart Association,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 29, 1997.\n     Hon. Byron Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: On behalf of the 57.5 million \n     Americans suffering from heart attack, stroke and other \n     cardiovascular diseases, the American Heart Association \n     strongly supports your amendment to the Labor-HHS-Education \n     Appropriation bill. The AHA commends your leadership and \n     initiative in offering an amendment to increase the funding \n     pool for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute \n     (NHLBI) by $8 million, targeted specifically for additional \n     heart and stroke-related research. Cardiovascular diseases, \n     America's No. 1 killer and a leading cause of disability, \n     suffer from disproportionately low research funding.\n       As various indicators show, there has been a dramatic \n     increase in the prevalence of heart disease and stroke, with \n     an unparalleled cost to our society that threatens our \n     future. More than 1 in 5 Americans of all ages suffer from \n     heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases. These \n     diseases consume about 1 of 6 health care dollars, with a \n     price tag of an estimated $259 billion in medical expenses \n     and lost productivity in 1997. Heart diseases and stroke \n     represent 4 of the top 5 hospital costs to the health care \n     system for all payers, excluding childbirth and its \n     complications, and 4 of the top 5 Medicare hospital costs.\n       In constant dollars from FY 1986 to FY 1996 funding for the \n     NHLBI extramural Heart Program decreased 5.5 percent. In a \n     recent nationwide survey 79 percent and 77 percent of \n     respondents support more federal funding for heart and stroke \n     research, respectively.\n       Our government's response to the heart disease and stroke \n     problem today will help define the health and well being of \n     Americans in the next century. Now is the time to capitalize \n     on progress in understanding cardiovascular diseases when \n     breakthroughs are on the horizon. Promising research \n     opportunities will result in better treatment, prevention and \n     even cures for heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular \n     diseases. A significant increase in research funding will \n     reduce premature death, improve quality of life, cut health \n     care costs and enhance America's scientific competitiveness.\n       Thank you for your consistent leadership in the battle \n     against heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular \n     diseases.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         Martha Hill, Ph.D., R.N.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Association of Black\n\n\n                                          Cardiologists, Inc.,\n\n                                   Atlanta, GA, September 2, 1997.\n     Hon. Byron Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: The Association of Black Cardiologists \n     (ABC), is pleased that you have offered amendment S. 1061, \n     the FY 1998 Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill to \n     increase resources for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood \n     Institute (NHLB) by $8 million, targeted specifically for \n     additional heart and stroke-related research. The Association \n     of Black Cardiologists (ABC), enthusiastically supports your \n     amendment. Our 600 plus members vigorously support this \n     amendment, and believe it is vital to the health of our \n     constituents.\n       Despite progress, heart attack, stroke and other \n     cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of death in \n     the United States and a main cause of disability. Over 57 \n     million Americans . . . more than 1 in 5, are afflicted by \n     one or more cardiovascular diseases. It is even severe \n     contact more in African Americans. Heart attack, stroke and \n     other cardiovascular diseases will cost this nation an \n     estimated $259 billion in medical expenses and loss of work \n     place productivity in 1997.\n       An increase in research funding for NHLB heart and stroke-\n     related research is critical to reduce premature death, \n     improve quality of life, cut health care costs and enhance \n     America's economic competitiveness. An overwhelming number of \n     respondents in a recent nationwide survey supports more \n     federal funding of heart and stroke research, 79% and 77% \n     respectively. However, in FY 1986 constant dollars, funding \n     for the NHLBI Heart Program decreased 5.5% from FY 1986 to FY \n     1996.\n       Promising scientific opportunities in the battle against \n     cardiovascular diseases could be realized with more resources \n     for research. This is the time to capitalize on the progress \n     in understanding cardiovascular diseases.\n       The Association of Black Cardiologists applauds your \n     leadership in the fight against these killer diseases and \n     commends your initiative in offering this amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       B. Waine Kong, Ph.D., M.D.,\n     Chief Operating Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      The Mended Hearts, Inc.,\n\n                                    Dallas, TX, September 2, 1997.\n     Hon. Byron Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: Mended Hearts is a national voluntary \n     organization of people who have heart disease, their spouses, \n     family members, caregivers and medical professionals. Mended \n     Hearts actively supports your floor amendment to the FY 1998 \n     Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related \n     Agencies Appropriation bill that increases the funding pool \n     for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) by \n     $8 million, targeted specifically for additional heart and \n     stroke-related research.\n       About 20 million Americans of all ages live with the \n     ramifications of heart disease. Of this group, nearly 13.7 \n     million, including about 7 million under age 60, live with \n     the effects of heart attack and about 5 million suffer from \n     congestive heart failure, the leading cause of \n     hospitalization for Americans age 65 and older. Heart defects \n     are the most common birth defect, the major cause of birth \n     defects-related infant deaths and a considerable cause of \n     childhood disability.\n       The prevalence of heart disease is rising rapidly, with a \n     tremendous economic toll on the economy of the United States. \n     For example, in 1994 there were 4.7 million cardiovascular \n     operations and procedures, compared to 1.2 million in 1979--a \n     fourfold increase.\n       It is estimated that heart attack, stroke and other \n     cardiovascular diseases will cost this nation $259 billion in \n     medical expenses and lost output in 1997. Despite the \n     seriousness and overwhelming costs of these diseases, in \n     constant dollars from FY 1986 to FY 1996 funding for the \n     NHLBI Heart Program decreased 5.5 percent.\n       On behalf of the 24,000 members of Mended Hearts in 220 \n     chapters nationwide, I commend your championship and \n     leadership in the battle against heart disease. Your \n     amendment will have a far reaching impact on the main cause \n     of death in the United States--heart disease. Promising \n     research opportunities for innovative cost-effective \n     approaches to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of \n     heart disease can be developed with these needed resources.\n       Thank you for your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Charles Christmas,\n     National President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            National Coalition for\n\n\n                                    Heart and Stroke Research,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 2, 1997.\n     Hon. Byron Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: The National Coalition for Heart and \n     Stroke Research, enthusiastically supports your amendment to \n     S. 1061, the FY 1998 Labor-HHS-Education Appropriation bill \n     to increase resources for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood \n     Institute (NHLBI) by $8 million, targeted specifically for \n     additional heart and stroke-related research. Your amendment \n     is critical to the health of all Americans.\n       About 57 million Americans--more than 1 in 5--are afflicted \n     by one or more cardiovascular diseases. Heart attack, stroke \n     and other cardiovascular diseases will cost this nation an \n     estimated $259 billion in medical expenses and lost \n     productivity in 197. These diseases place a heavy burden on \n     America's health care system, absorbing about 1 of 6 health \n     care dollars. Excluding childbirth and its complications, \n     heart diseases and stroke make up 4 of the top 5 hospital \n     costs for all players, and 4 of the top 5 Medicare hospital \n     costs.\n       Despite progress, heart attack, stroke and other \n     cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of death in \n     the United States and a main cause of disability.\n       An increase in research funding for NHLBI heart and stroke-\n     related-research is critical to reduce premature death, \n     improve quality of life, cut health care costs and enhance \n     America's economic competitiveness. Many Americans agree! An \n     overwhelming number of respondents in a recent nationwide \n     survey support more federal funding for heart and stroke \n     research, 79 percent and 77 percent, respectively. However, \n     in FY 1986 constant dollars, funding for the NHLBI extramural \n     Heart Program decreased 5.5 percent from FY 1986 to FY 1996.\n       Promising scientific opportunities in the battle against \n     cardiovascular diseases could be realized with more resources \n     for research. This is the time to capitalize on progress in \n     understanding cardiovascular diseases.\n       The National Coalition for Heart and Stroke Research \n     applauds your leadership in the fight against these killer \n     diseases and commends your initiative in offering this \n     amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                      Renee Smith, Representative.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, it is my hope that in some small way, \nwith this small step, a researcher will now unlock one more mystery of \nhow the human heart works.\n  I mentioned the wonderful discoveries that are made through research \nand the wonderful treatments that are provided in our hospitals in the \narea of cardiology, and yet there is so much we still do not know. \nThose of us who have waited through heart surgery with members of our \nfamily know that when you talk to the cardiovascular surgeons they will \ntell you that there are times when they simply don't know what has \ncaused this or that condition.\n\n[[Page S8697]]\n\n  It seems to me more and more research can unlock those mysteries and \ngive us the opportunity to save more and more lives in this country \nthat otherwise would be lost to this insidious enemy called heart \ndisease.\n  With that, I thank very much the chairman and the ranking member and \nask that my amendment be favorably considered. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nNorth Dakota for offering this amendment. I agree with him about the \nimportance of additional funding for pulmonary research, for heart \nresearch. It is a major killer in the United States. We ought to be \ndoing everything we can to investigate, find cures and implement them.\n  The amendment which has been offered carries an offset on \nadministration and it has been modified from what the Senator from \nNorth Dakota had originally suggested, which would have been \nearmarking, which poses problems, because we do not earmark but instead \nleave that designation to the National Institutes of Health so we do \nnot have excessive management or micromanagement by the Congress as to \nwhat the NIH funds must have. I think Senator Dorgan made a forceful \nstatement that those funds ought to be directed in that way, and the \nofficials at NIH will have that before them. I am confident they will \nmake every effort they can to carry out the intent with which my \ncolleague has expressed here.\n  We have vast sums of money at NIH. We are increasing it. It is $952 \nmillion now, and is up to $13.7 billion. Notwithstanding all that \nfunding, there are many applications which are not granted. This one \nexpresses what the Senator from North Dakota thinks ought to be done.\n  I am advised Senator Harkin is off the floor now attending a \ncommittee meeting and necessarily absent, but I am advised by his staff \nthat Senator Harkin finds this amendment acceptable, as do I, as \nmanager for the majority. We accept the amendment.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1068) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1070\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent the pending amendment be set \naside, and I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1070.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, insert after the last section \n     (preceding the short title) the following new section:\n       Sec.   . (a) Prohibition of Funds for National Testing in \n     Reading and Mathematics.--None of the funds made available in \n     this Act may be used to develop, plan, implement, or \n     administer any national testing program in reading or \n     mathematics.\n       (b) Exceptions.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to the \n     following:\n       (1) The National Assessment of Educational Progress carried \n     out under sections 411 through 413 of the Improving America's \n     Schools Act of 1994 (20 U.S.C. 9010-9012).\n       (2) The Third International Math and Science Study (TIMSS).\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, as the excellent chairman of the labor \nsubcommittee of the Appropriations Committee mentioned earlier, there \nis a pending issue which is of considerable significance which has \narisen in the last few weeks as a result of the question of how we are \ngoing to pursue national testing. The chairman of the committee has \nmentioned he would hope this issue, from the standpoint of an amendment \nto the bill, would be taken up for final vote tomorrow sometime. I am \ncertainly agreeable to that.\n  However, it had been my intention, along with Senator Coats, to offer \nan amendment today on this issue, and in talking it over with the \nchairman he suggested we offer the amendment and then hold the vote \nuntil tomorrow. That certainly is an approach which I am perfectly \nhappy to follow.\n  This amendment, which is basically directed at codifying what we \nunderstand now to be the President's position--and we say ``now'' \nbecause the President's position on national testing appears to have \nundergone a transformation at some fairly high level of significance. \nIt reflects that decision by the President to no longer push national \ntesting as something that should be controlled and directed by the \nDepartment of Education but rather to have national testing to the \nextent it be developed by independent agencies. Using the term \n``independent,'' I mean agencies which are independent of the Federal \nGovernment and which are not under the Federal Government or even under \nthe Federal Government's control through the use of the appropriations \nprocess.\n  Why is this important? There are a large number of us involved in the \nissue of reforming education who feel very strongly that national \ntesting makes sense, but to have it controlled by, designed by or in \nany way managed by the Department of Education here in Washington does \nnot make sense. That would be a fundamental flaw.\n  We are encouraged, and we think it is appropriate that the President \nappears to have come to this conclusion himself over the weekend. \nAlthough his initial reaction was to have the Department of Education \nrun this type of a national testing program, his decision now is to \nmove it to the private sector and allow the private sector and the \nprivate nonprofits to develop the proper testing standards.\n  Why is this important? Because the issue of national testing is \nimportant at a variety of different levels. In a positive way it is \nimportant because it will give communities an opportunity to compare \nhow their students are doing with other students, to compare how their \nschools are doing with other schools, compare how their educators are \ndoing with other educators across the country. That is very \nsignificant.\n  It is not unique, national testing. We have in this country one of \nthe most expansive national testing programs probably anywhere in the \nworld called the SAT test. It comes at the end of the school system, \nthe end of the educational experience, at least as far as elementary \nand secondary schools are concerned, and juniors and seniors and \nsometimes sophomores, students in their high school years, will take \ntests. They have the SAT, the SAT 2, they have achievements, they have \nadvanced placement tests, a whole series of tests which they take, \nquite a battery of tests. Anybody who has a child going through the SAT \nexperience understands its intensity and recognizes this is one heck of \na testing system which we have which is nationally driven which is, in \nfact, nationally directed, which is, in fact, nationally developed, and \nwhich is, in fact, a heck of a good system. I think the reason it \nworked so well is it has been energized and directed by the private \nsector of our country, not by the Federal Government.\n  The downside of national testing is that if it is done by the Federal \nGovernment, at the direction of the Federal Government, under the \ncontrol of the Federal Government or funded by the Federal Government, \nyou are stepping, in my opinion, and I think in the opinion of many of \nus who view education as a critical asset of the community, of the \nState, of people at the lowest level of government who have the right \nto control how their children's lives are determined in their school \nsystems rather than having it be controlled from Washington, those of \nus who view that education should be directed locally and not \nnationally, you are stepping on the slippery slope of once again the \nissue of national control over curriculum, national control over \ncontents, national control over teachers' standards in the educational \nsystem because a federally designed, federally paid for, federally \ncontrolled national educational testing system would be, in my opinion \nand I think the opinion of many people who view this issue and who have \nlooked at it for a while as I have, as being one of the first steps \ntoward a nationally directed curriculum, a nationally directed content \nin education, and a nationally directed standard for our teachers.\n\n[[Page S8698]]\n\n  That is something that I would most vehemently object to and have \nobjected to, and in fact when we went through Goals 2000, raising the \nissue of national curriculum was the core question. We amended that law \ndramatically from its initial structure so that it would not end up as \na national curriculum exercise.\n  Now that we have pushed forward onto the playing field a national \ntesting system, at something other than the end of your high school \nyears, a national testing system which will probably be targeted on the \nthird grade or the eighth grade or maybe both grades, to determine \ncompetency, especially in objective types of discipline such as \nmathematics and science, such a national testing system has to be \nentered into with some caution to be sure that we do not end up going \ndown the wrong path, that we use it for the purposes for which it \nshould be used, which is to give our local communities the capacity to \nevaluate how their local school systems are doing in educating their \nchildren--not use it with the capacity of taking away from our local \ncommunities the capacity to control their local school systems by \ntaking away control over curriculum or taking away control over \ncontent.\n  So this amendment is basically directed at saying it is not \nappropriate for the Department of Education to be an aggressive \nparticipant, a funded participant in the designing of a national \ntesting system. Rather, that should be left to the private or \nquasiprivate or nonprofit sector which presently does such a good job \nin areas such as SAT's.\n  The view, which was not the original view of the President and now is \nthe view of the President, is something which we congratulate him on \nchanging his position on and coming to a conclusion that is of that \nposition and which we want to support by passing this amendment.\n  Senator Coats and I have put this amendment together. It tracks what \nwas passed in the House, or what is being proposed in the House--I am \nnot sure it has been passed yet--by Representative Goodling from \nPennsylvania, chairman of the authorizing committee which deals with \neducation in the House.\n  I appreciate the courtesy of the chairman of the committee in \nallowing us to go forward with it and in his support in going forward \nwith it. We are certainly sensitive to his desire to have the vote \ntomorrow if there is to be a formal vote, if it is not adopted by \nagreement, which I hope would be because it does reflect, we believe, \nthe administration position.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I expect we will have a rather spirited \ndebate about this amendment, and we should have. I think this is an \ninteresting, timely, and important subject for the Senate at this \npoint. My understanding is that there will be lengthy debate and a \nhearing in the Senate tomorrow morning, followed by a vote tomorrow on \nthis subject.\n  This debate is not about developing some sort of enforced Federal \nstandard. Rather, this is a very important question about this \ncountry's educational system and whether parents, no matter where they \nlive, have an opportunity and the ability to measure how well their \nchildren are doing at two levels. Can they read at the fourth-grade \nlevel, and how do they read relative to other kids in this country, and \ncan they achieve basic proficiency in mathematics at the eighth-grade \nlevel?\n  We have some significant choices to make in this country on the \nsubject of education. No one that I know of suggests that we wrest the \ncontrol of educating our kids in the elementary and secondary schools \nfrom the local school boards. No one. That is where we make decisions \nabout how to educate our kids. But we do as a country have an \nobligation, I think, to begin asking the question: Should we not have \nsome basic standard of measurement to find out what our children are \nachieving in our schools to be able to measure community to community, \nschool to school, State to State? How are they doing? Are they able to \nread at the fourth grade level? Are they proficient in mathematics at \nthe eighth grade level?\n  I want to read a couple of comments as we begin.\n  Jim Barksdale, the CEO and president of Netscape Communications, one \nof the new communications companies in our country, and L. John Doerr, \na partner in the firm of Kleiner, Perkins, Caulfield & Byers, on behalf \nof 240 technology industry leaders in a bipartisan call for high \nnational education standards in reading and math, say this:\n\n       Every State should adopt high national standards, and by \n     1999, every State should test every fourth grader in reading \n     and eighth grader in math to make sure these standards are \n     met. President Clinton's national testing initiative offers a \n     new opportunity to use widely accepted national benchmarks in \n     reading and math against which States, school districts, and \n     parents can judge student performance.\n\n  This national testing initiative is not about suggesting a national \nor Federal system by which anyone from up here can control someone down \nthere.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire, I think, began by saying he was not \nopposed to developing some kind of national testing program. I think \nfrom that statement we ought to be able to find a way to develop a \nprogram of achievement standards. I am not wedded to the notion that it \nbe here or there or with this money or that money. I am wedded to the \nnotion that this country deserves to know what it is getting for the \nmoney it is spending for elementary and secondary education.\n  We spend a substantial amount of money sending our children to \nschool. A substantial amount of money is spent sending our children \ninto the classrooms of our country. The question is, what are we \ngetting for that? What are we achieving? What kind of accomplishments \nexist at the fourth grade level? Are our fourth graders able to read? \nIn which schools? In which States? And if not, why not? Before one can \nembark on a plan to improve education, you must first know where you \nare. And we don't have a basic approach by which we can measure \nachievement.\n  You get to 17 or 18 years of age, and guess what? You want to go to \ncollege. You are going to show up someplace, and you are going to have \nto take a test. That test is going to measure what you have achieved, \nwhat you know, what you have studied, and what you have retained from \nthat. So when you get to be 17 or 18 and begin to take the college \nentrance tests, then at that point somebody is going to measure what \nyou have been given, what you have learned, and what you are prepared \nto do. But by that point, we have spent a substantial amount of money.\n  Why don't we decide, as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and literally \nhundreds of other business leaders in this country have, that we ought \nto get more for our education system by measuring whether our students, \nstudent to student and school to school and State to State, are \nreaching certain levels of achievement?\n  I am a parent. I have two little children sitting this afternoon in a \npublic school classroom. They are the most wonderful kids in the world. \nI assume that every father would say that about their children. I want \nthose children to have the best possible education that our school \nsystem can give them. But I, as one parent, believe that it is \nimportant for us to measure as we go along what our children have \nlearned from that school system.\n  Things have changed. This is not 40 years ago when we as a country \ncould tie one hand behind our back and beat anybody else in the world \nat almost anything, and do it easily. We now face shrewd, tough \ninternational competition in every direction that we look. We now face \ncompetition, yes, in the job market, yes, in our economies, in our \nschools, and we face competition with countries who send their kids to \nschool 240 days a year. We send our kids to school 180 days a year.\n  You have seen and I have seen some of the comparisons of students in \nthe United States with students from Japan, students from Korea, \nstudents from Jordan, and students from around the world.\n  What the business leaders in this country, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, technology industry leaders, and others, including education \nleaders, are saying, is let us find a way by which we establish a \nmeasurement of achievement, by which we aspire to a goal that says that \nby the fourth grade children ought to be able to read competently, and \nlet's measure to make\n\n[[Page S8699]]\n\nsure that our school system makes that happen so that by the eighth \ngrade they have certain proficiency in math. That is what this is \nabout.\n  From the discussion I just heard--I expect there will be a lot of it \ntoday--the issue is, should there be a Federal mandate by a Federal \nagency that federally enforces some Federal test? No, of course not. No \none has proposed that. I would not support that.\n  If you say, however, that with the money we spend for education, we \nought to measure the output as taxpayers, and as parents we ought to \nfind out what are we getting, if you say that ought to be the goal--it \nis my goal, I expect it is probably your goal--then let's find a way to \ndo that. Parents have a right to know whether their kids have mastered \nthe basics in education, no matter what State they live in, no matter \nwhat city or school district they live in.\n  Those in this country who are concerned about our education system \nknow that we must make some improvements. How do we make improvements? \nYou create a blueprint, a plan, or a design for how you fix what is \nwrong. But before you can do that, you must assess what you have. What \nare the achievement levels? What are you getting for what you are now \nspending? That is what this is about.\n  I think that the debate--I guess I shouldn't prejudge; I will listen \nto it--will not be so much about whether it is useful for parents to \nlearn how their kids or how their schools stack up against other kids \nor other schools in other cities or in other States. I think the debate \nwill not be about that because I would expect most parents and \ntaxpayers would want that kind of information.\n  Incidentally, this effort to develop tests to measure achievement is \nall voluntary. There is nothing here that is mandatory. Any school can \nopt out. Any student can opt out. Any State can opt out.\n  If there is heartburn over the question of who develops these \nbenchmarks, let us find agreement on some independent entity that would \nestablish appropriate goals for ourselves and for our children.\n  Occasionally, I--as I am sure everybody in the Senate does--get on a \nradio call-in show. Inevitably, someone will call in and say, ``This is \nsome one-world international conspiracy. This is the Federal Government \nwanting to run the local school system.'' You have heard all of the \ndebate about all of these issues. In fact, going back, that became the \nargument that was used to say, ``Let's get rid of the Department of \nEducation at the Federal level.'' We do not hear much about that \nanymore. I don't expect we will see an amendment about that, although \nthere may be Members in the Chamber who believe that we should offer \nthat amendment and have that debate.\n  Does education reach a level of national importance sufficiently so \nthat we have a Department of Education? I think so. Most of the \nAmerican people think so. But we have had in the not-too-distant past \nthose who say, ``Let's abolish the Department of Education. What on \nEarth should we be doing thinking nationally about education?'' Well, \nthe American people know what we should be doing nationally about \neducation. It is not running the school systems--not at all. What we \nshould be doing nationally is worrying about whether we as a country \nare able to measure achievement--basic achievement in a range of areas, \nespecially reading and mathematics, sufficient so that our students are \nprepared to be everything they can possibly be. Achievement that allows \nthem to contribute not only to themselves but to this country, and to \nhelp us compete internationally. That is what all of this is about.\n  We are faced with tougher and tougher tests as a country. We are \nfaced with a changing world economy and global markets. Companies these \ndays are not national companies. They are international conglomerates. \nThey want to produce where it is cheaper to produce. They want to go \nwherever they can find the skilled labor at the least cost, and so on. \nSo it is tougher competitively for us than it was before. That is why \nour education system is so much more important now than it was. That is \nwhy it is so important that the education system work well. It is \nimportant that we as parents have information with which to measure \nwhat we are getting from this education system.\n  So let me, so that no one misinterprets what I have just said, say it \nagain. I think parents and taxpayers have every reason to believe that \nwe ought to be able to measure what we are getting from our education \nsystem student to student, school to school, school district to school \ndistrict, or State to State. We ought to be able to measure that. The \nfirst standard ought not be when you reach 18 decide to take a test to \ngo to college. But the development of achievement standards ought not \nbe confused with some of the discussion about a Federal agency \ndeveloping a federally enforced standard that they will use to mandate \nFederal policy for local education. That is totally hogwash. That is \nnot what this effort is about.\n  I will be interested in listening to the later debate because my hope \nis that through this discussion perhaps we can find common ground to \nsay, Yes, let's aspire to some achievement levels that we can measure \nacross this country in order to better prepare our children for the \nfuture. If you measure achievement levels, you know how your children \nare doing relevant to other children; you know how your schools are \ndoing; you know how your teachers are doing. If we aspire to do that \nand have the tools that give parents the ability to better manage the \nschool, to better help their children, then we will be better off as a \ncountry. If that is a goal--and I hope it is--then we should be able to \nfind a way to cooperate in reaching that goal through the development \nof some kind of entity that does not impose the specter of Federal \ncontrol over local schools, because that is not the desire at all.\n  The proposal originally by the President was a proposal for a \nvoluntary system in which any State, any school, or any student can opt \nout. But even if that causes heartburn because it has the specter of a \nFederal entity creating the tests, then let us find a method by which \nwe create that same kind of measurement and give parents the same kind \nof opportunity without inciting the fear that some would ascribe to it \nas representing a Federal initiative. We can do that. I think we can do \nthat. But we cannot do that if we stand up and mischaracterize the \ninitiative in the first place. This is not about Federal control and a \nfederally enforced test and Federal usurpation of local prerogatives \nwith respect to education.\n\n  Having given that initial discussion, I will anxiously listen to the \ndebate by two of the Members for whom I have the greatest respect. I \nthink both are bright and interesting people who have contributed a \ngreat deal to this Senate, and while we might disagree on this, the \npurpose of my standing up is that my hope is perhaps we can find an \narea of agreement. Both of my colleagues are parents. I think they \nprobably want the same output here that I want from this system, the \nbest possible education our schools can give our children and along the \nway as parents the best opportunity to measure how our kids are doing \nand how our schools are doing. If we have those opportunities, we will \nimprove not only our children's future but the future of this country.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1071 to Amendment No. 1070\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit the development, planning, implementation, or \n     administration of any national testing program in reading or \n mathematics unless the program is specifically authorized by Federal \n                                statute)\n\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, let me first say I very much appreciate \nthe efforts of the Senator from New Hampshire in addressing this issue. \nI think it is an important issue and one which goes to a topic which \ndeserves and needs a great deal of discussion and debate.\n  Clearly, our public education system in this country has many cracks \nin the once solidly supported and, I think, respected position that it \nonce had. We have many failing public schools, not just in our major \ncities, but across our land. The goal that we share, whether you are \nRepublican, Democrat, liberal or conservative, is that we want to \nimprove education in this country and we want to address some of the \nshortcomings that we find in education.\n\n[[Page S8700]]\n\n  The Senator from North Dakota raised a point which in many instances \nI think I do not disagree with. We do want to find ways of assessing \nwhere we are educationally, and giving parents a better idea of where \ntheir schools are in terms of preparing their children for a successful \nfuture.\n  The proposal to look at reading levels of achievement at the end of \nthe third grade in reading and in eighth grade in math is not \nnecessarily a goal that we should not attempt to reach. The concern \nthat was raised by the Senator from New Hampshire is that if we address \nthis in a way in which the Department of Education controls and designs \nthe way this will be tested and then potentially uses this to establish \nstandards, we continue a process of Federal Government knows best in \nterms of how to fix the education system in this country.\n  Frankly, the positive changes that are being brought about in the \neducation of the young people in this country are not coming from \nWashington. They are coming from local and State initiatives. We do not \nwant to do anything that deters that. In fact, we want to do everything \nwe can to encourage that. I think it is safe to say if the initiatives \nthat have been proposed and tried and are being tested and used in a \nnumber of our local educational jurisdictions and in a number of our \nStates had to have the approval of the Federal Government, we would \nhave gotten nowhere. We would not have charter schools in this country \nif the Department of Education had to approve it. We would not have had \nmany of the experimental programs aimed at better addressing the \nsituation of our at-risk children who are learning very little, or not \nat all, in many of our public schools, and particularly our public \nschools in urban areas across this country, because the national \neducation unions have a lock on the public school process and a lock on \nthe Department of Education.\n  I have been in the Chamber proposing a number of new initiatives, \nmost in the form of demonstration programs which merely ask that we \ntest a new idea to gauge its effectiveness. I do this so often because \nthe only thing we know about the current system for sure is that it is \nfailing many of our children. So why not try something new, why not \nexperiment with some new ideas? And if it works, then decide how we \nwant to encourage it. And if it does not work, throw it out and try \nsomething else. But what we have is a Department of Education locked \ninto a no-change system because the teachers unions, not merely the \nteachers but the teachers unions, say don't touch it--no merit pay for \nteachers, no changes in the rules on tenure. They just fight every \nchange that is proposed.\n  And so when the idea comes along of OK, let's set a testing standard \nso that we know where we stand, it looks good on its face--I think we \nall want that information; it can be useful to local jurisdictions and \nuseful to States. But what we do not want is to get into the situation \nwe got into with the national history standards whereby Federal \nbureaucrats and the organizations that currently control funding for \npublic education basically say we will define what those standards \nought to be, and we will set those standards and then we will measure \nthe test against those standards.\n  We don't want to get into that trap again. We went through that not a \nshort time ago, and those standards were soundly rejected because they \nwere taking us in absolutely the wrong direction.\n  Now, I think that we can address the goals raised by the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, which I think Senator Gregg and I share in, of trying to \nfind a way to provide local educational institutions and States with \ninformation about where students stand relative at least to reading and \nto math at fourth and eighth grade levels without falling into the \nproblem that we would have if the administration were allowed to go \nforward with its original plan.\n  What the Senator from North Dakota apparently was not aware of was \nthat the Department of Education has already begun developing tests, \nand has already contracted with a consortium of testing agencies \nwhereby the Department of Education defines how this is going to be \ndone, without using an independent agency.\n  Now, the President just this past Saturday in his national radio \naddress wisely concluded that was not the direction the American people \nwanted to go, or that was not the way in which we ought to pursue this \nconcept of trying to find where we stand at certain levels in regard to \nthe subjects of reading and mathematics. And so the President announced \non Saturday that he would defer to the critics' complaints that this \nshould be done by an independent agency and should not be administered \nor controlled by the Department of Education.\n  What Senator Gregg and I are trying to do is to hold the President to \nhis word, so that it is not just something said on a radio address but \nit is something that is actually fulfilled by members of his own \nDepartment of Education. So the amendment that was offered was intended \nto prohibit the use of funds in this act, or any act, for the \ndevelopment or implementation of a national testing program.\n  Now, we know that the Department has already signed a contract to \nbegin developing this testing program, and as a consequence of that we \nare now trying to send a signal to the Department encouraging them to \nslow down. This is something that the Congress should debate, as the \nSenator from North Dakota said. This is something that the Congress \nshould authorize. This is something on which the will of the people \nshould be heard, that the input from the education institutions at the \nlocal and State levels ought to be heard before we proceed with this \nnational effort. This truly should be a decision that is not first made \nin Washington and imposed on the States, but rather one that is first \nsupported in State capitols and local jurisdictions around the country \nand only then decided on by Congress.\n  Because there is a question raised about what the underlying \namendment is intended to accomplish, I propose that we pause here, and \nagree to work together, as the Senator from North Dakota said, to \nachieve what many feel is a desirable goal. I think it would be helpful \nfor local educational agencies and for States to have an assessment of \nwhere their students are. I think it would be helpful for parents to \nknow how their schools are performing and measuring up in relation to \nother schools. I think that puts pressure for change on the system.\n  I am trying to avoid the situation that we have frequently \nencountered after the passage of education legislation of parents \ngetting involved because they don't like what is going on in \nWashington. For instance, if we don't take the time to check whether \nparents really want national testing, if they are unhappy, they will \ncall up their Congressman and they will call up their Senators. They'll \nsay, wait a minute; we are not so sure about this new Federal \ninitiative to fix the problem of poor student performance because it \nlooks like more Federal control. Federal control in education hasn't \nworked very well in the past, and we are not sure it is going to work \nin the future. Besides how does the Department of Education conclude it \nknows what is best for the education system when it has been over 15 \nyears since a blue ribbon commission came out with a shocking report \ntalking about the mediocrity of public education in America, and since \nthen the only real reforms that have taken place have not been at the \nFederal level; reforms have been at the local and the State level, and \nwe want to preserve the right of local jurisdictions and States to make \nthose reforms.\n\n  So I am offering a second-degree amendment to the underlying \namendment which says that no Federal funds can be used for national \ntesting until Congress has specifically authorized those tests. It does \nnot say that we should not pursue the goal of some type of national \ntesting. But what it does say is that the Congress ought to debate this \nand it ought to be authorized by the Congress before the \nadministration, through the Department of Education, simply goes \nforward.\n  My second-degree amendment says that none of the funds made available \nin this act, or any other act, will be used to develop, plan, \nimplement, or administer any national testing program in reading or \nmathematics unless the program is specifically authorized by Federal \nstatute.\n\n[[Page S8701]]\n\n  The operative phrase is that you can't go forward with this and use \nFederal funds unless it is specifically authorized by the Congress. \nThat allows us to engage in the debate that the Senator from North \nDakota thought we ought to engage in, and I agree that allows us to \ndefine how this testing will take place, that allows us to acknowledge \nthe concern that the Senator from North Dakota expressed that maybe we \ndo not want the Department of Education running this.\n  Having been involved in the issue of student loans over the past \nseveral years and raising objections to the Department of Education \ntaking over the student lending business, which it says it can do more \neffectively and more efficiently than the private sector, I find it \nironic that Congress Daily reports that the Department of Education has \nhad to suspend all direct loan consolidation efforts because it is \noverwhelmed by the effort. It cannot handle the work. And so students \nwho want to consolidate their loans in terms of paying them back are \nnow not able to do so because the Department of Education cannot handle \nit.\n  A number of us, including Senator Gregg and many others, have raised \nconcerns about the ability of the Department of Education to properly \nmanage and administer the very complex business of making and \ncollecting student loans. Frankly, we have never thought that they have \nthe capacity to handle it. It is not that they are not well intended. \nThe problem is there are no competitive pressures. They do their own \nthing. And it is the nature of bureaucracy--that is why it is called \nbureaucracy--to become bureaucratized and inefficient.\n  I remember when the First Lady was here promoting her health plan, \nand in her first presentation to the Congress to two of the committees \nhere, one of which I sit on, I said it seems to me that this massive \nnational health plan is based on a number of faulty assumptions, one of \nwhich is that Government can accomplish an objective more efficiently \nand effectively than the private sector. I said that in my experience \nin 18 years in government and in my reading over the history of this \nGovernment, I have not been able to identify an area where the Federal \nGovernment has performed a service more effectively or efficiently than \nthe private sector. I said, can you name me one? And the First Lady \nsaid, ``Well, Senator, I think you are correct in terms of past \nperformance of the Federal Government, but this time we think we have \nit right.'' We think, in terms of the health care plan that was being \nproposed here by Mr. Magaziner and herself, that we can avoid that \nproblem.\n  As we have learned, that health care plan was rejected overwhelmingly \nby the American people because they had no faith that the Federal \nGovernment could take 15 percent of our economy, the entire health care \nsystem of the United States, and turn it over to Government to run with \nany assurance that it would be run effectively and efficiently. And, \ntherefore, those of us who have a philosophy grounded in the free \nenterprise system are very skeptical about new proposals to inject the \nFederal Government further and further into those efforts handled by \nthe private sector.\n\n  So, at the very time the Department of Education now admits that it \ncan't handle a small fraction of the lending business that is the \nconsolidation of loans, and that it is going to take months and months \nand months for it to get its act together, if then, it now wants to \nenter into a new area of national testing, who knows where this is \ngoing to take us. And of course, who knows how many additional people \nwill have to be assigned to have to administer this, to oversee the \ncontracts and define the standards.\n  Those are the concerns that Senator Gregg and I have, and those are \nthe concerns we are trying to address. What we would like to do with \nthis amendment, then, is simply follow up on the President's concession \nlast Saturday and basically say, No. 1, this should not be done by the \nFederal Government, should not be done by the Department of Education, \nit ought to be done, if done at all, through an independent agency. And \nsince we are dual players in this town, both the administration and the \nCongress, in doing the people's business, this is something the \nCongress ought to authorize. Therefore my second-degree amendment would \nprohibit funds from being used to further this national testing program \nuntil it is authorized by Federal statute.\n  The chairman of the relevant appropriations committee, Senator \nSpecter, will be holding hearings as early as tomorrow whereby the \nSecretary of Education will come forward, as well as Mr. Goodling, whom \nI deeply respect in terms of his experience with education. They will \nboth come to testify as to the pros and cons of national testing. I \nthink we need hear those pros and cons. I think we need to debate those \npros and cons, and then I think we need to go forward and make a \ndecision as to how we proceed.\n  Again, I say this as someone who is not unalterably opposed to \nnational testing for reading in fourth grade and math at eighth grade. \nFrankly, one of the reasons I want these tests is because I think it \nwill draw more attention to the failure of the public system to educate \nour children. When we look at the disparities that exist in public \neducation in some of our schools and we look at some of our efforts, I \nthink it will put additional pressure on the public system to open up, \nto try new alternatives, and parents will be demanding that we provide \nbetter education for their children and different ways of providing \nthat education. So, from that standpoint, I think national testing can \nbe of benefit.\n  With that, Madam President, I send my second-degree amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Coats], for himself and Mr. \n     Gregg, proposes an amendment numbered 1071 to amendment 1070.\n\n  Mr. COATS.

The pending business is the second-degree \namendment offered by the Senator from Indiana, Senator Coats, to \nSenator Gregg's amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nbe temporarily set aside and the Kyl amendment, No. 1056, be \ntemporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1072\n\n  (Purpose: To fund demonstration projects on Medicaid attendant care \n                  services, within amounts available)\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I now offer an amendment and send it to \nthe desk for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1072.\n\n\n[[Page S8702]]\n\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 39, before the period on line 25, insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That $2,000,000 of the \n     amount available for research, demonstration, and evaluation \n     activities shall be available for carrying out demonstration \n     projects on Medicaid coverage of community-based attendant \n     care services for people with disabilities which ensures \n     maximum control by the consumer to select and manage their \n     attendant care services''.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, as noted, that $2 million will be \nutilized from an existing fund for a demonstration project to test the \neffectiveness of providing attendant care services to individuals with \ndisabilities, regardless of age.\n  Every State in the country currently provides long-term services to \neligible individuals who require the assistance of an attendant in \nnursing homes or other institutions. However, under a curious provision \nof the current Medicaid law, these individuals are not guaranteed the \nright to remain in their own homes and communities while receiving the \nassistance of an attendant as an alternative to institutional care.\n  I have sought to persuade the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto change this provision in the Medicaid Program, and I wrote to \nSecretary Shalala accordingly on February 28, 1997. I ask unanimous \nconsent a copy of that letter be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. The amendment that I am introducing today directs the \nDepartment to test the cost effectiveness of this policy option to \nallow the disabled to remain at home and to obtain the Federal Medicaid \nbenefits. It is clear that the current long-term care system is highly \nregulated and very costly. It is my thought that there is a clear-cut \nneed for a program to be put into effect which will enable the disabled \nto stay at home or in the community as an alternative to institutional \ncare.\n  On February 17 of this year, I had the privilege of visiting a group \nof disabled individuals, many of whom have substantial disabilities, \nstruggling to live independent lives. They gave me a sweatshirt, and I \nnow display it for my colleagues and for those on C-Span II, showing, \n``Our Homes, Not Nursing Homes.'' And it is the symbol of someone who \nis disabled.\n  When I met with these individuals, who were struggling in their \nwheelchairs, with enormous disabilities, and found that they could not \nreceive Medicaid benefits unless they were in an institution, it seemed \nto me manifestly unfair. It is clear that it would be less costly to \nhave the disabled remain in their communities or in their own homes so \nthey could care for themselves and could receive the Medicaid benefits.\n  So I said to these people in North Philadelphia that I would bring \nthe matter to the Secretary of Health and Human Services with the view \nof having an administrative change. But I find that it is very \ncomplicated because the preliminary estimates from the Congressional \nBudget Office say that this would be an enormously expensive change to \nenable the disabled to have benefits to live in their communities or in \ntheir homes.\n  I wondered why. The best explanation which I have been able to \nreceive so far is that, at the present time, these people, the \ndisabled, are cared for by their relatives, by friends or somehow by \nthemselves because they don't want to go into an institution, so they \nforgo the assistance which Medicaid offers the disabled. The \nCongressional Budget Office asserts that if these individuals were to \nhave the ability to have this care outside of the institution, the \ncosts would skyrocket.\n  It seems to me, Madam President, unfair that where the Medicaid law \nsays the disabled are entitled to certain benefits if they are in an \ninstitution, that they should be compelled to be institutionalized when \nthey want to live in their homes or their own communities. This is \nquite a conundrum, quite a Catch-22. So the best course that I see at \nthe present time would be for us to undertake this program on a test \nbasis, and to have a study, made to see what the costs would be in \norder to try to arrive at some fair determination.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 28, 1997.\n     Hon. Donna Shalala,\n     Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Shalala: I am writing to alert you that I \n     intend to raise with your at next week's Subcommittee hearing \n     a matter concerning Medicaid coverage of attendant care \n     services for people with disabilities.\n       It has been brought to my attention that considerable \n     savings to the Medicaid program could be achieved by \n     redirecting long-term care funding toward community-based \n     attendant services, and by requiring States to develop \n     attendant service programs meeting national standards to \n     assure that people of all ages with disabilities have full \n     access to such services. Please be prepared to summarize the \n     current status of Medicaid services to the disabled \n     population, and to discuss your views on establishing a \n     national program of community-based attendant services. I \n     would also appreciate your thoughts on what further could be \n     done, both administratively and through legislative action, \n     to better enable people with mental and physical disabilities \n     to live independently.\n       I look forward to discussing this and other issues with you \n     next Tuesday when you appear to present the Administration's \n     fiscal year 1998 budget request for your Department.\n       My best.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter,\n           Chairman, Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human \n     Services, and Education.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, Senator Harkin is now attending a \ncommittee meeting, and I have been advised by his staff that this \namendment is agreeable to him, so I ask unanimous consent that it be \nadopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1072) was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 1070 and Amendment No. 1071\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, now briefly addressing the amendments \noffered by Senator Gregg and Senator Coats, it is my hope that the \namendments will be debated today for all those who have views and care \nto express them; that is, as I said earlier, because this is a \ncomplicated matter. In my conversation yesterday in a telephone call \nwhich I received from the Secretary of Education, he asked for my \nsupport, and I told him that I did not know enough about the matter to \nrender a judgment and had said earlier it seems to me that testing is \ndesirable, but I do not know that it ought to be undertaken by the \nFederal Government.\n  We have scheduled a hearing tomorrow which we have advanced from 9 \no'clock to 8:30 in the morning because we have since had a request from \nCongressman Goodling to testify at the hearing. So we are now going to \nhave the Secretary of Education, Richard Riley, we are going to have \nthe chairman of the House Education Committee, and we are looking, as a \nmatter of balance, to find someone in opposition to the Department of \nEducation program. So that hearing will be conducted from 8:30, \nhopefully until 10 a.m. It is my hope that we will complete action on \nthe remainder of this bill today, with the exception of the vote on the \nGregg amendment, and take that up tomorrow.\n  Madam President, I now call up amendment No. 1069.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1069\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the Attorney General \nhas abused her discretion by failing to appoint an independent counsel \n   on campaign finance matters and that the Attorney General should \n      proceed to appoint such an independent counsel immediately)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside, and the clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1069.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

He worked over every script, watched \n     each ad, ordered changes in every visual presentation and \n     decided which ads would run when and where;''\n       (6) there have been conflicting and contradictory \n     statements by the Vice President regarding the timing and \n     extent of his knowledge of the nature of a fundraising event \n     at the Hsi Lai Buddhist Temple near Los Angeles on April 29, \n     1996;\n       (7) the independent counsel statute requires the Attorney \n     General to consider the specificity of information provided \n     and the credibility of the source of information pertaining \n     to potential violations of criminal law by covered persons, \n     including the President and the Vice President;\n       (8) the independent counsel statute further requires the \n     Attorney General to petition the court for appointment of an \n     independent counsel where the Attorney General finds that \n     there is a reasonable likelihood that a violation of criminal \n     law may have occurred involving a covered person;\n       (9) the Attorney General has been presented with specific \n     and credible evidence pertaining to potential violations of \n     criminal law by covered persons and there is a reasonable \n     likelihood that a violation of criminal law may have occurred \n     involving a covered person; and\n       (10) the Attorney General has abused her discretion by \n     failing to petition the court for appointment of an \n     independent counsel.\n       (b) It is the Sense of the Senate that the Attorney General \n     should petition the court immediately for appointment of an \n     independent counsel to investigate the reasonable likelihood \n     that a violation of criminal law may have occurred involving \n     a covered person in the 1996 presidential federal election \n     campaign.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, this is the amendment that I had \nreferred to earlier on sense of the Senate for independent counsel.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Senator McCain to Attorney \nGeneral Reno dated October 11, 1996, requesting independent counsel be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                                 October 11, 1996.\n     Hon. Janet Reno,\n     Attorney General, Department of Justice, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Attorney General Reno: I am writing to you to request \n     that you use the authority granted to you in the Independent \n     Counsel Reauthorization Act to immediately appoint an \n     Independent Counsel to investigate charges raised in the \n     media regarding the Democratic Party and Clinton-Gore \n     Reelection Committee's use of soft money contributions which \n     appear to have been in violation of election law.\n       These allegations charge that foreign nationals have been \n     circumventing the law in order to funnel large campaign \n     contributions to the Democratic party. I have enclosed copies \n     of recent New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street \n     Journal articles regarding this situation.\n       During this election season, I believe it is impossible for \n     any Administration officials to determine whether any \n     illegalities or ethical lapses have been committed regarding \n     this situation. Therefore, it is crucial for the sake of the \n     integrity of the Office of the President and the political \n     party fundraising apparatus that this matter be investigated \n     by an Independent Counsel.\n       Your immediate attention to this matter is appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John McCain,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated October 29, \n1996, from five Members of the House of Representatives requesting \nindependent counsel be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 29, 1996.\n     Hon. Janet Reno,\n     Attorney General, Department of Justice, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Attorney General Reno: We are writing to request that \n     you immediately apply for the appointment of an Independent \n     Counsel to investigate the serious allegation that Federal \n     criminal laws may have been violated by a number of high \n     ranking officials in the Clinton Administration and at the \n     Democratic National Committee (``DNC'').\n       This investigation should include, but not be limited to, \n     the following specific reports that indicate violations of \n     Federal law may have taken place:\n       1. The involvement of President Clinton, Vice President \n     Gore, and officials of the Democratic National Committee in \n     the solicitation, acceptance, and receipt of $250,000 from \n     Cheong Am America, when the corporation had little or no \n     domestic income, in direct violation of the Federal Election \n     Campaign Act, and in the solicitation or receipt of over \n     $300,000 from Arief and Soraya Wiriadinata at a time when the \n     Wiriadinatas no longer resided in the United States, \n     violating the plain language in Federal law prohibiting \n     contributions by non-citizens outside the United States. \n     Although the Cheong Am America contribution was returned \n     following media inquiries, the $300,000 from the Wiriadinatas \n     has been retained by the DNC for use in influencing American \n     elections.\n       2. Incorrect reporting to the Federal Election Commission \n     by officials of the DNC of the residence address of Arief and \n     Soraya Wiriadinata, which presented the public appearance \n     that the Wiriadinatas were in the United States and \n     potentially intended to conceal the fact that their \n     contributions were in fact unlawful. News reports indicate \n     that the contributions apparently came after the Wiriadinatas \n     had returned to Indonesia and that the Vice Chairman of \n     Finance of the Democratic National Committee knew that the \n     Wiriadinatas were out of the country (Los Angeles Times, 10/\n     14/96). Property records on file in Fairfax County, Virginia \n     show that the home reported on DNC Federal Election \n     Commission (``FEC'') Reports as the Wiriadinata home address \n     was sold by the Wiriadinata family on December 15, 1995, yet \n     contributions received as late as July, 1996 continued to be \n     reported as coming from that address.\n       3. The solicitation, acceptance and receipt of \n     contributions from individuals, including Arief and Soraya \n     Wiriadinata ($450,000), Yogesh Gandhi ($325,000), and \n     individuals who made contributions in connection with the \n     April 29, 1996 event at the Hsi Lai Temple in \n     Hacienda Heights, California (an estimated $140,000) and a \n     fundraiser at the Hay-Adams Hotel in Washington, D.C., in \n     February 1996 (an estimated $1,000,000), when DNC \n     officials involved in fundraising may have had good reason \n     to know that these contributors did not have the financial \n     resources to make contributions in the large amounts \n     reported, and the contributors may therefore have been \n     conduits for prohibited funds from foreign sources.\n       4. Fundraising activities on behalf of the DNC by John \n     Huang while he was a Presidential appointee at the Department \n     of Commerce, possibly with the knowledge of officials of the \n     DNC, in violation of the Hatch Act. Contributions from the \n     Wiriadinatas to the DNC were received in November of 1995, \n     while Huang was serving as Deputy Assistant Secretary of \n     Commerce for International Economic Policy. DNC Press \n     Secretary Amy Weiss Tobe has stated to the press (Washington \n     Post, October 12, 1996) that Arief and Soraya Wiriadinata \n     contributed to the DNC after meeting John Huang in 1995, \n     during the time he was employed at the U.S. Department of \n     Commerce.\n       5. Possible improper influence on official government \n     decisions as a result of large contributions made to the DNC \n     or other entities by associates and allies of the Riady \n     family and the Lippo group of foreign-owned and foreign-\n     controlled corporations. Press reports indicate that a series \n     of events, which would economically benefit the Lippo Group \n     and the Riady family, took place after meetings between \n     President Clinton, Clinton Administration officials, John \n     Huang and James Riady. Federal bribery statutes prohibit the \n     performing of any official government act in return for \n     campaign contributions or other payments.\n       6. Knowing use of tax-exempt facilities at the Hsi Lai \n     Temple by the DNC for fundraising purposes and knowing \n     solicitation and acceptance of prohibited in-kind \n     contributions from a non-profit entity to a political \n     campaign through the DNC's failure to reimburse the Temple \n     for its expenses in connection with the event until \n     questioned by the media. Further, despite statements by Vice \n     President Gore that the event was not a fundraiser, news \n     reports have indicated that Mr. Huang called it a fundraiser, \n     contributions were collected at the event, and attendees \n     believed that they had to pay to attend.\n       7. The possible attempt by Mr. John Huang, an employee of \n     the DNC, with either the knowledge or implicit approval of \n     the DNC, to obstruct any investigation of his activities by \n     evading the service of a subpoena for the purpose of \n     preventing the release of information about his fundraising \n     activities until after the November 5, 1996 election. Mr. \n     Huang is reported to have raised as much as\n\n[[Page S8704]]\n\n     $5 million in contributions for the DNC, and has so far \n     refused to answer questions in public about his fundraising \n     activities. Until a U.S. District Court Judge intervened, the \n     DNC refused to cooperate or assist in having its employee, \n     John Huang, provide information which would resolve questions \n     as to the legality of the contributions which he solicited \n     and which the DNC is now using to influence American \n     elections.\n       8. Reports filed by the DNC with the Federal Election \n     Commission for the period ending September 30, 1996 list the \n     home address of at least thirty-one contributors to the DNC \n     (with contributions totaling over $225,000) as 430 South \n     Capitol Street SE, Washington, D.C. This address is not a \n     residence, it is the address of the business offices of the \n     DNC. By filing false and misleading information with the FEC, \n     DNC officials may have sought to conceal and impede \n     investigation into the true source and nature of these \n     contributions.\n       Equally important as each of these individual acts is the \n     overall pattern of questionable fundraising activity and the \n     apparent deliberate flaunting of federal election law and \n     usurpation of power and official privilege by the DNC's Vice \n     Chairman of Finance, John Huang, for the benefit of and with \n     the apparent cooperation of President Bill Clinton, Vice \n     President Gore, and the Democratic National Committee. The \n     magnitude of the funds involved, the high-rank of the \n     officials involved and the potential knowing and willful \n     violations committed make it impossible for any officials of \n     this Administration's Justice Department to carry out an \n     investigation that will be considered fair and free of \n     outside influence!\n       Therefore it is crucial for the sake of the integrity of \n     the Office of the President and the Office of the Vice \n     President that this matter be investigated promptly by an \n     independent counsel.\n       We look forward to a reply to this communication by Friday, \n     November 1, 1996. Your early reply will reassure the American \n     people that you are committed to preserving the integrity and \n     independence of the Department of Justice.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bill Thomas,\n                           Chairman, Committee on House Oversight.\n     Ben Gilman,\n                                            Chairman, Committee on\n                                          International Relations.\n     Bill Clinger,\n                                            Chairman, Committee on\n                                  Government Reform and Oversight.\n     Gerald B. Solomon,\n                                     Chairman, Committee on Rules.\n     John McCain,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated March 13, \n1997, from the 10 Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nrequesting independent counsel be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 1997.\n     Hon. Janet Reno,\n     Attorney General of the United States, U.S. Department of \n         Justice, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Attorney General: This letter serves as a formal \n     request, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 592(g)(1), that you apply \n     for the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate \n     possible fundraising violations in connection with the 1996 \n     presidential campaign. The purpose of this letter is not to \n     provide an exhaustive list of the particular allegations \n     that, we believe, warrant further investigation. Indeed, \n     since the Department of Justice has been conducting an \n     extensive investigation into fundraising irregularities for \n     several months now, you presumably have far greater knowledge \n     than do we of the various matters that are being, and will \n     need to be, investigated, and we presume that your judgment \n     as to the necessity of an independent counsel is based on all \n     of the information before you. Rather, the purpose of this \n     letter is to articulate why we believe this investigation \n     should be conducted by an independent counsel. As you know, \n     the Senate Committee on the Judiciary has, to date, refrained \n     from joining the assortment of other individuals who have \n     called upon you to initiate an independent counsel \n     appointment. Recent developments over the past few weeks, \n     however, have persuaded us that such an appointment is now \n     necessary.\n       When you appeared before the Senate in 1993 when we were \n     considering reenactment of the Independent Counsel statute, \n     you stated:\n       ``There is an inherent conflict of interest whenever senior \n     Executive Branch officials are to be investigated by the \n     Department of Justice and its appointed head, the Attorney \n     General. The Attorney General serves at the pleasure of the \n     President. Recognition of this conflict does not belittle or \n     demean the impressive professionalism of the Department's \n     career prosecutors, nor does it question the integrity of the \n     Attorney General and his or her political appointees. \n     Instead, it recognizes the importance of public confidence in \n     our system of justice, and the destructive effect in a free \n     democracy of public cynicism.''\n       You further testified that:\n       ``It is absolutely essential for the public to have \n     confidence in the system and you cannot do that when there is \n     conflict or an appearance of conflict in the person who is, \n     in effect, the chief prosecutor. * * * The Independent \n     Counsel Act was designed to avoid even the appearance of \n     impropriety in the consideration of allegations of misconduct \n     by high-level Executive Branch officials and to prevent * * * \n     the actual or perceived conflicts of interest. The Act thus \n     served as a vehicle to further the public's perception of \n     fairness and thoroughness in such matters, and to avert even \n     the most subtle influences that may appear in an \n     investigation of highly-placed Executive officials.''\n       We believe that, in light of recent developments, a \n     thorough Justice Department investigation into possible \n     fundraising violations in connection with the 1996 \n     presidential campaign will raise an inherent conflict of \n     interest, and that the appointment of an independent counsel \n     is therefore required to ensure public confidence in the \n     integrity of our electoral process and system of justice.\n       First recent revelations have demonstrated how officials at \n     the highest level of the White House were involved in \n     formulating, coordinating and implementing the DNC's \n     fundraising efforts for the 1996 presidential campaign. \n     Recent press reports, the files released by Mr. Ickes, and \n     public statements by very high ranking present and former \n     Clinton Administration officials indicate how extensively the \n     Administration was involved in planning, coordinating, and \n     implementing DNC fundraising strategy and activities. All \n     this has led The New York Times to a conclusion which we find \n     hard to challenge; namely, that ``the latest documentation \n     shows clearly that the Democratic National Committee was \n     virtually a subsidiary of the White House. Not only was \n     [President] Clinton overseeing its fund-raising efforts, not \n     only was he immersed in its ad campaigns, but D.N.C. \n     employees were installed at the White House, using White \n     House visitors' lists and communicating constantly with \n     [President] Clinton's policy advisers.'' The New York Times, \n     February 27, 1997. As a consequence, we believe that a \n     thorough investigation of all but the most trivial potential \n     campaign fundraising improprieties necessarily includes an \n     inquiry into the possible knowledge and/or complicity of very \n     senior White House officials in these improprieties. We \n     believe that, without questioning in the slightest the \n     integrity, professionalism or independence of the Attorney \n     General or the individuals conducting the present Justice \n     Department fundraising investigation, the fact that the \n     Department's investigation will inescapably take it to the \n     highest levels of the Executive Branch presents an inherent \n     conflict of interest calling for the appointment of an \n     independent counsel under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 591(c).\n       Moreover, these revelations raise new questions of possible \n     wrongdoing by senior White House officials themselves, \n     including but not limited to whether federal officials may \n     have illegally solicited and/or received contributions on \n     federal property; whether specific solicitations were ever \n     made by federal officials at the numerous White House \n     overnights, coffees, and other similar events, and whether \n     these events themselves, often characterized in White House \n     and DNC memoranda as ``fundraising'' events, constituted \n     improper ``solicitations'' on federal property; whether \n     government property and employees may have been used \n     illegally to further campaign interests; and whether the \n     close coordination by the White House over the raising and \n     spending of ``soft''--and purportedly independent--DNC \n     funds violated federal election laws, and/or had the legal \n     effect of rendering those funds subject to campaign \n     finance limitations they otherwise would not be subject \n     to. It seems to us that, even accepting the narrow \n     constructions of some of the governing statutes that have \n     been suggested--which are not necessarily the \n     constructions an independent counsel would render--the \n     answer to whether criminal wrongdoing has occurred will of \n     necessity turn on the resolution of disputed factual, \n     legal, and state of mind determinations. Because the \n     inquiry necessary to make these determinations will \n     inescapably involve high level Executive Branch officials, \n     we believe they should be left to an independent counsel \n     in order to avoid a real or apparent conflict of interest. \n     Moreover, where individuals covered by the independent \n     counsel statute are involved, as they plainly were here, \n     see 28 U.S.C. Sec. 591(b), the Ethics in Government Act \n     requires that these inquiries be conducted by an \n     independent counsel. Whether the Act simply permits or \n     requires the appointment of an independent counsel, \n     however, we believe that prudence and the American \n     people's ability to have confidence that the investigation \n     remains free of a conflict of interest, requires it.\n       Second, the emerging story regarding the possibility that \n     foreign contributions were funneled into U.S. election \n     coffers to influence U.S. foreign policy further highlights \n     the conflict of interest your ongoing investigation \n     inescapably confronts. A March 9, 1997, Washington Post \n     article quoted ``U.S. government officials''--presumably \n     familiar with the Department's ongoing investigation--as \n     stating that investigators have obtained ```conclusive \n     evidence' that Chinese government funds were funneled into \n     the United States last year,'' and quoted one official as \n     stating that ``there is no question that money was \n     laundered.'' This article reported that U.S. officials \n     described a plan by China ``to spend nearly $2 million to buy \n     influence not only in Congress but also within\n\n[[Page S8705]]\n\n     the Clinton Administration.'' If the FBI truly is \n     investigating these allegations, as is reported, and this \n     investigation extends to high level Executive Branch \n     officials, it raises an inherent conflict of interest.\n       Moreover, a closer look at the activities and associations \n     of some of the particular individuals who are reported to be \n     the principal figures in the ongoing investigation further \n     illustrates why this investigation ultimately must involve \n     high levels of the Executive Branch. Especially troubling is \n     the information revealed to date regarding the Riady family \n     and their associate, Mr. John Huang, but serious questions \n     are also raised by the activities and associations of Mr. \n     Charles Yah Lin Trie, Ms. Pauline Kanalanchak, and Mr. Johnny \n     Chung, among others. Taken together, these reported events \n     raise a host of serious questions warranting further \n     investigation: To what extent were illegal contributions from \n     foreign sources, in particular China, being funneled into the \n     United States, and with whose knowledge and involvement? To \n     what extent was U.S. policy influenced by these \n     contributions, and with whose knowledge and/or involvement? \n     To what extent were the decisions to hire Huang at the \n     Commerce Department, to support most-favored-nation status \n     for China and Chinese accession to the World Trade \n     Organization, or to normalize relations with Vietnam, \n     influenced by contributions, and with whose knowledge and/\n     or involvement? To what extent was the standard NSC \n     screening process for admission to the White House waived \n     or modified so as to permit special access to large donors \n     and their guests where it would ordinarily be denied, and \n     with whose knowledge and/or involvement? To what extent \n     was John Huang placed at the DNC to raise money in \n     exchange for past and future favors, and with whose \n     knowledge and/or involvement?\n       It is evident that these questions cannot be properly \n     investigated without a conflict of interest, since \n     investigating most of these questions will require inquiring \n     into the knowledge and/or conduct of individuals at the \n     highest levels of the Executive Branch. Moreover, several of \n     the principal figures in this investigation, including the \n     Riadys and the Lippo Group and Charlie Trie, reportedly have \n     longstanding ties to President Clinton.\n       Indeed, the conflicts at issue here are precisely the sort \n     of ``inherent conflict[s] of interest'' to which you \n     testified during Senate hearings in 1993 on the re-enactment \n     of the Independent Counsel Act. Avoiding an actual or \n     perceived conflict of interest was the basis not just for \n     your application for the appointment of an independent \n     counsel to investigate James McDougal, but also for your \n     recent requests to extend that counsel's jurisdiction to \n     include investigations of Anthony Marceca and Bernard \n     Nussbaum. The same concern warrants your application for an \n     independent counsel here, where public confidence can be \n     assured only by the appointment of an independent counsel to \n     investigate any alleged wrongdoing in connection with DNC, \n     Clinton Administration, and Clinton/Gore Campaign fundraising \n     during the 1994-1996 election cycle. As you yourself \n     testified, applying for an independent counsel, and our \n     request that you make such an application, in no way detracts \n     from the integrity and independence of the Attorney General \n     or the career prosecutors presently investigating these \n     allegations.\n       Pursuant to the statute, please report back to the \n     Committee within 30 days whether you have begun or will begin \n     a preliminary investigation, identifying all of the \n     allegations you are presently investigating or as to which \n     you have received information, and indicating whether you \n     believe each of these allegations are based on specific \n     information from credible sources, and either pertain to a \n     covered individual or present a conflict of interest. Please \n     also provide your reasons for those determinations. See 28 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 592(g)(2). In the event you conduct a preliminary \n     investigation, but do not apply for the appointment of an \n     independent counsel, or apply for an independent counsel but \n     only with respect to some of the various allegations on which \n     you have received information, please identify all those \n     allegations which in your view do not warrant appointment of \n     an independent counsel, and explain your view whether those \n     allegations warrant further investigation, pertain to a \n     covered individual, and/or present a conflict of interest. \n     See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 592(g)(3).\n           Sincerely,\n         Orrin Hatch, Chuck Grassley, John Ashcroft, Spencer \n           Abraham, Mike DeWine, Strom Thurmond, Arlen Specter, \n           Jon Kyl, Fred Thompson, Jeff Sessions.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. And I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter \nfrom Attorney General Reno dated April 14, 1997, responding to Senator \nHatch be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 14, 1997.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n               Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n                                                   Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On March 13, 1997, you and nine other \n     majority party members of the Committee on the Judiciary of \n     the United States Senate wrote to me requesting the \n     appointment of an independent counsel to investigate possible \n     fundraising violations in connection with the 1996 \n     presidential campaign. You made that request pursuant to a \n     provision of the Independent Counsel Act, 28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 592(g)(1), which provides that ``a majority of majority \n     party members [of the Committee on the Judiciary] * * * may \n     request in writing that the Attorney General apply for the \n     appointment of an independent counsel.'' The Act requires me \n     to respond within 30 days, setting forth the reasons for my \n     decision on each of the matters with respect to which your \n     request is made. 28 U.S.C. Sec. 592(g)(2).\n       I am writing to inform you that I have not initiated a \n     ``preliminary investigation'' (as that term is defined in the \n     Independent Counsel Act) of any of the matters mentioned in \n     your letter. Rather, as you know, matters relating to \n     campaign financing in the 1996 Federal elections have been \n     under active investigation since November by a task force of \n     career Justice Department prosecutors and Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation (FBI) agents. This task force is pursuing the \n     investigation vigorously and diligently, and it will continue \n     to do so. I can assure you that I have given your views and \n     your arguments careful thought, but at this time, I am unable \n     to agree, based on the facts and the law, that an independent \n     counsel should be appointed to handle this investigation.\n\n\n                     1. The Independent Counsel Act\n\n       In order to explain my reasons, I would like to outline \n     briefly the relevant provisions of the Independent Counsel \n     Act. The Act can be invoked in two circumstances that are \n     relevant here:\n       First, if there are sufficient allegations (as further \n     described below) of criminal activity by a covered person, \n     defined as the President and Vice President, cabinet \n     officers, certain other enumerated high Federal officials, or \n     certain specified officers of the President's election \n     campaign (not party officials), see 28 U.S.C. Sec. 591(b), I \n     must seek appointment of an independent counsel.\n       Second, if there are sufficient allegations of criminal \n     activity by a person other than a covered person, and I \n     determine that ``an investigation or prosecution of [that] \n     person by the Department of Justice may result in a personal, \n     financial or political conflict of interest,'' see 28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 591(c)(1), I may seek appointment of an independent \n     counsel.\n       In either case, I must follow a two-step process to \n     determine whether the allegations are sufficient. First, I \n     must determine whether the allegations are sufficiently \n     specific and credible to constitute grounds to investigate \n     whether an individual may have violated Federal criminal law. \n     28 U.S.C. Sec. 591(d). If so, the Department commences a \n     ``preliminary investigation'' for up to 90 days (which can be \n     extended an additional 60 days upon a showing of good cause). \n     28 U.S.C. Sec. 592(a). If, at the conclusion of this \n     ``preliminary investigation,'' I determine that further \n     investigation of the matters is warranted, I must seek an \n     independent counsel.\n       Certain important features of the Act are critical to my \n     decision in this case:\n       First, the Act sets forth the only circumstances in which I \n     may seek an independent counsel pursuant to its provisions. I \n     may not invoke its procedures unless the statutory \n     requirements are met.\n       Second, the Act does not permit or require me to commence a \n     preliminary investigation unless there is specific and \n     credible evidence that a crime may have been committed. In \n     your letter, you suggest that it is not the responsibility of \n     the Department of Justice to determine whether a particular \n     set of facts suggests a potential Federal crime, but that \n     such legal determinations should be left to an independent \n     counsel. I do not agree. Under the Independent Counsel \n     Act, it is the Department's obligation to determine in the \n     first instance whether particular conduct potentially \n     falls within the scope of a particular criminal statute \n     such that criminal investigation is warranted. If it is \n     our conclusion that the alleged conduct is not criminal, \n     then there is no basis for appointment of an independent \n     counsel, because there would be no specific and credible \n     allegation of a violation of criminal law. See 28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 592(a)(1).\n       Third, there is an important difference between the \n     mandatory and discretionary provisions of the Act. Once I \n     have received specific and credible allegations of criminal \n     conduct by a covered person, I must commence a preliminary \n     investigation and, if further investigation is warranted at \n     the end of the preliminary investigation, seek appointment of \n     an independent counsel. If, on the other hand, I receive \n     specific and credible evidence that a person not covered by \n     the mandatory provisions of the Act has committed a crime, \n     and I determine that a conflict of interest exists with \n     respect to the investigation of that person, I may--but need \n     not--commence a preliminary investigation pursuant to the \n     provisions of the Act. This provision gives me the \n     flexibility to decide whether, overall, the national interest \n     would be best served by appointment of an independent counsel \n     in such a case, or whether it would be better for the \n     Department of Justice to continue a vigorous investigation of \n     the matter.\n       Fourth, even this discretionary provision is not available \n     unless I find a conflict of interest of the sort contemplated \n     by the Act. The Congress has made it very clear that this \n     provision should be invoked only in certain narrow \n     circumstances. Under the Act, I must conclude that there is a \n     potential for an actual conflict of interest, rather than \n     merely an appearance of a conflict of interest. The Congress \n     expressly adopted this higher standard to ensure that the \n     provision\n\n[[Page S8706]]\n\n     would not be invoked unnecessarily. See 128 Cong. Rec. H 9507 \n     (daily ed. December 13, 1982) (statement of Rep. Hall). \n     Moreover, I must find that there is the potential for such an \n     actual conflict with respect to the investigation of a \n     particular person, not merely with respect to the overall \n     matter. Indeed, when the Act was reauthorized in 1994, \n     Congress considered a proposal for a more flexible standard \n     for invoking the discretionary clause, which would have \n     permitted its use to refer any ``matter'' to an Independent \n     Counsel when the purposes of the Act would be \n     served. Congress rejected this suggestion, explaining that \n     such a standard would ``substantially lower the threshold \n     for use of the general discretionary provision.'' H.R. \n     Conf. Rep. No. 511, 103rd Cong., 2nd Sess. 9 (1994).\n\n\n        2. covered persons--the mandatory provisions of the act\n\n       Let me now turn to the specific allegations in your letter. \n     You assert that there are ``new questions of possible \n     wrongdoing by senior White House officials themselves,'' and \n     you identify a number of particular types of conduct in \n     support of this claim. While all of the specific issues you \n     mention are under review or active investigation by the task \n     force, at this time we have no specific, credible evidence \n     that any covered White House official may have committed a \n     Federal crime in respect of any of these issues. \n     Nevertheless, I will discuss separately each area that you \n     raise.\n       a. Fundraising on Federal Property. First, you suggest that \n     ``federal officials may have illegally solicited and/or \n     received contributions on federal property.'' The conduct you \n     describe could be a violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 607. We are \n     aware of a number of allegations of this sort; all are being \n     evaluated, and where appropriate, investigations have been \n     commenced. The Department takes allegations of political \n     fundraising by Federal employees on Federal property \n     seriously, and in appropriate cases would not hesitate to \n     prosecute such matters. Indeed, the Public Integrity Section, \n     which is overseeing the work of the campaign financing task \n     force, recently obtained a number of guilty pleas from \n     individuals who are soliciting and accepting political \n     contributions within the Department of Agriculture.\n       The analysis of a potential section 607 violation is a \n     fact-specific inquiry. A number of different factors must be \n     considered when reviewing allegations that this law may have \n     been violated:\n       First, the law specifically applies only to contributions \n     as technically defined by the Federal Election Campaign Act \n     (FECA)--funds commonly referred to as ``hard money.'' The \n     statute originally applied broadly to any political \n     fundraising, but in 1979, over the objection of the \n     Department of Justice, Congress narrowed the scope of section \n     607 to render it applicable only to FECA contributions. \n     Before concluding that section 607 may have been violated, we \n     must have evidence that a particular solicitation involved a \n     ``contribution'' within the definition of the FECA.\n       Second, there are private areas of the White House that, as \n     a general rule, fall outside the scope of the statute, \n     because of the statutory requirement that the particular \n     solicitation occur in an area ``occupied in the discharge of \n     official duties.'' 3 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 31 (1979). The \n     distinction recognizes that while the Federal Government \n     provides a residence to the President, similar to the housing \n     that it might provide to foreign service officers, this \n     residence is still the personal home of an individual within \n     which restrictions that might validly apply to the Federal \n     workplace should not be imposed. Before we can conclude that \n     section 607 may have been violated, we must have evidence \n     that fundraising took place in locations covered by the \n     provisions of the statute.\n       Thus, while you express concerns about the possibility of \n     ``specific solicitations * * * made by federal officials at \n     the numerous White House overnights, coffees, and other \n     similar events,'' we do not at this time have any specific \n     and credible evidence of any such solicitation by any covered \n     person that may constitute a violation of section 607.\n       We do not suggest, of course, that our consideration of \n     information concerning fundraising on Federal property is \n     limited to whether the conduct constituted a violation only \n     of section 607. However, at this point in time, we have no \n     specific and credible evidence to suggest that any crime was \n     committed by any covered person in connection with these \n     allegations.\n       b. Misuse of Government Resources. You next assert that \n     Government property and employees may have been used \n     illegally to further campaign interests--conduct which might, \n     in some circumstances, constitute a theft or conversion of \n     Government property in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 641. \n     Again, we are actively investigating allegations that such \n     misconduct may have occurred. However, we are unaware at this \n     time of any evidence that any covered person participated in \n     any such activity, other than use of Government property that \n     is permitted under Federal law, such as the reports that the \n     Vice President used a Government telephone, charging the \n     calls to a nongovernment credit card. Federal regulations \n     permit such incidental use of Government property for \n     otherwise lawful personal purposes. See, e.g., 5 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 2635.704; 41 C.F.R. Sec. 201-21.601 (personal long \n     distance telephone calls). Thus, for example, allegations \n     that a Government telephone or telefacsimile machine may have \n     been used on a few occasions by a covered person for personal \n     purposes does not amount to an allegation of a Federal crime. \n     To the extent that there are allegations warranting \n     investigation that individuals not covered by the Independent \n     Counsel Act diverted Government resources, it is my \n     conclusion, as I explain below, that there is at present \n     no conflict of interest for the Department of Justice to \n     investigate and, if appropriate, prosecute those involved \n     in any such activity.\n       c. Foreign Efforts to Influence U.S. Policy. You next cite \n     reports suggesting the possibility that foreign contributions \n     may have been made in hopes of influencing American police \n     decisions. These allegations are under active investigation \n     by the task force. The facts known at this time, however, do \n     not indicate the criminal involvement of any covered person \n     in such conduct.\n       It is neither unique nor unprecedented for the Department \n     to receive information that foreign interests might be \n     seeking to infuse money into American political campaigns. \n     That was precisely the scenario that underlay the criminal \n     investigations, prosecutions and congressional hearings \n     during the late 1970s involving allegations that a Korean \n     businessman was making illegal campaign contributions, among \n     other things, to Members of Congress to curry congressional \n     support for the Government of South Korea. In a more recent \n     example, in 1996 an individual was prosecuted and convicted \n     for funneling Indian Government funds into Federal elections \n     through the cover of a political action committee.\n       Absent specific and credible evidence of complicity by a \n     covered person, it has never been suggested that the mere \n     allegation that a foreign government may have been trying to \n     provide funds to Federal campaigns should warrant appointment \n     of an independent counsel. Nor can it be the case that an \n     independent counsel is required to investigate because \n     campaign contributors or those who donated to political \n     parties believed their largesse would influence policy or \n     achieve access. The Department of Justice routinely handles \n     such allegations, and because of its experience in reviewing \n     and investigating these sensitive matters, embracing, among \n     other things, issues of national security, is particularly \n     well-equipped to do so.\n       d. Coordination of Campaign Fundraising and Expenditures. \n     You also suggest that the ``close coordination by the White \n     House over the raising and spending of `soft'--and \n     purportedly independent--DNC funds violated Federal election \n     laws, and/or had the legal effect of rendering those funds \n     subject to campaign finance limitations they otherwise would \n     not be subject to.'' We believe this statement misapprehends \n     the law. The FECA does not prohibit the coordination of \n     fundraising or expenditures between a party and its \n     candidates for office. Indeed, the Federal Election \n     Commission (FEC), the body charged by Congress with \n     primary responsibility for interpreting and enforcing the \n     FECA, has historically assumed coordination between a \n     candidate and his or her political party.\n       Of course, coordinated expenditures may be unlawful under \n     the FECA if they are made with funds from prohibited sources, \n     if they were misreported, or if they exceeded applicable \n     expenditure limits. However, we presently lack specific and \n     credible evidence suggesting that any covered person \n     participated in any such violations, if they occurred.\n       With respect to coordinated media advertisements by \n     political parties (an area that has received much attention \n     of late, the proper characterization of a particular \n     expenditure depends not on the degree of coordination, but \n     rather on the content of the message. Indeed, just last year \n     the FEC and the content of the message. Indeed, just last \n     year the FEC and the Department of Justice took this position \n     in a brief filed before the Supreme Court, in a case decided \n     on other grounds. See generally, Brief for the Respondent, \n     Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC (S. Ct. \n     No. 95-489), at 2-3, 18 n. 15, 23-24. In this connection, the \n     FEC has concluded that party media advertisements that focus \n     on ``national legislative activity'' and that do not contain \n     an ``electioneering message'' may be financed, in part, using \n     ``soft'' money, i.e., money that does not comply with FECA's \n     contribution limits. FEC Advisory Op. 1995-25, 2 Fed. Elec. \n     Camp. Fin. Guide (CCH)   6162, at 12,109-12,110 (August 24, \n     1995); FEC Advisory Op. 1985-14, 2 Fed. Elec. Camp. Fin. \n     Guide (CCH)   5819, at 11,185-11,186 (May 30, 1985). \n     Moreover, such advertisements are not subject to any \n     applicable limitations on coordinated expenditures by the \n     party on behalf of its candidates. AO 1985-14 at 11-185-\n     11,186.\n       We recognize that there are allegations that both \n     presidential candidates and both national political parties \n     engaged in a concerted effort to take full advantage of every \n     funding option available to them under the law, to craft \n     advertisements that took advantage of the lesser regulation \n     applicable to legislative issue advertising, and to raise \n     large quantities of soft political funding to finance these \n     ventures. However, at the present time, we lack specific and \n     credible evidence suggesting that these activities violated \n     the FECA. Moreover, even assuming that, after a thorough \n     investigation, the FEC were to conclude that regulatory \n     violations occurred, we presently lack specific and credible \n     evidence suggesting that any covered person participated in \n     any such violations.\n\n[[Page S8707]]\n\n    3. Conflict of Interest--The Discretionary Provisions of the Act\n\n       In urging me to conclude that the investigation poses the \n     type of potential conflict of interest contemplated by the \n     Act, you rely heavily on my testimony before the Senate \n     Committee on Government Affairs in 1993 in support of \n     reauthorization of the Independent Counsel Act. I stand by \n     those views and continue to support the overall concept \n     underlying the Act. My decisions pursuant to the Act have \n     been, I believe, fully consistent with those views.\n       The remarks you quote from my testimony should be \n     interpreted within the context of the statutory language I \n     was discussing. When, for example, I referred to the need for \n     the Act to deal with the inherent conflict of interest when \n     the Department of Justice investigates ``high-level Executive \n     Branch officials,'' I was referring to persons covered under \n     the mandatory provisions of the Act. With respect to the \n     conflict of interest provision, my testimony expressed the \n     conviction that the Act ``would in no way preempt this \n     Department's authority to investigate public corruption,'' \n     and that the Department was clearly capable of ``vigorous \n     investigations of wrongdoing by public officials, whatever \n     allegiance or stripes they may wear. I will vigorously defend \n     and continue this tradition.'' While I endorsed the concept \n     of the discretionary clause to deal with unforeseeable \n     situations, I strongly emphasized that ``it is part of the \n     Attorney General's job to make difficult decisions in tough \n     cases. I have no intention of abdicating that \n     responsibility[.]'' These principles continue to guide my \n     decisionmaking today.\n       There are times when reliance on the discretionary clause \n     is appropriate, and indeed, as you point out, I have done so \n     myself on a few occasions. However, in each of those cases, I \n     considered the particular factual context in which the \n     allegations against those persons arose and the history of \n     the matter. Moreover, even after finding the existence of a \n     potential conflict, I must consider whether under all the \n     circumstances discretionary appointment of an independent \n     counsel is appropriate. In each case, therefore, the final \n     decision has been an exercise of my discretion, as provided \n     for under the Act.\n       I have undertaken the same examination here. Based on the \n     facts as we know them now, I have not concluded that any \n     conflict of interest would ensue from our vigorous and \n     thorough investigation of the allegations contained in your \n     letter.\n       Your letter relies upon press reports, certain documents \n     and various public statements which you assert demonstrate \n     that ``officials at the highest level of the White House were \n     involved in formulating, coordinating and implementing the \n     [Democratic National Committee's (DNC's)] fundraising efforts \n     for the 1996 presidential campaign.'' You suggest that a \n     thorough investigation of ``fundraising improprieties'' will \n     therefore necessarily include an inquiry into the ``knowledge \n     and/or complicity of very senior White House officials,'' and \n     that the Department of Justice would therefore have a \n     conflict of interest investigating these allegations.\n       To the extent that ``improprieties'' comprise crimes, they \n     are being thoroughly investigated by the agents and \n     prosecutors assigned to the task force. Should that \n     investigation develop at any time specific and credible \n     evidence that any covered person may have committed a crime, \n     the Act will be triggered, and I will fulfill my \n     responsibilities under the Act. In addition, should that \n     investigation develop specific and credible evidence that a \n     crime may have been committed by a ``very senior'' White \n     House official who is not covered by the Act, I will decide \n     whether investigation of that person by the Department might \n     result in a conflict of interest, and, if so, whether the \n     discretionary clause should be invoked. Until then, however, \n     the mere fact that employees of the White House and the DNC \n     worked closely together in the course of President Clinton's \n     reelection campaign does not warrant appointment of an \n     independent counsel. As I have stated above, the Department \n     has a long history of investigating allegations of criminal \n     activity by high-ranking Government officials without fear or \n     favor, and will do so in this case.\n       I also do not accept the suggestion that there will be \n     widespread public distrust of the actions and conclusions of \n     the Department if it continues to investigate this matter, \n     creating a conflict of interest warranting the appointment of \n     an independent counsel. First, unless I find that the \n     investigation of a particular person against whom specific \n     and credible allegations have been made would pose a \n     conflict, I have no authority to utilize the procedures of \n     the Act. Moreover, I have confidence that the career \n     professionals in the Department will investigate this matter \n     in a fashion that will satisfy the American people that \n     justice has been done.\n       Finally, even were I to determine that a conflict of \n     interest of the sort contemplated by the statute exists in \n     this case--and as noted above I do not find such a conflict \n     at this time--there would be a number of weighty \n     considerations that I would have to consider in determining \n     whether to exercise my discretion to seek an independent \n     counsel at this time. Because invocation of the conflict \n     of interest provision is discretionary, it would still be \n     my responsibility in that circumstance to weigh all the \n     factors and determine whether appointment of an \n     independent counsel would best serve the national \n     interest. If in the future this investigation reveals \n     evidence indicating that a conflict of interest exists, \n     these factors will continue to weigh heavily in my \n     evaluation of whether or not to invoke the discretionary \n     provisions of the Act.\n       I assure you, once again, that allegations of violations of \n     Federal criminal law with respect to campaign financing in \n     the course of the 1996 Federal elections will be thoroughly \n     investigated and, if appropriate, prosecuted. At this point \n     it appears to me that that task should be performed by the \n     Department of Justice and its career investigators and \n     prosecutors. I want to emphasize, however, that the task \n     force continues to receive new information (much has been \n     discovered even since I received your letter), and I will \n     continue to monitor the investigation closely in light of my \n     responsibilities under the Independent Counsel Act. Should \n     future developments make it appropriate to invoke the \n     procedures of the Act, I will do so without hesitation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Janet Reno.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have circularized my intent to pursue \nthis amendment, and there is no other Senator on the floor now who \nseeks recognition. Before suggesting the absence of a quorum, let me \nsay that we had talked earlier about having a vote on the Kyl mendment \nat 5 o'clock this afternoon. We have not yet locked in that amendment, \nbut it is now being hot lined. It is my expectation that we will vote \nat 5 o'clock this afternoon on the Kyl amendment.\n  I now ask, Madam President, that anybody who opposes the sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution for independent counsel come to speak, anybody \nwho favors it come to speak, or if somebody has another amendment, come \nto speak. We will be glad to set this aside and proceed with the \nbusiness.\n  We also ask there be a hot line looking for a unanimous consent \nagreement later this afternoon, perhaps early evening, 6 o'clock, 6:30, \nto limit any further amendments which may be offered so that we may get \na calendar as to what we are going to do on this bill to proceed to \nthird reading and final disposition, because it is the intention of the \nmanagers to move for third reading if no other amendments are pending.\n  I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Ann McKinley, \na fellow on my staff, be granted the privilege of the floor during \nconsideration of the fiscal year 1998 Labor-HHS appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1056\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I actually will be \nbrief. I had a chance yesterday to speak in opposition to the amendment \nof my colleague from Arizona, Senator Kyl. I know that other Senators \nhave spoken about this as well.\n  I was on the floor early this morning when both Senator Specter and \nSenator Harkin spoke about it. Mr. President, the part of the Kyl \namendment which I am sympathetic to, and my guess is that a good many \nother Senators are sympathetic to it as well, would be the effort to \ntry to expand funding for the Pell Grant Program. And, Mr. President, \nas my colleague, Senator Harkin from Iowa, said earlier this morning, \ninterestingly enough, the Pell Grant Program, named after Claiborne \nPell, our Senator--I think all of us really came to admire and believe \nin Claiborne Pell--really does represent a kind of positive role for \nthe public sector, for Government, because what we as a country have \ndecided is that there are certain decisive areas of life in a\n\n[[Page S8708]]\n\nnation where you do not just leave it up to a market verdict.\n  If, in fact, you have a family, a young person or not such a young \nperson who cannot afford higher education, there is a role to make sure \nthat man or that woman can afford to go on to college, especially since \nthis is becoming more and more important in determining how they will \ndo economically or how their families will do.\n  Indeed, there is a statistic that is a shameful statistic that we \nhave had since the late 1970's, about an 8-percent graduation rate from \ncolleges and universities of those men and women from families with \nincomes under $20,000 a year, the main reason being that they have not \nbeen able to afford to go on and get their higher education.\n  I said this yesterday--and I will have an amendment that will try to \nspeak to this today or tomorrow--it is also true that with all the \ndiscussion about HOPE scholarships and tax credits, since they are not \nrefundable, all families with incomes below $28,000 a year are not \ngoing to become eligible. So we still have a huge hole, especially for \nthose students from moderate- and low-income families. So it seems to \nme, if we are going to be talking about providing support for higher \neducation and for families and for young men and women and older men \nand women--many of our students are older now in our community \ncolleges--we ought to make sure that low-income are included.\n  The problem with the Kyl amendment is that he takes the funding from \nthe LIHEAP, the Low-Income Energy Assistance Program, which is a \nlifeline program for very vulnerable families, especially for those of \nus who represent cold weather States, although part of low-income \nenergy assistance is also, I say to the Chair, since he is from the \ngreat State of North Carolina, some of it also is for cooling \nassistance. I think it was two summers ago that we had a number of \npeople in Chicago, poor people, who died, elderly people, from exposure \nto heat. They just could not afford air conditioning.\n  So, Mr. President, what the Kyl amendment does is it rescinds about \n$500 million, takes about half of what is in a $1 billion program--it \nhas already been cut way down--and it essentially ends the program.\n  Mr. President, I just want people to know, my colleagues to know--I \nthink they do--I think we are going to have a strong vote in opposition \nto the amendment, and that the vast majority of the recipients of an \nenergy grant is maybe $300 a year, or thereabouts. It is a lifeline \nprogram. It just enables an elderly person to be able to afford heat \nand not have to then spend more than she can afford and, therefore, not \nbe able to get ahold of a prescription drug she needs or maybe have to \ncut back on food on the table.\n  It is not much. It is extremely important. The vast majority of the \ncitizens--there are about 110,000 households in Minnesota that have \nparticipated, have incomes under $8,000 a year. These are not wealthy \npeople or middle-income people. These are people who are hard pressed. \nThis is a lifeline program. It represents the goodness in us. And we \ncannot be gutting this program.\n  I have been involved in this fight to kind of maintain or protect the \nLIHEAP program for the last 3 or 4 years. I do not know why we have to \ngo through this every time.\n  Mr. President, let me just make it clear that if you wanted to expand \nthe Pell Grant Program, I can think of other ways to do it. I mean, now \nwe know that with the B-2, the stealth bomber program, we have planes \nthat cannot fly in the rain or the snow. I mean, I will have an \namendment later on that will say, let us not build any more of these \nturkeys. And you can just transfer that funding for the Pell Grant \nProgram. But do not take it out of low-income energy assistance.\n  I see my colleague from Pennsylvania here. I thank him for his \ngraciousness in allowing me to have some time to speak about this. But \nagain, colleagues have heard it from the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nSenator Specter, Senator Harkin, any number of Senators who have come \nto the floor on this. And, again, I hope there will be a strong vote \nagainst the amendment.\n  It is extremely important. It is a matter of elementary decency, if \nyou will, to provide people with some support that they need. It is a \nlifeline support program. And I tell you, to a cold weather State like \nMinnesota, it is very important. We already know in Minnesota right now \nthat we are going to have to ask for some additional emergency energy \nassistance. We did last winter. That is what happens. This is an \nunderfunded program, not overfunded. The only reason I do not have an \namendment calling for more funding is I know the White House, the \nadministration, has been good about providing that emergency funding \nfor States that need it.\n  So, Mr. President, the last thing in the world that makes any sense \nis to essentially gut this program by rescinding $500 million. To all \nmy colleagues, I hope you will vote against this amendment. To Senator \nKyl, who is a Senator that I like and respect, I think you are \nprofoundly mistaken with this amendment, as much as I appreciate your \ngood work here. I hope that we will have a very strong bipartisan vote \nagainst this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by Senator \nKyl. I am reluctant to do so because I strongly support changes in the \neligibility rules for independent and dependent students for Pell \ngrants.\n  Congress needs to make changes in the eligibility rules for these \nstudents. Both independent students and dependent students are unfairly \ndisadvantaged by the rules now in effect. Today, single independent \nstudents at public 4-year institutions are not eligible for a Pell \ngrant if their income is over $10,000. Many of these students will not \nbenefit from the HOPE tax credit and the tax credit for lifelong \nlearning. Federal funds should be available to help them meet their \nmost basic college expenses.\n  A similar problem faces dependent students. The income protection \nallowance is so low for them that it has become a disincentive for \ncollege students to work part-time to help them contribute to college \ncosts. Over three-quarters of undergraduates work part-time while \nenrolled in college. The current system penalizes students who work \nduring the summer and part-time through the school year by reducing \ntheir Pell grant eligibility. We should be encouraging students to take \npart-time jobs, rather than take out additional loans.\n  The budget agreement contains a commitment to allocate $700 million \nfor changes to the needs analysis formula under the Pell grants. The \nHouse appropriations subcommittee provided over $500 million toward \nthis commitment, but the Senate bill contains no funds for this needed \nchange.\n  I am working with others in Congress and with the Department of \nEducation to ensure that a satisfactory appropriation level is \ncontained in the final bill.\n  Senator Kyl supports making funds available to reform the needs \nanalysis. But unfortunately, to pay for the reform, he makes a deep cut \nin the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program.\n  For the 5 million beneficiaries of LIHEAP across the Nation, \nincluding 120,000 in Massachusetts, it will be an unnecessarily harsh \nwinter if this important program is slashed.\n  Some 95 percent of the households receiving LIHEAP assistance have \nannual incomes below $18,000. They spend an extremely burdensome 18 \npercent of their income on energy, compared to the average middle-class \nfamily, which spends only 4 percent.\n  Researchers at Boston City Hospital have documented a ``heat or eat \neffect.'' Higher utility bills during the coldest months force low-\nincome families to spend less money on food. The result is increased \nmalnutrition among children.\n  Almost twice as many low-weight and undernourished children were \nadmitted to Boston City Hospital's emergency room immediately following \nthe coldest month of the winter. No family should have to choose \nbetween heating and eating.\n  Low-income elderly will be at the greatest risk if LIHEAP funds are \nslashed, because they are the most vulnerable to hypothermia. In fact, \nolder Americans accounted for more than half of all hypothermia deaths \nin 1991.\n  In addition, the elderly are much more likely to live in homes built \nbefore 1940, which are less energy efficient and put them at greater \nrisk.\n  Low-income elderly who have trouble paying their fuel bills are often \ndriven\n\n[[Page S8709]]\n\nto rely on room heaters, fireplaces, ovens, and wood-burning stoves to \nsave money. Between 1986 and 1990, these higher-risk heating sources \nwere the second leading cause of fire deaths among the elderly. In \nfact, elderly citizens are up to 12 times more likely to die in \nheating-related fires than adults under 65.\n  LIHEAP is a lifeline for Massachusetts and many other cold weather \nStates. I hope we can work together to make the needs analysis changes \nin the Pell grants, without denying this lifeline to a very vulnerable \ngroup. I urge that the Kyl amendment be defeated.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to join with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Specter and the \nsubcommittee's ranking member Senator Harkin, in opposition to Senator \nKyl's amendment to cut funding for the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program [LIHEAP]. While I applaud the Senator from Arizona's \ngoal to increase funding for Pell grants, I can not sanction a move \nthat would essentially gut the LIHEAP program, effectively depriving \nmillions of the disadvantaged, elderly, and disabled of critical \nassistance.\n  Mr. President, the appropriation for LIHEAP has declined more than 50 \npercent over the past decade, down from $2.1 billion in fiscal 1985. \nDuring that time, the eligible population has grown from 23 to 30 \nmillion. In Vermont, Federal cutbacks have forced the State to push \nback the deadline for applying for fuel aid to September 2. Mr. \nPresident, I strongly disagree with the contention that the need for \nfuel assistance has declined since the program's founding. Last winter, \ntwo-thirds of the 1,400 Vermonters who missed the State's benefits \ndeadline were denied assistance; and the number of people who ran out \nof fuel and requested emergency aid doubled.\n  Mr. President, Federal cutbacks since 1995 have reduced the number of \nfamilies in Vermont that receive assistance from over 24,000 to around \n12,000 this year. These families should not face the prospect of \nfurther cutbacks.\n  Mr. President, I want to emphasize to the program's critics that \nLIHEAP helps the neediest of the needy. As others have already stated, \nalmost 70 percent of recipient families have an annual income of less \nthan $8,000, and 44 percent have at least one member who is elderly and \n20 percent have one member who is disabled. Currently, only 5 million \nfamilies are being served nationally, a million less than 2 years ago.\n  Mr. President, this is a time to increase funding for LIHEAP not \ndecrease it. Last month, as cochair of the Northeast-Midwest Senate \nCoalition, I spearheaded a letter to Senators Specter and Harkin that \nasked for an increase in regular funding for LIHEAP so that the program \nis not forced to rely on releases of emergency funds to meet basic \nneeds. Fifty-five Senators signed on to this letter.\n  Mr. President, the Appropriations Committee should be commended for \nrecognizing that the need for LIHEAP is greater than current resources. \nThe committee has included $1.2 billion in so-called advance funds for \nfiscal 1999. I urge my colleagues to overwhelmingly reject this \namendment to cut LIHEAP and support Senators Specter and Harkin in \ntheir effort to increase LIHEAP funding in fiscal 1999.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there has been a hotline run, that is to \nsay, Senators on both sides of the aisle have been notified, and I now \nask unanimous consent that a vote occur on or in relation to the \npending Kyl amendment at 5 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I again renew the request that any \nSenator who has an amendment to offer should come to the floor. And \nagain I say that we are going to be seeking a unanimous-consent \nagreement to limit amendments which were filed, trying to get that \naccomplished by late afternoon or early evening.\n  Again, in the absence of any Senator on the floor seeking \nrecognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the pending amendment. I \nunderstand we will soon vote on the amendment of the Senator from \nArizona, Senator Kyl. I wanted to take just a moment to address that \namendment that is before the body.\n  Mr. President, Senator Kyl has suggested that we increase Pell grant \nfunding by $528 million. That is a worthy goal. That is something that \nI would like to see done. But he suggests paying for it by taking that \nmoney out of the low-income heating assistance program.\n  The Senator from Arizona experiences a different reality than the one \nI experience. The Senator from Arizona says the energy crisis is over; \nthe need for low-income heating assistance has ended. I could not \ndisagree more. We have just had in my State the worst winter in our \nhistory. In fact, we saw heating oil prices spike significantly, with \nnatural gas hitting an all-time high. Propane spiked dramatically, \nhitting an all-time high.\n  Mr. President, this is not the time to end the low-income heating \nassistance program. We just went through a winter in which not only did \nwe have the worst winter in terms of snowfall in our history, but we \nhad, if I am not mistaken, eight blizzards and nine major winter \nstorms. We also had the most powerful winter storm in 50 years in the \nfirst week of April.\n  Mr. President, that was devastating in my State. In fact, this \ncollection of storms was devastating in my State. Low-income heating \nassistance played a key role in helping people who are faced with the \nchoice between heating and eating. That is not a choice anybody should \nhave to make in this country.\n  So, while I certainly support the underlying intention of the Senator \nfrom Arizona to increase assistance for Pell grants, I would simply \npoint to the record of what we have already done.\n  We have a $1 billion increase for Pell grants in this legislation; \nfunding of $6.9 billion for Pell grants. Again, I would like to see \nthat increased further. But I don't think the way to fund it is to \ndramatically reduce what is available for low-income heating \nassistance. This bill has $1 billion for fiscal year 1998 in low-income \nheating assistance and $300 million in an emergency contingency fund. \nTo cut back by $528 million to add to Pell grants I don't think can be \njustified.\n  So I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing the Kyl amendment, not \nbecause I am opposed to an increase in Pell grants but because I am \nopposed to taking it out of low-income heating assistance at a time \nwhen we have just experienced in the northern plains the worst winter \nin our history, and, if the almanac is to be believed, we may be faced \nwith another tough winter this year. I hope that is not the case, but \nif it is, low-income heating assistance may make the difference between \npeople making a decision of heating versus eating. Again, that is not a \ndecision anybody should have to make.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we be given an \nextra 5 minutes past 5 o'clock to make statements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S8710]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/03/senate-section/article/S8693-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  NATIONAL DAY OF RECOGNITION FOR THE HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS OF DIANA, \n                           PRINCESS OF WALES\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am offering for myself, Senator \nLeahy, Senator Specter, Senator Landrieu, Senator Mikulski, and I am \nsure others, a resolution that designates Saturday, September 6, 1997, \nas a National Day of Recognition for the Humanitarian Efforts of Diana, \nPrincess of Wales.\n  Death is always difficult to accept. It is, however, more difficult \nwhen it captures someone in the prime of her life as it has Princess \nDiana. It is safe to say that events surrounding her death will make us \nall take a closer look at the handling of this event by the press, its \nresponsibilities, and the role it should play in the future.\n  As a mother, humanitarian, and a goodwill ambassador, Princess Diana \nwas an inspiration to many people throughout the world who admired her \nstrength in adversity, her dedication to those less fortunate, and her \ndevoted love to her children.\n  The extraordinary outpouring of grief and affection is a true \ntestament to the legacy that she leaves. The stunning array of flowers, \ncandles, and notes in front of the British Embassy is just one \nindication of the high esteem in which the Princess was held here in \nthe United States. Our country rejected a monarchy a long time ago, but \nwe know a true friend when we see one.\n  In a town accustomed to the art of issue advocacy, the Princess of \nWales was clearly one of the most persuasive and compelling advocates \nto have graced our Nation's Capital. Much has already been said about \nher efforts to raise awareness and attention to breast cancer and AIDS. \nShe recently took up the cause of banning the deployment of \nantipersonnel landmines. She was informed and articulate and committed \nto these causes.\n  Many people can make speeches, and many people can throw gala \nbenefits. What set Diana apart from others working for these same \ncauses was the gentleness of her spirit. To break the back of \nintolerance and to help to dispel unfounded notions about AIDS, Diana \nbroke tradition, and held babies afflicted with AIDS in her arms and to \noffer her hands to comfort AIDS patients.\n  We understood that she participated in these activities not just out \nof a sense of duty but because she genuinely cared. She delighted in \nchildren, commiserated with the rank and file, and listened to the \nelderly or less fortunate. Her vulnerability was also her strength. She \ncould connect with people like few people ever could. She was indeed \nthe people's Princess.\n  Although she was a symbol of glamour and celebrity, she taught us all \nthat the quality of life is measured by what you do for others and how \nyou treat others. By that measure, Diana's all too short life was very \nrich indeed. Her warmth and joie de vivre transcended wealth and power.\n  Along with my fellow Utahns and millions of people around the world, \nElaine and I were shocked and saddened to hear the tragic news of her \nuntimely and tragic death. We want to extend our sincere and heartfelt \ncondolences and sympathy to her family, and especially to her two sons, \nPrince William and Prince Harry.\n  In offering this resolution, Mr. President, Senator Leahy and I \nbelieve it is appropriate to extend the sympathy of all Americans to \nthe people of the United Kingdom on the death of such an extraordinary \nlady.\n  Mr. President, we expect to pass this today and I urge the support of \nall of our colleagues.\n  This is a sad event. This was a sad day. This is a tremendous loss \nfor the world. And this is the least we can do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor with the senior \nSenator from Utah this resolution that designates September 6, 1997, as \na National Day of Recognition for the Humanitarian Efforts of Diana, \nPrincess of Wales.\n  What we try to do with this resolution is to convey a sense of the \ntremendous sorrow that Americans--indeed, people around the world--felt \nat the shocking news of her death in Paris.\n  I was with my wife in Vermont, and was called out of a gathering to \nbe given the preliminary news of the accident. The two of us went back \nto our home that evening praying that the injuries were not life \nthreatening. Of course, within a matter of hours we learned that she \nhad died.\n  We have all been moved by the outpouring of affection by people \neverywhere, who remember the Princess of Wales as an extraordinary \nhumanitarian who gave voice to the most vulnerable people. I remember \nthe conversations I had with her about the scourge of landmines. This \nwas an issue that I was honored to work with her on. She and Elizabeth \nDole, the wife of our former distinguished majority leader and \nPresident of the American Red Cross, and myself and others, held a \nfundraiser for the victims of landmines earlier this year, and raised \nover half a million dollars for people who had lost arms and legs or \ntheir eyesight from landmines. She could do that, by simply spending an \nevening talking about the plight of landmine victims. She said about \nher trip to Angola, ``Before I went to Angola, I knew the facts but the \nreality was a shock.'' I wish more people would go see what she saw, \nand walk where she walked. Landmines would be banned tomorrow.\n\n  A lot of us can give speeches about landmines. Many people around the \nworld have worked to stop the scourge of landmines, but Diana brought a \nhuman face to the crusade to ban them. She gave a voice to landmine \nvictims. When she visited them, in Angola, or Bosnia, the whole world \nsaw those victims. When she held in her arms a child maimed by a \nlandmine, the whole world saw that child. And when they saw her walk \ninto a minefield, the whole world saw the danger so many people face \nevery day.\n  There was never a question in my mind, in my conversations with her, \nabout the sincerity of her compassion. She saw the victims of landmines \nthrough the eyes of a mother, a mother who cared not only for her own \ntwo sons, but for the sons and daughters of those dying worldwide.\n  This week and next week nations of the world meet in Oslo to take the \nfinal steps toward an international treaty banning landmines. I hope \neach of them will think of what this woman did, in calling attention to \nthe victims of landmines. There would be no more fitting memorial to \nthis great woman than a treaty that bans anti-personnel landmines from \nthis Earth forever.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague. I have appreciated working with \nhim on this. He spoke about the many other humanitarian causes the \nPrincess was involved in. I mentioned landmines, of course, because I \nsaw first-hand how she became involved not as a Princess but as a \nmother, a mother who knew how other mothers suffered when their \nchildren suffered. She spoke for all of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/03/senate-section/article/S8710-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8710-S8720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1056\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham).

Mr. President, I could talk at some length about this \namendment, and I will not. I will just make a few introductory \ncomments, and then my colleague, Senator McCain, will speak on this.\n  We have, I believe, close to 66, or thereabouts, cosponsors. This \namendment, which I am very proud to offer today, is really an amendment \nthat is\n\n[[Page S8712]]\n\nnamed after Mo Udall, who was a very distinguished Representative in \nthe House of Representatives and somebody that many people here have a \ngreat deal of love and respect for.\n  This amendment would call for 10 Parkinson's research centers. This \nwould be $100 million a year. The reason for this amendment is that \nParkinson's disease is a devastating neurological disease. Probably my \ncolleagues are very familiar with it. They may have had a loved one who \nsuffered from it. I had two parents who suffered from Parkinson's \ndisease.\n  Mr. President, what happens with people with Parkinson's is that \nthere is a tremendous problem with shaking, people have difficulty \nwalking, and many people have really found it difficult to be, if you \nwill, their own lobbyist. People have found it difficult to speak for \nthemselves.\n  But what has happened in the last several years is that there has \nbeen a wonderful group of people who have come here. The Udall family \nhas been very, very important in this whole struggle. In addition, Joan \nSamuelson, with the Parkinson's Action Network, has been really \ncritical to this. They have come here and I think have met with \nSenators, Democrats and Republicans alike. This is a bipartisan effort \nwe have on the floor of the Senate. They have essentially said to all \nof us, ``Time is not on our side. We have the research that we can \npoint to. It is such promising research. We are on the cuspis of major \nbreakthroughs, but if we do not at least increase this funding for \nresearch for many of us, we really will not have that much of a \nfuture.''\n  Mr. President, there are a million people in our country, men and \nwomen who struggle with Parkinson's disease. Up to now, we have been \nspending about $30 per person. It is a really shamefully low amount of \nmoney that we have spent. Very little has been invested.\n  But now these men and women, this community, has come to the Nation's \nCapital. They have met with all of us, and they have made their case. I \nam very honored to offer this amendment with Senator McCain. I hope we \nwill get very, very strong support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add as original cosponsors \nto this amendment Senator Craig, Senator Burns, Senator Durbin, Senator \nFord, Senator D'Amato, Senator Breaux, Senator Moseley-Braun, Senator \nSantorum, Senator Johnson, Senator Snowe, Senator Harry Reid, Senator \nHollings, Senator Torricelli, Senator Faircloth, Senator Levin, and \nSenator Lautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1074, As Modified\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to send a \nmodification to the desk, along with the cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to modify his \namendment, the yeas and nays not having been ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

I defer to my colleague from Arizona, and I thank him \nfor his--I am not going to use the word ``leadership'' because many \npeople always talk about Senator McCain's leadership--but for his \nemotional and personal involvement. He is a Senator who is very \nconnected to people. I thank him for all of his work. I hope we will \nget a good, strong vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Minnesota. He is a \nman of great spirit, a man of great commitment. When the Senator from \nMinnesota gets involved in an issue, he is heard from. I believe his \ninvolvement in this issue is important and, indeed, critical. I don't \nthink it is inappropriate to mention that the life of the Senator from \nMinnesota has been touched in the most graphic and dramatic fashion by \nthis disease we are discussing today. I thank the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. President, I support Senator Wellstone's amendment. Scientists \nhave made tremendous new discoveries and progress in regard to \nParkinson's disease, which clearly illustrates how close we are to \nfinding a cure and treatment for this deadly disease. According to a \nwide array of experts, we\n\n[[Page S8713]]\n\nare on the verge of substantial, groundbreaking scientific discoveries \nin the next few years regarding the cause and potential cure of \nParkinson's disease.\n  The most recent scientific discovery of a gene abnormality that \ncauses some cases of Parkinson's disease has provided researchers with \na powerful new tool for understanding Parkinson's disease. This is the \nkind of breakthrough that makes a strong case for ensuring adequate \nfunding for Parkinson's research.\n  I don't come to the floor very often on a situation like this, but \nthere is a gross inequity here and one that needs rectification. I find \nit gravely disturbing that despite the significant progress scientists \nare making in the field of Parkinson's, the National Institutes of \nHealth continuously fail to provide an appropriate amount of funding \nfor Parkinson's research, which is why the Senator from Minnesota and I \nare here.\n  During fiscal year 1996, the National Institutes of Health spent $32 \nmillion for direct Parkinson's research. That is about $32 for each of \nthe approximately 1 million Parkinson's patients--$32 for each of the \napproximately 1 million Parkinson's patients. Compare this to the \n$2,143 per AIDS victim; $338 per cancer victim; or $200 per breast \ncancer victim; or $81 per Alzheimer's victim; $74 per heart disease \nvictim, not including the additional funding just adopted as an \namendment to this bill.\n  Obviously, funding for Parkinson's research is grossly inadequate \ncompared to support which other diseases receive at NIH. By failing to \nprovide scientists with adequate funding, we are potentially letting a \ncure for this dreadful disease slip further and further into the \nfuture. This amendment will ensure that our scientific researchers have \navailable the necessary funding and support to proceed as quickly as \npossible to combat Parkinson's.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota has described what this \nlegislation would do, including the establishment of 10 Morris K. Udall \nCenters for Research on Parkinson's Disease throughout the Nation, \ncreate a national Parkinson's disease clearinghouse and other things.\n  Approximately 1 million Americans are afflicted with Parkinson's \ndisease. Parkinson's is a debilitating, degenerative disease which is \ncaused when nerve centers in an individual's brain lose their ability \nto regulate body movements. People afflicted by this disease experience \ntremors, loss of balance and repeated falls, loss of memory, confusion \nand depression. Ultimately, this disease results in total incapacity of \nan individual, including the inability to speak. This disease knows no \nboundaries, does not discriminate and strikes without warning.\n  This amendment is supported by the National Parkinson's Foundation, \nthe American Parkinson's Disease Association and Parkinson's Action \nNetwork. These organizations, as well as many other individuals \ninvolved in grassroots support activities, have worked long and hard to \nachieve widespread support for this authorization bill in both the \nHouse and Senate.\n  The Mo Udall Parkinson's Research and Education Act, which is the \nbasis for this amendment, has 64 cosponsors in the Senate and \napproximately 240 cosponsors in the House. Mr. President, we cannot \nafford to lose this opportunity to continue the momentous progress in \nfinding the cause for a cure for this terrible illness. On behalf of \nthe millions of Americans afflicted with Parkinson's and their families \nand friends, I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Hatch be added as \nan original cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, finally, I would like to thank the people \nthat I mentioned earlier--the National Parkinson's Foundation, the \nAmerican Parkinson's Disease Association, and Parkinson's Action \nNetwork. Without the help of these organizations, we would not be here \ntoday.\n  Finally, I know sometimes amendments have a tendency to be dropped in \nconference. The Senator from Minnesota and I feel very strongly about \nthis amendment, and that is why we feel it is necessary that we have a \nrollcall vote on this issue. I hope that the managers of the bill will \nsee the way clear to preserve this amendment in conference, as it is \nsupported by, as I mentioned, now 65 of our colleagues in the Senate \nand over 240 Members of the House.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to add one final word to what my \ncolleague, Senator McCain, has had to say. Above and beyond the \norganizations that Senator McCain recognized for their fine work, and \nabove and beyond Mo Udall, this amendment comes from legislation which, \nas I said, is really named after Mo Udall, for reasons I don't need to \nexplain to any colleague. I also would like to thank, but I want to do \nthis carefully, Muhammad Ali, who has been very courageous, and I use \nthat word carefully. Muhammad Ali struggles with Parkinson's, and he \ncould have chosen to have had the world or the country have only seen \nhim as he was when he was in his prime as a boxer. Instead, he has been \nvery public, very visible and a very, very strong advocate, not just \nfor himself but for many, many other people.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, and I know that my colleague \nfrom Indiana is going to have a second-degree amendment which I think \nreally adds strength to this and he has some very thoughtful and \nimportant questions to raise or comments to make, but I am going to end \non a personal note. I want to say to everybody here that we really do \nneed to have a strong vote, and we need to keep this in conference.\n  When Senator McCain was talking about this disorder and what it does \nto people, I remember when L-Dopa, the first drug, came out. My father \nwas in the original pilot group. For a while, L-Dopa helped, but then \nit reached the point where it did not. With my father, Leon Wellstone, \nat the very end, he not only could not walk, and he was a writer and \nhis hand would shake and he could not type, but, in addition, he could \nnot even speak.\n  It can be so ravaging to people. It can be so devastating. The reason \nwe have brought this amendment to the floor is that it is an equity \nquestion. So precious little has been invested in Parkinson's research \nat the very time when there is such potential for big breakthroughs.\n  I want to make it clear to everybody that we have had the Parkinson's \ncommunity come here to Washington, and they have come year after year \nfor the last 3 or 4 years that they have been working on this. Each \ntime, we make progress, and then at the very end, for some reason, they \nget shut out.\n  So I make a plea to people on the basis of please vote for this \nfunding. It is just a matter of elementary fairness and justice. It is \njust a matter of equity. Please don't shut people out. I just don't \nwant to see people who have been so courageous and who have come here \nand have struggled so hard not be successful in this Senate and in this \nHouse of Representatives. We have to pass this legislation. It really \nwould be a wonderful vote, and it really would make a huge difference \nin the lives of many of our neighbors and many of our friends who are \nmen and women of enormous worth and enormous dignity and enormous \nsubstance. Nothing I say is said out of pity, it is said out of respect \nfor the dignity of people. I just would like to say one more time, I \nhope we will get a huge vote for this amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment to provide a statutory \nprogram for research and training with respect to Parkinson's, I think, \nis well founded.\n  We have worked within the subcommittee to increase the funding for \nthe National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke which \nincluded language in the Senate report highlighting the importance of \nfurther activity on Parkinson's disease research. And the activities of \nthe sponsors of\n\n[[Page S8714]]\n\nthis amendment, whom I commend, will direct greater intensive effort on \nParkinson's, which is a horrible disease. It has afflicted many, many \npeople.\n  With the enactment of this amendment, I think we will be taking a \nfirm stand to show the emphasis that the Senate, hopefully, ultimately \nthe full Congress, will place on additional research and resources \nbeing directed against Parkinson's.\n  There is a great deal that could be said. We have a number of other \namendments, so I will limit my comments to those brief remarks.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I want to concur with what the chairman just said about \nthis amendment. Obviously, all of us are very concerned about the lack \nof, shall we say, appropriate funding levels for research into the \ncauses and interventions and cures of Parkinson's disease. This is \nsomething that I have been very close to for the last several years. I \nknow that both Senator McCain and Senator Wellstone have been leaders \non this issue in the Senate. And I congratulate them and commend them \nfor their leadership on the issue of proper funding for Parkinson's \nresearch.\n  There have been some recent breakthroughs in the causes of \nParkinson's, some recent breakthroughs in genetic tracing, some recent \nbreakthroughs in possible interventions, early interventions for those \nwho are detected early with the onset of Parkinson's disease.\n  This is a quantum increase. It is not out of bounds. Certainly the \nincidents of Parkinson's disease in this country and around the globe \nwarrants the type of investment in research that the amendment \nanticipates. It remains to be seen whether or not we can accommodate \nthis huge increase within the confines of the conference. I can assure \nthe authors of the amendment that this Senator, and I am sure that \nSenator Specter, will do what we can to maintain this type of a level \nfor Parkinson's research. What the disposition will be on the House \nside, obviously, we have no control over that. But I want to commend \nboth Senator McCain and Senator Wellstone for their leadership on this \nissue and hope that we can do what we can in conference to keep the \nfunding level up for Parkinson's research.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I want to add my support to this. I have \nbeen a supporter of additional funds for Parkinson's. But in the \nprocess of all of this, and serving on the committee, I have raised, on \na number of occasions, my concerns that we are making decisions about \nwhich diseases, which research centers at NIH receive the funds. We are \nmaking that decision, I think, in well-intended ways, in ways that we \nhope will direct funds to provide breakthroughs and better research and \nhopefully cures for some of these diseases, yet I have been concerned \nwe are doing it on a piecemeal basis.\n  I am concerned that those organizations which have the greatest \nlobbying clout, who have been able to contact the most Senators or \nCongressmen, the ones who have generated the most support at home or \nwho are best organized have become those that are rewarded by passage \nof legislation like this, and that those who do not have the lobbying \nexpertise, the lobbying clout, do not have the same kind of friends in \nCongress that others have and end up being shorted. As a consequence, \nwe are making decisions on the basis of anecdotal evidence--and some \nscientific evidence--but on the basis of political decisions as much as \nscientific decisions.\n  Medical research is a complicated field. NIH is a wonderful \norganization that attempts to direct funds in ways that will ensure \nthat research dollars are going into those areas where the best results \ncan be obtained. And yet, in my visits to NIH, and talking with a \nnumber of people out there, and my observation of the process here, it \nis clear that those funds are not always directed in the most \nexpeditious manner, not always directed in ways that provide the most \nhope in terms of finding breakthroughs and in finding cures.\n  Having said that, there is no question that Parkinson's research over \nthe years has been shorted. In 1994, it had a funding rate of $26 per \npatient, the lowest of all the major diseases, yet it affects one \nmillion or more Americans. Its direct funding in 1994 was only $26 \nmillion, the lowest dollar number of all the major diseases.\n  So I think it is important that we recognize that here is a \ndebilitating disease that affects a million or more Americans, that has \nhad a personal impact on many of us and our families, that has \ngenerated a very effective organization that supports research, \nincreased funding for research, but at the same time I think we have to \nacknowledge or we should acknowledge and recognize that this is not the \nbest way to go about allocating funds for research at NIH, that the \nlobby group that is the most effective or the Members who are in the \nbest position to direct the funds because of their committee positions \nor whatever, that is not the way that we ought to be allocating \nresearch dollars.\n\n  We ought to be doing it on a meritorious basis, one that is supported \nby medical science, one that receives the recommendation of independent \nresearchers or an independent body or medical experts that certainly \nhave more expertise in this area than we do. I say that because if you \nlook at the list of diseases and the centers and the way we fund those, \nthere is clearly an imbalance. We clearly are directing funds to areas \nwhere research is unnecessary or is duplicated. We clearly are not \ndirecting funds to areas where we need research.\n  I have discussed this with NIH officials. I have been told--and will \nnot quote any names--but I have been told by people who are in a \nposition to know, they are duplicating and in some cases tripling the \namount of funds going into the same research simply because they are \ndirected by the Congress to fund that specific disease. And, of course, \nany duplication or triplication or every excess dollar that has to be \nspent because it is politically directed to be spent and not medically \nnecessary or scientifically required and going to meritorious studies \nis a dollar that does not go into some other research, whether it is \ndirect research or indirect research, that could offer potentially \nlife-saving breakthroughs in other diseases.\n  Just an example or two. All of us have heard about Parkinson's, and \nwe are going to increase Parkinson's here. And I am going to support \nthat increase. I will say this. This is the last specific research \ndollar increase that I am going to support until we have an outside \norganization that can give us some recommendations as to how to \nallocate our money. This ``disease of the month'' or who has the best \nlobby or who has the most influential friends in Congress is not the \nway that we ought to be directing research funds. But I have been a \nlong-time supporter of Parkinson's.\n  They have made their case. But I have told them I am not going to \ncontinue on this basis. I will support the bill this year, but I am \ngoing to be adding shortly an amendment that Senator Frist will speak \nto, of which I would like to add him as a cosponsor, which will \ninitiate this study so that we would have a report so that in next \nyear's appropriations process we have before us the information we need \nin order to make rational decisions, meritorious decisions rather than \njust simply political decisions. I don't mean just simply political \ndecisions, but decisions that are not wholly supported by medical \nscience.\n  Very few people have heard of polycystic kidney disease, PKD. I had \nnot heard of it until I was visited by a friend of mine who introduced \nme to the disease. PKD receives a ridiculously low appropriation, and \nyet PKD is a disease that affects 500,000 Americans. It affects their \nkidneys in a way that they do not function. And yet, as a Government, \nbecause kidney dialysis is covered under Medicaid and Medicare, we \nspend untold millions of dollars in paying the bills for kidney \ndialysis when we provide virtually nothing for research in an area \nwhere some amazing advances are possible, according to the medical \nresearchers, that can eliminate this disease and save the taxpayer \nliterally billions of dollars.\n  But because PKD is something that has not generated a huge lobbying \neffort, does not have influential friends in Congress in key positions, \nPKD continues to get the short end of the stick\n\n[[Page S8715]]\n\nin terms of research dollars. And yet, if there was ever an area where \nwe ought to be directing research funds, if the medical science says we \nhave an opportunity here to utilize these effectively and provide \nresearch, if there is ever an area that can free up funds that we can \nuse for more research, in Parkinson's and other areas, or to help with \nthe Medicare funding or Medicaid funding or Medicare funding, it ought \nto be in polycystic kidney disease, because the Government, we have \nagreed we are going to pay for transfusions on dialysis, we are going \nto pay for those out of Federal funds. And so year after year after \nyear we pay billions of dollars to provide very costly and very \ndifficult relief for people suffering from this disease, and yet we \ngive them virtually nothing in terms of their research.\n  As a consequence of all that, and through discussions we have had in \ncommittee with some NIH scientists and researchers, I think we are \ncoming to a consensus here that we ought to initiate a process by which \nwe can coordinate our research dollars in a way that it gives us an \neffective use of those dollars and gives us the best chance to provide \nthe best research in the best ways.\n  This amendment that I am going to offer shortly would require a \ncomprehensive review of NIH and congressional policies and procedures \nfor establishing priorities for research dollars. And that review has \nto be independent of the agency. The amendment requires that the agency \ncontract with the Institute of Medicine, which I think is a highly \nrespected and reputable institution, to conduct the study according to \nthe statutory specifications, and requires a report to Congress within \n6 months so that the authorizing and the appropriating committees for \nnext year's cycle will have that information before them before they \nmake their decisions.\n  It raises critical questions about how we ought to direct research \ndollars, talks about how much funding that would be appropriate, and \nthe statutory changes that will be needed to change NIH policies and \nprocedures.\n  The Institute of Medicine is particularly directed to focus on the \nfactors and criteria used by NIH to make disease funding allocations, \nto focus on the process by which the funding decisions are made, the \nmechanisms for public input and the impact of congressional statutory \ndirectives.\n  Again, as I said, Dr. Olonow, from NIH, who testified before our \ncommittee, thought that this was an appropriate way to proceed. The \nfunding is drawn from NIH's general administrative funds. None of these \nfunds will come from existing research dollars. This amendment is not \nopposed by NIH. I think it will give us a means of making wiser \ndecisions about how we appropriate dollars in the future.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1075\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the conduct of a comprehensive, independent \n   study of National Institutes of Health research priority setting)\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I now offer this amendment by sending it to \nthe desk, and ask unanimous consent that Senator Frist be added as an \noriginal cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there objection to setting aside the pending amendments so the \nCoats amendment would be considered as a first-degree amendment?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Coats], for himself and Mr. \n     Frist, proposes an amendment numbered 1075.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 49, after line 26, add the following:\n\n\n    comprehensive independent study of nih research priority setting\n\n       Sec.   . (a) Study by the Institute of Medicine.--Not later \n     than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services shall enter into a \n     contract with the Institute of Medicine to conduct a \n     comprehensive study of the policies and process used by the \n     National Institutes of Health to determine funding \n     allocations for biomedical research.\n       (b) Matters To Be Assessed.--The study under subsection (a) \n     shall assess--\n       (1) the factors or criteria used by the National Institutes \n     of Health to determine funding allocations for disease \n     research;\n       (2) the process by which research funding decisions are \n     made;\n       (3) the mechanisms for public input into the priority \n     setting process; and\n       (4) the impact of statutory directives on research funding \n     decisions.\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 6 months after the date on \n     which the Secretary of Health and Human Services enters into \n     the contract under subsection (a), the Institute of Medicine \n     shall submit a report concerning the study to the Committee \n     on Labor and Human Resources and the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the Senate, and the Committee on Commerce \n     and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (2) Requirement.--The report under paragraph (1) shall set \n     forth the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the \n     Institute of Medicine for improvements in the National \n     Institutes of Health research funding policies and processes \n     and for any necessary congressional action.\n       (d) Funding.--Of the amount appropriated in this title for \n     the National Institutes of Health, $300,000 shall be made \n     available for the study and report under this section.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I appreciate the support and the efforts \nthat Senator Wellstone has provided. We have discussed this matter on a \nnumber of occasions. He is, I believe, willing to accept the amendment \nand supports what we are trying to do.\n  I know Senator Frist and maybe others would like to speak on the \nCoats amendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, could I add Senator Bryan as an \noriginal cosponsor of the Wellstone-McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague from Indiana and also my \ncolleague from Tennessee for their thoughtful and important amendment, \nand I thank them for their support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. I rise to commend my colleagues, Senators Wellstone and \nMcCain, for their excellent leadership on this issue and their \ncommitment to improving the lives of patients suffering from \nParkinson's disease.\n  I would like to recognize at this time the important efforts of all \nof the advocacy groups who have done such a wonderful job in educating \npeople broadly, increasing the awareness about the devastation of this \ndisease, and the continued need for research, and to the causes and to \nthe treatments and to the eventual cure of Parkinson's disease. It is \nin large part due to these efforts, this broad effort at the grassroots \nlevel across this country that there has been increased focus on \nParkinson's disease and Parkinson's research at the National Institutes \nof Health.\n  I want to reiterate and support the words of my colleague from \nIndiana who has expressed some concern with regard to the process of \nhow these decisions are made and are brought forward, and thus our \namendment which he has put forward. As chair of the subcommittee on \npublic health and safety that has jurisdiction over the majority of the \npublic health agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, I \nmust state today, because I believe we should not be placing \nauthorizing legislation on an appropriations bill but should rather be \nconsidering this particular bill within the overall NIH reauthorization \nprocess.\n  I, along with my fellow committee members, Senators Jeffords and \nCoats, have discussed at length the critical role our public health \nagencies play in improving the health and well being of American \ncitizens. We have a strong commitment to push forward authorization \nlegislation for each of the National Institutes of Health's vital \nprograms, but we have to do this in a systematic way through a coherent \nprocess, one in which we would be able to give thoughtful review and \ncomparative review to the programs that we establish.\n  Thus, although I am very supportive of increasing funding in support \nfor Parkinson's research, my preference very clearly would have been to \nwork\n\n[[Page S8716]]\n\nwith my colleague and to include this bill within our overall NIH \nreauthorization bill that would address the various concerns.\n  I also want to reiterate what my colleague from Indiana has said, \nthat we have to be very careful because once again we are falling into \nthis risky area of establishing a precedent that once again we take a \ndisease either of the week or of the month or of the year or in \nreflection or in response to a very strong advocacy group and react to \nthat individual disease without consideration of this larger process.\n  Every week people come to my office with multiple voices requesting \nmore funds to be allocated to research in a variety of diseases. It \nmight be heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease or pancreatic \ndisease or neurological research. Again, each comes forward making a \nvery strong case. As a physician, and as one who is empathetic and who \nhas treated many of these diseases, my initial response is to say we \nshould increase funding, and if we do increase funding we will find a \ncure, better treatment or relieve suffering.\n  The problem is that is exactly the way the system works today. I am \nconcerned that if we continue to appropriate as we are today, disease \nby disease, we are sending an inaccurate or wrong message to our \npatient groups. Therefore, we come in today with this amendment, to \nhave a comprehensive study of talking, of discussing exactly how these \ndecisions of prioritization, of research, should be made.\n  As a physician and as a researcher, I understand the many, many \ncomplex factors that must be considered in determining the priorities \nfor research and the enormous difficulty that exists in making \ndecisions of heart disease versus lung disease versus renal disease \nversus pancreatic disease versus Parkinson's disease. Indeed, each of \nus in this Chamber, if you came and asked us, would have different \npriorities based on our own personal circumstances, who we know who has \ncome to see us, who in our family has suffered from a particular \ndisease, and then we are asked to turn around and vote on particular \npieces of legislation to be supported by the available research \ndollars.\n  My fellow members of the Senate Labor Committee and I have discussed \nthe issue of the priority-setting process within the NIH in two \nhearings, one on May 1 and the other on July 24. In those hearings we \nengaged the various committee members in the dialog about the process \nat the National Institutes of Health regarding funding allocation \ndecisions and what should be the appropriate congressional role in \ndirecting Federal biomedical research dollars. Our committee members \nhave expressed concern, as again so well articulated by the Senator \nfrom Indiana, that Congress should take caution in micromanaging \nbiomedical research by establishing legislative mandates for specific \nareas of research without a thorough comparative review of other \ndiseases, of other interests.\n  We have to be honest with ourselves that there is genuine \ndisagreement among various constituencies about how NIH funds should be \ndistributed among the various institutes and agencies at the NIH. \nIndeed, there has been much discussion over the need for increased \nParkinson's research, and I recognize that disputes have taken place \nregarding over what the exact amount of research dollars currently \nspent on Parkinson's disease should be.\n  As legislators, we have a responsibility, an obligation to the \nAmerican people to assess the overall strategy, the overall system, the \noverall process of prioritizing our research dollars. We must do that \nto ensure the public trust in the decisionmaking process as the NIH \naddresses the health needs of the Nation.\n  However, we must ensure that we are funding the best scientific \nopportunities through the appropriate process. I believe we all have \nthe same goal, to use our resources in the very best way possible to \nreduce the burden of illness and human suffering. Our challenge is to \nfigure out the system, the process, the path for best achieving that \ngoal. I believe the best way to answer these questions is to ensure \nthat the process at the NIH is working, that the public has a vote in \nthat process.\n  The amendment we are offering today supports a study to be undertaken \nby the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Science to \nconduct a comprehensive independent study of the policies and the \nprocesses used by the NIH to determine how they allocate funds for \nbiomedical research. The study will look at those factors or criteria \nthat are used to determine funding allocations for disease research, \nthe process by which these research funding decisions are made, the \nmechanisms for public input into the priority-setting process, to make \nsure we hear from the public, and lastly, the impact of the statutory \ndirectives on research funding decisions.\n  The report of the study will set forth the findings and the \nrecommendations and the conclusions of the Institute of Medicine for \nimprovements in this process, and the Institute of Medicine will submit \nthe report to both the Senate and the House authorizing committee and \nAppropriations Committees within 6 months.\n  I believe this is the best way to address this challenge of \nprioritizing research. It is my goal that we ensure that the process \nand the policies at the NIH appropriately address funding allocation \nand research decisions. The scientific community is equipped to help \nset the Nation's research priorities.\n  In conclusion, I again want to state my preference on the underlying \namendment would have been to work with my colleagues in the Senate \nwithin the overall NIH reauthorization process to resolve the various \nissues rather than legislating on the appropriations bill today. \nHowever, I do support the underlying bill to support the increase in \nParkinson's research, and I urge my colleagues to support our amendment \nto initiate this comprehensive independent study of NIH policies and \nprocesses for making funding decisions in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I speak in favor of the Coats amendment and I urge its \nadoption. I do have problems with the underlying amendment. On the \nother hand, I recognize that the large majority of Members desire to \ntell NIH what they should be doing with respect to Parkinson's disease. \nI also recognize it is a serious problem for those that have \nParkinson's disease, and many of my friends across the country do so.\n  I think the Coats amendment is an important addition to let NIH know \nthat they have to at least be more forthcoming with respect to the \nprocesses they use in determining how they should expend the money in \nresearch. I, therefore, commend Senator Coats for bringing this to our \nattention, and as a way to prevent the need for amendments such as the \nunderlying amendment as we move toward the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Parliamentary inquiry. What is the status of the pending \nissue before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the Coats amendment \nnumbered 1075.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Further inquiry, Madam President. Has the amendment \noffered by Senator McCain and Senator Wellstone been set aside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has been set aside.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, the amendment offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from Indiana is acceptable to this side of the \naisle. It calls for a study which I think is well-founded, and we are \nprepared to accept it.\n  I commend my colleague from Indiana for offering the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment \nnumbered 1075, offered by the Senator from Indiana.\n  The amendment (No. 1075) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, if we can proceed with sequencing, I \nhave just discussed with the Senator from Indiana a subsequent \namendment which he intends to offer and he is prepared to accept a 20-\nminute time limit, equally divided, so we can proceed to a vote on that \namendment in relatively short order.\n  I believe we will have to get concurrence from my colleague, Senator \nHarkin.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S8717]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I think we will be able to work out a time agreement, 20 \nminutes equally divided, but we have to check on the other side of the \naisle.\n  Why do we not proceed at this time, and then we will work on that \ntime agreement. I suggest my colleague from Indiana proceed with his 10 \nminutes at this time.\n  Mr. COATS. If I could state to the Senator, before we have an \nagreement, why do I not just, while we are working on the agreement, \nwhy do I not begin? I could probably pretty much make my statement, and \nI might not need the full 10 minutes in the agreement. I will be glad \nto yield back. There are a certain amount of things I want to say. \nUntil we hear from the other side----\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think if we might, the Senator from Indiana would go \nahead and make some remarks and at least at the beginning outline what \nhis amendment is about. That will certainly alert offices. If we do not \nhear, in a decent amount of time, that some people are objecting to a \ntime limit, we will go ahead with an agreement.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I think that arrangement is acceptable.\n  Why do we not proceed on that basis, with the Senator from Indiana \nproceeding with his argument, and we will try to solidify that time \nagreement as we hotline it or allow Members to know what we are doing \ngenerally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. The amendment I will offer, and I will hold offering it \nuntil such time as an agreement can be at least reached on the other \nside, this amendment is something that we have debated before. I think \nit is an important debate. I think it does not require that we make a \nlengthy debate because it has been discussed and debated.\n  I want to make sure that each Senator is aware of a certain practice \nand the implications of that practice before they cast their final vote \non the Parkinson's research or any other research that might involve \nthe use of fetal tissue. The amendment says, briefly, notwithstanding \nany other provision of law, none of the amounts subject to the \nprovisions of subsection (e) of the Morris K. Udall Parkinson's \nResearch Act of 1997 may be expended for any research which utilizes \nhuman fetal tissues, cells, or organs obtained from a living or dead \nembryo or dead fetus during or after an induced abortion. The \nsubsection does not apply to human fetal tissues, cells, or organs \nobtained from a spontaneous abortion or an ectopic pregnancy.\n  We just debated, and I believe will vote tonight or tomorrow, and \ncertainly it will pass and I will vote for it, the provision offered by \nthe Senator from Minnesota to increase funding for Parkinson's \nresearch. I was pleased the Senate accepted the amendment I just \noffered to provide a study which will give us guidance in terms of how \nwe can direct research funds in the future.\n  But on the question of Parkinson's research, it is important that we \naddress an issue that a lot of people do not like to talk about but it \nis an issue that I think is relevant and one that is important, and \nthat is that in certain research--and I believe it is very limited \nresearch, and fortunately it is research that is much more limited than \nit was in the past because it has not shown that much promise--the \nimplantation of human fetal tissue has been one of the means by which \nresearchers have attempted to address the symptoms of Parkinson's \ndisease.\n  Now, from a practical standpoint it is important to understand that \nthe amendment here only affects use of fetal tissue, the use of funds \nto provide fetal tissue research for Parkinson's disease. There are a \nnumber of other diseases, diabetes and others, that use fetal tissue \nresearch, and that is a subject for a separate time. This only applies \nto that particular section of the Udall bill and it simply says that \nfunds that we will appropriate cannot be used for fetal tissue \nresearch. It does not affect research in other areas. It does not \naffect indirect research that affects Parkinson's.\n  Frankly, I do not know that this should even be an issue in \nParkinson's, and I cannot speak with scientific authority, but to the \nbest of my knowledge fetal tissue research has held very little and is \ndiminishing in importance in terms of Parkinson's research.\n  The Parkinson's Action Network has issued a statement, and I will \nquote from that statement that says:\n\n       Even those involved with fetal tissue research readily \n     acknowledge that the result of their research will not use \n     human fetal tissues. Current work is intended only to \n     demonstrate the capability. Ultimately, another source of \n     fetal material must be found.\n\n  That is the statement from the Parkinson's Action Network.\n  So we are not even talking about direct use here as a potential cure \nor alleviation of circumstances of Parkinson's. One of the reasons for \nthat is that human tissue has consistently been found to be unsanitary \nor not fit for clinical use.\n  Now, the good news is that there are other sources of tissue that \nhave shown some promise that are not from induced abortions. There are \nxenografts, fetal pig tissue, that at this time and to my understanding \nare believed to be more useful than human tissue.\n  There are human cell lines that are more promising sources of tissue \nthan tissue derived from abortions. Genetically engineered cell \nresearch has shown significant promise. And tissue that is derived from \nmiscarried pregnancies is now being utilized as a substitute for \nutilizing fetal tissue from induced abortions.\n  So I want my colleagues to understand, we are not trying to impede \nsignificant research on Parkinson's from the limited amount of research \nthat does come from fetal tissue. There are alternative means of \nobtaining tissue, whether it is animal tissue, whether it is human cell \nlines, whether genetically engineered, or whether it is actual fetal \ntissue, but fetal tissue obtained from miscarriages, from spontaneous \nabortions, which are miscarriages, but also from ectopic pregnancies.\n  So there are alternatives to obtain the material necessary for this \nresearch.\n  In addition, the research seems to be moving away from fetal tissue \nand even new tissue toward more promising areas of research in \nParkinson's disease. Implanted brain stimulators work for some but \nobviously do not work for all. Surgical pallidotomies, proton therapy, \ngenetic-based therapy--these are all alternatives to the fetal tissue \nresearch.\n  So, therefore, just from a practical standpoint, regardless of how \nyou feel about the ethical question, I think there is a real basis to \navoid the controversy and to avoid the profound ethical questions and \nconcerns that arise from the utilization of human fetal tissue through \ninduced abortions.\n  What are those ethical questions that we ought to be asking \nourselves? Many of us in the Senate--I am included in this--either have \nparents, children, spouses, relatives, friends, or colleagues who have, \nunfortunately, incurred a neurological disease in which fetal tissue \ntransplantation has offered some hope of treatment. So it is not a \nsubject that we ought to lightly dismiss.\n  I just outlined why I think in the area of Parkinson's research that \nit is really not even a major issue any more. But I think we have to \naddress the question of the wrenching dilemma that it ought to pose--\nthat is posed--by the issue of human tissue research. Therefore, I \nthink we ought to be searching for a path that serves both public \nhealth needs and concerns and the questions of moral principle, a path \nthat offers hope for breakthroughs in research, for cures, for \nalleviating symptoms, but a path which also shows ethical insight.\n  Scientific research does not occur in a moral vacuum. I think it has \nto be guided by something that is more than just practically possible \nor feasible research. It has to be guided by some ethical \nconsiderations that I think each of us need to ask ourselves.\n  In this regard, the ethical questions, I believe, are the following:\n  Question No. 1: Will the use of tissue from elective abortions create \nan irreversible economic and an institutional bond between abortion \ncenters and biomedical science?\n  Just think for a minute. If medical research becomes dependent on \nwidespread abortion, a vested interest would clearly be created in a \nsubstantial uninterrupted flow of human fetal\n\n[[Page S8718]]\n\ntissue. Medical science would be dependent on continued legal abortion \non demand. Does that create an ethical dilemma? I would argue that it \ndoes. The reason that it does is that there is no way that we could \nprovide sufficient tissue from spontaneous abortions, miscarriages, or \nectopic pregnancies because we know that if tissue transplants are the \ncure for diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and other neurological \ntrauma, then we are talking about between 34 million and 20 million \nfetuses a year necessary to supply the need for the fetal tissue to \naddress the problem.\n  So just on this basis alone, it seems that we need to look at \nalternative ways to generate fetal tissue without elective abortions--\nto look at cell cultures, use of animal tissue, and other research that \nI have just mentioned. We have an ethical nightmare, a potential \nethical nightmare that we will face if we can't address ourselves to \nalternatives.\n  Another question is: By what right is this fetal tissue obtained? \nCertainly the remains of the fetus in elective abortions are not \ndonated in the traditional sense of the word. The fetus can't give \nconsent. It is instead provided by the very people who have made the \ndecision to end the life of the fetus. Can the person who ends the life \nbe morally permitted to determine the use of the organs in the life \nthat that person just ended?\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the distinguished Senator will yield for a moment.\n  Mr. COATS. I would be happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, we have been checking with various \nSenators to see if we could reach a unanimous-consent agreement, and it \nnow appears that we will not be able to make that determination very \nfast. Senators are waiting to find out what is going to happen with \nrespect to the vote and we had earlier talked about stacked votes at 7. \nIt now appears we cannot have stacked votes. So we will set the vote at \n7 o'clock by agreement with the other side of the aisle on the \nWellstone-McCain, McCain-Wellstone amendment so we will at least \nproceed with that vote at that time, and by 7 we should be in a \nposition to know what we will be able to do about a unanimous-consent \nagreement here and further scheduling.\n  I thank my colleague from Indiana for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator make a request that the vote \noccur at 7 p.m?\n  Mr. COATS. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam Chair, I will not object, but might I inquire, \nthe amendment that we have introduced, Wellstone-McCain, McCain-\nWellstone, this precludes a second-degree amendment, I gather. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry as to whether it \nprecludes a second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The present agreement would not preclude a \nsecond-degree amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent that this vote at \n7 preclude a second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I agree with that modification, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I regret that we were not able to obtain \nan agreement. I will finish my statement very shortly here and then \noffer the amendment. I certainly would agree to set it aside so that \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania can continue with what other business he \nhas. We obviously will have to address this issue in greater detail at \nanother time, either later this evening or tomorrow.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I think it may still be possible to \nhave a time agreement, but we could not get that determination. Rather \nthan await that determination to get back-to-back votes, I decided we \nought to get the vote set at 7 and perhaps we could have a time \nagreement entered into after that. We will decide when to have the \nvote, but perhaps we can have a time agreement. We have a great many \namendments pending, and to the extent we can have limited time \nagreements, we ought to try to do that.\n  I thank my colleague from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Let me return to the question of the ethical dilemma that \nis posed with utilization of fetal tissue in research. There is a broad \nethical question that affects all neurological research or any research \nthat utilizes human fetal tissue. I have tried to raise some of the \nquestions that I think ought to give all of us pause before we sign off \non the use of human fetal tissue in medical research.\n  Does it create an irreversible economic and institutional bond been \nabortion centers and biomedical science? That is a legitimate question. \nBecause if the cure or alleviation of symptoms for neurological \ndiseases, diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and diabetes \nand other neurological trauma, is dependent on utilization of human \nfetal tissue, then we are talking about the need to supply fetal tissue \npatches or pieces from up to 20 million abortions, induced abortions a \nyear. That poses a profound ethical question.\n  Second, the question is, by what right will we obtain this fetal \ntissue? We obtain it with the consent of the very person who has made \nthe decision to end the life of the fetus from which the fetal tissue \nwill be derived. So there is no such thing as consent of the human \nspecies, the human being, the human person whose life is ended to \nprovide the fetal tissue in the name of medical science.\n  And is it really possible to separate the practice of abortion from \nits use in biomedical research? Are researchers merely using the \nresults of abortion, or are they dictating its practice?\n  There are real concerns about how fetal tissue is derived, how it is \nprocured. A report issued by the University of Minnesota Center for \nBioethics has stated that in Sweden, ``Doctors say they have obtained \nbrain tissues with a forceps before the fetus was suctioned out of the \nmother. That raises the question of whether the fetus was killed by the \nharvesting of brain tissue or by abortion.''\n  Janice Raymond, professor of women's studies and medical ethics at \nthe University of Massachusetts, has testified that doctors are already \naltering the methods of abortion in order to get the tissue that they \ndesire, and I quote from her.\n\n       Doctors who are eager to get good tissue samples must put \n     women at additional risk of complication by altering the \n     methods of performing abortions and by extending the time it \n     takes to perform the conventional abortion procedure.\n\n  Dorie Vawter of the Center for Bioethics at the University of \nMinnesota has reaffirmed this observation, noting that some clinics \ncurrently alter abortion methods for tissue harvesting--slowing down \nthe abortion procedure, reducing the pressure of the suction machine, \nand increasing the size of dilation instruments, all practices which \nplace women at additional risk.\n  And so in the harvesting of human tissue, the human tissue has to be \nat a certain condition. I talked a few moments ago about how much of \nthis tissue is unfit for effective use in Parkinson's research or other \nneurological research. And now we have testimony of people who are \naltering the procedures of obtaining the human fetal tissue so that the \nhuman fetal tissue is in a better condition for this research. But in \ndoing so they place the health of the woman who is carrying the child, \nfrom whom the fetal tissue is derived, at greater health risk.\n  And then I think we have to ask probably the most difficult of \nquestions, and that is, are we encouraging abortion by covering it with \na veneer of compassion?\n  Dr. Kathleen Nolan, formerly of the Hastings Center, writes,\n\n       Lifesaving cures resulting from the use of cadaveric \n     material might make abortion, and fetal death, seem less \n     tragic. Enhancing abortion's image could thus be expected to \n     undermine efforts to make it as little needed and little done \n     procedure as possible.\n\n  This is a very real concern because often people come up to me and \nsay: Why do you offer amendments? Why do you think that utilization of \nfetal tissue should be restricted to noninduced abortions, because it \ndoes so much good, it holds so much potential.\n  Look at the ethical question involved. Is taking a life, is killing a\n\n[[Page S8719]]\n\nfetus in order to obtain material that is useful in providing research \nwhich offers promising health benefits to individuals, is that not one \nof the most profound ethical and moral questions that we have to face?\n  And so I think when we look at a question like this, we clearly have \nto understand, as Stephen Post said,\n\n       Ultimately, it is the specter of a society whose medical \n     institutions are inextricably bound up with elective abortion \n     and whose people come to believe that for their own health \n     they have every right to feed off the unborn, that gives \n     pause.\n\n  Arthur Caplan of the University of Minnesota expresses these concerns \nin another way.\n\n       This is the ultimate issue of generational justice. You're \n     not just asking for the pocketbooks of the young--you're \n     asking for their body parts.\n\n  Now, fortunately, Madam President, we have alternatives available to \nus. I have listed those alternatives. In the case of Parkinson's, and \nthat is the issue we are facing here--we will address the other issue \nat another time--but in the case of Parkinson's research, we are \nlearning that fetal tissue research is of diminishing importance and of \ndiminishing effectiveness.\n  We are learning that there are more viable alternatives that hold far \ngreater benefit and hope for breakthroughs in treating Parkinson's than \nfetal tissue. And so while I think it is appropriate that we are \nfocusing on increasing funds for research in Parkinson's, I believe it \nis also appropriate that we place this most limited of restrictions on \nthis research, both for practical reasons because it offers very little \nhope of any research breakthroughs and because this tissue can be \nobtained by other alternatives without taking human life, without \ninducing abortions. Fetal tissue cells from human fetuses can be \nobtained through miscarriages, spontaneous abortions, ectopic \npregnancies, but the other forms of research, the xenografts from \nanimal tissue, which are now being found to be more useful than human \ntissue, human cell lines, genetically engineered cells, and then all \nthe other more promising means of research in Parkinson's, I think \nallow us to say that at least in this area we will not pursue and we do \nnot need to pursue the utilization of human fetal tissue.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1077\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for research that utilizes human \nfetal tissue, cells, or organs that are obtained from a living or dead \n          embryo or fetus during or after an induced abortion)\n\n  Mr. COATS. So with that, Madam President, I send my amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its consideration with the understanding that it may \nbe possible to enter into an agreement that would limit the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment? Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Coats], for himself and Mr. \n     Nickles, proposes an amendment numbered 1077.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . Limitation on Use of Funds.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provisions of law, none of the amounts subject to the \n     provision of subsection (e) of the ``Morris K. Udall \n     Parkinson's Research Act of 1997'' may be expended for any \n     research that utilizes human fetal tissue, cells, or organs \n     that are obtained from a living or dead embryo or fetus \n     during or after an induced abortion. This subsection does not \n     apply to human fetal tissue, cells, or organs that are \n     obtained from a spontaneous abortion or an ectopic pregnancy.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator withhold.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I withdraw that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Susan \nHammersten, a fellow in my office, be granted the privilege of the \nfloor during the pending Labor, HHS appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I strongly support the amendment that \nSenator McCain and Senator Wellstone have offered. More research is \nclearly needed if we are to conquer this debilitating disease that \nafflicts more than a million Americans.\n  I strongly disagree, however, that this is an appropriate place to \nrevisit the issue of fetal tissue research, and I urge the Senate to \ndefeat the Coats amendment.\n  The earlier ban on fetal research was lifted 4 years ago, and that \naction was deeply justified. The ban was lifted by the administration \nand Congress after careful consideration and exhaustive debate.\n  Research involving fetal tissue holds the potential to provide \ntremendous advances in treatments and cures for a long list of \ndebilitating conditions such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's \ndisease, Huntington's disease, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, \nblindness, leukemia, hemophilia, sickle cell anemia, spinal cord \ninjuries, deficiencies of the immune system, birth defects, and certain \nconditions causing intractable pain. The list goes on and on.\n  It is no wonder, then, that opposition to a ban on fetal tissue \nresearch is supported by a wide range of organizations dedicated to \nimproving the health of Americans, including the Alzheimer's \nAssociation, the Epilepsy Foundation of America, the Cystic Fibrosis \nFoundation, the Parkinson's Disease Foundation, and the Society for \nPediatric Research.\n  Four years ago, Congress decided that the benefits of this research \nfar outweighed the unsubstantiated fears and concerns that the need for \nfetal tissue would lead to increases in abortions. The vote in the \nSenate to lift the ban was a resounding 93 to 4.\n  The bill enacted in 1993 established rigorous standards to safeguard \nagainst any possibility that fetal tissue research would influence \nindividual decisions about abortion. Those safeguards are in place and \nthey are working--and working well.\n  A 1997 GAO study of the safeguards reports that ``the act's \ndocumentation requirements were met'' and that ``there have been no \nreported violations in the acquisition of human fetal tissue for use in \ntransplantation.''\n  The safeguards are working not just in research on Parkinson's \ndisease, but in all research involving fetal tissue. It is irrational \nand inappropriate to revisit this debate by singling out research on \nParkinson's disease for excessive restrictions.\n  Since 1993, the NIH has awarded more than $23 million in grants for \nresearch involving the study, analysis, and use of human fetal tissue. \nThe research that is being carried out today is producing effective \nsolutions that can end the suffering associated with a wide variety of \nillnesses, and it makes no sense, no sense at all, to restrict it.\n  One other point should be made. The research being conducted today \nwith fetal tissue is also providing new techniques such as specialized \ncell lines and genetically engineered cells. In fact, the development \nof these new technologies may well eliminate the need for using fetal \ntissue for research purposes. Ironically, the best way to achieve the \ngoal of the Coats amendment is to defeat the Coats amendment, and I \nurge the Senate to do so.\n  My Republican colleagues have argued that women will decide to have \nan abortions in order to donate tissue for research.\n  These claims are unfounded and uncorroborated. The substantial \nhistory of fetal tissue research--extending back at least 30 years to \nthe development of the polio vaccine--shows no evidence--and no \nevidence has been presented here to the Senate this evening--that the \nresults have encouraged abortion.\n  American women for various personal and entirely unrelated reasons \nchoose to have over 1 million legal abortions each year. These legal \nabortions will continue to be performed in the future, regardless of \nthe extent of fetal tissue research.\n  Congress enacted stringent safeguards to address this claim. No woman \ncan know in advance if the remains from her abortion would or even\n\n[[Page S8720]]\n\ncould be used for research purposes. A woman may not be approached for \nconsent to donate the aborted tissue until after she has made the \ndecision to have an abortion.\n  Safeguards established by the NIH have eliminated any potential \nincentives for abuse. No profit can be derived from providing the \ntissue for research. No family member or friend can benefit from a \nwoman's abortion. A woman may not designate who will be the recipient \nof the tissue.\n  This issue has been reviewed and studied as to the effectiveness of \nthe rules and regulations which have been established. It is \neffectively working and working well. This amendment would have an \nadverse impact in terms of the real potential for making significant \nprogress in areas of research, and it would not be justified in terms \nof providing the kind of restrictions that are included in the Coats \namendment. For that reason, I hope the Coats amendment will not be \naccepted.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, each year a small portion of the Medicare \nbudget is devoted to HCFA's Office of Research and Demonstrations for \nActivities that help guide Medicare policymaking on coverage, financing \nand other operational issues. This year the Appropriations Committee \nhas approved $47 million for this purpose, an increase, of $3 million \nover the last year.\n  The Appropriations Committee has urged the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to use a portion of this research budget to conduct a 2-\nyear demonstration project on coverage of medical nutrition therapy by \nregistered dietitians under Medicare part B. I would like to take this \nopportunity to reiterate my support for this project and to urge the \nSecretary to move expeditiously to initiate this program.\n  Research has shown that medical nutrition therapy is an effective way \nto save health care dollars and improve patient outcomes. By reducing \nand shortening hospital admission, preventing and controlling medical \ncomplications and limiting the need for physician follow-up visits, \nmedical nutrition therapy can lower the cost of treating a variety of \ndiseases. Of particular note are the savings that have been documented \nfor patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease, two ailments \nthat account for a staggering 60 percent of all Medicare expenditures.\n  As we continue efforts to modernize and improve the Medicare Program, \nwe should not overlook medical nutrition therapy as an important way to \nsave program dollars and improve patient treatment options. A \ndemonstration project in this area will help us understand how we can \nbest integrate this important service into any future Medicare \nimprovements.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1057\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, earlier today I voted to support Senator \nHarkin's amendment to fund the Food and Drug Administration's ``Youth \nTobacco Initiative'' regulations. When this amendment was first offered \non July 23, 1997, I voted to table it. I was concerned at that time \nthat the offset was a tax; taxes fall under the jurisdiction of the \nWays and Means and Finance Committees. I am pleased that Senator Harkin \nchanged the offset so that I was able to vote for the amendment today. \nI am a strong supporter of the Food and Drug Administration's efforts \nto reduce the number of young people who begin smoking cigarettes each \nyear. I believe that the money designated for that purpose today is \ncrucial to the success of those efforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

For the information of all Senators, I regret that the \ncloture motion is necessary at this time. I understand all of the \ninterested parties were in agreement just prior to the recess. In fact, \nI stayed very close to the members of the committee that reported this \nlegislation and to those who have continued to work to try to work out \nremaining disagreements, including Senator Jeffords, Senator Mack, \nSenator Frist, others on this side of the aisle, as well as Senator \nDodd and Senator Mikulski.\n  This is truly a bipartisan issue and one we certainly should take up \nand finish before we go out at the end of this year.\n  When you talk about quality of life for Americans, certainly having a \nreformed Food and Drug Administration would be in their interest. Too \nmany procedures, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices are delayed, hung \nup by bureaucracy. What we need is an expedited process, the reforms \nthat are necessary to make that happen, and safe procedures for the \nAmerican people.\n  I hope we can get this done. The only objection I know of was one \nthat has been lodged by Senator Kennedy. We thought we had the \nagreement all worked out the last week we were in session. At the last \nminute, there seemed to be some further objection. As a matter of fact, \nI had hoped over the last 2 weeks before we went out the 1st of August \nfor our State work period that we could get this agreed to. Now there \nis apparently some disagreement with regard to cosmetics. I would think \nthis legislation is much more important than some remaining small \ndisagreement in this area.\n  So as a result of filing this cloture motion, a cloture vote will \noccur on Friday, September 5 in the morning unless something is worked \nout in the meantime. I will consult with the Democratic leader and all \nthe Senators involved on both sides of the aisle as to how we can \nproceed. We need to get this done.\n  By the way, this is on the motion to proceed. It looks like we will \nhave a filibuster even on the motion to proceed. I am committed to \nthis. If we have to have a cloture on the motion to proceed, if we have \nto have more than one, if we have to have cloture on the bill itself, \nwhatever is necessary, I feel that we should force this to an action.\n  However, I do ask unanimous consent the mandatory quorum under rule \nXXII be waived at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/03/senate-section/article/S8720-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, on October 25, 1994, Jered Gamache lost \nhis life, and his brother, Andy, was seriously injured on their way \nhome from school when a Yakama tribal police officer, driving at 68 \nmiles per hour, ran through a red light and crashed into their truck. \nJered was 18 and Andy was 16. Despite the loss of Jered's life and the \ninjuries to Andrew, the Gamache family has been totally unable to seek \ndamages against the Yakama tribal government for the actions of its \npolice officer.\n  Now, let us compare this situation, Mr. President, to the case of \nAbner Louima, the Haitian immigrant who was brutalized a few weeks ago \nby New York City police officers. According to the New York Times, in \naddition to the ongoing criminal investigation, Mr. Louima's attorneys \nare planning to file a $465 million civil damage suit against New York \nCity.\n  Now, Mr. President, what makes the case of Jered and Andy Gamache \ndifferent from the case of Abner Louima? The answer is simple: Tribal \nsovereign immunity. Unlike New York City, the Yakama tribal government \ncan claim immunity from any civil lawsuit, including suits involving \npublic safety and bodily harm, in both State and Federal courts. As a \nconsequence, the lawyers retained by the Gamache family have told them \nit is pointless to bring any kind of lawsuit. They have no recourse.\n  New York City does not have sovereign immunity, and thus, of course, \nis subject to a lawsuit in any amount of money on the part of victims \nof malfeasance, on the part of members of its police department.\n  A few weeks ago, up until the present time, the New York Times has \nrun articles and editorials showcasing the Louima case as an example of \npolice brutality and the need for permanent reform. While that case has \nsparked outrage from editorialists in New York and elsewhere, last \nSunday the New York Times vilified my efforts to provide exactly the \nsame avenue for relief to the Gamache family as the New York Times \neloquently advocates for Mr. Louima. The New York Times has decided \nthat while it is unacceptable for New York City to brutalize a person, \nit rejects non-Indians' right to bring similar claims against tribal \npolice agencies in the U.S. courts. So we have 18- and 16-year-old \nvictims who have no recourse.\n  Enormous injustices can be done whenever a technical claim can \nprevent the adjudication of a just claim on the part of an individual \nagainst a government. It is for exactly that reason that the doctrine \nof sovereign immunity was long ago dropped by the Federal Government \nand the State government in cases of this nature.\n  Let us consider another case, Mr. President, the case of Sally \nMatsch. When she was fired from an American Indian casino in Minnesota \nshe felt that she was a victim of age discrimination, so she sued the \nPrairie Island Indian Tribe. The tribe, however, invoked its sovereign \nimmunity against lawsuits in State or Federal courts, and her case was \nheard by an Indian court on the second floor of the casino and was \ndismissed amid the sounds of slot machines by a judge who served at the \npleasure of the tribal council that ran the casino.\n  Seventeen years ago I was attorney general of the State of \nWashington. I brought a lawsuit that asserted the right of the State of \nWashington to tax the sale of cigarettes in Indian smoke shops to non-\nIndians. The Supreme Court of the United States upheld our position \nthat those sales were taxable. For all practical purposes, however, in \nthe 17 years since that time, States have been unable to enforce a \nright that the Supreme Court of the United States said they had because \nthey cannot sue the tribe or the tribal business entities in order to \ncollect those taxes or to enforce their collection. Why? Tribal \nsovereign immunity.\n  Barbara Lindsey, Mr. President, is president of an organization of \nPuget Sound beach property owners in Washington State. In 1989, 16 \nIndian tribes sued those property owners in the State of Washington \nclaiming that ``treaty rights'' gave them the right to enter private \nproperty to remove clams and oysters. A Federal district court in large \nmeasure has accepted that claim, but Barbara Lindsey and the thousands \nof property owners she represents, Mr. President, cannot sue the Indian \ntribes for violations of their property rights, even in cases when \nthose violations are obvious and open. The problem? Tribal sovereign \nimmunity.\n  So, Mr. President, this body will debate next week when it debates \nthe Interior appropriations bill a provision that for a period of 1 \nyear, as a rider on the appropriations bill, requires the waiver of \ntribal sovereign immunity on the part of those tribes--and I believe\n\n[[Page S8722]]\n\nit is all of them--whose governmental entities, whose police forces, \nare being funded by money appropriated by the Congress out of the taxes \ncollected from all of the American people. The proposal does not change \nany substantive laws. It simply says if, in fact, the law has been \nviolated, there should be a remedy in a neutral Federal court--we have \nnot extended it to State courts--but in a neutral Federal court.\n  Is it fair to prevent a family from seeking justice for the wrongful \ndeath of their son? Is it fair that a claim of age discrimination \ncannot be made or decided in a neutral court? Is it fair that a \ndecision of the Supreme Court of the United States on taxes cannot \neffectively be enforced? It is not, Mr. President, and claims that \nsovereignty is somehow undercut by saying that the sovereign is subject \nto the laws is simply not the case.\n  The claim of those who believe we should make no change is a claim \nthat an Indian tribe can act in a totally lawless fashion and not be \nheld responsible in any court of the United States for those lawless \nactions.\n  It can be dressed up in whatever fancy language about sovereignty \nthat one may propose, but it comes right down to that proposition: Is \nit fair that if you are injured by a New York City policeman you can \nsue New York City, but if you are injured by a Yakama tribal police \nofficer, you may not sue its tribe. The doctrine is one that stems from \nthe kings of England. It is an anachronism in today's world. Under \nconstitutional guarantees of due process to every American citizen, \nevery American citizen should be granted the opportunity to bring his \nor her case in a neutral court and get an answer as to whether or not \ncrimes have, in fact, been committed. The only issue that will be \ninvolved in this case is, Should any government be permitted to act in \nan entirely lawless fashion and not be called to account for its acts? \nThe answer to that question is ``no''. We should not be involved in \nthat kind of action, and the only body with constitutional authority to \nmake that decision across this United States is the Congress of the \nUnited States. The buck stops here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/03/senate-section/article/S8721-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SUBMITTING CHANGES TO THE BUDGET RESOLUTION DISCRETIONARY SPENDING \nLIMITS, APPROPRIATE BUDGETARY AGGREGATES, AND APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE \n                               ALLOCATION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I rise to express my sincere interest in \nestablishing a Job Corps campus within my home State of Delaware. \nToday, the Senate considers legislation increasing our commitment to \nthe Job Corps program--a program to educate and provide job training to \nyouth at high risk of falling into government dependent or criminal \nlifestyles. Most of the young people who benefit from the Job Corps' \nservices live at residential centers in their home States. In some \ncases, students enrolled in Job Corps can even commute from their \nhomes. Currently, Delaware's young people do not have either of these \noptions available to them. This situation potentially limits the number \nof my young constituents able to take advantage of the Job Corps, \ncutting off a path to self-reliance and a brighter future for many.\n  My office has worked in concert with a host of Delaware's other \nelected and appointed officials on this issue. It is my hope that a \nsmall portion of the funding this legislation dedicates to this program \ncan be used to begin establishment of a Delaware Job Corps facility. I \napplaud Senators Stevens and Specter for including an acknowledgement \nof our efforts to bring a Job Corps campus to Delaware in S. 1061's \naccompanying committee report. I look forward to working with the \nadministration on this important matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/03/senate-section/article/S8722-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8722-S8723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

RICHARD LESHER\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to pay a word of tribute to Dr. \nRichard Lesher, outgoing president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  Mr. President, it has been my pleasure to know and work with Dick \nLesher since I was a freshman Member of the Senate. We have served in \nthe army of free enterprise in many important legislative battles. Dick \nwas a dedicated fighter for small businesses.\n  Dick can also be justifiably proud of the growth and success of the \nU.S. Chamber over the last 22 years. During his tenure as president, \nthe Chamber has grown to 215,000 strong.\n  The Chamber has also expanded its information services to include \ntelevision. ``First Business'' is carried on 42 local stations, the USA \nLatin American channel, and USIA's WorldNet. ``It's Your Business'' is \nseen on USA Cable Network and 140 stations around the country.\n  Dick Lesher also took very seriously the Chamber's responsibility to \nhelp educate the next generation of business leaders and created the \nCenter for Workforce Preparation.\n  These are just a few of Dick Lesher's many accomplishments as \npresident of the flagship business organization in our country.\n  But, Dick is a man we can appreciate as much for who he is as for \nwhat he did. I have always known Dick Lesher to be straightforward and \nhonest. He never pulled punches. You knew where you stood. And, even if \nDick disagreed on a matter of policy, he admired his opponents' \nconvictions. Such a fair-minded attitude sets the stage for alliances \non other issues. And, I have always believed, having genuine respect \nfor everyone on the playing field is not only good business, it is a \nhallmark of good character.\n  Dick is leaving the Chamber to return to his hometown in \nChambersburg, PA. I wish him all the best in his new home and, \nhopefully, more relaxed lifestyle.\n  But, while he will be leaving the day-to-day battles on labor and tax \npolicy to his successor, I do not believe for a minute that he is \nretiring. I know that he will remain informed and engaged in the myriad \nof issues that affect the health and growth prospects of American \nbusiness. And, I look forward to his continued counsel and insights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/03/senate-section/article/S8723-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting treaties \nand sundry nominations which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/03/senate-section/article/S8723-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MEASURES REFERRED\n\n  The following bill, previously received from the House of \nRepresentatives for the concurrence of the Senate, was read the first \nand second times by unanimous consent and referred as indicated:\n\n       H.R. 765.

A bill to repeal the provision in the Taxpayer Relief Act of \n1997 relating to the termination of certain exceptions from rules \nrelating to exempt organizations which provide commercial-type \ninsurance; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n   LEGISLATION REPEALING CERTAIN PROVISION OF THE TAXPAYER RELIEF ACT\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would repeal an irrational provision of the Taxpayer Relief Act of \n1997. I refer to section 1042 of that act, which took away the tax \nexempt status of TIAA-CREF, the Teacher's Insurance Annuity Association \nCollege Retirement Equities Fund. The legislation I am introducing \ntoday, with Senators D'Amato\n\n[[Page S8724]]\n\nand Graham of Florida as original cosponsors, would simply strike \nsection 1042 and restore the tax exemption that TIAA-CREF has been \nafforded since its establishment by Andrew Carnegie in 1918. Repeal of \nsection 1042 would also serve to restore the tax exemption for Mutual \nof America, which has served as a pension administrator for social \nwelfare organizations for over 50 years and was similarly tax-exempt \nuntil August 5, 1997, when the President signed the tax bill.\n  TIAA-CREF is a 2-million member retirement system that serves 6,100 \nAmerican colleges, universities, teaching hospitals, museums, \nlibraries, and other nonprofit educational and research institutions. \nTIAA was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1937 \nto ``forward the cause of education and promote the welfare of the \nteaching profession.'' Let me repeat--to ``forward the cause of \neducation and promote the welfare of the teaching profession.'' The law \nfurther states that the purpose of TIAA--this is the New York Statute--\nis ``to aid and strengthen non-proprietary and non-profit-making \ncolleges, universities, and other institutions engaged primarily in \nresearch.'' And it has done just that, in an exemplary manner. It has \nlong been recognized as a model of such programs.\n  Mr. President, by charter and New York law, TIAA-CREF's pension \nassets are exclusively and irrevocably dedicated to providing \nretirement benefits to covered employees. Its funds are essentially \nequivalent to a multiple employer pension trust for colleges and \nuniversities. Like other pension trusts, TIAA-CREF should not be taxed.\n  As a somewhat unanticipated result of TIAA-CREF's creation, it \nbrought to American higher education portability of pensions. You did \nnot have to start out in one institution and after a certain point stay \nthere the rest of your life because you had to have some retirement \nbenefit. This is of great value to our educational system for the \nsimple reason that it enables a young person at, say, a 2-year college \nor a local college, who shows great promise, does good work, to end up \nat Chicago or Stanford or Duke, because they can move. This is part of \nthe agility of American higher education. There is no reason to tax \nthis. Earlier in the summer, the Finance Committee had said don't tax \nit, and the full Senate agreed. But somehow or other, the conference \nagreement provided otherwise. This was a mistake, and it wants to be \ncorrected.\n  The repeal of TIAA-CREF's 79-year-old tax exemption will cost the \naverage retiree who receives a $12,000 annual pension about $600 in \nincome, unless we act. Librarians are not highly paid. A $12,000 \npension would be quite normal. A $600 reduction would be 5 percent \nright away. Future retirees currently accumulating benefits are likely \nto face reductions of 10 to 15 percent.\n  Why make the lives of librarians and assistant professors and \nteachers in community colleges harder? We have an opportunity to undo \nthis before the law takes effect in 1998. Why don't we? The Finance \nCommittee said no to it. During the conference deliberations on the tax \nbill, nearly half the Members of the Senate, and dozens of Members of \nthe House, signed letters asking the conferees to stand against \nrepealing this tax exemption.\n  Now it is September. Members of Congress have had a month-long \nopportunity to visit with and hear from the academic community. I am \nhopeful we can act on this legislation and restore TIAA-CREF and Mutual \nof America to their appropriate status as tax-exempt organizations \nbefore Congress adjourns for the year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1142\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1.

A bill to prohibit commercial air tours over the Rocky \nMountain National Park; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am here today to introduce legislation \nbanning commercial tour overflights at Rocky Mountain National Park.\n  Tour overflight disturbances are a growing problem at a number of \nparks. This is an issue that other Members of Congress have addressed \nin the past, and it will continue to be contentious as long as the \nnatural calm treasured by park visitors is threatened.\n  I commend the Members of Congress who have been involved in creating \nlegislation to control national park overflights in general or in a \nparticular park. Details of problems are park specific, which is why I \nam addressing the issue of overflights at Rocky Mountain National Park \nin Colorado. I hope that introduction of this legislation also serves \nto help Congress and the administration stay focused on creating a \npolicy to address tour overflights at all national parks.\n  The National Park Service is directed by law to protect the natural \nquiet in our National Parks. The 1916 National Park Service Organic Act \nstates that the Park Service shall conserve scenery and wildlife and \nleave the areas unimpaired for future generations. Two other public \nlaws explicitly state the need to preserve national parks in their \nnatural state, most recently the National Parks Overflights Act of 1987 \nthat notes the adverse impact that overflights have on the natural \nquiet and experience. The law also insists that parks should be \nessentially free from aircraft sound intrusions. In 1996, President \nClinton announced his commitment to the peace of our national parks by \nordering that agencies protect them against noise intrusions from park \noverflights.\n  Furthermore, surveys have indicated that more than 90 percent of park \nvisitors feel that tranquility is very important, but it is not only \nthe quiet atmosphere that overflights threaten; overflights also have \nthe potential to adversely impact wildlife and other natural resources.\n  In particular, I am concerned about proposals for helicopter \nsightseeing at Rocky Mountain National Park that could seriously \ndetract from the enjoyment of other park visitors and also could have a \nnegative impact on the resources and values of the park itself. I value \nthe wildlife and solitude at Rocky Mountain National Park, and I \nunderstand fully the concern that commercial tour overflights will \nimpair visitor enjoyment.\n  Rocky Mountain National Park is a relatively small park in the \nRockies, about 70 miles from Denver. The park receives nearly 3 million \nvisitors each year, almost as many as Yellowstone National Park, which \nis eight times its size. The park is easily accessible, yet continues \nto provide quiet, solitude, and remoteness to visitors, especially in \nthe back country.\n  Several problems are specific to this mountainous park. The elevation \nof the Park does not allow a large minimum altitude, therefore, \naccording to the National Park Service, natural quiet is unlikely if \noverflights are permitted at all. In addition, the terrain, consisting \nof many 13,000 foot peaks and narrow valleys, coupled with \nunpredictable weather, presents serious safety concerns. Also, the \nunique terrain of Rocky Mountain National Park would cause air traffic \nto cumulate over the popular, lower portions of the park as pilots are \nforced to navigate around the dangerous peaks and high winds.\n  Not only would the overflights be concentrated directly over the most \npopular portions of the park, but more powerful, and louder, \nhelicopters must be used to achieve the necessary lift at a high \naltitude.\n  In August the members of the Clinton administration's appointed task \nforce on commercial tour overflights toured Rocky Mountain National \nPark. One of the participants, a spokesman for the National Air \nTransportation Association observed the altitude of the park and \nextreme weather conditions and stated, ``I don't know that there's \nanything here that being in a helicopter would make that much\n\n[[Page S8725]]\n\nmore interesting than what can be seen from the road.''\n  These distinctive qualities lead to the conclusion that the best \nsolution to overflight disturbance is a ban on commercial tour flights \nat Rocky Mountain National Park. It is important for me to affirm that \nthis legislation would only ban commercial tour overflights. It is not \nintended to have any adverse effect on emergency, military and \nadministrative flights or on commercial high-level airlines or private \nplanes.\n  A commercial tour overflight ban has widespread support throughout my \nState. State and local officials in areas adjacent to the park, \nincluding Larimer County, Grand County, and the city of Estes Park have \nindicated their concerns with flights over the park, and they support a \nban. In the last session of Congress the entire Colorado delegation \nwent on record in support of an overflight ban. The Governor of \nColorado has also expressed a fear shared by many that such \ndisturbances could cause a loss of tourism.\n  Rocky Mountain National Park has been fortunate enough to be free \nfrom overflights to this point, partially because local towns have \ndiscouraged companies that might provide such services. In addition, \nthere are no existing private property rights that are infringed upon \nby the implementation of a permanent commercial tour overflight ban.\n  At the beginning of this year the FAA issued a temporary ban on \nsightseeing flights over Rocky Mountain National Park. However, I \nremain concerned as we await final ruling by the FAA on park \noverflights and consider the possibility that such low-flying aircraft \ncould be permitted in the park.\n  In 1995, one of our top Denver newspapers editorialized that the FAA \nshould make Rocky Mountain National Park off-limits to low-flying \naircraft use, the sooner the better. Now, 2 years later, it is time to \ntake action on imposing a permanent ban on scenic overflights.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself and Mr. D'Amato):\n  S. 1144. A bill disapproving the cancellation transmitted by the \nPresident on August 11, 1997, regarding Public Law 105-33; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                        DISAPPROVAL LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on this the first full day of Senate \nbusiness since our adjournment for the August recess, I come to the \nfloor with my colleague and friend from New York, Senator D'Amato, to \naddress an issue of importance to New York, and of surpassing \nsignificance to our constitutional form of government. On August 11, \nfor the first time in our history, President Clinton exercised his new \nauthority under the Line Item Veto Act. In doing so he repealed, a \nprovision of Federal law intended to relieve New York of up to $2.6 \nbillion in disputed Medicaid claims. The provision had been included at \nSenator D'Amato's behest, and with my full support, in the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997, one of the two major reconciliation bills signed \ninto law on August 5 in a ceremony at the White House.\n  Senator D'Amato and I rise today to state for the record our firm \nopposition to the President's repeal of the New York Medicaid \nprovision, and to introduce a ``disapproval bill'' to reverse the \nPresident's action. I will also speak to the underlying question of the \nconstitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act.\n  Each year, for 21 years now, I have issued a report on the balance of \npayments, as we put it, between New York State and the Federal \nGovernment. The twenty-first edition, now prepared in collaboration \nwith the Taubman Center on State and Local Government at the John F. \nKennedy School of Government will be published toward the end of this \nmonth. Let me report for purposes of this comment, however, that it \nwill show that New York has the third highest poverty rate in the \nNation and the fourth highest Cost of Living Index--as computed by the \nFriar-Leonard State Cost of Living Index. This has resulted in an \nextraordinarily high level of Medicaid costs for the State and \nespecially for the city of New York.\n  This level of payments might have been sustainable with a more \nequitable Federal-State matching formula. If, for example, the Federal \nGovernment paid 73 percent as it does in Arkansas. But we were capped \nat 50 percent. As my colleague from New York knows, the current \nFederal-State Medicaid matching formula was taken directly from the \nHill-Burton Hospital Survey and Construction Act of 1946, under which \nthe matching rate is based on the square of the ratio of State per \ncapita income and national per capita income. In a commencement address \nat Kingsborough Community College in New York 20 years ago, I \nsuggested, only half jokingly, why not square root? If you are going to \nhave algebra in Federal statutes, why not turn it our way? Given New \nYork's 50-percent match rate, however, something had to be done.\n  And so, like a number of other States, New York began to impose \nprovider taxes on hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies, and \nso forth, as a way of generating revenues to finance specific health \ncare programs. As part of the costs incurred by providers, these taxes \nwere reimbursable, withal at the 50-percent level, by the Federal \nGovernment. The taxes all went into additional health care, and no one \ncould claim fraud. However, in recent years some States got too \ncreative in imposing and seeking Federal matching funds for their \nprovider taxes, in some instances using the Federal money for purposes \nunrelated to health care. This led Congress in 1991 to enact \nlegislation to prevent States from gaming the system. Since New York \nwas confident its taxes were in compliance with the 1991 law, the State \ncontinued its practice, all the while seeking a waiver from the Federal \nhealth care bureaucracy.\n  And so, when the time came to draft the 1997 reconciliation bill, \nSenator D'Amato, a member of the Committee on Finance, asked that a \nprovision be included that would simply preclude any Federal claims \nregarding the use of these taxes from 1991 to 1996. I fully supported \nthis measure. The issue had been debated during our markup in the \nFinance Committee, and the provision was included in the final bill, \nwhich was passed by a large 73 to 27 majority. The conference report \nwas adopted by an even larger majority, 85 to 15.\n  As ranking member of the committee, I was on this floor with our \nesteemed chairman, Senator Roth, for several days and in meetings with \nHouse conferees and administration officials for an eternity, or so it \nseemed. Morning, noon, night; mostly night. Let the Record reflect that \nat no point in the course of those deliberations did the subject of the \nMedicaid waiver come up. No Member of the House challenged it; no \nrepresentative of the administration said a word to me. In fact, the \nonly administration objection that I know of was buried deep in the 21-\npage letter of administration views sent by OMB Director Raines on July \n7, which said, in pertinent part:\n\n       [T]he Senate bill would deem provider taxes as approved for \n     one State. We have serious concerns about these provisions \n     and would like to work with the Conferees to address the \n     underlying problems.\n\nThis was not the clearest possible statement. What, for example, does \n``deem'' mean? Further, the term ``serious concerns'' is used any \nnumber of times in the administration's views, yet in none of those \nother instances did a line item veto result. ``Serious concerns.'' I \nask my friend from New York, does that sound like a veto threat to him? \nIn 20 years in the Senate, this Senator has heard many veto threats \nmade, but never one like that. Yet this is evidently how we should \nexpect things to work in the era of the line item veto.\n  This leads to my second, larger, point. I am one of those--and I am \nnot alone--who hold that the line-item veto is unconstitutional in that \nit violates the presentment clause of article I, section 7, which \nstates:\n\n       Every bill which shall have passed the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate shall, before it becomes a \n     law, be presented to the President of the United States; if \n     he approve, he shall sign it, but if not, he shall return it.\n\n  When the Line Item Veto Act was first debated in the Senate in the \nspring of 1995, I argued--along with our revered colleague from West \nVirginia, Senator Robert C. Byrd, and others-- that the presentment \nclause means exactly what it says. But I'm afraid not many people were \nlistening.\n\n[[Page S8726]]\n\n  Recall that the line item veto was part of item one in the Contract \nWith America, which was then only a few months old. But we said: \n``Don't do this! It violates the principle of the separation of powers \nas we have understood it since George Washington was President.'' For \nit was President Washington who wrote ``From the nature of the \nConstitution, I must approve all the parts of a bill or reject it in \ntoto.''\n  In lengthy statements here on the floor, Senators Byrd, Levin, \nHatfield, and I--among others--argued as emphatically as we could. We \ncited the relevant case law--INS versus Chadha, Bowsher versus Synar; \nwe quoted prominent constitutional scholars--Laurence H. Tribe, Michael \nJ. Gerhardt. Yet in the end we were in a regrettably small minority. \nThe Line Item Veto Act passed the Senate on March 23, 1995, by a vote \nof 69 to 29. When the conference report came back in March of 1996--a \nfull year later--it passed by a vote of 69-31. Of the 31 Senators \nopposed, four of us felt the principle at stake was so consequential \nthat it demanded immediate scrutiny by the courts. For which the Line \nItem Veto Act had explicitly provided: Section 3 of the act provides \nfor ``expedited review'' of the statute's constitutionality by the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia, with direct appeal to the \nU.S. Supreme Court. The act further stated that ``any Member of \nCongress or any individual adversely affected'' could bring an action \n``on the ground that any provision of this part violates the \nConstitution.''\n  Accordingly, on January 2 of this year, the first business day after \nthe Line Item Veto Act took effect, I joined with Senator Byrd, Senator \nCarl Levin of Michigan, former Senator Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon, and \nRepresentatives Henry A. Waxman of California and David E. Skaggs of \nColorado, as plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality \nof the measure. We were represented on a pro bono basis by a team of \ndistinguished and learned counsel, including Louis R. Cohen; Charles J. \nCooper; Lloyd N. Cutler; Michael Davidson; and Alan B. Morrison. Oral \nargument was heard on March 21 by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of the \nU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. And less than 3 weeks \nlater, on April 10, Judge Jackson held for us and declared the bill \nunconstitutional. He wrote in his opinion:\n\n       . . . the Act effectively permits the President to repeal \n     duly enacted provisions of federal law. This he cannot do. . \n     . . The duty of the President with respect to such laws is to \n     ``take care that [they] be faithfully executed.'' U.S. Const. \n     art. II, sec. 3. Canceling, i.e., repealing, parts of a law \n     cannot be considered its faithful execution.\n\n  On June 26, however, the Supreme Court vacated the district court's \njudgment, holding in a 7-2 decision that as Members of Congress, we did \nnot have ``standing'' to sue, as we could not demonstrate any personal, \nor ``judicially cognizable,'' injury. We do not agree; in our view, the \nmeasure shifts the balance of power between the Congress and President \nin direct contravention of article I, something that can only be done \nby constitutional amendment. But, of course, the Court left it for \nothers to sue.\n  Now we can. As a consequence of the President's decision to use the \nline-item veto on a measure designed to help New York, surely there \nwill now be a lawsuit that will persuade the Supreme Court to strike \ndown the measure as unconstitutional. All manner of New Yorkers \npresumably have standing; they have suffered injury. The Court was \nexplicit that in such a case, the act was open to constitutional \nchallenge. Let the Governor sue. The Comptroller. The Speaker. Mayors. \nHospital administrators. Nurses unions. I shall be honored to join in. \nExpedited judicial review will again be provided pursuant to section 3 \nof the Line Item Veto Act; the action will again begin in the district \ncourt in Washington, with direct appeal to the Supreme Court. This time \nround, I trust the Court will declare the statute unconstitutional. As \nJustice John Paul Stevens wrote in his dissent to the Court's June 26 \ndecision:\n\n       If the [Act] were valid, it would deny every Senator and \n     every Representative any opportunity to vote for or against \n     the truncated measure that survives the exercise of the \n     President's cancellation authority. Because the opportunity \n     to cast such votes is a right guaranteed by the text of the \n     Constitution, I think it clear that the persons who are \n     deprived of that right by the Act have standing to challenge \n     its constitutionality. . . [T]he same reason that the \n     respondents have standing provides a sufficient basis for \n     concluding that the statute is unconstitutional.\n\n  Once the constitutional issue is disposed of, and even if it is not, \nand very possibly before it is, I know my colleague from New York will \njoin me in saying that the issue of the equity of the Medicaid matching \nformula must be addressed. It is too extreme an example of \ndiscrimination to go on for another half century. Three years ago, \nPresident Clinton said as much. On a visit to New York City in May \n1994, he spoke at a breakfast of the Association for a Better New York. \nInviting questions, the President was asked by State Comptroller H. \nCarl McCall whether anything would be done to relieve the State of the \n``crushing burden'' imposed by Medicaid. The President replied:\n\n       There's no question that the formula should be changed, and \n     that states like New York with high per capita incomes but \n     huge numbers of poor people are not treated fairly under a \n     formula that only deals with per capita income.\n\nThere was no reference to this in the President's recent veto message \nof the New York provision. Rather, the contrary:\n\n       No other state in the nation would be given this provision, \n     and it is unfair to the rest of our nation's taxpayers to ask \n     them to subsidize it.\n\nThis was not entirely accurate, although there is no reason to suppose \nthe President was aware of this. In the absurdly dense 1,600-page bill \nCongress had sent him, there was a small provision, adopted in the \nFinance Committee, which raises the Medicaid matching level for Alaska \nfrom the bottom rate of 50 percent to the national average of 59.6 \npercent. The Senators from Alaska made the simple case that the cost of \nliving in Alaska is well above the national average. This is reflected \nin higher incomes, which the Medicaid formula wrongly interprets as \ngreater wealth. They asked for nothing more than the national average. \nThe District of Columbia got an increased match rate as well. Hawaii \nasked also, but the bill had been closed by then. Senator D'Amato and I \nsay it is time to open the issue up.\n  The case for legislative remedy is surely overwhelming. And we intend \nto use the new attention that has been drawn to this issue by the \nPresident's veto to press that case at every opportunity.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, may I suggest the absence of a quorum so \nI will have an opportunity to concur with my colleague, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from New York? Let me say, No. 1, that I \ntotally support his presentation as it related to the manner in which \nthis veto took place. It is something that none of us were apprised of \nor aware of; that there had been extended negotiations with his \nadministration during this process. It came as a total surprise. But I \nwould like to take one moment and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I send, for myself and Mr. D'Amato, a \nbill to the desk and ask that it be appropriately referred.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be appropriately referred to the \nappropriate committee.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise this morning, along with Senator \nMoynihan, to introduce legislation to ``disapprove'' President \nClinton's line-item veto that cancels a Medicaid provision in the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 which provides health care to the poorest \nof the poor in New York. Let me say that that is the legislation which \nhas just been sent to the desk. That is legislation to disapprove this \nveto. Let me also say that I must speak out not about the authority of \nthe line-item veto, which I support, but about its use in this \nparticular case.\n\n[[Page S8727]]\n\n  Mr. President, I have to tell you--and I listened intently to Senator \nMoynihan making his presentation with respect to the manner in which \nthe entire budget negotiations and the process was conducted. The fact \nof the matter is that the administration and the President agreed \nduring the budget negotiations to accept the provisions that were \nincluded in this bill.\n  The fact of the matter is, I believe it was June 25 when these \nprovisions were adopted by the full Senate. Mr. President, there was no \nsecret. The administration knew. The administration had ample time all \nduring that process to say ``no'', this is unacceptable.\n  I have to tell you, I am shocked and outraged that the administration \nhas singled out New York for this particular provision by stating that \nthis is an ``item that would have given preferential treatment to only \nNew York.''\n  Mr. President, that is blatantly, patently false. It is a total \nmisstatement.\n  I hope that the President will have an opportunity to examine this \nbecause I believe that his advisers have given him very poor advice.\n  I can't believe, knowing the President's commitment to attempt to \ndeal with the problem of the uninsured, particularly the children--he \nhad full knowledge of the manner and the totality of dealing with the \nshortcomings because we are attempting to reduce the burdens, we are \nattempting to get our Medicaid and Medicare costs under control. In \nthis bill, notwithstanding that the administration claimed and advised \nthe President and his people that this was a special provision just for \nNew York, there are instance after instance, in case after case after \ncase, where other States received similar treatment, as they can and \nshould have in order to push the tremendous cuts --15 percent-plus in \nsome cases. There were going to be 25 percent cuts that hospitals \ndealing with a disproportionate share of this Nation's poor would \notherwise have had to make. That is DSH payments.\n  Let's understand what we are talking about. The average person--what \nare you talking about? What is this DSH? How do you take care, in large \nmetropolitan areas in the North, the South, the East, and the West of \nour country, of those who do not have medical insurance? What do those \nhospitals do? Close their doors? Go bankrupt? Who is to pay for them?\n  So there was a conscious effort by the committee to see to it that \nStates with these disproportionate problems in terms of dealing with \nthe uninsured, with those who had just Medicaid and Medicaid alone, who \ncannot sustain the operations of our medical centers, to give relief. \nIndeed, Mr. President, I believe if one were to add up the totality of \nthe money provided, it would be in the area of $700 to $800 million \nthat was given in relief to pushing the cuts that these States and \nthese institutions would otherwise absorb.\n  Let me give you just some of the States. Alabama, Connecticut, \nFlorida, Louisiana, Maine, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, South \nCarolina, Texas, Vermont.\n  Mr. President, to suggest that New York was the only one, indeed, New \nYork could have been included. And if draftsmanship had been used, if \nwe had known that we would have been singled out in this manner, I tell \nyou we could have included the provision within the budget in such a \nway that all of these States including New York would have had to be \nvetoed then.\n  Are we saying it is the poor of New York who should be disadvantaged? \nWe don't begrudge help to those States that are needing it. This is not \nan attempt to game the system. And let me talk about that.\n  There came a point in time when the Federal Government became aware \nthat some States were gaming the system. In other words, certain States \nwere guilty of scamming. That was wrong, and both Senator Moynihan and \nI provided the support, and it passed unanimously, that we put a stop \nto that. But let's understand that is not what New York was doing.\n  For example, for those who were gaming the system, a provider would \npay a $5,000 provider tax to the State. The State would then draw a \nmatching $5,000 from the Federal Government and then reimburse the \nprovider. It was a scam. It was simply a bookkeeping entry to get the \nFederal Government to pick up an expense that the State never really \nincurred and the provider did not incur.\n  That is wrong. That is not our system. New York was not then and is \nnot now involved in that scam. This wasn't an attempt to bill poor \npeople for services and build roads or not use those moneys. That has \nnever been the allegation. And, indeed, as a matter of fact, New York \nhas had a long history of requiring insurers to pay assessments on \nhospital services. Thereby, that assessment over and above that \nparticular service would go to help the poorest of the poor. And, \nindeed, we now have a program by utilizing these provider taxes that \nprovides insurance for those families who could not purchase it for \ntheir youngsters. We provide up to 140,000 youngsters, children up to \nthe age of 19, with insurance. It comes from this provider tax.\n  Let me say that these assessments provide $1.1 billion a year in \ngross provider tax collections and are used for dealing with uninsured \nchildren, the poorest of the poor. The Balanced Budget Act contained \nlanguage which specifically determined that New York provider taxes \nmeet the legitimate requirements. That is what we did.\n  Now, Mr. President, we have attempted for more than 2 years to get a \nresolve of this matter from HCFA. Nothing. Nothing. No response. Delay, \ndelay, delay, delay. You can't do that to a community. You are not \ndoing it just to a State government. That impacts on the lives of \nhundreds and hundreds of thousands of people. Is that fair?\n  And so, Mr. President, I find it incomprehensible and absolutely a \ntragedy that the President would have received this kind of advice. \nPeople, I believe, did not tell the President the entire story. I \ncannot believe that he really would want to veto a provision, the \ndollars of which are used to take care of the truly needy. I hope that \nbetween the time this legislation that we have introduced comes to a \nvote, we can get a resolve of this matter, not to deal with it in a \nconfrontational, adversarial way, but in a way that makes sense, in a \nway that is fair, that is fair intellectually, that is fair morally, \nthat is fair ethically.\n  And I want to make it clear that I concede nothing. If we have to \nfight, why then we will, because this is a battle not about a State \nbeing treated fairly or unfairly but about its people and their needs. \nThis is a battle that says that a State does have a right to raise \nrevenues in a particular manner and to utilize them for the purpose \nwhich I have attempted to outline.\n  I want to commend my colleague, who, as the ranking member of Finance \nand, indeed, the senior member on Budget, was there every moment of the \nnegotiations, and never once were we told this is a special treatment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Never.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Never once. And so for it to be sprung on us --I was out \nof the country--I said, when asked, that I was shocked, truly shocked. \nAgain, I think the President is a big enough person to look at this in \na way, or to say to those in charge at HCFA, come on, let's resolve \nthis. Let's see to it that New York's problem, which is one of seeing \nto the needs of the uninsured--and, by the way, we have plans in \nspeaking to the administration--and Senator Moynihan and I have been \nconferring with the health department people. They believe that this \nprogram can be and will be in the fullness of time--it is a program to \nprovide insurance where families pay a very modest amount, in some \ncases $25 a month, and some none depending upon their income--that it \ncan be expanded to take care of up to 500,000 young people, youngsters, \nchildren who otherwise would not be insured.\n  Mr. President, we are not going to give up the battle. It is a battle \nthat we are committed to winning on behalf of the poor, on behalf of \nthe needy, on behalf of the uninsured, on behalf of the many working \nfamilies that do not have full coverage. And I am proud and privileged \nto join the senior Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan, in an \nattempt to get justice for these children and for those in need.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I just congratulate my colleague and friend for the \ntone of his statement, its tenor. He is not seeking confrontation with \nthe administration. He is seeking insurance for the poorest of poor \nchildren in\n\n[[Page S8728]]\n\nour State. I was able to say earlier that in the annual balance of \npayments study that we have been putting out for 2 years, New York has \nthe third highest poverty rate in the Nation and the fourth highest \ncost of living. These children are at stake.\n  The Senator has made the point, and I congratulate the Senator for \nit, in that mode and making clear because the record is there that this \nissue was never raised prior to the veto. It was a decision made after \nthe bill was signed, I think. I don't know. And I think that some \nreassessment of the process, the procedure might bring change in \njudgment.\n  Again, I thank my friend, and I am telling him how pleased and \nhonored I am to be associated with him in this matter.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMS:\n  S. 1145. A bill to amend the Social Security Act to provide \nsimplified and accurate information on the Social Security trust funds, \nand personal earnings and benefit estimates to eligible individuals; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  THE SOCIAL SECURITY INFORMATION ACT\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nrequire the Social Security Administration to provide key information \nto the American people for retirement planning.\n\n  In that regard, I plan to send my bill to the desk in just a moment.\n  But to explain that, every working American has a significant part of \neach paycheck designated to the Social Security Program, but few know \nhow much they've contributed over their lifetime, the real value of \ntheir Social Security investment, or how much they'll need for a secure \nretirement.\n  As average life-expectancy increases and the oldest baby boomers \napproach retirement, the answers to those three questions become \ncritically important, for there's growing concern over the future of \nSocial Security and how individuals should prepare themselves for \nretirement.\n  Over the next 33 years, the number of retirees and their dependents \nwho are eligible for Social Security benefits will increase by more \nthan 100 percent; from 30 million in 1997 to more than 60 million in \n2030, while the number of workers 20 to 64 years old will increase by \nonly 20 percent.\n  By 2030, the ratio of workers per retiree will be the smallest ever, \nstraining the entire Social Security system to the breaking point. Most \nof these older Americans will rely on Social Security benefits as their \nmajor source of retirement income.\n  For many families, Social Security is the largest and most important \nfinancial investment they'll make, consuming up to one-eighth of their \ntotal lifetime income. Yet, the Federal Government remains \nunaccountable for the dollars working Americans have invested in the \nprogram.\n  Current laws do not require the Social Security Administration, \n[SSA], the agency managing the Social Security trust funds, to send \nclear and complete account statements to individual taxpayers.\n  Therefore, Americans don't receive adequate information about the \nretirement benefits they can expect to receive, the rate of return from \ntheir Social Security investment, or the future financial status of the \nSocial Security trust funds--information, by the way, private \ninvestment agencies are required to provide to their investors.\n  As a result, the vast majority of today's baby boomers won't be \nfinancially secure at retirement.\n  My legislation would help to correct this problem and bring Social \nSecurity closer to meeting the disclosure requirements expected of \nprivate investment firms. This legislation will help ensure that \nworking Americans receive the information they need to plan for a \nsecure retirement.\n  In 1989, Congress passed the personal earnings and benefits estimate \nstatements, it is commonly known as PEBES. That legislation requires \nthe SSA to send to eligible individuals statements on their yearly \nearnings and estimated benefits.\n  A recent study by the General Accounting Office, the accounting arm \nof Congress, suggests that while the PEBES is useful, it is extremely \ndifficult for average Americans to understand and, in fact, could be \nmisleading. Therefore it isn't as effective as it could be or should \nbe.\n  Moreover, the current PEBES statement does not include the \ninformation an individual needs to most effectively plan for \nretirement.\n  My proposal would require Washington to provide key information on \nthe real value, or the yield, of a worker's investment in the Social \nSecurity Program by counting employers' contributions as workers' \nearnings to calculate the rate of return. Washington currently excludes \nthis type of contribution from a worker's earnings statement.\n  The employer's share of Social Security is a labor cost that's \nultimately borne by the employee; it is only fair that it be counted as \na worker's contribution.\n  To ensure that the information is easy to understand, my legislation \nwould also direct the SSA to provide benefit estimates in real rather \nthan current dollars. To show the impact of inflation on Social \nSecurity benefits, consider the case of a typical individual retiring \nin 2043. That American is 25 years old today, retiring in the year \n2043.\n  The current benefit estimate found in PEBES will tell this worker \nthat he or she can expect to receive $98,989--nearly $100,000 annually \nin Social Security benefits. That sounds pretty good, doesn't it? But \nmost workers will never consider the effects of inflation on this \nnumber. They'd never guess that an income of $98,989 in 2043 will \nactually be the equivalent of only $14,180 today because of inflation.\n  If the PEBES includes such misleading information, it is likely that \nmore working Americans will misunderstand and, therefore, overestimate \nthe value of the benefits they will receive from Social Security. Only \nafter it is too late will they find themselves financially unprepared \nfor retirement.\n  Not only would my legislation direct the SSA to include all of the \nmost important information found in PEBES on a single, easy-to-read \nform, but the SSA would also be required to provide the current and \nprojected balance in the Social Security trust funds, and let \nindividuals decide on their future by providing them honest information \ntoday.\n  With this information, Americans will be able to quickly and easily \ndetermine what the PEBES report is about and find the information \nessential to successful retirement planning.\n  Working American need to know up front what they can and cannot \nexpect out of the Social Security system compared against what they are \npaying into it.\n  Giving individuals an honest accounting of that information serves \nthe fundamental objectives of the Social Security Program by enabling \nworkers to judge to what degree they should supplement their \ncontributions with other forms of retirement savings such as pension \nplans and personal savings and investments.\n  While much more needs to be accomplished to preserve and strengthen \nthe Social Security safety net for today and tomorrow, the approach \nI've outlined would be an important first step in that attempt.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT:\n  S. 1146. A bill to amend title 17, United States code, to provide \nlimitations on copyright liability relating to material on-line, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n  the digital copyright clarification and technology education act of \n                                  1997\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I speak today on an issue of great \nimportance to copyright law and to the continued growth of electronic \ncommerce on the Internet. In December 1996, two treaties were adopted \nby the diplomatic conference of the World Intellectual Property \nOrganization [WIPO] to update international copyright law. These \ntreaties would extend international copyright law into the digital \nenvironment, including the Internet. However, these treaties do not \nprovide a comprehensive response to the many copyright issues raised by \nthe flourishing of the Internet and the promise of digital technology. \nWe must endeavor to keep the scales of copyright law balanced, \nproviding important protections to creators of content, while ensuring \ntheir widespread distribution. To begin the discussion I am introducing \ntoday the Digital Copyright Clarification and Technology Education Act \nof 1997.\n  Any discussion of this issue, even in the most simple terms, raises \nmany\n\n[[Page S8729]]\n\nimportant issues. We must foster the growth of the Internet, which \nprovides such great opportunity to our country because it is the most \nparticipatory form of mass communication ever developed. It draws \npeople together from all corners of the globe to share and communicate \non an unprecedented level, and brings all levels of government closer \nto the public. The Internet also holds great promise for education. \nStudents--rural, suburban, and urban--are increasingly able to access a \nwealth of information right at their computer that was previously \nbeyond their reach.\n  In addition, the Internet offers significant commercial \npossibilities. Small businesses can reach out across the globe and \nconquer the distances between them and potential customers. Individuals \ncan view merchandise and make purchases without leaving home. \nHopefully, soon a system will develop to allow individuals to contract \nelectronically with traditional force of law for contracts on paper. \nHowever, this potential will never be realized without a system that \nfairly protects the interests of those who own copyrighted material; \nthose who deliver that material via the Internet; and individual users. \nThe implications here are far-reaching, with impacts that touch \nindividual users, companies, libraries, universities, teachers and \nstudents.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would accomplish several \ngoals. First, the legislation would clarify the extent of liability for \nentities who transfer information via the Internet without control of \nthe content. Second, the bill would provide for a rapid response to \ncopyright infringement with the cooperation of the copyright owner and \nthe on-line service to take down the infringing material, helping to \ncurtail piracy. Third, the Act will provide for the use of digital \ntechnology in education, research, and library archives, including \nupdating the fair use doctrine for electronic media. Fourth, the \nlegislation provides a standard for liability based on individual \nconduct, not a standard that constrains the development of new \ntechnology.\n  We must confirm that the entities who facilitate the operation of the \nglobal information infrastructure not be unfairly liable for literally \nbillions of transmissions that individual users send via the Internet \nor post on the World Wide Web every week. We cannot make the Internet \ntoo costly to operate. Liability for infringement of copyright should \nreflect the degree of control that any party had in the determination \nof the content of the offending message. Those providing the \ninfrastructure that makes the Internet possible should not be held \nliable for the content of messages to which they have no access. Often, \nthe copyright holders will be best situated to make a determination of \nwhether their copyrighted material is being infringed.\n\n  In addition, two very real considerations in the final outcome are \nthe capabilities and limits of current technology. It is not possible \nto monitor every communication on the Internet, not even to look at \nevery homepage on the World Wide Web, even if it were desirable. In \nJanuary 1997, one estimate put the number of Internet hosts at more \nthan 16 million. Each could host multiple homepages, and those \nindividual sites could be composed of multiple individual pages. One \nindividual host, GeoCities, boasts of more than half a million \nhomesteaders, with 5,000 new residents arriving daily. As of May 1997 \nthere were more than 40 million people on the Web, a breathtaking \nincrease from the 1 million in December 1994. To state the facts of the \nexploding traffic growth in a different way, one major infrastructure \nprovider, of which there are many, reports traffic of 250 terabytes a \nmonth--a terabyte is a thousand billion bytes--which translates into \nalmost six billion bytes a minute--for one carrier. More importantly, \nany wholesale reading of messages would constitute the largest full \nscale attack on our individual privacy ever undertaken. We are \nconfident that those delivering the mail do not read our sealed letters \nand we should have that same confidence in our e-mail and other \nelectronic communications. It would be impossible for any carrier to \nreview all of the material; and we cannot create a legal obligation \nthat is technologically impossible to satisfy. Clearly, the potential \nfor copyright infringement is real--as real as the impossibility of \nrequiring a service provider to monitor every communication, including \ne-mail, homepages, and chat rooms.\n  Another important issue is the right of reproduction as specifically \nrelated to ephemeral copying. As a message is sent through cyberspace \ncopies of the message are reproduced, in a sense. This is a reality of \ncomputer technology. For the most part an entire copy never exists \nanywhere, except at the points of distribution and receipt. The \nInternet was designed to send packets, pieces of a message expressed in \ndigital form, a full message is not sent from one point to another. In \nthe process of delivering the message multiple copies of each packet \nare sent so if a path is blocked path or data lost, the end message can \nbe totally reassembled. Additionally, a full copy may be assembled on \nthe recipient's server, where the message would reside until the \nrecipient pulls down the file, or a copy may be made on a user's hard \ndrive during the simple act of reading a document on-line. Obviously, \nto make this sort of copy illegal would be a move that flies in the \nface of the operations of the Internet and would destroy the World Wide \nWeb. We need to make clear the status of these temporary and necessary \ncopies within communications networks.\n  The passage of appropriate copyright legislation goes beyond the \nimplications of liability and technical operations. The outcome of this \ndebate will affect educators and students across the country. One \nimportant aspect for education is to guarantee that computers can be \nused in distance learning, in a way that television and video recorders \nhave been used for years. The copyright laws have long recognized the \nneed to ensure that the copyright laws do not stand in the way of the \nopportunities that the technology promises to provide students in rural \nareas. Unfortunately, the current law reflects the technology that was \ncurrent when it was passed, largely video. We need to update these laws \nto reflect the enormous potential of the digital era. Part of the work \nin this area may include defining the classroom to reflect that in many \ninstances the classroom is no longer a physical space.\n  In addition, the fair use doctrine in the Copyright Act should be \namended to make clear that fair use applies regardless of the manner in \nwhich the material is distributed. A sound fair use doctrine is \ncritical to continued interoperability of various systems, which in \neffect allows the Internet to exist and grow. Fair use encourages \nothers to build freely on the ideas and information in a work while \nguaranteeing the author's right to their original expression. \nCurrently, fair use may be made of a work for teaching, commentary, \nresearch, scholarship, criticism, and even news reporting. We should \nnot tolerate discriminatory treatment based on a means of distribution \nor an alternative technology. Fair use in one medium should be fair use \nin another.\n\n  Finally, we must facilitate the preservation of copyrighted materials \nby libraries, archives, and universities. These institutions should be \nable to preserve their works, many of which represent the cultural \nheritage of the United States, in the best means possible, including \ndigitally. To require that these institutions purchase new copies of \nexisting works, but in digital format, could cost untold billions of \ndollars. Many works could never be made available digitally as they are \nno longer available in a format available for purchase.\n  Mr. President, we have made an effort to provide access to technology \nto all students in the last couple of years. In 1996, Congress \nappropriated $200 million to provide teachers with the training and \nsupport needed for access to technology, and to ensure that effective \nsoftware and on-line resources would be available for use with the \ncurriculum. The fiscal year 1998 budget request from the administration \nfor this program is $425 million, with the House Appropriations \nCommittee approving $460 million. Approving nearly $700 million over 2 \nyears to guarantee that education can be delivered in a digital format, \nwhile impeding or denying delivery of digital material by neglecting \nour copyright law makes no sense. A decision has been made that \nstudents must prepare to operate in an on-line world. We must unlock \nthe teaching\n\n[[Page S8730]]\n\npotential of the Internet and we must now guarantee that the \nappropriate material is made available, so that our students can \nreceive a full education while taking advantage of the tremendous \nstrides made in technology.\n  The Missouri State Librarian recently wrote to me that Missouri's \nstrong distance education programs could flourish or wither, depending \non the outcome of this debate. I suspect this is the case in all States \nwith strong distance learning programs to serve rural areas. These \nprograms allow residents in even the most remote areas to have the same \naccess to education as those who live near schools, colleges, or \nuniversities. These programs cannot operate as effectively without the \nassurance that educators can use materials over computer networks.\n  Equally important, Mr. President, we must begin a process \ninternationally that is structured to balance the rights of copyright \nowners with the needs and technological limitations of those who enable \nthe distribution of the electronic information, and with the rights and \nneeds of individual end users. The current treaties and statements are \nnot sufficient, and include some language that could create legal \nuncertainty. The loose language could lead to law that ignores \ntechnical realities, blindly shifts liability and ignores serious \nissues. The language must be clarified through the enactment of \nlegislation in conjunction with the Senate's ratification of the \ntreaties.\n  Moreover, some of the proposed treaty implementation language \nattempts to attack copyright violations from the position of the \ntechnology that may be used, rather than placing the blame on those who \nare infringing the copyright. We cannot legislate technology. Just as \nwe have seen the legislated 56-bit encryption become obsolete so too \nwill any technology frozen in place by legislation. We must end \npolicies of the Government that hinder technology, but, more \nimportantly we must not initiate new policies that express an inherent \nfear of new technology.\n\n  We must recognize other realities. Scores of software programs are \nillegally copied on-line, and intellectual piracy is an issue. However, \nsome of this problem relates to the failure of the law, particularly \ncopyright law, to keep up with the swift advance of technology. In a \ndigital environment, hundreds of copies can be made and distributed in \nthe blink of an eye. These copies are reproductions; they are perfect \nrecreations of the original. The speed with which copies can be made \nmakes the traditional ways of enforcing the copyright laws--a court \norder--obsolete. Copyright laws must evolve to embrace the new medium \nof digital storage and transmission. Those who provide the content for \nthe Internet need some assurance that their valuable work will not \nbecome worthless because piracy. The approach in the Digital Copyright \nClarification and Technology Education Act of 1997 requires that \nservice providers cooperate with content providers by taking action \nafter they are notified that illegal material is posted, or being \ntransmitted on their systems. The benefits to copyright holders are \nnotable. A copyright owner will be able to stop the illegal \ndistribution of the material quickly without having to use the courts \nas a first measure. This approach solves the largest problem for on-\nline piracy, by providing a quick response to illegal activity which \nwill preserve the value of the material.\n  Mr. President, one of the many important values held in this country \nis the freedom of expression. The United States must continue to be a \nleader in the preservation of freedom of expression around the world. \nMany countries are looking to the United States to be a leader on these \nimportant issues. We have the opportunity to send a strong message \ninternationally that copyright law must be revised to fit the realities \nof a digital environment, and that by doing so we can encourage the \ngrowth and evolution of the Internet, while protecting all parties \ninvolved, with zero tolerance for illegality.\n  I look forward to working with all interested parties, service \nproviders, educators, entertainers, authors and others as this issue \ndevelops. I welcome the involvement of Senators who may have an \ninterest in this legislation and the opportunity to work together to \ndevelop sound policy.\n  Mr. President, the administration took a lead role in the copyright \ndebate that took place in an international forum. We must continue this \nleadership in the Senate, in order to secure the U.S. role not only as \na leader in the manufacture of technology and development of content, \nbut also as a leader in fashioning a fair and just approach to the use \nof digital technology and information.\n  Mr. president, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                S. 1146\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, during my tenure as Administrator \nof the Veterans, Administration a ``fall back and rescue'' plan was \nformulated to be of assistance to those veterans with VA guaranteed \nmortgages which might be burdensome.\n  The proposal which later became a VA regulation is now, as then, \nreferred to as IRRRL which stands for interest rate reduction \nrefinancing loan.\n  Many thousands of eligible veterans have already benefited from this \nlegislation during the past 17 years of its existence and the VA \npersonnel involved deserve many thanks for their dedicated interest and \nhelp.\n  My concern is not with the legislation or the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, but rather with the seeming reluctance of many in the mortgage \nindustry to take a more active posture with regard to its \nimplementation.\n  I have been told by those who are in the know that the numbers of \ninterested lenders is very small in comparison to the need.\n  I call upon those companies who service GI mortgage loans to be more \nreceptive and to make known throughout the veterans community the \nexistence of these mortgage ``lifelines.''\n  The main features of the IRRRL are the following: First, in most \ncases the interest rate will be lower, and the payment will be lower. \nDocumentation is at a minimum and no credit evaluation is done; second, \nrefinancing can be done if the mortgagee is less than 2\\1/2\\ months \nbehind in their payments; and third, the veteran can add up to \n$6,000.00 to the mortgage for energy efficient improvements, for \nexample, air conditioning, heating systems, insulation, storm door and \nwindows.\n  In closing, I also encourage Secretary designate Hershel Gober to \nintensify the VA's efforts to communicate to veterans information on \nthis very vital and viable tool which is available to them. Further, I \nhope to enlist in the same effort the extremely valuable services of my \ngood friend, former VA Secretary Jesse Brown, whose knowledge and \ndedication to veterans is unquestioned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/03/senate-section/article/S8737-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HONORING THE EMPLOYEES OF CARL F.

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity \ntoday to recognize the important work of Mayor Brenda Barger in leading \nthe residents of Watertown, SD, through winter storms and flooding.\n  Early this year, residents of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South \nDakota experienced relentless snowstorms and bitterly cold \ntemperatures. Snowdrifts as high as buildings, roads with only one lane \ncleared, homes without heat for days, hundreds of thousands of dead \nlivestock, and schools closed for a week at a time were commonplace. As \nif surviving the severe winter cold was not challenge enough, residents \nof the Upper Midwest could hardly imagine the extent of damage Mother \nNature had yet to inflict with a 500-year flood.\n  Record levels on the Big Sioux River and Lake Kampeska forced over \n5,000 residents of Watertown, SD, to evacuate their homes and left over \none-third of the city without sewer and water for 3 weeks. The headline \nof the Watertown Public Opinion on April 6 read ``Watertown in Peril,'' \nand I will never forget the image of homeowners and neighbors, shrouded \nin a late-season snow storm, sandbagging against the rising waters of \nthe Big Sioux River and Lake Kampeska.\n  Brenda Barger held Watertown together with her strength and \ndirection. Some 6 weeks prior to major flooding which began on April 4, \nMayor Barger initiated efforts to try and minimize the impact of the \nimpending disaster. Mayor Barger brought together local and county \nofficials, volunteer agencies including the Red Cross, Salvation Army, \nand others, to brainstorm and compile resource lists of expected needs \nincluding equipment, people, and funds.\n  Despite careful planning, on April 5, an unexpected blizzard hit the \nState, devastating the area. Everything froze, creating further \nconcerns about what was going to happen once the water began flowing \nagain. Mayor Barger camped out in the city's impromptu crisis center \naround the clock and helped to direct the efforts of a number of local \nvolunteers, prisoners, and National Guard personnel. Mother Nature \ncaused Mayor Barger to make a number of difficult decisions immediately \nfollowing the April storm, including ordering the evacuation of nearly \n5,000 residents, or one-fourth the population, of Watertown and the \nshutdown of the water treatment plant at Lake Kampeska. In the \nfollowing days, Mayor Barger secured over 750 port-a-potties and \ndeployed them on the lawns of those families who could return to their \nhomes. Water trucks were brought in to provide people with a fresh \nwater supply, and Mayor Barger oversaw repairs to the water treatment \nplant which were completed ahead of schedule.\n  While those of us from the Midwest will never forget the destruction \nwrought by this year's floods, I have been heartened to witness first-\nhand and hear accounts of South Dakotans coming together within their \ncommunity to protect homes, farms, and entire towns from rising flood \nwaters. Mayor Brenda Barger truly exemplifies the role of a public \nservant, who, in the face of unimaginable natural destruction, placed \nthe needs of an entire community ahead of personal concern. Now, Mayor \nBarger is spearheading efforts by Watertown residents to fully repair \nthe damage from this past year and plan for future emergencies.\n  Mr. President, there is much more to be done to rebuild and repair \nimpacted communities. Mayor Brenda Barger illustrates how the actions \nof an individual can bring some relief to the victims of this natural \ndisaster. I ask you to join me in thanking her for her selfless efforts \nand congratulate her on being\n\n[[Page S8738]]\n\nrecognized during the National Association of Towns and Townships \nconvention in Washington, DC, this week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/03/senate-section/article/S8737-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO MAJ. T.A. TAYLOR-HUNT\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a very \nspecial native of Philadelphia upon her retirement from the U.S. Air \nForce. This extraordinary woman, Maj. T.A. Taylor-Hunt, has served her \ncountry and her community with grace and distinction.\n  To say that T.A. has had an exemplary military career is an \nunderstatement. Her promise as an officer was evident when she received \nan American Spirit Honor Medal upon graduation from basic training. \nAfter completing technical school at Shepard AFB, she began a career in \naccounting and finance at Dover AFB, with follow-on assignments that \ntook her around the world. At the Strategic Air Command NCO Academy, \nshe was recognized as an Honor Graduate, Distinguished Graduate, \nCommandant's Award winner, Academic Champion, and Flight Speech \nChampion. She was the first person in the 25 year history of the \nAcademy to receive so many awards. Likewise, T.A. received an \nInstructor's Abilities Award at NCO Leadership School as well as the \nOfficer's Training School Flight Academic Achievement Award. As a \ncomptroller, T.A. played a critical role in the financial operations of \nOperation Desert Storm. In Europe, she helped to establish an Army \nmedical unit in the former Yugoslavia. At the time of her retirement, \nshe was the Deputy Chief of Wartime / Contingency Planning at the \nDefense Finance and Accounting Service, Denver Center.\n  I would also note that Major Taylor-Hunt graduated summa cum laude \nfrom the University of Maryland, and she received her masters degree \nwith distinction from Webster University. Currently, she is attending \nthe University of Denver College of Law.\n  In addition to the awards I mentioned earlier, Major Taylor-Hunt has \nreceived numerous other commendations for her military performance, as \nwell as her extensive community service. Her military awards and \ndecorations include the Meritorious Service Medal, the Air Force \nCommendation Medal, the Outstanding Unit Award, and the Air Force \nSpecial Recognition Ribbon. Some of her other awards include the 1988 \nDelegate of the Year for the Coastal Charter Chapter American Business \nWomen's Association, the Federal Women's Program Military Officer of \nthe Year, a Community Service Award for the Defense Finance and \nAccounting Service, and inclusion in the 1996 Who's Who Among Students \nin American Colleges and Universities.\n  Mr. President, given T.A.'s tireless efforts to help the less \nfortunate, it is clear that the recognition she received has been well \ndeserved. Her business card describes the way she lives her life. The \ninscription reads, ``Take Care of Others, God Will Take Care of You.'' \nAnd take care of others she has. T.A. devotes a substantial number of \nhours each week soliciting, collecting, sorting, and distributing \ndonations to the homeless, without the assistance of staff. She not \nonly meets the basic needs of homeless families such as food and \nclothing, but she also works to correct their credit problems so that \nthey can find permanent housing. Likewise, T.A. volunteers at several \nshelters, delivers Meals-On-Wheels, and tutors a fourth grade student.\n  I am proud to say that Major Taylor-Hunt's compassion has been \ncontagious. What started as an effort to help one family living in a \nschool bus has grown into an extensive support network spanning the \nDenver metropolitan region. Through her leadership, families have found \nhomes; furniture has been donated; hungry people are being fed; \nchildren are receiving decent school clothes; and holiday meals and \ngifts are donated regularly.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring \nMaj. T.A. Taylor-Hunt and in extending the Senate's best wishes to her \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/03/senate-section/article/S8738-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATIONS TO THE ONEONTA YANKEES\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the major league baseball season \ndoes not end for another month, but today is the end of the regular \nseason of the New York Penn short-season A League.\n  I am very proud to congratulate two teams for making the playoffs, \nthe Batavia Clippers and, closer to my home in Pindars Corners, the \nOneonta Yankees. Oneonta is this year's winner of the New York Penn's \nPickney Division, with the second best record in the league. Led by \nhitting stars such as third baseman Alan Butler and catcher/designated \nhitter Rene Pinto, behind the pitching of Scott Wiggins and Zach Day, \nand with the support of the rest of the team which played outstanding \nbaseball this year, the Oneonta Yankees had their best season in 7 \nyears and are going to the playoffs for the first time since 1990.\n  The Oneonta Yankees have a tradition of success and excellence, \nhaving won the New York Penn league title 11 times in their 30 years of \nexistence. The team has been affiliated with the world champion New \nYork Yankees for longer than any other minor-league club in the Yankee \norganization. Several of today's Yankee stars, including Bernie \nWilliams and Andy Pettitte, began their careers in Oneonta. Don \nMattingly--affectionately referred to by the cognoscenti as ``Donnie \nBaseball''--whose number 23 was just retired at a ceremony at Yankee \nStadium this past weekend, also played for the Oneonta Yankees.\n  As the season ends and the playoffs begin, I want to extend my \ncongratulations to Sam Nader, team owner; Joe Arnold, team manager; and \nthe entire Oneonta Yankees team. I also want to wish them and the \nBatavia Clippers the best of luck in the post season.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/03/senate-section/article/S8738-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO NORMAN B. TURE\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, It is with great sadness that I \nrise today to mark the passing of Dr. Norman B. Ture, President of the \nInstitute for Research on the Economics of Taxation and one of the \nprincipal architects of supply side economics.\n  Dr. Ture was a man of principle. He was convinced, and he convinced \nmany others, that public policy must be guided by respect for \nindividual freedom and property rights, reliance on personal \nresponsibility and integrity, and faith in the free market as the means \nfor ordering economic activity. His brilliant economic analysis helped \nshow that increasing marginal income tax rates lower productivity by \nskewing people's choices away from work and toward leisure activities. \nHe was a major architect of the Reagan tax cuts of the early 1980's, \nserving as Undersecretary for Tax and Economic Affairs in the Reagan \nTreasury Department from 1981 to 1982. Less noticed, however, was his \nsignificant role in putting together the Kennedy tax cuts of 1963. \nWhether on a committee staff, in the executive branch or as an \nindependent researcher, Dr. Ture devoted his career to increasing \nAmericans' standards of living by making taxes less onerous.\n  Dr. Ture also fought to convince public policy makers of the need to \nmake taxes more visible. Hidden taxes on investments and estates, \noverly broad definitions of income, and onerous regulations that allow \ngovernment to control economic activities in his view act as drags on \nthe economy and obscure the real costs of government. These policies, \nDr. Ture showed, unfairly make government interference in our economic \nlife appear cheap or even cost free. They thereby encourage people to \naccept more regulation than is in their financial interest, and to give \nup more of their freedom than they should.\n  Dr. Ture passed away on August 10. He had fought off lung cancer but \nfinally was felled by cancer of the pancreas. He is survived by his \nwife, six children, and two grandchildren. I know our thoughts and \nprayers go out to all Dr. Ture's family in this time of great sorrow.\n  It is some consolation, however, that we will soon see Dr. Ture's \nlast report. Soon before he died, Dr. Ture finished work on a paper \nlaying out a clean, unbiased, highly visible tax system that would let \nthe people see the price of government and make an informed decision as \nto how much of it they are willing to pay for. I look forward to the \nfruitful debate Dr. Ture's final work will no doubt produce.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/03/senate-section/article/S8738-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8738-S8739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. JOAB LESESNE\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nDr. Joab Lesesne, a great educator and South Carolinian.\n\n[[Page S8739]]\n\n  Dr. Lesesne recently celebrated his 25th year as president of Wofford \nCollege, a small Methodist-affiliated school, which has become one of \nthe finest small liberal arts schools in the Nation. Its successful \nevolution is largely due to Dr. Lesesne who first arrived at Wofford 33 \nyears ago as an assistant professor of history. Prior to his post at \nWofford, he taught history at Coastal Carolina, part of the University \nof South Carolina system.\n  Three years after his arrival at the college, Dr. Lesesne was \nappointed assistant dean. While in this position, he implemented a \nvisionary interim program during the 1967-68 academic year which \ncontinues today. Through this program, students are able to devote \nthemselves to one particular subject for several hours a day for an \nentire month. The projects range from the study of modern Irish poetry \nto kayaking down the Rio Grande. The program has contributed to the \nschool's success in turning out well-rounded students with broad \ninterests.\n  In 1969, Dr. Lesesne was appointed director of development, a \nposition he held for a year before being named dean of the college. \nAfter serving as dean from 1970-1972, Dr. Lesesne continued his \nascension and was elected president of the college. Today, under his \nguidance, Wofford continues to break new ground, both locally and \nnationally.\n  In 1975, the Wofford Board of Trustees approved full co-education, \nand the college began admitting women as resident students for the \nfirst time in its history. They now comprise approximately 45 percent \nof the student body. Throughout the Lesesne presidency, Wofford has \ngrown exponentially in its endowments and its campus facilities. \nAdditions include the Campus Life Building, which marked the college's \n125th anniversary in 1979, a new residence hall, and the Franklin Olin \nBuilding, one of the largest gifts ever made by the prestigious F.W. \nOlin Foundation. The campus's hospitable setting led the Carolina \nPanthers to choose Wofford as their summer training camp.\n  Wofford consistently receives national recognition for its leadership \nin liberal arts education. It is consistently ranked as one of the \n``best buys'' in liberal arts education and recently,a survey showed it \nto be the national leader in the percentage of students earning \nacademic credits outside the United States through travel or study \nabroad programs. Furthermore, its academic excellence is complemented \nby fiscal responsibility. The Lesesne presidency has an enviable record \nof balanced budgets, tuition well below the national average for Phi \nBeta Kappa independent colleges, and overall good management.\n  Dr. Lesesne's record of distinction does not end with Wofford. In \n1991, he was chosen as the Citizen of the Year by the Spartanburg \nKiwanis Club and, in subsequent years, has received numerous awards \nfrom the local and statewide Chambers of Commerce. Additionally, he \nserves on many boards representing industry, banking, commerce, and \neducation. He is past Chairman of the Board of Directors of the \nNational Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, the \nfirst southerner ever to hold the post, and is a former president of \nthe Southern University Conference, and former President of the \nNational Association of Schools and Colleges of the United Methodist \nChurch. Additionally, Dr. Lesesne is a retired major general in the \nSouth Carolina Army National Guard.\n  Dr. Lesesne's tenure at Wofford, the longest of any college president \nin the State, exemplifies the virtues of fortitude and loyalty. Under \nhis steady hand, the school sails forward, faithfully serving its \npupils and the community. Joe, in the roles of educator and \nadministrator, is a public servant of the highest order. All of us in \nSouth Carolina are proud to call him our own.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/03/senate-section/article/S8738-4", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MEXICAN GOVERNMENT DETERMINATION ON APPLE DUMPING\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am dismayed by the decision made \nMonday by the Mexican Government to impose a 101.1 percent tariff on \nU.S. Red Delicious and Golden Delicious apples effective September 1. \nThis tariff increase has been imposed in response to an antidumping \nclaim filed by Chihuahua apple growers against U.S. growers earlier \nthis year. Ignoring significant evidence to the contrary, the Mexican \nGovernment has issued a preliminary determination that U.S. growers are \nselling apples in Mexico at half their fair price.\n  The Mexican Government's determination is wrong. U.S. apple growers \nhave not engaged in dumping. It appears that Mexican officials have \nvirtually ignored the documentation submitted by the U.S. apple \nindustry proving that U.S. apple growers are exporting apples at a fair \nprice. The allegations made by Mexico are ludicrous and the tariff \nincrease unjustified.\n  As many of my colleagues know, my home State of Washington is the \nNation's largest apple producer, and Mexico is the largest market for \nour apples. This drastic tariff increase will devastate the United \nStates apple industry while allowing Mexican growers, with no \ncompetition, to charge exceedingly high prices for their apples.\n  Together with my colleagues from Oregon and Idaho, I call on the \nadministration to take immediate action on this issue. We cannot allow \nMexico to undermine the United States apple industry with these unfair, \nprotectionist trade practices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/03/senate-section/article/S8739-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING VOLUNTEER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

These constables are volunteer officers who give to \ntheir country freely of their time, and sometimes, their lives.\n  In Michigan, we have over 2,000 such volunteer reserve officers who \nhave made an immeasurably positive impact on the communities they \nserve.

Thanks is due to the Police Reserve Officer \nAssociation of Michigan and the British Special Constables for their \nefforts in sponsoring the International Reserve Law Officers \nConference.

Are they \nhelping each other build houses or put the roofs on? Are they talking \nabout what they are going to do to bring their communities together? No \nNo, they are not, Mr. President We are talking about putting people who \nhave suffered atrocities in houses 10 feet from each other, and then \npresumably they are going to try to live together, form a school \ndistrict together Mr. President, it is not going to work It may work 25 \nor 50 years from now, but it is not going to work now.\n  The reason I want to talk about this is because our troops are right \nin the middle of it Our troops are being put in the position of taking \npositions between two warring Serb factions They are trying to keep \npeace in a place where they have not yet come to terms with the issues \nSo I am very worried that the President, though I know he is trying to \ndo the right thing, is not stepping back and asking what have we \nlearned from the last year and a half? What have we learned since \nDayton? What can we do to give peace a fair chance? And, most \nimportant, how can we make sure that our troops are neutral \npeacekeepers, so they will not be the targets of the wrath of one \nfaction or another? How can we make sure that our troops are keeping to \nthe mission that they were given, without mission creep, and that our \npolicies underlying the troops that are there are sound policies with a \nreasonable chance of success?\n  You know, I was struck by the interview given by General \nShalikashvili, who is leaving the Joint Chiefs chairmanship this month, \nwhen he said two things He said the troops that are in Bosnia are not \nthe right types of troops to capture war criminals It is a different \ntype of training that is necessary for that--those are my words Second, \nhe talked about the lack of money that we have available right now to \nmake sure that our troops are ready when they are needed to go into a \nUnited States security threat He said we don't even have the money to \nbuy parts, and we are not keeping up with training I am thinking to \nmyself, we are spending $3 billion a year in Bosnia on a mission that \nis ill-defined and a mission that is, I am afraid, creeping into \ndanger, and we are doing it with defense dollars, which is clearly \ntaking from our readiness--$3 billion a year.\n  So I want to raise some basic questions No. 1, can our troops \nadequately defend themselves? Thank goodness, today Gen. Wes Clark, the \nnew head of NATO military operations, said, ``Don't fool with American \ntroops because, if you do, we are going to react with force.'' Well, \nthank goodness I want our troops to defend themselves with all the \nmight that they need to make sure that people do not think they can \nfire at our troops or throw rocks at them because they are on a \npeacekeeping mission So, No. 1, can our troops defend themselves?\n  No. 2, what is the mission? Now, we have been told that the mission \nis very clear It is to keep the warring parties apart; it is not to \ncapture war criminals And, yes, we keep seeing others trying to draw us \ninto capturing war criminals Now, this does not mean we don't want to \ncapture war criminals Of course, we would like to see these people \nbrought to justice But, Mr. President, I have to say that if we are \ntrying to keep peace, I think we have to determine what we are going to \ndo that will keep peace and what we will do that will hurt peace I \nthink if we are trying to resettle refugees who are not ready to mix \nyet, that is not going to bring about peace No. 2, if we are going to \nexpand the mission without coming to Congress to explain exactly what \nour troops are supposed to be doing with regard to capturing war \ncriminals, then we have a shifting mission and not a clear one. So what \nexactly is the mission?\n\n  Mr. President, last but not least, do we have an underlying policy \nthat gives us a real chance for peace? If we don't, if this is not \ngoing to work, let's address it now, let's not wait until 9 months from \nnow when our troops are supposed to withdraw. Let's not say, well, we \nhave tried something for a year and a half and it isn't working, but if \nwe just hang in there, then maybe things will get better, and then when \n9 months are up, then the cries will come, ``Well, let's keep the \ntroops there.''\n  Mr. President, I want American troops on the ground if there is a \nU.S. security interest and if there is a chance for success. I don't \nmind spending our taxpayer dollars if there is a chance for success. \nBut if we are taking from our own military readiness, if we don't have \nthe spare parts for the equipment that we need for training and \nreadiness, how can we justify spending $3 billion a year for Dayton \naccords that I don't think have a chance to succeed?\n  So I think we need to go back to the drawing board. I think the time \nhas come for us to look at what is the underlying best chance for a \npeaceful coexistence in Bosnia.\n  Now, I would like to turn to my friend and colleague from Kansas \nbecause he also had the opportunity to visit our troops. I will just \nsay that I am so proud of our troops. They are doing a wonderful job. I \nhad lunch in Tuzla with our troops, and they are committed to doing the \njob they always do well. They are following orders. But, Mr. President, \nI think we owe our troops something. We owe them an underlying policy \nthat has a chance to succeed. We owe them a clear mission. Mr. \nPresident, we are not giving our troops that clear mission. We are not \ngiving them the underlying policy that will have a chance to succeed. I \nthink we owe them that. I think the time has come for the President to \nsay, step back, let's look at the Dayton accords and let's see if we \ncan do something that will make more sense, not 9 months from now, but \ntomorrow let's start talking about this so that we will have a better \nchance to leave in 9 months when we have been promised that we will. \nBut when we leave, let's leave with a chance for success.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased that my colleague from Kansas also \ntook the time to go and visit with the troops. I think that we have \ndecided, from our different experiences--we were not there together, we \nwere there at different times. But his experiences were very, very \nvivid. I think because we have visited with our troops and because we \nhave talked to the people, I think we have a real feel for what can be \ndone and what can't be done.\n  This was my fourth trip to Bosnia. It is not like I just tooled in \nthere one day a couple of weeks ago. I have been there four times. I \nhave to say that I had great hopes for the Dayton accords, even though \nI did not want our troops on the ground. I led the fight against it. \nNevertheless, once they went, I wanted it to succeed. Of course, we all \ndo. But, Mr. President, what we are doing now is not going to succeed, \nand I don't want to risk one American life and not one more taxpayer \ndollar until the underlying policy is a policy that has a chance to \nsucceed.\n  I yield to my friend and colleague from Kansas, Senator Roberts.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nTexas for yielding. I especially thank her for obtaining this time to \ndiscuss our policy, the American policy on Bosnia, at what I consider a \nspecial time, a real crossroads time to determine exactly what that \npolicy is.\n  The Senator has already pointed out that we were in Bosnia over the \nrecent\n\n[[Page S8741]]\n\nbreak at different times--very close, but at different times. I went as \na member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and, as a matter of fact, \nI received briefings in Prague, Budapest, Bosnia, and London. Most of \nthe concern in regard to those people in charge of our intelligence \ncapability was in regard to Bosnia and, obviously, we spoke with the \nofficials within our embassies, as well as the SFOR command and those \nof the military.\n  I came back after visiting Sarajevo, Tazar, our staging base in \nHungary, and Tuzla, which is the SFOR command center. I must say that I \nshare many of the concerns with the Senator from Texas. There is \nprogress in Sarajevo. If you land in Sarajevo, you will get a briefing \nby the embassy that indicates that the 90-percent figures in relation \nto unemployment have now been reduced to 50; the shops, the markets--\nthe famous market that literally exploded on CNN, really that first \ngreat atrocity where American people became aware of the severe \nproblems there, that is back in business. The schools are now \noperating, and we know that there is income in Sarajevo because the \ngypsies are back. The areas over the main highway obviously are very \nheavily mined. That is still a big problem. I arrived I think at a very \nspecial time, I would tell my colleague from Texas, because it was just \nafter the President's special emissary, Mr. Richard Holbrooke, had \narrived in Bosnia. And I must say that in my personal opinion that up \nto that point we were drifting in Bosnia, and I think with Mr. \nHolbrooke's arrival there was a new impetus, if you will.\n\n  A week prior to that the British--our allies over there, part of the \nSFOR command--had arrested and captured and killed one or two of the \nwar criminals. As that happened, the Embassy officials that we visited \nwith indicated that certainly did a lot for our credibility in regard \nto that area; that up to that point there had been some drift.\n  So I asked all of our intelligence people, I asked the SFOR command, \nand I asked our Embassy people: Had the mission changed? Because \nobviously if we are going to adopt that kind of an aggressive posture \nin Bosnia; that is, really going after the war criminals to locate and \nto capture and to prosecute them--that certainly is a different kind of \nmission that many of us here in the Senate, and I might add in the \nHouse, envisioned for our United States troops in Bosnia.\n  They reiterated the following.\n  No. 1: The relevancy of the United States in Bosnia is peacekeeping, \nrefugee resettlement, economic restoration, democracy building, and the \nwar criminal issue.\n  I think the mission has been changed. I think it has been changed \nsubstantially. I think we have gone from peacekeeping to peace \nenforcement. I think we now are disarming, if you will, the police that \nMr. Karadzic has around him in Srpska. It is a very aggressive overt \neffort. We are now taking over radio and TV stations and apparently \ngiving them back after a fuss is raised by a mob against our NATO \ntroops.\n  I think we have a timetable. I think this is a must-do situation \nprior to the elections to be held later on this month in Srpska. I \nthink we have taken sides in that election overtly. I think it is very \nclear in that regard. And I think we made a decision that before winter \ncomes in that area we must do something about the war criminals. Why? \nIt is pretty easy to point out.\n  I know that this is a very small replica of persons indicted for war \ncrimes. I have a much larger chart. Time did not permit me to bring it \nover from the office. These are 79 individuals that are pictured here--\n10 are in custody now--of the war criminals or the persons indicted for \nthe war crimes. Let me just say, I said 79 and 78. They are indicted by \nthe U.N. International Criminal Tribunal in the Hague for grave \nbreaches of the 1949 Geneva Convention, violations of laws, customs of \nwar, and crimes against humanity.\n  The person I would like to draw to your attention is a young man 34 \nyears old who is still at large. He is only 34 years old. The charges \nare from about May 7, 1992, to early July 1992. There were hundreds of \nMuslim and Croat men and women confined at the Luka camp in inhumane \nconditions under armed guard. These detainees were systematically \nkilled at Luka almost every day during that time. The accused, often \nassisted by camp guards, entered Luka's main hangar where most of the \ndetainees were kept, selected detainees for interrogation, beat them, \nand often shot them. They killed them. It goes on here. I would just \nsay simply that the descriptions involved remind you of the Nazi war \ncrimes. I will not go into that.\n  But obviously if these people are not brought to justice there is no \nchance for peace in Bosnia. Who is going to do this job? The Senator \nfrom Texas has already indicated that it is pretty obvious now that the \nNATO troops are. That is a clear difference, or a clear policy change, \nfrom peacekeeping. I call it peace enforcement.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I am delighted to yield to my colleague.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am glad the Senator is on this point because in the \noriginal mission statement in the Dayton accords there was a provision \nto capture war criminals, but it was going to be a police force within \nthe Federation. It was going to be a police force made up of all three \nof the sectors that would go after war criminals, hopefully in a way \nthat would be responsible. That police force has not materialized. As \nthe Senator from Kansas has said, we are substituting our NATO forces \nfor the police force that is the mission in the Dayton accords. That is \na change of mission by any way you read it.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I appreciate the Senator's comments.\n  The young man I was talking about is 34 years old, at large now, and \n78 other war criminals are at large as well.\n  As I have indicated, there is no way that you can bring the Dayton \naccords to their successful completion with these folks at large.\n  Let me just say this. Everybody there, every intelligence source, \nevery person that you visit with, whether they be Muslim, Croat or \nSerb, SFOR command, Russians. We visited with the Russians in their \ncompound. They are really doing a very good job working with us and \nclosely cooperating; and obviously the Brits and the Norwegians; 34 \nnations are involved in this effort.\n  We have literally planted the flag. We have an outstanding \ncooperative effort. We have spent $7 billion in Bosnia. But there are \nsome expenditures too from all those nations involved in the SFOR \ncommand. All of these people have indicated very clearly that if we \nleave, and if we leave, why, the Brits will leave. If we leave, the \nBritish will leave.\n  We both have learned that when we were talking to Embassy officials \nand members taking part in the interparliamentary conference over there \nin Great Britain, they said, ``We were with you in terms of our ground \ntroops. When you leave, we leave.'' If we leave, if SFOR leaves, or the \nAmerican presence in SFOR. Let's not really kid ourselves. Within \nweeks, why, the fighting will break out again. Yet we have in the other \nbody in the House on the defense appropriations bill a cutoff date \nsaying our troops must come home as of June 1998.\n  Our Secretary of Defense, our former colleague and dear friend, \nSecretary Cohen, indicated that the troops will be home in June 1998. \nThe President has said the troops will be home in June 1998. But maybe, \nI don't know. We are a little nebulous on that.\n  That is where the candor comes in because I think our policy has \nbecome very disingenuous. On the one hand we are building up the troop \nlevels from about 8,500 to 12,000. We have changed the mission from \npeacekeeping to peace enforcement. Yet, we say in June 1998 we can \nwithdraw the troops. That is not possible.\n  I personally think that once you plant the flag, once you have 34 \nnations involved, once you have that kind of cooperation, it is going \nto be very difficult to withdraw. When the Dayton accords fail, that is \ngoing to send a message around the world that we don't want to send. \nYet the case has not been made to the American public, to this Senate, \nor to us by the administration, as to how we are going to accomplish \nthat.\n\n  Thank goodness the Senator from Texas has arranged this time so we \ncan sort of have a kickoff here in terms of long-term goals and what I \nconsider to\n\n[[Page S8742]]\n\nbe short-term politics. I think we need a lot of candor.\n  I have a related concern. In a meeting with about 18 young Kansans, \nboth men and women in uniform, only 2 plan to stay in the service. They \nhave been over there 9 months. They work 13, 14, 15 hours a day. The \npersonnel tempo, the operational tempo--the Senator from Texas, as a \nformer member of the Armed Services Committee, knows, I know, and \neverybody even connected with the military knows that we have downsized \nto the point where the operation and personnel tempo in all the \ncountries involved in the peacekeeping operations--we are wearing out \nour military. It is not working. When you get 16 out of 18 Kansans, \nsome of whom are very dedicated in midcareer, say they are going to \nleave because of the pressures on them and their families, working \novertime, there is a big problem here. That is a related problem that \nwe have not really talked about in relation to the Bosnian situation.\n  Let me just say in closing that I would like to refer to the remarks \nby our colleague from Delaware, Senator Biden, who has had many trips \nto Bosnia. I have his remarks here that he made before the Senate as of \nthis morning.\n  He says that we have reached a crucial point in our policy toward \nBosnia. Resolute American action, combined with allied support and \nlocal compliance, could turn the corner.\n  I also add that I agree with Senator Biden. I am not sure we can turn \nthe corner. I want to know what is around the corner. And we need \ncandor.\n  I also say that he lists the goals--to greatly expand the number of \nrefugees returning to their prewar homes.\n  The Senator from Texas was in Brcko, talked to the people there, and \nsaw the futility of forced relocation.\n  I was flying in a helicopter with a one-star Army commander, went \nover a knoll where Moslems used to live--60 of them. We have tried \nthree times to relocate these people. Each time they have been beaten, \nand the homes have been destroyed. He has indicated that it might not \nbe a very good idea to try for the fourth time.\n  Senator Biden went on to say--and I agree with him--that we can and \nmust ensure that the country's municipal elections in mid-September are \nheld and are free and fair. I hope we can do that. That will be our \nbest hope. But there once again we are having our troops and the NATO \ntroops take part, and are actually taking part in an election. They are \nelection observers, and more than that. He points out that we must and \ncan guarantee free access to the electronic media. We guarantee the TV \nstation. And Mrs. Plavsic, who is one of the candidates and the best \ncandidate, openly now is supported by NATO forces, and our forces. But \nnow we apparently have given that back to Mr. Karadzic and his people. \nSo we are playing sort of a back and forth business in terms of TV.\n  Senator Biden--and I will just sum up here--in his remarks said that \nit is absolutely essential for an international military force to \nremain in Bosnia after June 1998 to guarantee that progress will \ncontinue. Thank goodness somebody has been candid. Senator Biden has \nindicated that. He says an international force should be there. \nEverybody in that whole part of the world indicates that if we are not \ninvolved in that international force it will not succeed. That is what \nhappened in the beginning.\n  So I commend Senator Biden for his candor. But then he says--I want \nthe Senator from Texas to pay very close attention in regard to his \ncomments as it relates to NATO expansion. He indicates that not only \nwould all that has been accomplished go up in smoke if fighting \nreignited--i.e., if we leave--but a failure in Bosnia would signal the \nbeginning of the end for NATO which is currently restructuring itself \nto meet Bosnia-like challenges in the 21st century.\n  Senator Biden, Senator Lugar, and many others who are involved in the \nproposal to expand NATO have indicated that the Congress of the United \nStates is not focused on this issue. The American public is not focused \non this issue.\n  Let me say that Senator Hutchison has certainly focused on the issue, \nand that she is able to have 20 Senators sign a letter to the President \nexpressing many concerns over NATO expansion--tough questions that need \nto be answered.\n  In Prague I was very privileged to address the Transatlantic \nConference in regard to NATO expansion. I guess you could say that I \nwas sort of the skunk at the expansion picnic in that I took the \nconcerns that the Senator has raised. I raised them with the Czech \nRepublic not because of any lack of support or admiration for the \nemerging nations. But there again we have planted the flag for NATO \nexpansion. Here we have a situation where the Congress of the United \nStates is going to say, ``OK, we are going to take our troops, and we \nare going to bring them home after June 1998. But, on the other hand, \nwe are going to go ahead with NATO expansion. And under article V we \nare going to be committed to American men and women perhaps risking \ntheir lives on Polish soil, Czech soil, and Hungarian soil, not to \nmention the 24 other countries that would like to become involved if we \nare going to withdraw the troops in regard to Bosnia. You certainly \ncan't propose an expansion of NATO with article V.''\n  These are the kind of questions that I think we need to raise.\n  I have gone on much too long here this evening. But I do again want \nto thank the Senator from Texas for raising these concerns. I have just \ntouched on several concerns. I plan when we have additional time under \nmorning business--or we ought to take the time--to go over all of the \nconcerns that the Senator from Texas has raised, and some of the \nconcerns that I have raised. It is a time for candor because the clock \nis ticking.\n  The election will be held at the end of September to determine the \nfuture of Bosnia. I do not want to see the Dayton accords fail. But I \ncan tell you one thing, they are not going to be successful if we \nsimply withdraw the troops by June 1998. Then where are we? If we keep \nthem there, where are we?\n  I asked one of the Embassy officials in Sarajevo, ``When did all of \nthis start?'' I think I am right by saying it was in 1384 when the \nTurks and the Serbs first got involved in a very difficult conflict and \na war. It has not been fully settled since, except for the reign of \nMarshal Tito who ruled the country with an iron fist.\n  So I thank the Senator from Texas. I thank her for her leadership. I \nlook forward to continuing to work with her as we try to answer some of \nthese very, very difficult questions.\n  I thank the Senator. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas for \nhis remarks. I am pleased that he took the time to go over and visit \nour troops in Bosnia, to find out for himself what the situation was \nthere. He is a distinguished new member of the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  I think it is important that all Senators try to go over there \nbecause we have a lot at stake. Our troops are on the ground. Up to \n12,000 will be there very soon. Their lives are at stake. In addition \nto that, our taxpayers are footing the bill for $3 billion a year so \nfar, and they have the right to ask, what are we doing there? What are \nwe doing with the $3 billion? Are we doing something that will have a \nchance to succeed? Those are fair questions.\n  Americans are generous people. They are valiant. They are committed \nto freedom, and they want everyone in the world to live in freedom. \nThey would risk their lives, as they have in this century, for the \nfreedom of people who live in Europe and other places. They are willing \nto risk their lives. They are willing to pay from their pocketbooks, \nfrom their families the money if a policy has a reasonable chance to \nsucceed.\n  I am today raising the question, do we have a reasonable chance to \nsucceed with the underlying policy? There is no question that our \ntroops are doing a great job. There is no question that our new \ncommander, Gen. Wes Clark, is absolutely correct when he says, you fool \nwith American troops and you are going to face the consequences. I am \nglad we have issued the ultimatum because everybody is on fair notice \nthat you can't throw rocks and shoot at American troops and get by with \nit.\n  But it is the underlying policy that I question today. I am calling \non the President of the United States, with the leadership of the \nSecretary of Defense and the Secretary of State, to step back and look \nat the policy. Are\n\n[[Page S8743]]\n\nwe trying to put the American standard of multiethnic, peaceful \ndemocracy into a place that is not ready? I think we are. And I think \nwe are risking a lot doing it. So I am asking the President and his \nCabinet members to come together and say, let's look again at Dayton. \nLet's look at whether the time is now for resettling refugees, for \nforcing people to live in this Federation with a joint Government of \nCroats and Muslims and Serbs, all of whom have committed, or had \ncommitted on them, terrible atrocities. And we are now saying come \ntogether, form a government, have a joint presidency, have a joint \ngovernment, create a school system that will accommodate a Muslim \nreligion and a Catholic religion and come together and bring all of \nthis in in the next 9 months.\n  Let us step back. Let us revisit Dayton. Let us see if we can make a \nDayton that has a chance to succeed. I will support leaving our troops \non the ground beyond June 1998; I will support the money it takes if we \nhave a policy that has a reasonable chance to succeed, that will bring \na peaceful coexistence. And I think the time has come to look at a \ndivision where people can come together of like mind and form a \ngovernment that will serve their purposes where they can invest in \ninfrastructure, where we can help them invest in infrastructure, and \nthey can build their factories and they can have jobs and begin to live \nin peace with their neighbors who are different from them.\n  That happens all over Europe. In fact, the lesson of history is that \nmany times people who cannot live together split apart. You can name \nexample after example. And it can be done peacefully. Why not let them \ncome together in their own groups, form their governments, create their \nlivelihoods. In the former Bosnia, there were taxes on the minority \nethnic groups. There were restraints on what certain minority ethnics \ncould do. They could not be doctors. They could not be small business \npeople around the corner selling hardware. They could not be lawyers. \nThey could only have certain farming-type jobs.\n  That is not a recipe for success. Why not look at a division that \nmight work. Let them have their government. Let them have an economy. \nLet us help them build the sewer lines and the roads and the streets \nand the airports and the factories so they can pull themselves up. Let \nthem trade with their neighbors. Let that be the beginning of getting \nalong together, whether they are Catholic or whether they are Muslim or \nwhether they are orthodox, and then perhaps eventually, after they have \nhad good relationships for years, they will be able to mix and move in \nto the other country.\n  I hope that the President of the United States will not continue to \nsay, well, if we just keep trying, we just stay at it, we will have an \ninfinite commitment of American troops and American dollars along with \nour European allies, all of whom are also stretched in their budgets, \nall of whom care about their soldiers and their troops just as we do, \nall of whom, I believe, would like to see a policy that has a chance \nfor success. They are there on the ground because they, too, are \ngenerous people.\n  So I ask the President of the United States, I ask Madeleine \nAlbright, I ask Bill Cohen, go back to the drawing board. Look at \nsomething that might have a chance to work. Do not be in a rut trying \nto put a round peg in a square hole. It is time to look for a round \nhole. What we are doing now is not working. Maybe a division will not \nwork either, but let us try something that has a better chance. Let us \nlearn from the experience and let us go forward.\n  Mr. President, we are going to hear a lot more about this. I hope we \nwill not wait 9 months to determine that this is not going to work. Let \nus start now. Let us give our troops a chance now. Let us give our \ntaxpayers a chance now. Let us give the people of Bosnia more hope than \nthey are seeing now. Senator Roberts talked about the experience of \nthese poor Muslim people trying to move back into their old homes and \nthe Serb factions kept them out, beat them up, finally burned their \nhomes up. Mr. President, that is not a recipe for success.\n  Let us step back. Let us give peace a chance by looking at something \nnew. And let us do something now rather than frittering away 9 months \nand not having any better chance than we have today.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  On behalf of the leader, I would like to close the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/03/senate-section/article/S8739-4", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8743-S8744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NATIONAL DAY OF RECOGNITION FOR THE HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS OF DIANA, \n                           PRINCESS OF WALES\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of S. Res. 118, submitted earlier today by \nSenators Hatch and Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 118) expressing condolences on the \n     death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and designating September \n     6, 1997 as a ``National Day of Recognition for the \n     Humanitarian Efforts of Diana, Princess of Wales.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, all of us have heartfelt grief for the \npeople of Great Britain. That is why the Senate is acting in this \nresolution, saying this is a woman and a leader who cared so much about \nAIDS victims, people who did not have the chance in life that she did. \nI think she really did show many of us that if we will just reach out a \nhelping hand to those less fortunate, it will make a difference.\n  The Senate stands today in unanimous agreement that we grieve with \nthe people of Great Britain and we will set aside a day of recognition \nand one in which all of us will be thinking about her accomplishments, \nthe tragic, senseless death that she suffered, and hope that through \nher children and the Royal Family and all of the British Government and \nthe people of Great Britain good things will come from the leadership \nshe showed and the compassion she showed for others and that because \nshe lived we will all be better people.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in support of the \nresolution expressing the Senate's condolences upon the death of Diana, \nPrincess of Wales. I can think of no event in recent times that has \nmoved so many people from different parts of the world and different \nwalks of life as the untimely and tragic death of this remarkable \nwoman. Diana was loved and respected worldwide. She meant different \nthings to different people, but the essence of her universal appeal \nseems to derive from the fact that, at the height of fame and \nprivilege, Diana never lost the simple, human touch.\n  To many people, the greatest tragedy of Diana's death is the loss to \nher two young sons, William and Harry. Diana was a committed and caring \nmother who did a remarkable job rearing her children under great \npressure and intense public scrutiny. Many of us have seen the moving \nfootage of Diana hugging her sons unabashedly, or beaming at the end of \nan amusement park adventure the three of them had shared. These things \nmay seem simple to people outside the spotlight, but they were quite \ndaring for someone charged with molding the character of the future \nKing of England.\n  Diana's human touch was daring in other ways, too. She may have \nsinglehandedly changed the way people around the world view their \nfellow human beings suffering from AIDS and leprosy when she simply \ntouched their hands. With a simple, compassionate gesture, the princess \nshowed that we can afford to reach out to the sick.\n  Despite many bouts with personal adversity, Diana never withdrew into \nthe comforts of her privileged background. Instead, she seemed to \nrelish tackling new challenges, becoming a passionate humanitarian who \nspent countless hours ministering to the sick, the poor, and the \nforgotten. Many Americans, including a number of my colleagues, knew \nher from her charitable work with the homeless and with victims of \nAIDS, breast cancer, leprosy, and other human afflictions.\n  Most recently, Princess Diana helped to shed light on the horrors of \nindiscriminate injury and death caused by the worldwide proliferation \nof antipersonnel landmines. I have joined my\n\n[[Page S8744]]\n\ncolleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, in his effort to enact a ban on \nthe use of landmines, and this campaign received an invaluable boost \nfrom the efforts of Princess Diana. I can think of no greater tribute \nto her legacy than for us to summon the will and courage to enact such \na ban.\n  Mr. President, when the eyes of the world turn to London this \nSaturday, I hope that passage of this resolution will convey the \nthoughts and prayers of the American people to the family of the \nPrincess of Wales and the British people. It is the least we can do for \nsomeone who deeply touched, and forever changed, so many of our lives.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, as the dean of the women in the Senate, \nI rise to pay tribute to the life and legacy of Diana, the Princess of \nWales. Our hearts go out to her family and to the British people. We \nbelieve it is appropriate that we adopt this resolution to create a \nnational day of mourning on September 6, the day of her funeral.\n  People have expressed surprise at the outpouring of love and grief \nfrom the British people. But we shouldn't be surprised. Princess Diana \nwas a remarkable person. We were dazzled by her grace and beauty--but \nwhat we truly valued was her compassion.\n  She was called the people's princess. She was born a member of the \naristocracy and married into royalty--but she never forgot that \nBritain's strength was its ordinary working people. The thousands of \npeople laying flowers and waiting in line for hours to sign the \ncondolence book represent a cross section of Britons. They are the \nsenior citizens, the working mothers, the new immigrants--and \nespecially, the children.\n  She treated the people she met with respect and compassion and she \ntaught her children to do the same. Many people go through the motions \nof doing good works. But with Princess Diana, it came from the heart.\n  The Princess of Wales had her personal challenges. But it is for her \npublic commitments that we will most remember her. She chose her causes \ncarefully. She worked on behalf of those who were most in need. She \ncampaigned for awareness of AIDS and tolerance and compassion for those \nwho suffered from AIDS. She helped support battered women's shelters. \nShe worked on behalf of children's hospitals. She worked to raise money \nfor breast cancer research. These causes were universal in nature and \nsupported by many women around the world.\n  She was also a leader in the effort to end the use of antipersonnel \nlandmines. She traveled to Angola and Bosnia to show the world the \ntragic effects of landmines on ordinary civilians. By visiting mine \nfields and landmine victims, she showed us more than any report or \ninternational symposium ever could.\n  In the U.S. Senate, Senator Leahy and Senator Hagel have led our \neffort to end the use of landmines. I am proud to be part of that \neffort. We have stopped exporting mines, and are now trying to stop \ntheir use. The world's most technologically advanced military does not \nneed a weapon that cannot distinguish between a soldier and a child--\nwho may be killed while playing in a field 10 years after the war is \nover.\n  Mr. President, Princess Diana's death was a tragedy. But her life was \na triumph. Her legacy is her work on behalf of those in need, and, most \nimportantly, her children--whose lives will reflect the values their \nmother taught them. We can best honor her legacy by continuing to work \nas she did for those who are most in need.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table and that any statements relating to \nthis resolution appear at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 118) and its preamble read as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 118\n\n       Whereas the Senate and the American people heard the \n     announcement of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, with \n     profound sorrow and deep regret;\n       Whereas the Princess of Wales touched the lives of millions \n     of Americans and people throughout the world as an example of \n     compassion and grace;\n       Whereas the Princess of Wales was a committed and caring \n     mother who successfully raised two young sons under great \n     pressure and public scrutiny;\n       Whereas the Senate recognizes the tireless humanitarian \n     efforts of the Princess of Wales, including the areas of--\n       (1) raising awareness of and attention to breast cancer \n     research and treatment;\n       (2) HIV/AIDS, particularly in the areas of pediatric AIDS, \n     educating the public regarding the facts of HIV/AIDS \n     transmission, and fostering a public attitude that is \n     intolerant of discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS;\n       (3) banning antipersonnel landmines from the arsenals of \n     war, as these indiscriminate weapons often result in \n     casualties to civilians, including children, sometimes many \n     years after the armed conflict in which the mines were used; \n     and\n       (4) eliminating the problem of hopelessness around the \n     world: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) extends to the people of the United Kingdom sincere \n     condolences and sympathy on the death of Diana, Princess of \n     Wales.\n       (2) recognizes the extraordinary impact of the Princess of \n     Wales' humanitarian efforts around the world; and\n       (3) designates September 6, 1997, as a ``National Day of \n     Recognition for the Humanitarian efforts of Diana, Princess \n     of Wales''.\n       Sec. 2.

Both of these \ninstruments were signed on behalf of the United States at the OAS \nheadquarters in Washington on January 10, 1995. In addition, for the \ninformation of the Senate, I transmit the report of the Department of \nState with respect to the Convention and the Protocol.\n  When ratified, the Convention and the Protocol will constitute the \nfirst multilateral convention between the United States and other \nmembers of the OAS in the field of international judicial cooperation \nin criminal matters. The provisions of the Convention and Protocol are \nexplained in the report of the Department of State that accompanies \nthis message.\n  The Convention and Protocol will establish a treaty-based system of \njudicial assistance in criminal matters analogous to that which exists \nbilaterally between the United States and a number of countries. These \ninstruments should prove to be effective tools to assist in the \nprosecution of a wide variety of modern criminals, including members of \ndrug cartels, ``white-collar'' criminals, and terrorists. The \nConvention and Protocol are self-executing, and will not require \nimplementing legislation.\n  The Convention provides for a broad range of cooperation in criminal \nmatters. Mutual assistance available under the Convention includes: (1) \ntaking testimony or statements of persons; (2) providing documents, \nrecords, and articles of evidence; (3) serving documents; (4) locating \nor identifying persons or items; (5) transferring persons in custody \nfor testimony or other purposes; (6) executing requests for searches \nand seizures; (7) assisting in forfeiture proceedings; and (8) \nrendering any other form of assistance not prohibited by the laws of \nthe Requested State.\n  The Protocol was negotiated and adopted at the insistence of the \nUnited States Government, and will permit a greater measure of \ncooperation in connection with tax offenses. I believe that the \nConvention should not be ratified by the United States without the \nProtocol. If the Convention and Protocol are ratified, the instruments \nof ratification would be deposited simultaneously.\n  One significant advantage of this Convention and Protocol is that \nthey provide uniform procedures and rules for cooperation in criminal \nmatters by all the states that become Party. In addition, the \nConvention and Protocol would obviate the expenditure of resources that \nwould be required for the United States to negotiate and bring into \nforce bilateral mutual assistance treaties with certain OAS member \nstates.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Convention and the Protocol, and that it give its advice and \nconsent to ratification, subject to the understandings described in the \naccompanying report of the Department of State.\n                                                  William J.
