I ask unanimous consent that these staff members associated \nwith our presentation of the bill be allowed the privilege of the floor \nduring consideration of the defense bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The list is as follows:\n\n       Sid Ashworth, Tom Hawkins, Susan Hogan, Mary Marshall, Gary \n     Reese, John Young, James Hayes, Justin Weddle, Carolyn \n     Willis, Jennifer Stiefel, Frank Barca, and Kristin Iagulli.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senate begins consideration today of \nthe 1999 Defense appropriations bill, to fund the military activities \nof the Department of Defense for the upcoming fiscal year.\n  This bill provides $250.5 billion in new budget authority for 1999, \nan increase of $2.8 billion over the amount appropriated in 1998.\n  The committee reported this bill on June 4th. Unforeseen \ncircumstances delayed the consideration of the bill, but I believe it \nis vital that we pass the Defense funding bill prior to the recess.\n  The military must know how much money it will have to meet critical\n\n[[Page S9324]]\n\noperational and modernization requirements at the beginning of the \nfiscal year, October 1.\n  Fiscal year 1999 represents the first budget cycle under the 5 year \nbipartisan budget agreement--the amount requested by the President \ncorresponds to the cap agreed to for Defense.\n  That results in a fundamentally different dynamic for balancing this \nbill compared to fiscal years 1996, 1997 and 1998.\n  For the previous three fiscal years, Congress and the White House \nwere at odds over the total level of funding for Defense. The budget \nsubmitted by the Pentagon failed to fully accommodate the readiness and \nmodernization priorities of the Joint Chiefs.\n  For 1999, the committee received a budget proposal consistent with \nthe bi-partisan budget agreement--not enough for Defense, but at the \nlevel agreed to last summer at the summit.\n  The content of that budget reflected the priorities and strategy of \nthe Quadrennial Defense Review, submitted by Secretary Cohen and Gen. \nJoe Ralston last spring. The FY 1999 budget kept faith with the \nconcepts and priorities advocated in the QDR.\n  I want to begin by commending Secretary Cohen and Deputy Secretary \nJohn Hamre for their efforts to present a budget that did not require a \nmajor overhaul by Congress.\n  We do not agree on every item, and fact of life events resulted in \nadjustments on many programs, but essentially, this budget request \nmeets the minimum needs of the Armed Forces.\n  The recommendations from the committee focus on three goals: ensure \nan adequate quality of life for the men and women of the Armed Forces; \nsustain readiness; and modernize to assure future battlefield dominance \nby our Armed Forces, if needed.\n  To achieve needed quality of life for our troops, and their families, \nthis bill fully funds the 3.1 percent authorized military pay raise.\n  During consideration of the DOD authorization bill in June, I joined \nthe managers of that bill in co-sponsoring an amendment to increase the \npay raise to 3.6 percent for 1999.\n  The first amendment that Senator Inouye and I will jointly offer to \nthis bill will provide the additional appropriation for the 3.6 percent \nraise.\n  Additionally, the Treasury-General Government bill that we will pass \nlater today provides a comparable pay raise for civilian Pentagon \nworkers. Those amounts are funded from within the general operation and \nmaintenance appropriations.\n  The pay raise solves only a part of the compensation crisis facing \nthe Department of Defense.\n  My discussions with the service chiefs, the service secretaries, \nfield commanders and the men and women of the Armed Forces, serving in \nmy State of Alaska and around the world, lead me to conclude that an \nequally pressing challenge is retirement pay.\n  The changes adopted by Congress in 1986 reflected the cold war \npriority of attracting men and women to serve a full 30 year career in \nthe Armed Forces.\n  Our victory in the cold war led to a wrenching realignment of the \nforce, and radical new personnel priorities.\n  There is great pressure today for individuals to spend only 20 years \nin active service. The revised retirement plan puts them at an unfair, \nand unacceptable disadvantage, as compared to serving a full 30 years.\n  It is my intention to work with the leaders here in Congress, and \nwith the Secretary of Defense, to put us on a track to fix the \nretirement system--in my mind, there is no higher defense funding \npriority, for it has led to a series of decisions by men and women in \nthe services, not to continue because of their feeling about the \nunfairness of the retirement policies.\n  The considerable operational demands on our Armed Forces dictate that \nwe also ensure the welfare and quality of life for those on active duty \nnow.\n  Based on the committee's recent trip to Bosnia and Southwest Asia, a \nnew $50 million MWR and retention initiative is included in this bill.\n  These funds will provide added resources and flexibility to address \nthe though living conditions and family separation challenges of \ndeployments to Bosnia and Southwest Asia.\n  More than $100 million is added for quality of life enhancements in \nthe service O accounts, to upgrade barracks, dormitories, and other \npersonnel support facilities.\n  Our second focus, maintaining readiness, has been stressed by \noverseas deployments during the past three years.\n  For 1998, this committee succeeded in providing needed contingency \nfunds as an emergency, without disrupting other Defense programs.\n  For 1999, the recommendation adds funds for flying hours, depot \nmaintenance, training, and base operations.\n  We recommend savings resulting from changed economic factors, such as \nfuel costs, foreign currency, and inflation--but restore all those \namounts to the O appropriations.\n  There is no option to trade near term readiness for future \nmodernization. As long as our Armed Forces face the range of missions \noverseas underway today, we must sustain the O accounts at least at \nthe levels provided in this bill, and the House bill.\n  No sector of Defense has suffered more the past few years than \nacquisition. We must invest more to protect the technological \nsuperiority that our smaller military force counts on.\n  These recommendations fully fund the combat priorities advocated by \nthe Joint Chiefs: F-22, the Crusader, F-18, new attack submarine, the \nJASSM missile, V-22, and national missile defense.\n  In many instances, the recommendations add funds for technology \ndevelopment programs, to look even further down the road, past the \nsystems we will deploy over the next ten years--out for the next thirty \nyears.\n  Achieving these three priorities was especially challenging given our \nfixed budget caps.\n  Every dollar shifted among programs came from a reduction to an item \nin the budget request--there were no additional dollars to spend this \nyear for Defense.\n  Senator Inouye and I sought to allocate the resources available to \nthe subcommittee as equitably as possible, and consistent with the \nmilitary needs identified by the Chiefs.\n  In most cases, we could not provide large increases in existing \nprocurement programs, or to restore programs already terminated.\n  No member of this committee, or the Senate, secured every priority \nwhich he or she advocated to the committee. On the other hand, we \nreviewed all of them, and have done our best.\n  I believe the recommendations are fair and achieve a balance between \nthe budget and the priorities of Congress. It is my intention to do \neverything we can to work with all of our colleagues to meet the needs \nthey have brought to the Committee.\n  Finally, there is one notable change from the bill reported last year \nby this Committee--in the area of medical research.\n  In the bill we reported last year, we provided $176 million for \nmedical research. Coming out of conference, that total grew to $344 \nmillion, almost twice the level of the Senate.\n  In the context of adding $6 billion to the budget, that total was \nmanageable.\n  Let me explain that again. Last year, we had an additional $6 billion \nby the time we came out of the conference, and it was possible to \nincrease that amount. This year, we have no top line margin to \nallocate. Whatever is added to this bill will come out of either \nreadiness, or future acquisition, or the quality of life concepts that \nI have discussed.\n  For 1999, Senator Inouye and I recommended a new appropriations of \n$250 million in the defense health program for medical research grants.\n  This increase over last year's appropriation provides adequate \nresources to sustain growth in the breast cancer and prostate cancer \nprograms, while enabling the Department of review other research \nprograms and opportunities. The report lists all the programs seeking \nfunding this year.\n  The bill establishes a floor for breast cancer and prostate cancer \nresearch at the minimum; at least they must be provided at the level \nthat we finally agreed to in conference in 1998.\n\n  The bill also seeks to address the funding priorities of the National \nGuard. In testimony before the subcommittee, the Army Guard identified \nas shortfall for 1999 $634 million for their operational requirements--\nnot for future involvement for just their operational requirements.\n\n[[Page S9325]]\n\n  The bill reported by the committee provides an additional $20 million \nfor the Guard counterdrug operation, $225 million for the Army Guard \nO account, and $95 million for Army Guard personnel account.\n  A total of $475 million will be added to the National Guard and \nReserve equipment. That is a cut, however, of 25 percent from the level \nappropriated in 1998.\n  Finally, the bill reported by the committee did not include the $1.9 \nbillion requested by the President as emergency spending for Bosnia.\n  The Senate considered several amendments during debate on the defense \nauthorization bill concerning our future force levels and operations in \nBosnia.\n  Later this morning, I know Senator Hutchison, Senator Byrd, and \nothers will raise at least one amendment related to our presence in \nBosnia.\n  At the time we considered this bill in the Appropriations Committee, \nit was premature for this committee to consider funding for that \nmission for 1999.\n  Based on our visit to Bosnia in May, and to NATO headquarters after \nthat, it is clear that a long-term presence in Bosnia is envisioned by \nNATO and the administration.\n  That long-term role cannot in the future be funded on an annual \nemergency basis. The Congress must be part of the decision on the size \nof the force, the duration of the mission, and the cost of the \noperations.\n  Mr. President, we bring this bill to the Senate with the hope of \ncommencing the August recess tomorrow. Securing passage of this bill at \na reasonable hour will require the cooperation, consideration, and \nassistance of every Senator.\n  It is my hope that we will obtain early today an agreement to have \nall amendments filed at the desk so we can most efficiently dispose of \nthose amendments--accepting some, debating some, and encouraging \nMembers not to raise others.\n  This bill has been available to all Members since June 5. The bill \nclosely approximates the level authorized in the defense bill we passed \nlast June.\n  That authorization bill is in conference with the House, and we have \ncontinued to work closely with Senator Thurmond, Senator Levin, and \nothers on that committee to support the priorities passed by the Senate \nin that bill.\n  Mr. President, the presentation of this bill to the Senate would not \nbe possible without the leadership and partnership that I have enjoyed \nwith my friend from Hawaii, Senator Inouye.\n  This is the tenth year that the two of us have come to the Senate \njointly to present and recommend the defense appropriations bills. Six \nof those years Senator Inouye served as chairman, and I have enjoyed \nthat privilege for the past four.\n  It is a pleasure and a privilege to work with the Senator from Hawaii \non defense matters and other matters. I enjoy our personal friendship. \nAnd the opportunity to bring this bill to the Senate on a full \nbipartisan basis is one that I think comes from the tie between us that \nwe enjoy.\n  Mr. President, I yield to Senator Inouye for his statement.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, may I first thank my dear colleague from \nAlaska for his very generous remarks. It has been a pleasure to work \nwith him for the past 10 years. We hope that together we have been able \nto present to the U.S. Senate a bipartisan approach to this very \nimportant subject.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong support of the Department of \nDefense appropriations bill for fiscal year 1999, S. 2132, as reported \nfrom the Committee on Appropriations.\n  This bill contains funding for the Department of Defense for the \nupcoming year, excluding amounts for military construction.\n  The total recommended is $250.5 billion. This is about $840 million \nless than was requested by the administration, but about $2.8 billion \nmore than funded for fiscal year 1998.\n  Within these amounts, the committee has recommended full funding to \nsupport our men and women in uniform.\n  This includes a 3.1-percent pay raise as requested by the President. \nLater today, the chairman will offer an amendment to increase that to \n3.6 percent, the amount authorized by the Senate last month. I strongly \nsupport this amendment.\n  Also at the chairman's initiative, the committee is recommending $50 \nmillion to initiate a new fund for morale, welfare, and recreation.\n  This new appropriation account will support the personnel support \nneeds of our men and women serving on contingency deployments in Bosnia \nand Southwest Asia.\n  Last May, Senator Stevens led a delegation of members from the Armed \nServices and Appropriations Committees to Bosnia and Southwest Asia.\n  It was apparent in our discussions with these units that the \ndeployments for these contingencies were beginning to impair the \nretention of critically skilled individuals and that morale was \nstarting to suffer.\n  The delegation unanimously concluded that we needed to do more to \nsupport our troops serving in these areas.\n  The chairman's initiative will help ease the burden of these long \noverseas deployments and show our men and women in uniform that the \nCongress has not forgotten them.\n  Mr. President, this is a very good bill, which meets the national \nsecurity needs of our Nation, but within the fiscal constraints that \nhave been agreed upon in this balanced budget environment.\n  I should point out to my colleagues that this bill does not provide \nany funding for Bosnia.\n  The President submitted a budget amendment to the Congress requesting \nan appropriation of $1.29 billion in emergency funding to maintain our \ntroops in Bosnia.\n  When the committee marked up this bill, it was unclear what action \nthe Senate would take on Bosnia.\n  It is my hope that this matter will be resolved in conference or \nthrough a supplemental spending measure at a later date.\n  Let me assure my colleagues that the committee will not shirk from \nour responsibility to support funding for our forces assigned overseas, \nno matter where they are located. This matter will be addressed at a \nlater date.\n  Mr. President, I want to close by commending our chairman and his \nstaff for the fine work that they have done in putting this bill \ntogether. As many of you recognize, this is a huge bill. Nearly half of \nour Government's discretionary resources are contained in this one \nappropriations bill.\n  There are an enormous number of programs that must be reviewed and \nrecommended by the chairman and his staff before this measure can be \nreported to the Senate. That task is made more difficult by the \nthousands of requests for billions of dollars that are made by the \nMembers of this body.\n  I want to salute the majority staff which really has done yeoman's \nwork in putting this bill together for the Senate. It is a small staff, \nmany have been with the Appropriations Committee for several years. \nThey transcend the political divisions that sometimes divide this \nSenate. The staff is led by Steve Cortese who has been by the \nchairman's side for the past decade and it includes, Sid Ashworth, Tom \nHawkins, Susan Hogan, Mary Marshall, Mazie Mattson, Gary Reese, John \nYoung, Justin Weddle, and on assignment as a legislative fellow, Ms. \nCarolyn Willis.\n  Mr. President, the Senate owes them a deep debt of gratitude.\n  Under Chairman Stevens' leadership, the resulting bill is a well-\nbalanced product, crafted in a completely bipartisan fashion. It meets \nthe needs of the military services and also fully considers the \npriorities of the Senate and the American taxpayers.\n  This is a good bill. I urge all of my colleagues to support its \npassage.\n  Before ending my presentation, I would like to reflect upon a few \nthings that have just come across my mind in the past few minutes.\n  Chairman Stevens and I are what some of us call dinosaurs of the \nSenate. Admittedly, we are chronologically a bit old. Both of us served \nin World War II, the ancient war. I would like my colleagues to recall \nthat in that war 16 million men and women served--16 million. Today, we \nare calling upon less than 1 percent of our Nation's population--one-\nhalf of 1 percent--to stand\n\n[[Page S9326]]\n\nin harm's way for us, to risk their lives for us. Some have suggested \nthat this is too much spending. As far as I am concerned, if any person \nis willing to stand in harm's way in my behalf, he or she gets the \nbest.\n  There are many programs that have been carried out at the chairman's \ninitiative that he is too humble to even mention. He has been in the \nforefront of medical research, and I am proud to say that, working with \nhim, we have been able to come up with a breast cancer program that is \nbeing acclaimed worldwide--not just nationally. Scientists from all \nover the world come to work with the Army Research Center. It may not \nbe evident to many of my colleagues, but some of the best research \nbeing done on AIDS is being done by the U.S. Army. The same can be said \nfor prostate cancer and other tropical diseases.\n  I began my closing remarks by saying there were 16 million American \nmen and women who served with us in World War II. It was at a time when \nour population was about 100 million. Today, our population is over 250 \nmillion, and we are asking 1.3 million to defend all of us.\n  I concur with my chairman: This is the minimum, this meets the \nminimum needs of our military. If budgetary constraints were not placed \nupon us, I am certain we would come forth with something a bit more \ngenerous. After all, Mr. President, you and I want our children and our \ngrandchildren to go to college, we want to be able to have a car in the \ngarage, three meals a day. That is part of the American way of life. I \nbelieve that men and women in the service should also aspire to the \nAmerican way of life, and I am sorry to say that this measure may not \nprovide all that is necessary, but we are striving for the best.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this measure.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I reciprocate in thanking my good friend \nfor his comments. It is interesting when we reflect back on World War \nII. We as a nation knew who we were, what we were doing, and we had \nunanimous support for what we were doing. Today, each of us faces \ncomments from time to time about our commitment to defense and \nquestions of whether we could not cut this budget. If anything, we \nshould have a great deal more money. I shall speak to the Senate later \nabout that during the consideration of this bill.\n  Let me point out to Members of the Senate that we have knowledge of \n46 amendments on this bill. We have reviewed them with our staff and \nwith the staff of those who will present those amendments, and 23 of \nthem we are prepared to accept. Of the balance, 13 of them we have not \nseen. It would be very helpful if Members will bring their amendments \nto us so that we can look at them and determine whether or not we can \nwork with the person who wishes to present the amendment and accept it \nor modify it in a way that it becomes acceptable. I expect we will have \nsome substantial votes today and into the night. But it will be much \neasier for all of us if we can see these amendments and we can try to \nfind some way to accommodate the needs of the Senate and the demand of \nour defense spending with the individual desires of Members of the \nSenate.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3391\n\n  (Purpose: To provide a 3.6 percent pay raise for military personnel \n                        during Fiscal Year 1999)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I mentioned in my statement that we have \na 3.1 percent pay raise in this bill. I want to send to the desk, and \ndo send to the desk, an amendment. It is sponsored by myself and my \nfriend from Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for himself and Mr. \n     Inouye, proposes an amendment numbered 3391.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 99, in between lines 17 and 18, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 8104(a) On page 34, line 24, strike out all after \n     ``$94,500,000'' down to and including ``1999'' on page 35, \n     line 7.\n       (b) On page 42, line 1, strike out the amount \n     ``$2,000,000,000'', and insert the amount ``$1,775,000,000''.\n       (c) In addition to funds provided under title I of this \n     Act, the following amounts are hereby appropriated: for \n     ``Military Personnel Army'', $58,000,000; for ``Military \n     Personnel Navy'', $43,000,000; for ``Military Personnel, \n     Marine Corps'', $14,000,000; for ``Military Personnel, Air \n     Force'', $44,000,000; for ``Reserve Personnel, Army'', \n     $5,377,000; for ``Reserve Personnel, Navy'', $3,684,000; for \n     ``Reserve Personnel, Marine Corps,'' $1,103,000; for \n     ``Reserve Personnel, Air Force'', $1,000,000; for ``National \n     Guard Personnel, Army'', $9,392,000; and for ``National Guard \n     Personnel, Air Force'', $4,112,000''.\n       (d) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Act, the \n     total amount available in this Act for ``Quality of Life \n     Enhancements, Defense'', real property maintenance is hereby \n     decreased by reducing the total mounts appropriated in the \n     following accounts: ``Operation and Maintenance, Army'', by \n     $58,000,000; ``Operation and Maintenance, Navy'', by \n     $43,000,000; ``Operation and Maintenance, Marine Corps'', by \n     $14,000,000; and ``Operation and Maintenance, Air Force'', by \n     $44,000,000.\n       (e) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Act, the \n     total amount appropriated under the heading ``National Guard \n     and Reserve Equipment'', is hereby reduced by $24,668,000.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment will raise the military \npay to 3.6 percent. This pay raise will add $185 million to the Active \nForces, Guard, and Reserve pay accounts. Over the last year, our \ncommittee has heard repeatedly in both hearings with the service chiefs \nand during field visits to Bosnia, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Alaska, and \nother places throughout the world that our military members perceive an \nerosion of existing benefits. This adjustment in pay matches the \nprivate sector wage growth at a time when many service members are \nquestioning the value of continued service due to an increasing pace of \ndeployments.\n  Some economists estimate that the pay gap between the private sector \nand the military may be as high as 13.5 percent. This amendment will, \nat a minimum, provide a fairer base for military pay raises in the \nfuture.\n  I ask if my friend has any comments to make in regard to this \namendment.

Mr. President, we have tried to be consistent with the \nauthorization bill.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 99, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8104. (a) None of the funds appropriated or otherwise \n     made available under this Act may be obligated or expended \n     for any deployment of forces of the Armed Forces of the \n     United States to Yugoslavia, Albania, or Macedonia unless and \n     until the President, after consultation with the Speaker of \n     the House of Representatives, the Majority Leader of the \n     Senate, the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, \n     and the Minority Leader of the Senate, transmits to Congress \n     a report on the deployment that includes the following:\n       (1) The President's certification that the presence of \n     those forces in each country to which the forces are to be \n     deployed is necessary in the national security interests of \n     the United States.\n       (2) The reasons why the deployment is in the national \n     security interests of the United States.\n       (3) The number of United States military personnel to be \n     deployed to each country.\n       (4) The mission and objectives of forces to be deployed.\n       (5) The expected schedule for accomplishing the objectives \n     of the deployment.\n       (6) The exit strategy for United States forces engaged in \n     the deployment.\n       (7) The costs associated with the deployment and the \n     funding sources for paying those costs.\n       (8) The anticipated effects of the deployment on the \n     morale, retention, and effectiveness of United States forces.\n       (b) Subsection (a) does not apply to a deployment of \n     forces--\n       (1) in accordance with United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 795; or\n       (2) under circumstances determined by the President to be \n     an emergency necessitating immediate deployment of the \n     forces.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, the United States and the rest of the \nWestern European countries are on the verge of a very deep and \nexpensive and very dangerous involvement in yet another area of the \nBalkans, the Serbian province of Kosovo. Unfortunately, and once again, \nit seems to me the administration has yet to explain to the Congress or \nto the American people why it is in our vital--again, I emphasize the \nword ``vital''--national interest to get in the middle of this growing \nconflict.\n  Let me make it clear I think a case can be made that, under certain \ncircumstances, it is in the U.S. national interest to get involved in \nthe conflict in Kosovo. But in my view, it is the responsibility of the \nPresident of the United States and the administration, i.e., the \nnational security team, to explain to the American public and the U.S. \nCongress why such an involvement is in our vital national interest \nbefore our troops are committed.\n\n  The reports on CNN are clear that the Yugoslavian leader, Mr. \nMilosevic, is taking hard and very brutal action against the ethnic \nAlbanians who are living--and, by the way, they comprise, Mr. \nPresident, 90 percent of the total population--in Kosovo. Certainly, \nthis should be of no surprise since this is the same kind of activity \nthat he directed in the breakup of Bosnia.\n  Our diplomatic efforts are active, but they keep changing in purpose \nand intent. The all too frequent U.S. diplomatic technique has been \nemployed. Several lines in the sand have been drawn, with threats of \nsevere reprisals if the Serbian action against the Albanian population \ndoes not cease, but, regretfully, nothing positive to date has come \nfrom our diplomatic initiatives or threats. So these lines in the sand \nare crossed and the fighting has intensified, resulting in increased \nhuman suffering.\n  The Albanian rebels, known as the KLA, are growing in strength and \nthe fighting grows more fierce, with no peaceful solution in sight. The \nUnited States and NATO have threatened military action, and they gave a \nmilitary demonstration consisting of a determined flight involving a \nconsiderable amount of aircraft. They called it ``Determined Falcon.'' \nI am not sure how determined the falcon was. At any rate, neither side \nhas offered to end the conflict. In fact, the KLA is actually buoyed by \nthe apparent Western support for their cause, and therefore they are \nnot interested in backing off now. Mr. Milosevic, having observed our \nunwillingness to carry out our threats when he crossed the lines in the \nsand, and coupled with the strong support of the Serbian people to put \nan end to the rebel uprising in Kosovo, has no reason to back off \neither.\n  We have now started an international monitoring program, Mr. \nPresident, in Kosovo. It is ``aimed at bringing peace to this strife-\ntorn region.'' I don't know of any Senator or anybody or any observer \nwho would object to that. But it is not entirely clear what these \nobservers will accomplish other than to report on the obvious, and that \nis, there is a small war in Kosovo and we have been unable to influence \nits cessation.\n  This observer group is comprised of about 40 diplomats and ``military \nexperts'' attached to the embassies in Belgrade. Our ``military \nexperts'' are unarmed U.S. military forces from the European Command, \nand they are specifically trained for this mission.\n  Here are my concerns: In Kosovo, we are, once again, backing into a \nmilitary commitment, just as we did in Bosnia--and I hate to use this \nexample but I think it is applicable--and in Vietnam. The term of \n``unarmed military observers'' or ``experts'' brings back some pretty \nsad memories of other wars that we have backed into. We are running a \ngreat risk that our military experts or diplomats could be in harm's \nway. As a matter of fact, in terms of hearings yesterday in the \nIntelligence Committee, we were talking about the priorities in regard \nto intelligence assets in certain countries, and force protection, \nobviously, plays a big role in that. So if we have our intelligence \nassets certainly supporting our troops in that part of the world, it \ngives real evidence that this is the case.\n  NATO is conducting contingency planning that could involve thousands \nof military troops to separate the warring factions or impose peace--it \nhas been estimated anywhere from 7,000 to 25,000 troops, even more.\n\n[[Page S9328]]\n\n  The distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, at a \nbriefing when the Secretary of State briefed a bipartisan group of \nSenators on what was happening in regard to India and Pakistan, \nactually warned the Secretary of State and said we do not have the \npersonnel, we do not have the means, we do not have the materiel to \ncommit those kinds of troops, that kind of involvement with regard to \nKosovo, without emergency funding, without certainly stepping up our \nsupport, both in terms of funds and in terms of troops.\n  The costs of involvement in Kosovo, both in dollars and the impact on \nan already-stressed military, are potentially devastating. The chairman \nindicated that in his discussion with the national security team and \nwith the administration.\n  There are many unanswered questions of how this conflict in Kosovo is \nin our vital national interest. I think a good case can be made for our \ninvolvement in Kosovo. I just came back with the distinguished chairman \nof the Senate Intelligence Committee from taking a look at the three \nnew NATO countries, what our intelligence assets are there and what the \nsituation is there. Every official there, every foreign minister, every \npresident indicated that Kosovo was in the interest of NATO and peace \nin Europe. But there are some very serious unanswered questions, and \nthere are unexplained scenarios of the conflict in Kosovo leading to a \nlarger war in Europe if this war is not ended now.\n  But my primary concern is that this whole business has yet to be \naddressed by the administration or, for that matter, to some degree, \nthe Congress in any substantive way. He cannot, nor will Congress let \nhim, commit the men and women of our Armed Forces without defining our \nnational interests, the objectives, and the exit strategy for any \ninvolvement in Kosovo.\n  In the military, Mr. President, there is a term called a warning \norder, which is sort of a heads-up that some action is coming your way \nand, as the commander, you should start planning on how you would \nhandle that action.\n  The amendment I offer today, which is consistent with the amendment \nthat was accepted on a bipartisan basis during the last defense \nappropriations bill in regard to Bosnia, is a kind of a ``warning \norder.'' The intent is to let the administration know that before they \ndecide to deploy the military to the region as a result of the conflict \nin Kosovo, we need to address some salient points before Congress will \nfund the deployment. It is that simple.\n  The Congress and, more importantly, the American people need to \nunderstand at least the following information, and information required \nby the amendment. They are as follows:\n  No. 1, certification that such a deployment is necessary in the \nnational interests of the United States;\n  No. 2, to explain the reasons why the deployment is in the national \nsecurity interests of the United States;\n  No. 3, to define the number of U.S. military forces to be deployed to \neach country;\n  No. 4, to explain the mission and the objectives of the forces to be \ndeployed;\n  No. 5, to discuss the expected schedule for accomplishing the \nobjectives of the deployment;\n  No. 6, what is the exit strategy for U.S. forces engaged in \ndeployment, if that is possible;\n  No. 7, what are the expected costs associated with the deployment and \nthe funding source for paying these costs.\n  I am going to terminate my remarks very quickly, because I know the \ntime schedule here. Let me point out that when Ambassador Gelbard and \nGeneral Wesley Clark appeared before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and reported again on Bosnia and again said that the mission \nhad changed and again said that the objective or the end game could not \nbe defined, I pointed out that it could be in our national interest \nthat we are in Bosnia and that while it was ill-defined, while the \nmission was changed, my main complaint--and I think one of the \ncomplaints shared by the distinguished chairman--is that the \nadministration didn't fund it and the money is coming out of readiness \nand procurement and modernization, and that has to stop.\n  What are the expected costs associated with the deployment and the \nfunding source?\n  What are the anticipated effects of the deployment on the morale, \nretention, and effectiveness of U.S. forces?\n  I think, Mr. President, that Bosnia is the perfect example of why \nsuch a ``warning order'' is necessary. We have expended over $10 \nbillion in Bosnia.\n  We have yet to answer most of the questions contained in this \namendment: Why is it in our national interest to continue to be there? \nHow many troops do we need? How and when do we get out? And how are we \ngoing to pay for it?\n  I am a strong believer, Mr. President, that once the U.S. flag--the \nU.S. credibility--is ``planted,'' that we must support the U.S. \nposition rather than embarrass or put our troops at risk. My intent is \nsimply to go on record now before we get involved in yet another \nentanglement in yet another region of the Balkans--before the flag is \nplanted and the troops are deployed.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I commend Senator Roberts. He is \nfollowing the path that he followed last year. The Senate adopted his \namendment that he presented last year, which has had a salutary effect \non the considerations involved in Bosnia. And we will soon have \nannounced the basic reduction in forces in Bosnia, brought about in \nmany ways because of the study that Senator Roberts' amendment last \nyear mandated.\n  I have reviewed this with my friend from Hawaii. And I note that he \nhas put in even another provision this year that recognizes that there \nmight be an emergency that would be such where the President would not \nhave time to prepare the report that is listed. I think that is very \nwise to offer that flexibility to the administration.\n  I am prepared to accept this amendment. I ask the Senator from Hawaii \nwhat his views would be concerning Senator Roberts' amendment?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I join my chairman in commending our dear \nfriend. Once again, he has taken the initiative and leadership in this \nimportant area. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3393) was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is my understanding that the Senator from Washington \nwishes to speak on a subject that is not related to the bill. I am \npleased to afford my good southern friend that opportunity. I ask him, \nhow much time does he wish?\n  Mr. GORTON. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator have 10 minutes \nfor a statement as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Alaska for the use \nof this time, and I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Texas, \nwho is here with an important amendment, in granting me this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9323-5", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9328-S9329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE PLIGHT OF THE AMERICAN FARMER\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we have heard a large number of words and \nspeeches on this floor, of course, in the last 2 or 3 months on the \nplight of the American farmer. Many called for a return to the policies \nof yesteryear. I am here this morning in contrast to talk about 10 \nimpediments or evidences of indifference on the part of this \nadministration to the farmers and the agricultural communities of the \nState of Washington, the Pacific Northwest, and all of America which \ncan be solved simply by the administration's willingness to care about \nthose Americans who produce our food and fibers.\n  So in the classic way that we give lists of 10, I will start, Mr. \nPresident, with number 10, the Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem \nManagement Program. A bloated attempt begun 4 years ago, to have lasted \n1 year would cost $5 million, which is now approaching $40 million in 4 \nyears, and has antagonized\n\n[[Page S9329]]\n\nall of the private interests in the Interior Columbia Basin, all of the \nMembers of Congress who represent any part of that basin, but the \ncontinuance of which is demanded by the President as the price of \nsigning an appropriations bill for the Department of Interior.\n  I held a field hearing on this subject in Spokane, WA, with unanimous \nor near unanimous opposition to the program as it is being conducted at \nthe present time. Both the bill that I am in charge of managing and the \nbill that has already passed the House of Representatives dramatically \nchanges and minimizes that program.\n  At the behest of this administration, however, a Seattle Congressman \nput up an amendment to restore the program to its present pristine \nsize. Every Member of the House of Representatives representing any \npart of the Columbia Basin voted against that amendment, and yet the \nadministration continues to demand it, with all of the interference of \nprivate agriculture that it entails.\n  No. 9, the Department of Agriculture budget--welfare over farmers. \nTwo-thirds of the Department of Agriculture's budget is earmarked for \nfood and for welfare programs. The essential research conservation and \non-the-ground farmer programs get lost in the shuffle. Only when there \nis a crisis does the Secretary of Agriculture pay any attention to \nthem.\n  For 3 consecutive years, the administration's request for farmer \nprograms have decreased while the amount requested for food and \nnutrition programs has increased. No one disputes the importance of \nthose food and nutrition programs, but we cannot very well feed America \nwithout providing the funding and infrastructure necessary to enhance \nthe production of the most healthy, abundant, safe and inexpensive \ncrops in the world.\n  No. 8, Columbia-Snake River dams. The President's Council on \nEnvironmental Policy of the Department of the Interior had made it \nquite clear that major dam removal is very high on their agenda of \ncourses of action for the Columbia and Snake Rivers. The Columbia Basin \nin eastern Washington, in eastern Oregon, and in Idaho, was literally a \ndust bowl until the introduction of irrigation. Without it, those \nStates would not lead the country in apples, hops, asparagus, and \npotato production.\n  The Columbia Basin is a cornucopia for the Nation's food supply. Dam \ndrawdown or removal would shut down agriculture in the region. In \naddition, of course, those rivers provide the avenues of transportation \nto get those agricultural products to market, a transportation system \nthat would be destroyed by dam removal.\n  No. 7, China trade policy--Washington wheat farmers seem not worth \nhelping by this administration. For more than 20 years, China has \nrefused to import Pacific Northwest wheat because of unfounded, \nnonscientific phytosanitary reasons. They call it ``TCK smut.'' TCK \nsmut has never been detected in Washington wheat. It does exist, \nhowever, in the fields of our wheat-growing counterparts--Canada, \nFrance and Germany; but China imports from all three.\n  The administration seeks a new set of trade relations with China. The \nPresident went to China. The President, in order to keep peace with \nChina, did not so much as mention these trade barriers, ignoring the \nplight of our wheat farmers in the Pacific Northwest. His first \npriority should be to get that barrier lifted.\n  No. 6, repeated efforts to eliminate agricultural research. For the \npast 2 years, the administration has recommended zeroing out all of the \nnational regionally based agriculture research programs. These programs \nconduct research necessary to all food-producing regions of the \ncountry. The administration's insistence on nationalizing these \nprograms is ludicrous. Obviously, cotton research cannot and should not \nbe conducted in eastern Washington; and red delicious apple research is \nnot conducted in Mississippi. These regional programs have bolstered \nour already strained land grant education university programs. They are \nabsolutely essential, and yet the administration would wipe them out.\n  No. 5, no movement on fast-track trade negotiating authority. Fast \ntrack is essential to establishing trade relations with Chile. \nCurrently, the United States exports face an 11-percent tariff in that \ncountry, giving our competitors an 11-percent advantage. Yet, because \nof objections from members of his own party, the President has \nabandoned the cause of fast-track trade authority.\n  No. 4, the agricultural labor shortage--not our problem. The \nadministration does not seem to believe that there is an agriculture \nlabor shortage and is opposed to the Guest Worker Program to address \nthis issue that has already passed the Senate of the United States. In \nthe face of that fact, the General Accounting Office estimates that \nover one-third of our Nation's migrant workforce is illegal. By doing \nnothing, the Clinton administration is making lawbreakers out of law-\nabiding agriculture employers and proposes to do nothing about it.\n  No. 3, sanctions against Pakistan. Sanctions are killing our \nagriculture industries. With more than 40 percent of the world's \npopulation under U.S. sanctions, the American farmer is locked out of \nmany markets. The President instantly imposed sanctions on Pakistan as \na result of its nuclear tests, and only as a result of action by \nCongress have those sanctions or the effect of those sanctions been at \nleast partially removed with respect to Pakistan.\n  No. 2, the Endangered Species Act and private property rights. The \nEndangered Species Act impacts eastern Washington farmers and many \nothers more than any other environmental regulation, and yet the \nadministration, rather than assist in reasonable amendments to the \nEndangered Species Act, insists on ever more rigid enforcement and ever \nmore interference with the ability of our farmers to grow the food and \nfiber that the Nation needs.\n  No. 1, Al Gore. President Clinton has officially tagged the Vice \nPresident as the administration's environmental leader. He is the \npromulgator of most of the policies that I have already discussed and \nhas constructed environmental roadblocks and headaches for farmers from \nWashington State all across the United States to Florida.\n  No one knows the land better than America's hard-working farm \nfamilies. The District of Columbia, the administration, and Al Gore \nshould not be dictating to America's farmers how to till, harvest, \nirrigate, employ, and manage their farms. Al Gore and his \nadministration need to focus on foreign trade and agricultural \nresearch, not on locking up private property and overregulating the \nfamily farm.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Con. Res. \n    28), as agreed to by the Senate, and to offset that increase by \nreducing the amount provided for procurement for the F/A-18E/F aircraft \nprogram to the amount provided by the House of Representatives in H.R. \n            4103, as passed by the House of Representatives)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n\n[[Page S9330]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3397.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 13, line 9, increase the amount by $219,700,000.\n       On page 25, line 25, reduce the amount by $219,700,000.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, my amendment would allow the National \nGuard to almost fully fund its operation and maintenance, or O \naccount, for the coming fiscal year. This year's Defense Department \nbudget request left the National Guard with a $634 million budget \nshortfall, including a $450 million shortfall in the Guard's O \naccount. This request fell on the heals of a $743 million shortfall for \nthe current fiscal year. I think these shortfalls are wrongheaded and \nunacceptable.\n  Fortunately, both Houses of Congress have acted more responsibly in \nfunding the National Guard. Even with the improvements from both \nHouses, though, the Senate appropriations bill we are currently \nconsidering leaves the Guard's operation and maintenance account $225 \nmillion short. The House bill leaves an even greater gap of $317 \nmillion. My amendment would add $220 million to the National Guard's \nO account, leaving just a $5 million shortfall to that account.\n  According to the National Guard, shortfalls in the operation and \nmaintenance account compromise the Guard's readiness levels, \ncapabilities, force structure, and end strength. Failing to fully \nsupport these vital areas will have a direct as well as indirect \neffect. The shortfall puts the Guard's personnel, schools, training, \nfull-time support, and retention and recruitment at risk. Perhaps most \nimportantly, however, I know firsthand that it is eroding the morale of \nour citizen-soldiers, as I have had the opportunity to visit some of \nthe armories in Wisconsin and have heard this concern firsthand.\n  With that in mind, 26 State adjutants general--a majority of the \nadjutants general in this country--have contacted my office to voice \ntheir support for this amendment. The leaders of the National Guard \nunits in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, \nFlorida, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, \nMichigan, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, \nTennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wyoming, and my \nown home State of Wisconsin support my amendment. I would like to thank \nthem for their dedication and support, and I hope we decide to heed \ntheir call for support of the National Guard.\n  Mr. President, in spite of the National Guard's budget concerns, the \nadministration continues to deliver insufficient budget requests given \nthe National Guard's duties; yet, the administration increasingly calls \non the Guard to handle some very wide-ranging tasks. These shortfalls \nhave an increasingly greater effect given the National Guard's \nincreased operations burden. This is as a result of new missions, \nincreased deployments, and training requirements, including the \nmissions in Bosnia, Iraq, Haiti, and Somalia.\n  As I am sure my colleagues know by now, the Army National Guard \nrepresents a full 34 percent of total Army forces, including 55 percent \nof combat divisions and brigades, 46 percent of combat support, and 25 \npercent of combat service support; yet, the Guard only receives 9.5 \npercent of Army funds.\n  To offer a comparison with the other Army components, the National \nGuard receives just 71 percent of requested funding, as opposed to the \nActive Army's 80 percent and Army Reserve's 81 percent. I think it is \ntime we move toward giving the National Guard adequate and equal \nfunding. This amendment almost achieves funding equity for the National \nGuard, and the National Guard is the Nation's only constitutionally \nmandated defense force.\n  Not only have we failed to invest fully in the National Guard, we \nhave failed to invest fully in the best bargain in the Defense \nDepartment. That should not come as a surprise, however. DOD has never \nbeen known as a frugal or practical department--from $436 hammers to \n$640 toilet seats to $2 billion bombers that don't work and the \nDepartment doesn't seem to want to use. The Department of Defense has a \nstoried history of wasting our tax dollars. Here is an opportunity to \nspend defense dollars on something that actually works, that is \nworthwhile, and enjoys broad support on both sides of the aisle.\n  In this regard, the National Guard fits the bill. According to a \nNational Guard study, the average cost to train and equip an active \nduty soldier is $73,000 per year, while it costs only $17,000 per year \nto train and equip a National Guard soldier. The cost of maintaining \nArmy National Guard units is just 23 percent of the cost of maintaining \nactive Army units. It is time for the Pentagon to quit complaining \nabout lack of funding and begin using their money a little more wisely \nand efficiently.\n  Finally, my amendment doesn't terminate any program, nor does it \ncreate unsupported cuts to existing programs. This amendment merely \nfollows the recommendation of the other Chamber.\n  Early this year, the House overwhelmingly supported DOD authorization \nand appropriations bills that provide $2.6 billion to procure 27 Super \nHornet aircraft. I think, and the General Accounting Office thinks, \nthat is actually far too much money for a plane that provides only \nmarginal benefits over the current, reliable Hornet. But it is better \nthan the $2.8 billion for 30 Super Hornets that the bill contains. I \nthink we should follow the prudent lead of our colleagues in the other \nbody on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the House \nNational Security Committee's report on its fiscal year 1999 DOD \nauthorization bill, which specifically addresses the Super Hornet, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               F/A-18E/F\n\n       The budget request contained $2,787.8 million for 30 F/A-\n     18E/F aircraft and $109.4 million for advanced procurement of \n     36 aircraft in fiscal year 2000.\n       Based on the results of the Quadrennial Defense Review \n     (QDR), the committee notes that the Department has reduced \n     the total procurement objective from 1,000 to 548 aircraft \n     and has also reduced procurement in the future years defense \n     program (FYDP) from 248 to 224. The committee notes that the \n     Department plans to request increases of six aircraft per \n     year for each of the next three fiscal years until its \n     maximum production rate of 48 aircraft per year is attained \n     in fiscal year 2002. However, for fiscal year 1999, the \n     requested increase from fiscal year 1998 is 10 aircraft.\n       The committee is also aware that the Department has \n     increased the number of low rate initial production (LRIP) \n     aircraft in fiscal years 1997, 1998 and 1999 from 42, as \n     approved in 1992 by the Defense Acquisition Board (DAB), to \n     its current plan of 62 aircraft. The Department's Selected \n     Acquisition Reports indicate that both its initial plan of 42 \n     LRIP aircraft and its current plan of 62 LRIP aircraft were \n     predicated on a procurement objective of 1,000 aircraft. The \n     committee notes that were the Department to comply with the \n     10 percent LRIP guideline contained in section 2400 of title \n     10, United States Code, 55 LRIP aircraft should be \n     sufficient.\n       During the past year, the committee has followed the \n     Department's challenges in solving an uncommanded rolling \n     motion problem that occurs at altitudes and angles of attack \n     in that portion of the flight envelop where the F/A-18E/F \n     performs air combat maneuvers. The Department's Director of \n     Operational Test and Evaluation recently testified that the \n     most promising solution to this problem--a porous wing \n     fairing--causes unacceptable airframe buffeting and that the \n     final solution to the problem may include other combinations \n     of aerodynamic alternations to the wing surface. According to \n     the Director, the root cause of the problem and modifications \n     to the porous wing fairing are still being investigated, and \n     the wing fairing configuration flown during developmental \n     testing does not incorporate the production representative \n     wing fold mechanism. Additionally, the Director stated that \n     the Department would not have a complete understanding of the \n     impact of the design fix, including uncertainty over air flow \n     effects around the weapons pylons, until the conclusion of \n     operational testing in 1999. Moreover, the Director also \n     noted other concerns with the aircraft such as deficiencies \n     in the performance of its survivability and radar jamming \n     systems.\n       In light of the significantly higher increase in production \n     proposed for fiscal year 1999, the apparent excess number of \n     LRIP aircraft,\n\n[[Page S9331]]\n\n     and the development and testing issues yet to be fully \n     resolved, the committee recommends a reduction of $213.1 \n     million and three aircraft. Of the total $213.1 million \n     reduction, initial spares is reduced by $8.4 million. The \n     committee believes that an increase of seven aircraft from \n     the approved fiscal year 1998 level is appropriate and \n     further believes that a total of 59 LRIP aircraft, \n     approximately 11 percent of the total procurement objective, \n     will meet requirements for operational testing and evaluation \n     and will also be sufficient to meet both initial training \n     requirements and the first operational deployment scheduled \n     for fiscal year 2002.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to quote the chairman of \nthe House Military Procurement Subcommittee, Duncan Hunter. Speaking of \nthe National Security Committee's Super Hornet procurement decision, \nRepresentative Hunter said, ``We think it's a rational, responsible \nreduction, a balanced reduction.''\n  Mr. President, it is time we prioritized this Nation's defense needs. \nThe National Guard provides a wide range of services, from combat in \nforeign lands to support in local weather emergencies, all at a \nfraction of the cost of the Active Army. The National Guard needs and \ndeserves our full support. And it is for that reason that I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I intend to move to table this amendment.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to commend the Senator from \nWisconsin for presenting this amendment. I would have to speak against \nthat.\n  It is true that the budget request submitted by the administration \nfor the National Guard had a shortfall for O activities in the Guard \nin the amount of about $770 million. On our chairman's initiative, we \nplaced an amount of $320 million to make up for part of the shortfall.\n  In addition to that, the administration had zero dollars for \nprocurement of new equipment based upon the philosophy that if the \nregular services, the Regular Army, purchases equipment, some of the \nleftovers may go for the Guard. We did not concur with that. We \nappropriated $500 million for the Guard to get new equipment.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, I believe it should be noted that \nevery service, every component of every service, is faced with \nshortfalls. There is a shortfall in Navy O They would like to have \nmore steaming time. They want their ships to be out there for \nmaneuvers. We can't do that. The Army Tank Corps would like to have \nmore petroleum and gasoline so that the men who drive these tanks may \nget more experience and be ready for combat, if such is necessary. \nArtillerymen would like to have more ammunition for firing range \npractice.\n  Mr. President, we have the sad chore of trying to balance all of the \naccounts and, at the same time, realizing that if this Nation is to \ncontinue being the superpower of this world and thereby deter any \nnation from any mischievous action, we have to provide funds to \nmodernize. The accounts that may be affected by this amendment would \nstop the modernization program.\n  Mr. President, although I agree that the Guard should be receiving \nmuch more, I will have to concur with my chairman's action when he \nmoves to table this.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have had a series of visits with the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff. I particularly recall the discussion I had with \nSecretary of the Navy John Dalton and with Admiral Johnson. There is no \nquestion that the Navy representatives have informed our committee that \nfull F/A-18E/F funding is the administration's top appropriations \npriority for defense and the Navy.\n  This amendment would take these funds from that priority, the F/A-\n18E/F, and move it to the National Guard.\n  We have added, as I stated this morning, $95 million to augment the \nGuard and Reserve personnel accounts.\n  We have added for the Guard and Reserve operation and maintenance \nfunds an additional $225 million.\n  Finally, we added $450 million to the Guard and Reserve procurement \naccount.\n  I have to tell the Senator we have exceeded the requests in many \ninstances. We added almost $1 billion in the zero sum budget for the \nGuard and Reserve priorities.\n  Furthermore, the F/A/-18E/F is just entering production. The \nSenator's amendment will seriously disrupt the production program, and \nsubstantially increase the unit cost, if the Senate approves this \namendment. To me it does not make common sense to increase the cost of \nthe F-18, the Navy's top priority planes which we must buy to meet the \nNavy's previously approved program requirements. We have helped the \nGuard and Reserve. I do not think we should punish the Navy in order to \nhelp them any more.\n  If the Senator wishes to make any comments, I yield to him for those \ncomments.\n  I intend to make a motion to table his amendment. But before I do \nthat, I ask unanimous consent that, on any votes that are laid aside in \norder to join the priority list that is already in existence under the \nGuard and Reserve the common procedure of a minute on each side be the \nprocedure for this bill: That there be 2 minutes equally divided on any \nvote that occurs on this bill on an amendment that is set aside for a \nlater time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me first of all say that the two \nSenators who have spoken in opposition to this amendment are not only \nvery sincere in their support of the National Guard but they have \ndemonstrated in committee a serious concern about increasing funding. \nAnd their efforts have gone a long way to make sure that we have less \nof a shortfall than was originally occurring. That is encouraging. \nHowever, as was admitted by those opposed to this amendment, we still \nhave a $225 million shortfall in the O account at the National Guard. \nThis is a serious shortfall.\n  I am not suggesting that we remove this funding from vital areas, but \nthis is about priorities within the defense budget. I think it is a \npretty easy call. Although I would prefer that we not move forward with \nthe Super Hornet airplane, what I am suggesting here is not a dramatic \nreduction in those planes. I am simply suggesting we take what has \nalready been passed in the House; that is, instead of having 30 of the \nSuper Hornets, we procure 27--3 fewer. For three fewer of these planes, \nwe could fully fund the National Guard O account.\n  This is not an attempt, as the Senator from Alaska, suggested, to \nseriously disrupt the production of the Super Hornet. Very candidly, \nMr. President, I would prefer to do that, because the General \nAccounting Office has pointed out that the Super Hornet is not \nsubstantially better than the current plane. It is going to cost $17 \nbillion more than the current plane. That is a huge amount of money.\n  But that is not what this amendment does. All this amendment does is \nsay let's adopt what the House did, which is have 27 Super Hornets \ninstead of 30, and use the money that is saved to fully fund the \nNational Guard, or virtually fully fund the National Guard O account.\n  Mr. President, these shortfalls for the National Guard are serious. I \nhave had the opportunity to visit armories in Oak Creek, WI, and \nAppleton, WI, and spend a fair amount of time speaking to the officers \nand the guardsmen and guardswomen who are trying so hard to do the job \nthat they are expected to do, constituting 34 percent of our entire \nArmy's sources and resources. They are having morale problems. \nOtherwise, why would 26 adjutant generals in this country write in \nsupport of this amendment? They are very concerned.\n  Mr. President, my amendment is simply about priorities. It is a \nmodest reduction in the number of these Super Hornets that are going to \nbe procured, and in return for something that is far more vital at this \npoint. And that is fully funding the O account for the National \nGuard.\n\n  Mr. President, in light of the fact there will be a motion to table \nat some\n\n[[Page S9332]]\n\npoint, I strongly urge my colleagues to put these modest resources in \nthe National Guard, which supports our Army and which exists in our \ncommunities in every one of our States, rather than three more \nairplanes that, frankly, have not been proven to be substantially \nbetter than the current plane that has done a good job in the Gulf war \nand other situations.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if there is no further debate on this \nmatter, I move to table the Senator's amendment and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I now ask that that amendment be set aside.\n  Is the standing order that all of the votes we ask for the yeas and \nnays on prior to 2 o'clock will be automatically set aside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3398\n\n   (Purpose: To limit the use of funds pending establishment of the \n position of Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Technology Security \n                                Policy)\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if it is in order, I would like to send an \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. KYL. And ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3398.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 99, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8104. (a) None of the funds appropriated by this Act \n     may be obligated or expended for the establishment or \n     operation of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency until the \n     Secretary of Defense takes the following actions:\n       (1) Establishes within the Office of the Under Secretary of \n     Defense for Policy the position of Deputy Under Secretary of \n     Defense for Technology Security Policy and designates that \n     official to serve as the Director of the Defense Security \n     Technology Agency with only the following duties:\n       (A) To develop for the Department of Defense policies and \n     positions regarding the appropriate export control policies \n     and procedures that are necessary to protect the national \n     security interests of the United States.\n       (B) To supervise activities of the Department of Defense \n     relating to export controls.\n       (C) As the Director of the Defense Security Technology \n     Agency--\n       (i) to administer the technology security program of the \n     Department of Defense;\n       (ii) to review, under that program, international transfers \n     of defense-related technology, goods, services, and munitions \n     in order to determine whether such transfers are consistent \n     with United States foreign policy and national security \n     interests and to ensure that such international transfers \n     comply with Department of Defense technology security \n     policies;\n       (iii) to ensure (using automation and other computerized \n     techniques to the maximum extent practicable) that the \n     Department of Defense role in the processing of export \n     license applications is carried out as expeditiously as is \n     practicable consistent with the national security interests \n     of the United States; and\n       (iv) to actively support intelligence and enforcement \n     activities of the Federal Government to restrain the flow of \n     defense-related technology, goods, services, and munitions to \n     potential adversaries.\n       (2) Submits to Congress a written certification that--\n       (A) the Defense Security Technology Agency is to remain a \n     Defense Agency independent of all other Defense Agencies of \n     the Department of Defense and the military departments; and\n       (B) no funds are to be obligated or expended for \n     integrating the Defense Security Technology Agency into \n     another Defense Agency.\n       (b) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Technology \n     Security Policy may report directly to the Secretary of \n     Defense on the matters that are within the duties of the \n     Deputy Under Secretary.\n       (c) Not later than 10 days after the Secretary of Defense \n     establishes the position of Deputy Under Secretary of Defense \n     for Technology Security Policy, the Secretary shall submit to \n     the Committees on Armed Services and on Appropriations of the \n     Senate and the Committees on National Security and on \n     Appropriations of the House of Representatives a report on \n     the establishment of the position. The report shall include \n     the following:\n       (1) A description of any organizational changes that have \n     been made or are to be made within the Department of Defense \n     to satisfy the conditions set forth in subsection (a) and \n     otherwise to implement this section.\n       (2) A description of the role of the Chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff in the export control activities of the \n     Department of Defense after the establishment of the \n     position, together with a discussion of how that role \n     compares to the Chairman's role in those activities before \n     the establishment of the position.\n       (d) Unless specifically authorized and appropriated for \n     such purpose, funds may not be obligated to relocate any \n     office or personnel of the Defense Technology Security \n     Administration to any location that is more than five miles \n     from the Pentagon Reservation (as defined in section 2674(f) \n     of title 10, United States Code).\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I ask of the distinguished chairman \nwhether this would be an appropriate time to discuss briefly the \namendment or whether we should lay it aside and move to other business? \nWhat would be the chairman's pleasure?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I just delivered a copy of the Senator's \namendment to the minority and other committees affected. He is at \nliberty to make such comments he wishes to make, but we will not be \nable to have final consideration of the matter until we have heard back \nfrom Senator Inouye and his people on his side of the aisle. The \nGovernmental Affairs Committee is also considering this issue.\n  Mr. KYL. What I might do then, Mr. President, since we want to handle \nthis in a way agreeable to the chairman, if there is no one else to \npresent an amendment right now, rather than defer business, I will go \nahead and describe the amendment but do it briefly and then, when the \nchairman is ready to proceed with other business, lay it aside and \nhandle it in that fashion, if that is agreeable with the chairman.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Fine.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in that event, let me first ask unanimous \nconsent that two fellows from my office, John Rood and David Stephens, \nbe granted floor privileges for the debate on this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I will describe this amendment briefly.\n  Frankly, this came out of the revelations concerning the alleged \ntransfer of certain technology to the Chinese Government as a part of \nthe process of launching American satellites on Chinese rockets, the \nso-called Loral-Hughes matter. But it really goes beyond that. It is a \nquestion of whether or not the Defense Department has in process an \nadequate way of reviewing the requests for export licensure and the \nconditions attached to those licenses to ensure that national security \nis not jeopardized.\n  That role has in the past been played by an agency of the Defense \nDepartment called the Defense Technology Security Agency. It goes by \nthe name of DTSA for the people who understand it. The point of this \nmemorandum is to ensure that DTSA will continue to have a prominent \nrole in the evaluation of export licenses and the kinds of conditions \nthat would be attached to them.\n  In fact, we ensure as a result of this amendment that the role is \nprominent by restoring the position of the Deputy Under Secretary for \nTechnology Security Policy within the Office of the Under Secretary of \nDefense for Policy, and thereby ensure, as I say, a prominent role for \nthis agency. The Deputy Under Secretary would have access to both the \nUnder Secretary of Policy and the Secretary of Defense himself.\n  This is important, Mr. President, for the following reasons:\n  No. 1, DTSA is the single agency in the Government reviewing the \nnational security implications of an item for export;\n  No. 2, DTSA coordinates input from the services, military branches, \nthe Joint Chiefs and the defense agencies;\n\n[[Page S9333]]\n\n  No. 3, DTSA routinely supports the Department of State in its \ninvestigations of these matters;\n  No. 4, creating a Deputy Secretary of Technology Security will ensure \nthat the Department of Defense is represented at a sufficiently high \nlevel at the interagency meetings that occur to discuss these export \nlicenses.\n  And, finally, providing the Deputy Under Secretary with the authority \nto interact directly with the Secretary of Defense will enable the \nDeputy Secretary to bring items of immediate concern directly to the \nSecretary to discuss with the Secretary of Commerce and the President.\n  The Department of Defense is the only agency with the expertise, the \npersonnel, and the ability to assess the impact of exports on the \nnational security of the United States, and this ought to be our No. 1 \nconcern. The Persian Gulf war demonstrated the value of the United \nStates maintaining a technical edge on the battlefield. Maintaining \nthat edge in the future is dependent upon keeping sensitive \ntechnologies out of the hands of potential adversaries.\n  Questions regarding the appropriate role of the Department of Defense \nin considering exports of dual-use items have obviously been of concern \nfor a number of years. But, as I said, the alleged transfer technology \nto the Chinese Government has really elevated this concern to the point \nthat there are those of us in Congress who want to ensure that the \nDepartment of Defense continues to have an important role here.\n  Early in the 1990s, Congress examined the problems with export \ncontrol and how it was possible that American companies, with the \nknowledge of the Department of Commerce, could have contributed to the \nIraqi arms buildup, as we know occurred. We learned, for example, that \nbetween 1985 and the imposition of the U.N. embargo on Iraq in August \nof 1990, the Department of Commerce approved for sale to Iraq 771 \nexport licenses for dual-use goods. Some of these sales involved \ntechnologies that very probably helped the Iraqis develop ballistic \nmissile, nuclear, and chemical weapons. In some cases, Commerce \napproved the sale over strong objections from Defense or without even \nconsulting the Department of Defense at all.\n  In 1994, the Export Administration Act expired and in 1996 dissolved, \nleaving no overarching legal forum to guide the export control policies \nof the United States. Export controls were at that point directed by \nExecutive order. And this resulted in relaxed control over national-\nsecurity-related equipment and technologies. The GAO has documented \npotential problems with changes that occurred in 1996 and with the \nDepartment of Commerce retaining the primary responsibility for \noversight of important national security equipment or technology.\n  Let me just give a couple of examples here. On September 14, 1994, \nthe Department of Commerce approved an export of machine tools to \nChina. The tools had been used in a plant in Ohio that produced \naircraft and missiles for the U.S. military. Some of the more \nsophisticated machine tools were diverted to a Chinese facility engaged \nin military production, possibly cruise missile production.\n  Under current referral practices, the majority of applications for \nthe export of categories related to stealth are not sent to the \nDepartment of Defense or the Department of State for review. Without \nsuch referrals, it cannot be ensured that export licenses for \nmilitarily significant stealth technology are properly reviewed and \ncontrolled.\n  A third example: Commercial jet engine hot section technology was \ntransferred to the Department of Commerce in 1996. Defense officials \nare concerned about the diffusion of technology and the availability of \nhot section components that could negatively affect the combat \nadvantage of our aircraft and pose a threat to U.S. national security \nconcerns. So the Defense Department must have an active role and a \nstrong position in advising the President about the national security \nimplications of exporting these and other important dual-use \ntechnologies. In order to do this, the Secretary of Defense must have \nthe best advice available. This amendment will ensure that Secretary \nCohen and all subsequent Secretaries have that advice.\n\n  Mr. President, at the appropriate time I hope we can engage in \nfurther discussion of this to ensure that the national security of the \nUnited States is not impaired.\n  At this time, unless there is anyone else who would like to discuss \nit, I am happy to have the chairman or the ranking member move to other \nbusiness.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask this amendment be set aside for \nlater consideration so we may have consultation with other committees \nand Members involved in this subject. We did not have this on our list \nand have not distributed it until just now. I ask unanimous consent it \nbe put aside until other Members have a chance to review it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3397\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we have had a brief debate. The manager of \nthe bill, the chairman of the committee, has moved to table the \nFeingold amendment. I want to add my comments to the debate on that \nissue.\n  This is an amendment which I strongly oppose and I urge my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle to oppose it. This is part of a continuing \ncampaign of harassment against the Navy's No. 1 program, the No. 1 \nprogram of the U.S. Navy. This campaign has had a long, and to date \ntotally unsuccessful, history. We all know the problems in the court \nsystems when individuals flood the courts with frivolous lawsuits. We, \nin providing procurement funds for the Navy, have had a string of what \nI consider to be less than good-faith, responsible amendments directed \nat this program.\n  The amendment before us purports to cut funds from a Navy procurement \nprogram and earmark them for the National Guard operations and \nmaintenance fund. As a long-time and strong supporter of the National \nGuard, I recognize the limited funding the Guard has, and I have worked \nwith my colleagues, the chairman and the ranking member of the Defense \nAppropriations Committee, and the Senator from Kentucky, my cochairman \nof the National Guard caucus, to fund adequately the Guard component of \nthe total force. But I do not believe that pitting one service against \nthe other, raiding the Navy's No. 1 procurement program, is the way to \nfill that funding requirement. No, this amendment is not a step forward \nfor good government. It has been proposed for no other reason than as a \nreckless assault on a program which has successfully cleared every \nproduction hurdle with room to spare.\n  I have been advised by Major General Edward Philbin, Executive \nDirector of the National Guard Association of the U.S., that NGAUS is \nnot supporting this program because, among other things, it would \nsimply create problems between the National Guard and the Navy. This, \nto me, is a very unfortunate step when, as pointed out by the \ndistinguished Senator from Hawaii, all services are facing shortfalls. \nWe have to address the inadequacy in funding for the National Guard and \nall of the other services. But I can tell you that this amendment is \ntotally uncalled for.\n  The F/A-18E/F is the Navy's No. 1 priority procurement program. If \nyou ask the Secretary of the Navy or any of the fleet carrier strike-\nfighter aviators what will enable the Navy to be viable in the 21st \ncentury and beyond, they will tell you it is the Super Hornet. \nYesterday the CNO was in my office with one of the fine young men who \nfly the F/A-18. They reemphasize this is their No. 1 program. They \ncannot afford to take cuts in the program such as proposed on the House \nside, or particularly as proposed in this amendment. I think it is a \nsad day when some Members, for reasons known to themselves, would wish \nto pit the National Guard against the Navy. I think it is irresponsible \nand could lead to services raiding each other's accounts to achieve an \nindividual Senator's political goals.\n  In January of 1997, the Senator from Wisconsin led an effort to \nterminate\n\n[[Page S9334]]\n\nthe F/A-18E/F. He failed. Since then, he has continued what appears to \nbe a vendetta against the program, and now his intent is slowly to \ndrain the money from the aircraft by continuing a plan to reduce the \nnumber of aircraft and the funding available, to make a full-rate \nproduction decision nearly impossible.\n  When you talk with the people in the Navy who know what their needs \nare, who know what the future of naval aviation is, they will insist, \nand they will tell you that this is the airplane that they must have. \nIf we want our men and women in naval aviation to carry out the \nmissions we demand of them, then we have to provide them the modern, \nup-to-date, efficient aircraft, technologically superior, that the E/F \nF-18 gives us.\n  I remember full well several years ago when the distinguished ranking \nmember of this committee, the Senator from Hawaii, said, ``We don't \never want to send American fighting men and women into a battle evenly \nmatched. We want to send them in with the technological superiority, \nthe training, and the capability and resources to make sure they win.''\n  Mr. President, that is what the 18E/F gives us. It gives us that \ntechnological superiority. It gives us the ability to make sure we have \nthe best chance possible of bringing our naval aviators home safely, \nhaving accomplished their mission.\n  The F/A-18E/F has already been scrutinized in the Quadrennial Defense \nReview. It has been scrutinized by the National Defense Panel. It has \nundergone GAO study after GAO study. It has been tested by pilots at \nthe Patuxent River Naval Air Station and the Naval Air Weapons Station, \nChina Lake. It has accumulated 2,749 test flight hours, over 1,800 \nflights, and numerous aircraft carrier landings. It has never had a \ncatastrophic failure. I wish other tactical air programs could meet \nthese standards. It has test fired just about every weapon the Navy \nmight need it to carry. It is on time, it is on budget, and it needs to \nget underway.\n  I ask my colleagues, if they have any question about the value of \nthis plane, ask somebody who flies one. Ask somebody who has had the \nopportunity to fly it. Ask somebody who we are sending in harm's way, \nasking them to fly a fighter and attack aircraft off a carrier, ask \nthem how important they think the F/A-18E/F is to their ability to \ncarry out their mission and to come home safely. If you will ask the \nnaval aviators, whose lives are on the line, I have no question what \ntheir response is going to be. I have heard it myself. Any of my \ncolleagues who wish to contact somebody they know in naval aviation or \nin the Navy itself, I believe they will tell you it is the No. 1 \npriority.\n  Mr. President, this is simply a bad amendment, and I sincerely hope \nthat my colleagues will vote overwhelmingly with the chairman of the \ncommittee and the ranking member to table this unwise amendment. I \nthank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Missouri \nstates that my amendment is a ``reckless assault'' on the Navy's Super \nHornet program. This could not be further from the truth.\n  My amendment to increase funding for the National Guard is simply \nthat; an amendment to correct most of a dangerous shortfall in funding \nfor the National Guard's operations and maintenance account. To raise \nas little controversy as possible in finding an offset to the funding \nincrease, I chose a provision already agreed to by the other chamber. \nNot only did the House agree to funding procurement of 27 Super Hornets \nin FY99, the body authorized funding for the identical amount.\n  In speaking to the reduction, Chairman of the House Military \nProcurement subcommittee, Duncan Hunter said, ``We think it's a \nrational, responsible reduction, a balanced reduction.'' Does this mean \nChairman Hunter is recklessly assaulting the Super Hornet program? Is \nChairman Hunter diminishing the value of the Navy's aviation fleet? Is \nChairman Hunter questioning the value of the Super Hornet? I don't \nthink Chairman Hunter was, or ever will be, accused of any of those \nthings. That's why, Mr. President, it boggles my mind why I now stand \naccused of all those things. It's a plain mischaracterization of my \namendment.\n  This amendment is not about gutting the Super Hornet program. This \namendment is not about pitting one service against another. This \namendment is not about diminishing the Navy's aviation fleet. This \namendment does not question the value of the Super Hornet.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is about an adequate level of funding \nfor the National Guard and priorities in our armed forces. This \namendment is about giving priority to the National Guard's readiness \nlevels, capabilities, force structure, and end strength. This amendment \nis about bringing the Guard's personnel, schools, training, full-time \nsupport, and retention and recruitment to adequate levels. This \namendment, is about ending a slide in the morale of our citizen-\nsoldiers.\n  Finally, my friend from Missouri states that the National Guard \nAssociation of the United States does not support this amendment. I'm \nsure he made his case very forcefully to them. I counter by saying that \nthe association does not oppose this amendment either. In fact, a \nmajority of State Adjutants General, 26 of them so far, have contacted \nmy office to add their names in support for my amendment. I hope my \ncolleagues will draw their own conclusions from that figure. Indeed, I \nurge my colleagues to contact their State Adjutant General and ask them \nfor their opinion of my amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the National Guard, as I do. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote against tabling my amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3124\n\n (Purpose: Relating to human rights in the People's Republic of China)\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3124 which I \nfiled previously.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Hutchinson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3124.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 99, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n\n                                TITLE IX\n\n                         HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA\n\n                 Subtitle A--Forced Abortions in China\n\n       Sec. 9001. This subtitle may be cited as the ``Forced \n     Abortion Condemnation Act''.\n       Sec. 9002. Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Forced abortion was rightly denounced as a crime \n     against humanity by the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal.\n       (2) For over 15 years there have been frequent and credible \n     reports of forced abortion and forced sterilization in \n     connection with the population control policies of the \n     People's Republic of China. These reports indicate the \n     following:\n       (A) Although it is the stated position of the politburo of \n     the Chinese Communist Party that forced abortion and forced \n     sterilization have no role in the population control program, \n     in fact the Communist Chinese Government encourages both \n     forced abortion and forced sterilization through a \n     combination of strictly enforced birth quotas and immunity \n     for local population control officials who engage in \n     coercion. Officials acknowledge that there have been \n     instances of forced abortions and sterilization, and no \n     evidence has been made available to suggest that the \n     perpetrators have been punished.\n       (B) People's Republic of China population control \n     officials, in cooperation with employers and works unit \n     officials, routinely monitor women's menstrual cycles and \n     subject women who conceive without government authorization \n     to extreme psychological pressure, to harsh economic \n     sanctions, including unpayable fines and loss of employment, \n     and often to physical force.\n       (C) Official sanctions for giving birth to unauthorized \n     children include fines in amounts several times larger than \n     the per capita annual incomes of residents of the People's \n     Republic of China. In Fujian, for example, the average fine \n     is estimated to be twice a family's gross annual income. \n     Families which cannot pay the fine may be subject to \n     confiscation and destruction of their homes and personal \n     property.\n       (D) Especially harsh punishments have been inflicted on \n     those whose resistance is motivated by religion. For example, \n     according to a 1995 Amnesty International report, the \n     Catholic inhabitants of 2 villages in Hebei Province were \n     subjected to population control under the slogan ``better to \n     have more graves than one more child''. Enforcement measures \n     included torture, sexual abuse, and the detention of \n     resisters' relatives as hostages.\n       (E) Forced abortions in Communist China often have taken \n     place in the very late stages of pregnancy.\n\n[[Page S9335]]\n\n       (F) Since 1994 forced abortion and sterilization have been \n     used in Communist China not only to regulate the number of \n     children, but also to eliminate those who are regarded as \n     defective in accordance with the official eugenic policy \n     known as the ``Natal and Health Care Law''.\n       Sec. 9003. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     the Secretary of State may not utilize any funds appropriated \n     or otherwise available for the Department of State for fiscal \n     year 1999 to issue any visa to any national of the People's \n     Republic of China, including any official of the Communist \n     Party or the Government of the People's Republic of China and \n     its regional, local, and village authorities (except the head \n     of state, the head of government, and cabinet level \n     ministers) who the Secretary finds, based on credible \n     information, has been involved in the establishment or \n     enforcement of population control policies resulting in a \n     woman being forced to undergo an abortion against her free \n     choice, or resulting in a man or woman being forced to \n     undergo sterilization against his or her free choice.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Attorney General may not utilize any funds appropriated or \n     otherwise available for the Department of Justice for fiscal \n     year 1999 to admit to the United States any national covered \n     by subsection (a).\n       (c) The President may waive the prohibition in subsection \n     (a) or (b) with respect to a national of the People's \n     Republic of China if the President--\n       (1) determines that it is in the national interest of the \n     United States to do so; and\n       (2) provides written notification to Congress containing a \n     justification for the waiver.\n\n                Subtitle B--Freedom on Religion in China\n\n       Sec. 9011. (a) It is the sense of Congress that the \n     President should make freedom of religion one of the major \n     objectives of United States foreign policy with respect to \n     China.\n       (b) As part of this policy, the Department of State should \n     raise in every relevant bilateral and multilateral forum the \n     issue of individuals imprisoned, detained, confined, or \n     otherwise harassed by the Chinese Government on religious \n     grounds.\n       (c) In its communications with the Chinese Government, the \n     Department of State should provide specific names of \n     individuals of concern and request a complete and timely \n     response from the Chinese Government regarding the \n     individuals' whereabouts and condition, the charges against \n     them, and sentence imposed.\n       (d) The goal of these official communications should be the \n     expeditious release of all religious prisoners in China and \n     Tibet and the end of the Chinese Government's policy and \n     practice of harassing and repressing religious believers.\n       Sec. 9012. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     no funds appropriated or otherwise made available for the \n     Department of State for fiscal year 1999 for the United \n     States Information Agency or the United States Agency for \n     International Development may be used for the purpose of \n     providing travel expenses and per diem for the participation \n     in conferences, exchanges, programs, and activities of the \n     following nationals of the People's Republic of China:\n       (1) The head or political secretary of any of the following \n     Chinese Government-created or approved organizations:\n       (A) The Chinese Buddhist Association.\n       (B) The Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association.\n       (C) The National Congress of Catholic Representatives.\n       (D) The Chinese Catholic Bishops' Conference.\n       (E) The Chinese Protestant ``Three Self'' Patriotic \n     Movement.\n       (F) The China Christian Council.\n       (G) The Chinese Taoist Association.\n       (H) The Chinese Islamic Association.\n       (2) Any military or civilian official or employee of the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China who carried out \n     or directed the carrying out of any of the following policies \n     or practices:\n       (A) Formulating, drafting, or implementing repressive \n     religious policies.\n       (B) Imprisoning, detaining, or harassing individuals on \n     religious grounds.\n       (C) Promoting or participating in policies or practices \n     which hinder religious activities or the free expression of \n     religious beliefs.\n       (b)(1) Each Federal agency subject to the prohibition in \n     subsection (a) shall certify in writing to the appropriate \n     congressional committees, on a quarterly basis during fiscal \n     year 1999, that it did not pay, either directly or through a \n     contractor or grantee, for travel expenses or per diem of any \n     national of the People's Republic of China described in \n     subsection (a).\n       (2) Each certification under paragraph (1) shall be \n     supported by the following information:\n       (A) The name of each employee of any agency of the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China whose travel \n     expenses or per diem were paid by funds of the reporting \n     agency of the United States Government.\n       (B) The procedures employed by the reporting agency of the \n     United States Government to ascertain whether each individual \n     under subparagraph (A) did or did not participate in \n     activities described in subsection (a)(2).\n       (C) The reporting agency's basis for concluding that each \n     individual under subparagraph (A) did not participate in such \n     activities.\n       Sec. 9013. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     the Secretary of State may not utilize any funds appropriated \n     or otherwise available for the Department of State for fiscal \n     year 1999 to issue a visa to any national of the People's \n     Republic of China described in section 9012(a)(2) (except the \n     head of state, the head of government, and cabinet level \n     ministers).\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Attorney General may not utilize any funds appropriated or \n     otherwise available for the Department of Justice for fiscal \n     year 1999 to admit to the United States any national covered \n     by subsection (a).\n       (c) The President may waive the prohibition in subsection \n     (a) or (b) with respect to an individual described in such \n     subsection if the President--\n       (1) determines that it is vital to the national interest to \n     do so; and\n       (2) provides written notification to the appropriate \n     congressional committees containing a justification for the \n     waiver.\n       Sec. 9014. In this subtitle, the term ``appropriate \n     congressional committees'' means the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate and the Committee on International \n     Relations of the House of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I turn, I believe, to an issue of \ngreat, great importance to this body and to the Nation. In defending \nhis policy before he left for China, President Clinton said:\n\n       We do not ignore the value of symbols, but in the end, if \n     the choice is between making a symbolic point and making a \n     real difference, I choose to make a difference.\n\n  I say to my colleagues, today we have a chance to make a difference. \nThe President went on and said:\n\n       When it comes to advancing human rights and religious \n     freedom, dealing directly, speaking honestly with the Chinese \n     is clearly the best way to make a difference.\n\n  While in China, President Clinton was allowed to make some tempered \nremarks on human rights abuses in China, though, unfortunately, he was \nquick to equate them with problems in America. He came back from China \nhailing his trip as a success and praising President Jiang and saying--\nI quote again-- ``feeling the breeze of freedom.''\n  Only a week after President Clinton's return from China, China \ndemonstrated the impact of this rhetoric on their attitude and their \npolicies by arresting 10 democracy advocates. There their crime was not \nrape. It was not theft. It was not burglary. It was not grand larceny. \nIt was not fraud. Their crime was that they dared to start a democratic \nopposition party.\n  The Washington Post reported--it is obvious in the headline--on \nSunday, July 12, on the front page, ``Chinese Resume Arrests, 10 \nDetained a Week after Clinton Visit.''\n  Fortunately, five of these activists were subsequently released. But \nwhen the supporters of democracy protested these arrests in an open \nletter to the Communist Government, it was no surprise the Chinese \nGovernment kindly responded by arresting yet another dissident, Xu \nWenli.\n  According to the Associated Press, on July 24, 1998, the Chinese \nGovernment detained four more dissidents, bringing the known number of \ndetained dissidents since the President returned from China to 21. \nTwenty-one dissidents have been detained since July 10, and three \nremain in custody at this moment.\n  On July 29, the Associated Press reported that the Chinese Government \ndetained the democracy activist Wang Youcai for the second time this \nmonth. I will simply say, this is not the ``breeze of freedom,'' but it \nis rather the draft of repression.\n  Some would like to argue that President Clinton's televised comments \nin China were a historic breakthrough in emboldening democracy \nactivists throughout China. Unfortunately, the President's remarks were \nbroadcast in the middle of the day when few Chinese were watching \ntelevision. His remarks were not repeated on the evening news and were \ncompletely omitted from the next day's state-controlled newspapers. I \nremind my colleagues also that Chinese activists already had their \nmomentum, and that momentum was of their own creation from the 1989 \ndemonstrations at Tiananmen Square.\n  We see that President Clinton spoke directly to the Chinese people, \nat least some of them. We see the symbolic point that he made, but what \nwe do not see is that there was any difference made in the policy of \nthe Chinese Government. In fact, their response was one of impudence, \none of, if you will, a reinforcement of their policy of repression, and \nI believe the arrests that the Washington Post and all the major\n\n[[Page S9336]]\n\nmedia in our country spoke of within a week of the President's return \nis testimony to the failure of our policy of appeasement.\n  As this chart is on the floor of the Senate with that headline, \n``Chinese Resume Arrests,'' it stands as, I think, irrefutable evidence \nthat the current policies failed to bring about the desired changes, \nthe changes that we all desire in China.\n  They resumed arrests. A policy of appeasement has never worked, and \nit is not working today. Today, we, as a body, have the opportunity to \nmove beyond rhetoric into real action with the amendment that I have \noffered.\n  The amendment is composed of two parts: one dealing with forced \nabortions and one dealing with religious persecution in China. This \nwill have brought most of the House-passed measures last year--the \nChinese freedom policy measures sponsored by my good friend and \ncolleague, Chris Cox--this will have brought most of those now to a \nvote in the Senate. I am glad to say that my friend, Spence Abraham, \nthe Senator from Michigan, intends to offer the human rights monitors \namendment later on this bill.\n  I am also glad that an amendment that I had filed dealing with \nsatellite technology transfers and moving the authority for that waiver \nprocess back to the State Department and away from the Commerce \nDepartment is, as I speak, being worked out in the State Department \nauthorization conference committee, and I trust and hope that it will \nbe in that conference report when it is presented to the Senate later.\n  I want to provide my colleagues with some background on this \namendment. As many of my colleagues will recall, in November of last \nyear, a number of China-related bills were overwhelmingly passed by the \nHouse of Representatives. This is that package of bills sponsored by \nCongressman Cox, a ``policy for freedom,'' it was called. Since that \ntime, most of these measures have languished in Senate committees \nwithout hearings, without movement and without consideration.\n  On the defense authorization bill, we adopted several of these House \nprovisions that I offered at that time. However, the remainder of those \nwere not passed because my efforts to offer them were thwarted by those \nwho did not desire to have that debate on these China provisions before \nor during the President's trip to China. I simply say the President has \nreturned. This is our opportunity now.\n  My amendment, which I am glad to say is bipartisan and that Senator \nWellstone from Minnesota, who is on the floor--and I welcome his \nremarks in support of this--is cosponsoring this amendment, mirrors the \nlanguage that passed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives \nlast November.\n  The provision on forced abortions--by the way, the Nuremberg Tribunal \non War Crimes condemned forced abortions, rightfully, as being a crime \nagainst humanity. This is not a pro-life, pro-choice issue. Pro-\nchoicers overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives voted for this \nprovision because this is, in fact, a crime against humanity.\n\n  To compel and to force--to use coercion--take a woman in the seventh, \neighth, ninth month of pregnancy and compel her, against her wishes, to \nhave an abortion, that is a crime against humanity. That is why that \nprovision in the House of Representatives passed by a vote of 415-1--\n415-1.\n  The second provision, the ``free the clergy'' portion, of the \namendment passed the House of Representatives last November by a vote \nof 366-54.\n  Now, what does the amendment do? It condemns religious persecution \nand forced abortion in China. The amendment would prohibit the use of \nAmerican funds, appropriated to the Department of State, the USIA or \nAID, to pay for the travel of Communist officials involved in \nrepressing worship or religious persecution.\n  So where there is credible evidence that these officials are engaged \nin these horrendous practices, they would be denied visa approval, they \nwould be denied travel expenses, per diem by the American Government, \nby the American taxpayer. It would deny visas to officials engaged in \nreligious persecution and forced abortion.\n  The amendment would force the Department of State to raise, in every \nbilateral and multilateral forum, the issues of individuals in prison, \ndetained, confined, or otherwise harassed by the Chinese Government on \nreligious grounds. It simply means that we are going to require our \ndiplomats, when engaging in bilateral and multilateral discussions, to \nraise these important issues of religious persecution and forced \nabortions so that that discussion and our concern--the concern of the \nAmerican people--is reflected by our diplomatic corps.\n  This amendment would make freedom of religion one of the major \nobjectives of the United States foreign policy with respect to China.\n  And lastly, concerning religious persecution, this amendment would \ndemand that Chinese Government officials provide the United States \nState Department with the specific names of individuals, the \nindividuals' whereabouts, the condition of those individuals, the \ncharges against them, and the sentence that it imposed against them.\n  So individuals who have been arrested and incarcerated because of \ntheir faith, because of their religious practice, we would demand that \nthe Chinese Government provide information about the condition, the \nwhereabouts of those individuals and how long the sentence was. The \nsame would be applied to those engaged in forced abortions.\n  Mr. President, since the founding of the People's Republic of China \nalmost 50 years ago, the Government has savaged and persecuted \nreligious believers and subjected religious groups in China to \ncomprehensive control by the state and the Chinese Communist Party.\n  The head of the state's Religious Affairs Bureau said in 1996--and I \nquote the head of the Religious Affairs Bureau in China--``Our aim is \nnot registration for its own sake, but control.'' Let me say that \nagain. He said, ``Our aim is not just registration, but control over \nplaces for religious activities as well as over all religious \nactivities themselves.''\n  When people say there is religious freedom in China, that they only \nrequire registration, please realize, the purpose of that registration \nis to control religious activities in China, an effort that they have \nbeen quite successful at. So religious organizations today in China are \nrequired to promote socialism and ``patriotism'' while the massive \nstate party propaganda apparatus vigorously attempts to promote atheism \nand combat what they call ``superstition.''\n  Mr. President, the Chinese Government, the Communist Party, have in \nrecent years intensified efforts to expel religious believers from the \nGovernment, the military, and the party, ordering a nationwide purge of \nbelievers in January of 1995.\n  I am very concerned about the mounting campaign of religious \npersecution being waged by the rulers of China. I believe this \namendment is the least that we can do. Many of my colleagues have said \nthat using trade policy is the wrong instrument in dealing with the \nrepressive practices of the Chinese Government. I understand. In fact, \nI am sympathetic to that argument.\n  I never thought that most-favored-nation status was the best tool \nthat we had, and yet when we come with a proposal like this, one that I \nhave visited with Senator Wellstone about, and many of my colleagues \nabout, when we come with one that denies visas and denies travel and \nper diem for those involved in these terrible practices, then I hear \npeople saying that is the wrong tool to use, we should not use visas. \nThis is the very least that we can do. If we are not willing to deal \nwith the $60 billion trade deficit that we give China--trade imbalance \nthat we have with that country--then the least we can do is come back \non this issue of visas, travel expenses, and raising the issue in our \ndiplomacy and diplomatic efforts with the Chinese Government and make \nthis something more than mere rhetoric.\n  I believe that these amendments are modest, that they are temperate, \nthat they are well thought out. They have been repeatedly debated, not \nonly in the House of Representatives but on the floor of the Senate as \nwell.\n  I will ask my colleagues to support the amendments and to oppose any \neffort to table these amendments. I believe that there is clear \nevidence not only of religious persecution among Evangelical believers, \namong Roman\n\n[[Page S9337]]\n\nCatholic believers, but most obviously among Buddhist believers and the \nfollowers of the Dalai Lama. The repression ranges from ransacking \nhomes in Tibet in search of banned pictures of the Dalai Lama to the \nclosing and destroying of over 18,000 Buddhist shrines last spring. So \nthe repression is real. And religious faith of all persuasions is in \nrevival in China, but it is in revival in the face of intense \npersecution by the Chinese Government.\n  I will only briefly speak of the practice of forced abortions that \nare going on in China today. I believe that this is a practice that is \nindefensible by any civilized human being. In their effort and attempt \nto reach a 1 percent annual population growth, the Chinese authorities, \nin 1979, issued regulations that provided monetary bonuses and other \nbenefits, as incentives, and economic penalties for those who would \nhave in excess of one child.\n  They subject families in China to rigorous pressure to end \npregnancies and to undergo sterilizations. And while the Communist \nChinese Government today says that coercion is not an approved policy, \nthey admit that it goes on. They have not provided our State Department \nany evidence that they are punishing the perpetrators of that terrible \npractice of coerced abortions and forced sterilizations in China today.\n  Even more tragic is their effort to eliminate those they regard as \n``defective.'' China's eugenics policy, the so-called natal and health \ncare law, requires couples at risk of transmitting disabling congenital \ndefects to their children to undergo sterilization.\n  So the practices continue in China; the abuses continue in China. \nThis amendment is the very least that we can do in clear conscience. I \nhave faith that my colleagues are going to support this amendment. I \nthink it is something that is so essential that we do. This practice of \ncoerced abortions--and, may I add, the practice of persecuting \nbelievers, religious believers --is morally reprehensible and \nindefensible.\n  It is clear, as well, that the desired changes that the policy of so-\ncalled constructive engagement has sought has failed.\n  I once again point to this headline in the Washington Post, which \nwas, in various forms, the front page story all across this country \nthis month: ``Chinese Resume Arrests''--that in the wake of our \nPresident's visit to China.\n  So please look at the temperate tone of these amendments. Realize \nthat the substance is simply denying visas, travel expenses, if you \nwill, American-taxpayer-subsidized travel, in recognition of those who \nthe State Department, the Secretary of State, has credible evidence \nindicating that they are involved in these inhumane practices.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment when we vote this \nafternoon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, let me say that I am very \nproud to join with my colleague, Senator Hutchinson from Arkansas, in \noffering this amendment. Let me say, second of all, that while we do \nnot agree on all issues--that may be the understatement of the year--we \ndo have a common bond in our very strongly held views and, I think, \npassion when it comes to human freedom in our country and other \ncountries and respect for human rights.\n  At the beginning, I would like to just start out by doing two other \nthings before speaking right to the amendment.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Linn Schulte-Sasse, who \nis an intern with our office, be allowed to be on the floor during the \ndebate on this appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I think my colleague from Arkansas will agree with me, \nit would be important, given this topic, given this debate, given this \ndiscussion, to mention Aung San Suu Kyi from Burma, a woman who just \nwanted to go to a meeting. That repressive junta Government would not \nlet her do so. She spent 5 days in her car, refusing to leave, before \nshe could go to this meeting. She never could get to the meeting. Now \nshe is back safely at home. It reminds us, again, of the repression of \nthis regime.\n  I hope that these junta leaders understand that all of us in the \nSenate, Democrats and Republicans alike, abhor their actions. From my \npoint of view, we can't do enough as a country to isolate that \nrepressive Government.\n  The core value that brings my colleague from Arkansas and the Senator \nfrom Minnesota together here today is freedom in human rights. I think \nthat there is no better way to speak to this than to examine our \nrelationship with the Government and 1.2 billion people in China.\n  I am concerned that the administration's ``carrots only'' policy has \nnot worked well enough when it comes to accomplishing this goal of \npromoting freedom in human rights. I believe that the limited steps \nthat the Chinese Government has taken to lessen political persecution \nor religious persecution has been when there has been American \npressure. These included the prospect of a human rights resolution on \nChina at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in Geneva and the debate \nover annual MFN renewal. All of this has been important in \ncommunicating a strong statement to this Government that they are under \nour watchful eye, and that we speak out against persecution against \npeople because of the practice of their religion or of their basic \npolitical viewpoint.\n  I had reservations, I have reservations about the June summit between \nthe President and President Jiang Zemin. I had hoped that there would \nbe concrete results. I always believed it would have been better if the \nPresident had laid out clear human rights preconditions before visiting \nChina. Having said that, I was still very hopeful that this visit would \nmake a difference. I applauded the President speaking out while in \nChina. But always the question was, what next? Will China now take \nrealistic but meaningful steps, such as opening up Tibet to human \nrights monitors and foreign journalists? Will China release political \nprisoners? Will they put safeguards in place for the right of free \nassociation of workers, beginning a process of abolishing the arbitrary \nsystem of reduction through labor? Will they lift their official \nblacklist of prodemocracy activists now abroad who can't return to \nChina?\n  I fear that what we have seen so far by way of agreements announced \nin Beijing are merely symbolic in nature. On Tuesday, Secretary \nAlbright reported that Chinese dissidents are continuing to be rounded \nup. For example, last Wednesday the police arrested Zhang Shanguang, a \nprominent dissident, who had already spent 7 years in jail. What did he \ndo? What was his crime? He tried to organize laid off workers. Also \nlast week, a Chinese court sentenced another dissident to 3 years in \nprison for helping a fellow activist to escape from China.\n  Mr. President, I am all for having good relations with the \nGovernment. I am all for making sure that we have economic cooperation. \nI understand the market that is there. But I join with my colleague, \nSenator Hutchinson, in introducing this amendment, to say that whatever \nwe do by way of our relations with China, we ought not to sacrifice a \nbasic principle that we hold dear as a country, which is a respect for \nhuman rights and for human freedom of peoples.\n  This amendment started out to do three things. One will be taken care \nof in an amendment by my colleague, Senator Abraham, which will \nincrease the number of U.N. diplomats at the Bejing Embassy assigned to \nmonitor human rights and add at least one human rights monitor to each \nU.S. consulate in this vast country. That is an important amendment. I \nhope my colleagues will support it.\n  The second point I want to make is that our amendment is divided into \ntwo parts. First, our amendment will demonstrate our commitment to \nreligious freedom by banning travel to the United States by any Chinese \nofficial who has engaged in religious persecution. While membership in \nreligious groups is increasing explosively in China, the Government \ncontinues to prosecute, continues to persecute, Muslim Uighurs, Tibetan \nBuddhists and Christians.\n  While harsh prison sentences and violence against religious activists \nstill occur, state control increasingly takes the form of a \nregistration process. This\n\n[[Page S9338]]\n\nis the way the Government monitors the membership in religious \norganizations.\n  According to the State Department's reports, Chinese officials have \nconducted a special campaign against all unauthorized religious \nactivities by Christians. This included police detaining people, \nbeating, and fining members of the underground Catholic Church in \nJiangxi Province, and raiding the homes of bishops. That is what is \nhappening in this country.\n  The Government has also carried out a major purge of local officials \nin certain heavily Muslim populated areas, and targeted again \n``underground'' Muslim activities. The Government has banned the \nconstruction or renovation of 130 mosques, and arrested scores of \nMuslim dissidents.\n  In Tibet, human rights conditions remain grim, and have gotten worse \nthis past year. Tibetan religious activists face ``disappearance,'' or \nincommunicado detention, long prison sentences, and brutal treatment in \ncustody.\n  Finally, this amendment, second part, demonstrates the abhorrence of \nthe United States over the practice of forced abortion and \nsterilization. It targets officials involved in forcing Chinese women \nto undergo abortions and sterilization and bans their travel to the \nUnited States of America. Chinese population control officials, working \nwith employers and work unit officials, routinely monitor women's \nmenstrual cycles. They subject women who conceive without Government \nauthorization to extreme psychological pressure, to harsh economic \nsanctions, including unpayable fines--in one province, twice a family's \ngross annual income--to loss of employment, and in some cases to the \nuse of physical force.\n  Some people argue that we cannot influence China, that the country is \ntoo large, too proud, and that change takes too long. I disagree. \nReligious prosecution, religious persecution, forced sterilization, \nforced abortion, people trying to speak out on behalf of their own \nhuman rights, all of these citizens have thanked us for speaking out; \nall of the human rights advocates have thanked us for helping to keep \nthem alive by focusing attention on their plight and for fighting for \nreforms.\n  We cannot give up. We must continue to pressure China on these urgent \nmatters. I urge my colleagues to vote for this very reasonable \namendment, and I think Senator Hutchinson sends a very compelling and \nvery powerful message, not only to the Government that we will not in \nany way, shape, or form stand by idly and be silent about this kind of \nrepression, but also to the people in China, the citizens, that we \nsupport their efforts on behalf of human rights, on behalf of their \nright to be able to practice their own religion, on behalf of their \nright to be free from forced abortion and forced sterilization.\n\n  Colleagues, please give this amendment your overwhelming support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I realize that standing and speaking in \nopposition would be condemned by some of my colleagues and my \nconstituents. I also realize that my chairman will rise to table this \namendment at the appropriate time. But I believe that something has to \nbe said as to why some of us oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. President, we are blessed to be able to live in a great country. \nWe just celebrated the 222nd anniversary of our birth. We have had a \nvery illustrious and a glorious history. Yet, there are many chapters \nin our history that we would prefer not to discuss; we would prefer to \njust pass them over. The countries that we are speaking up against in \nSoutheast Asia and Asia do not have a 222-year history. Yes, they may \nhave been in existence for 4,000 or 5,000 years, but keep in mind that \nmost of these countries have been under the yoke of some European power \nuntil just recently. Indonesia, until the end of World War II, was \nunder the control, and therefore a colony of, Holland. China has been \ncontrolled by various countries. The Japanese have been there; the \nBritish have been there; the French, the Russians--and Americans. North \nKorea had been under the control of the Japanese up until World War II. \nThe Philippines was our colony until the end of the war.\n  Our country is blessed with resources--all of the minerals that we \nneed, all of the chemicals we need to make us the No. 1 high-tech \ncountry in the world, the most powerful military country in the world. \nThese other countries are still struggling. I don't think we can expect \nthese nations who are going through the evolutionary stage of just 50 \nyears, as compared to our 222 years--we cannot impose and demand that \nour will be carried out.\n  We should remind ourselves that we, the people of the United States, \nand the Supreme Court of the United States have said that slavery was \nconstitutional. That wasn't too long ago. And there are many fellow \nAmericans who are still showing the effects of slavery to this day. \nWell, we pride ourselves on human rights, but hardly a day goes by when \nwe don't see statistics that may not be the happiest. For example, I am \nvice chairman now of the Indian Affairs Committee. The things we are \nconfronted with on a daily basis in this committee are sickening. For \nexample, the unemployment rate in the Nation is less than 5 percent. \nThe unemployment rate in Indian reservations today is over 50 percent. \nIn some reservations, it is as high as 92 percent. Yes, there are \nreservations that are doing well--doing very, very well. But most of \nthe 550 tribes are not doing well.\n  When you look at health statistics, they are worse than Third World \ncountries. They are worse in cancer, worse in respiratory diseases, \nworse in diabetes. And this happens in these United States. And if some \nother country should condemn us for this, we would stand up as one and \nsay: It is none of your damn business.\n  Well, Mr. President, the question before us is, Do we contain and do \nwe isolate China--a nation with a population of over one-fourth of the \nworld's population? They have problems, as much as we have problems. \nThe question is, Do we ignore them, realizing that they may someday \nacquire all the technology that they need to become a terrible world \npower? Or do we try to engage them and, hopefully, by practice and by \nmodel, convince them that our system is the best?\n  We seem to have done pretty well in doing this with the Soviet Union. \nWe are told that the cold war is over now, that the power the Soviet \nUnion had once upon a time is no more. Why? Because we had a policy of \nengagement. We continue to talk to them. We continue to exchange views. \nYes, we propagandize them and they propagandize us. But because of our \nattitude, because of our resources, we have prevailed. I think the same \ncan happen elsewhere.\n  Yes, we are dealing with countries that have a short contemporary \nhistory--Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos. These were European colonies. If one \nlooks at the history of these colonies, the treatment was just as bad \nas the colonies in Africa. And now to suddenly say, ``Now that you have \nfreedom, we expect you to behave like Americans,'' I think is asking \ntoo much, Mr. President.\n  We speak of human rights. We will conclude this year the final \npayment of redress to Japanese Americans who were put in camps. Mr. \nPresident, I certainly recall that soon after December 7--on February \n19, 1942--an Executive order was issued declaring that Japanese \nAmericans were not to be trusted. Therefore, they had to be rounded up, \nwith 48 hours' notice, and placed in 10 camps throughout the United \nStates--no due process. No crimes were committed. Studies were made, \ninvestigations done, and there was not a single case of sabotage, not a \nsingle case of un-American activity. In fact, men volunteered from \nthese camps to form a regiment, which I was honored to serve in, and we \nbecame the most decorated Army unit in the history of the Army. The \nUnited States is finally going to close that chapter.\n  But these things have happened to us. As a personal matter, I \nresented that when, on March 17, 1942, my Government said I was to be \ndeclared 4C.\n  In case people are not aware of what 4C is about, 1A is the Draft \nBoard's declaration that you are physically fit, mentally alert. \nTherefore, you are qualified to put on the uniform of the United \nStates; 4F, something is wrong with you, physically or mentally; 4C is \na special designation for enemy alien. That was my designation.\n  So when one speaks of the history of the United States, there are \nchapters\n\n[[Page S9339]]\n\nthat we don't wish to look at, because, if we start looking back to \nthese chapters, you will find that we have gone through this painful \nevolution.\n  So I am telling my colleagues that this is not a simple amendment. It \nis an amendment that requires deep thought on our part. I hope that we \nleave it up to those who we rely upon in our State Department to do the \nbest. We can always watch what is going on. Yes, they have forced \nabortion. I am against that. I am against religious persecution. We try \nto convince ourselves that there is no religious persecution in the \nUnited States. But I am certain we know that there is.\n  Mr. President, I will be voting to table this amendment.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The distinguished Senator from \nArkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, it is with some reluctance that I \nrespond to the comments, because I have such utmost respect for the \nSenator from Hawaii and his distinguished career, and all that he \nrepresents.\n  But I just want to clarify the perspective of the authors of this \namendment. The issue is not imposing American values. Frankly, we don't \nand we can't impose anything on another nation. But what we can say is \nthat the values are important.\n  I think it is terribly wrong to try to make a moral equivalency \nargument and say that examples of religious persecution that may exist \nin the United States can in any stretch of the imagination be compared \nto the wholesale religious oppression that exists in China today.\n  We simply don't have headlines in the Washington Post saying that \nthere were ``10 detained in Arkansas'' because of their religious \nbeliefs. We don't have that in this country, and we shouldn't. If we \ndid there would be an outrage, and if we did we should be condemned by \nother nations in the world.\n  So the issue is not imposing American values. The issue is whether or \nnot we as a body and we as a nation want to reflect certain fundamental \nbeliefs and fundamental rights.\n  I add that these are not American values that we speak of. These are \nnot American values that this amendment is addressing. These are human \nvalues. They are basic human rights.\n  It was not the U.S. Supreme Court that I quoted in condemnation of \nforced abortion. It was the Nuremberg War Tribunal that said forced \nabortion is a crime against humanity.\n  These are human values. We cannot excuse a nation by saying they are \nnew at this thing of freedom. No. In fact, it is not that the communist \nrulers of China don't understand freedom. It is that they understand \nfreedom all too well, and they are determined to repress it.\n  The issue in China is control, and the Chinese Communist Government \nis determined to use whatever means necessary and whatever means at \ntheir disposal to insure that they maintain control, even to the point \nof persecuting those who might say there is a power above and beyond \nthe power of the Chinese Government.\n  I say to my distinguished colleague from Hawaii that the issue is not \nisolation. It is certainly not isolation. There is no way that we \ncould, even if we wished to, isolate the largest, most populist nation \nin the world.\n  It is, though, whether we as a country and we as a people are going \nto stand for something other than profits.\n  That is what this amendment is about. That is why I believe, I have \nfaith, that my colleagues in the Senate will support an amendment that \nreally reflects the best not only of American values but human values.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will take 2 minutes, because I know \nmy colleague wants to move forward.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Hawaii is the best of the best \nSenators. I don't like to be in disagreement with him. I am certainly \nnot in disagreement with his analysis about our own history. There is \nnobody who can speak with more eloquence and more integrity about \ninjustices in our country toward minorities and violations of people's \nhuman rights than the Senator from Hawaii. There is no question about \nit.\n  But I also believe, as my colleague from Arkansas has ably pointed \nout, that it is also important for other countries, and it would have \nbeen an important relation for our country to speak out.\n  When I think about South Africa, I think about what President Mandela \nsaid. One of the things he said over and over again, was when the \npeople in the United States took action, it was when we put the \npressure--not just symbolic politics--that things began to break open, \nand finally we were able to end the awful system of subjugation of \npeople because of the color of their skin.\n  When I think even about our relations with the former Soviet Union, \nwe were tough on these human rights violations.\n  I really believe that this amendment is just a very modest beginning \nwhich says, look, when you have people who are directly guilty of \nreligious persecution, and when you have people who are directly guilty \nof forced sterilization, forced abortion--and we even had waivers for \nthe Presidents. But what we are saying is then let's take this into \naccount. They ought not to be given travel visas to our country.\n  This is moderate, I say to my colleagues. This is but a step forward. \nBut it sends such a powerful and important message about what our \nvalues are all about, what we are about as a nation. And it supports \nthe people in China. This really is an important amendment. I hope that \nour colleagues will vote for it and will give it overwhelming support.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, before I respond, I again would like to \nrequest Senators to come forward, and let us see their amendments.\n  Earlier today I said of the 46--it is now 47 amendments that we know \nof--that we had agreed to accept 23 of them.\n  My staff informs me that the difficulty is we can't accept them \nbecause we haven't seen the final version of them. We hope that those \nwill be produced here so we can dispose of the amendments that we are \nwilling to accept expeditiously with very short comments from Members.\n  We are going to have over 50 amendments. We are going to finish this \nbill by tomorrow. I advise Members and staff to start bringing in cots \nfor people to rest on tonight unless we get through them very quickly.\n\n  Mr. President, I have to confess to my friends, both of them who have \nspoken in favor of this amendment, that this Senator is at a loss to \nunderstand section 9012, which says that no funds can be used to pay \nthe travel expenses and per diem for the participation in conferences, \nexchanges, programs, et cetera, of any national from the People's \nRepublic of China who is the head or political secretary of any Chinese \nGovernment-created or approved organization. And it lists the Chinese \nBuddhist Association, the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association, the \nNational Congress of Catholic Representatives, the Chinese Catholic \nBishops' Conference, the Chinese Protestant Three-Self Patriotic \nMovement, the China Christian Council, the Chinese Taoist Association, \nthe Chinese Islamic Association, and then a series of civilian and \nmilitary officials and employees of Government to carry out the \nspecific policies that are listed, such as promoting or participating \nin policies or practices which hinder religious activities, or the free \nexpression of religious beliefs.\n  I am at a loss to understand that section. Perhaps the Senator would \nexplain that to me.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. The officials that are listed of the various \nreligious organizations that the Senator listed in the amendment are, \nin fact, Government employees, and Government agents.\n  They are those at the head of these associations. These are the \nregistered churches that are used as tools and the agents of the \nChinese Communist Government in the repression of those various groups. \nIt does not refer to the pastors, the ministers, the priests of local \ncongregations, but the heads of these associations which, in fact, work \nfor the Communist Chinese Government and are those that are \nperpetrating the very persecution against those groups.\n\n[[Page S9340]]\n\n  So while there are millions of Chinese today underground in \nunregistered churches, mosques, synagogues and temples, there is also \nthe so-called Patriotic Church, the recognized church by the Government \nwhich is strictly controlled, names, addresses of worshipers to be \nturned into the Government. Messages that are proclaimed are closely \ncensored by the Government. That is why those officials would be \nincluded if, in fact, the Secretary of State found credible evidence \nthat they were practicing perpetrating religious persecution.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am sad to say to my friend I don't understand that \nsection to have that limitation, but, in any event, it is a very \ncontroversial subject to be added to the Defense appropriations bill. \nIn conferring with Members yesterday, it was the position that we took \nat the time that we were going to do our utmost to keep controversial \nsubjects that would lead to extended debate off of this bill. The only \nway to do that is, once we have had a short explanation of it in \ncourtesy to the presenting Senator, it was going to be my intention to \nmove to table any such amendment, not just this one but any such \namendment.\n  Therefore, on the basis of the policy that we have announced, I move \nto table the Senator's amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is set aside and the vote will \noccur after 2 p.m. today.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at the request of \nSenator Thomas that a letter signed by himself and Senator Murkowski, \nSenator Biden, Senator Kerry, Senator Smith of Oregon, Senator Hagel, \nSenator Grams, Senator Feinstein, Senator Robb, and Senator Lieberman, \nand an excerpt from Newsweek be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 1998.\n       Dear Colleague: When the Senate returns to consideration of \n     the DOD Authorization bill, S. 2057, we expect a series of \n     amendments to be offered concerning the People's Republic of \n     China. These amendments, if accepted, would do serious damage \n     to our bilateral relationship and halt a decade of U.S. \n     efforts to encourage greater Chinese adherence to \n     international norms in such areas as nonproliferation, human \n     rights, and trade.\n       In relative terms, in the last year China has shown \n     improvement in several areas which the U.S. has specifically \n     indicated are important to us. Relations with Taiwan have \n     stabilized, several prominent dissents have been released \n     from prison, enforcement of or agreements on intellectual \n     property rights have been stepped up, the revision of Hong \n     Kong has gone smoothly, and China's agreement not to devalue \n     its currency helped stabilize Asia's economic crisis.\n       Has this been enough change? Clearly not. But the question \n     is: how do we best encourage more change in China? Do we do \n     so by isolating one fourth of the world's population, by \n     denying visas to most members of its government, by denying \n     it access to any international concessional loans, and by \n     backing it into a corner and declaring it a pariah as these \n     amendments would do?\n       Or, rather, is the better course to engage China, to expand \n     dialogue, to invite China to live up to its aspirations as a \n     world power, to expose the country to the norms of democracy \n     and human rights and thereby draw it further into the family \n     of nations?\n       We are all for human rights; there's no dispute about that. \n     But the question is, how do be best achieve human rights? We \n     think it's through engagement.\n       We urge you to look beyond the artfully-crafted titles of \n     these amendments to their actual content and effect. One \n     would require that the United States to oppose the provision \n     of any international concessional loan to China, its \n     citizens, or businesses, even if the loan were to be used in \n     a manner which would promote democracy or human rights. This \n     same amendment would require every U.S. national involved in \n     conducting any significant business in China to register with \n     the Commerce Department and to agree to abide by a set of \n     government-imposed ``business principles'' mandated in the \n     amendment. On the eve of President Clinton's trip to China, \n     the raft of radical China-related amendments threatens to \n     undermine our relationship just when it is most crucial to \n     advance vital U.S. interests.\n       Several of the amendments contain provisions which are \n     sufficiently vague so as to effectively bar the grant of any \n     entrance visa to the United States to every member of the \n     Chinese government. Those provisions not only countervene \n     many of our international treaty commitments, but are \n     completely at odds with one of the amendments which would \n     prohibit the United States from funding the participation of \n     a great proportion of Chinese officials in any State \n     Department, USIA, or USAID conference, exchange program, or \n     activity; and with another amendment which urges agencies of \n     the U.S. Government to increase programs between the two \n     countries.\n       Finally, many of the amendments are drawn from bills which \n     have yet to be considered by the committee of jurisdiction, \n     the Foreign Relations Committee. That committee will review \n     the bills at a June 18 hearing, and they are scheduled to be \n     marked-up in committee on June 23. Legislation such as this \n     that would have such a profound effect on US-China relations \n     warrant careful committee consideration. They should not be \n     subject of an attempt to circumvent the committee process.\n       In the short twenty years since we first officially engaged \n     China, that country has opened up to the outside world, \n     rejected Maoism, initiated extensive market reforms, \n     witnessed a growing grass-roots movement towards increased \n     democratization, agreed to be bound by major international \n     nonproliferation and human rights agreements, and is on the \n     verge of dismantling its state-run enterprises. We can \n     continue to nurture that transformation through further \n     engagement, or we can capitualte to the voices of isolation \n     and containment that these amendments represent and negate \n     all the advances made so far.\n       We hope that you will agree with us and choose engagement. \n     We strongly urge you to vote against these amendments.\n           Sincerely,\n         Craig Thomas, Chairman, Subcommittee on East Asian and \n           Pacific Affairs, Committee on Foreign Relations; Frank \n           H.

I spent seven years in prison in China for my \n     activities on Tiananmen Square in 1989, so I certainly share \n     the view that the Chinese government must change its ways. \n     But I also think the American president can accomplish some \n     positive things with his trip.\n       It's critically important to have a broad range of contacts \n     with China. The West should not try to isolate the communist \n     regime or limit contact to political exchange. Washington \n     needs to maintain dialogue on many fronts at once: economic, \n     cultural, academic, anything that helps build civil society. \n     The key to democracy in China is independence. My country \n     needs independent intellectuals, independent economic actors, \n     independent spirits.\n       Economic change does influence political change. China's \n     economic development will be good for the West as well as for \n     the Chinese people. China needs Most Favored Nation trade \n     status with the United States, and it should fully enter the \n     world trading system. The terms of that entry must be \n     negotiated, of course, but in any case the rest of the world \n     must not break its contact with China.\n       President Clinton's visit to Tiananmen Square did not look \n     like a sacrilege to the Chinese people. He didn't stand in \n     the middle of the square, but along the side, outside the \n     Great Hall of the People. All foreign leaders go there. \n     Clinton was right later to mention the events of June 4, \n     1989. He must continue to stick up for such political \n     prisoners as Liu Nianchun, imprisoned in 1995 for three \n     years; Li Hai, a former student at Peking University \n     sentenced to nine years in 1995; and Hu Shigen, another \n     former Peking University student who was sentenced to 20 \n     years in 1994. All were convicted on trumped-up criminal \n     charges. These people must never be forgotten. Nor should the \n     routine arrest and harassment of other dissidents, which \n     continued last week.\n       It's hard to say exactly what Chinese leaders think about \n     Clinton. The scandals in Washington allegedly implicating \n     Chinese officials only make the picture murkier. But one \n     thing is clear: China's leaders always view American \n     presidents as competitors. They believe that the United \n     States doesn't want China to grow, and they are suspicious of \n     its motives. That made Clinton's task in China more difficult \n     still. I wish him well.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S9341]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I keep asking and requesting that Members \ncome forward with these amendments. I have asked now the leadership to \nclear a unanimous consent request that all amendments have to be filed \nby 4. I know it is not cleared yet, but I am again requesting that and \nletting people know somehow or other we are going to get these \namendments. It may be that I will just have to move to go to third \nreading, we will have a vote to go to third reading and cut them all \noff.\n  For those people who want to go home, I will give them an avenue to \nget home, and that is let's just vote on this bill. But if people won't \nbring the amendments to us, we are going to have to take some drastic \nsteps here to limit the number of amendments we can consider. I know \nthat it is an extraordinary procedure, but these are extraordinary \ntimes. I would like at least to have the amendments we have said we \nwould accept. Twenty-three Members out there with amendments I said we \nwould accept, and they have not brought them over.

The distinguished Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3409\n\n (Purpose: To express the Sense of Congress that the readiness of the \nUnited States Armed Forces to execute the National Security Strategy of \n  the United States is eroded from a combination of declining defense \n   budgets and expanded missions, including the ongoing, open-ended \n    commitment of U.S. forces to the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia)\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3409.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       Sec. _. (a): Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since 1989,\n       (A) The national defense budget has been cut in half as a \n     percentage of the gross domestic product;\n       (B) The national defense budget has been cut by over $120 \n     billion in real terms;\n       (C) The U.S. military force structure has been reduced by \n     more than 30 percent;\n       (D) The Department of Defense's operations and maintenance \n     accounts have been reduced by 40 percent;\n       (E) The Department of Defense's procurement funding has \n     declined by more than 50 percent;\n       (F) U.S. military operational commitments have increased \n     fourfold;\n       (G) The Army has reduced its ranks by over 630,000 soldiers \n     and civilians, closed over 700 installations at home and \n     overseas, and cut 10 divisions from its force structure;\n       (H) The Army has reduced its presence in Europe from \n     215,000 to 65,000 personnel;\n       (I) The Army has averaged 14 deployments every four years, \n     increased significantly from the Cold War trend of one \n     deployment every four years;\n       (J) The Air Force has downsized by nearly 40 percent, while \n     experiencing a four-fold increase in operational commitments.\n       (2) In 1992, 37 percent of the Navy's fleet was deployed at \n     any given time. Today that number is 57 percent; at its \n     present rate, it will climb to 62 percent by 2005.\n       (3) The Navy Surface Warfare Officer community will fall \n     short of its needs a 40 percent increase in retention to meet \n     requirements;\n       (4) The Air Force is 18 percent short of its retention goal \n     for second-term airmen;\n       (5) The Air Force is more than 800 pilots short, and more \n     than 70 percent eligible for retention bonuses have turned \n     them down in favor of separation;\n       (6) The Army faces critical personnel shortages in combat \n     units, forcing unit commanders to borrow troops from other \n     units just to participate in training exercises.\n       (7) An Air Force F-16 squadron commander testified before \n     the House National Security Committee that his unit was \n     forced to borrow three aircraft and use cannibalized parts \n     from four other F-16s in order to deploy to Southwest Asia;\n       (8) In 1997, the Army averaged 31,000 soldiers deployed \n     away from their home station in support of military \n     operations in 70 countries with the average deployment \n     lasting 125 days;\n       (9) Critical shortfalls in meeting recruiting and retention \n     goals is seriously affecting the ability of the Army to train \n     and deploy. The Army reduced its recruiting goals for 1998 by \n     12,000 personnel;\n       (10) In fiscal year 1997, the Army fell short of its \n     recruiting goal for critical infantry soldiers by almost \n     5,000. As of February 15, 1998, Army-wide shortages existed \n     for 28 Army specialities. Many positions in squads and crews \n     are left unfilled or minimally filled because personnel are \n     diverted to work in key positions elsewhere;\n       (11) The Navy reports it will fall short of enlisted sailor \n     recruitment for 1998 by 10,000\n       (12) One in ten Air Force front-line units are not combat \n     ready;\n       (13) Ten Air Force technical specialties, representing \n     thousands of airmen, deployed away from their home station \n     for longer than the Air Force standard 120-day mark in 1997;\n       (14) The Air Force fell short of its reenlistment rate for \n     mid-career enlisted personnel by an average of six percent, \n     with key war fighting career fields experiencing even larger \n     drops in reenlistments;\n       (15) In 1997, U.S. Marines in the operating forces have \n     deployed on more than 200 exercises, rotational deployments, \n     or actual contingencies.\n       (16) U.S. Marine Corps maintenance forces are only able to \n     maintain 92 percent ground equipment and 77 percent aviation \n     equipment readiness rates due to excessive deployments of \n     troops and equipment;\n       (17) The National Security Strategy of the United States \n     assumes the ability of the U.S. Armed Forces to prevail in \n     two major regional conflicts nearly simultaneously.\n       (18) To execute the National Security of the United States, \n     the U.S. Army's five later-deploying divisions, which \n     constitute almost half of the Army's active combat forces, \n     are critical to the success of specific war plans;\n       (19) According to commanders in these divisions, the \n     practice of under staffing squads and crews that are \n     responsible for training, and assigning personnel to other \n     units as fillers for exercises and operations, has become \n     common and is degrading unit capability and readiness.\n       (20) In the aggregate, the Army's later-deploying divisions \n     were assigned 93 percent of their authorized personnel at the \n     beginning of fiscal year 1998. In one specific case, the 1st \n     Armored Division was staffed at 94 percent in the aggregate; \n     however, its combat support and service support specialties \n     were filled at below 85 percent, and captains and majors were \n     filled at 73 percent.\n       (21) At the 10th Infantry Division, only 138 of 162 \n     infantry squads were fully or minimally filled, and 36 of the \n     filled squads were unqualified. At the 1st Brigade of the 1st \n     Infantry Division, only 56 percent of the authorized infantry \n     soldiers for its Bradley Fighting Vehicles were assigned, and \n     in the 2nd Brigade, 21 of 48 infantry squads had no personnel \n     assigned. At the 3rd Brigade of the 1st Armored Division, \n     only 16 of 116 M1A1 tanks had full crews and were qualified, \n     and in one of the Brigade's two armor battalions, 14 of 58 \n     tanks had no crewmembers assigned because the personnel were \n     deployed to Bosnia.\n       (23) At the beginning of fiscal year 1998, the five later-\n     deploying divisions critical to the execution of the U.S. \n     National Security Strategy were short nearly 1,900 of the \n     total 25,357 Non-Commissioned Officers authorized, and as of \n     February 15, 1998, this shortage had grown to almost 2,200.\n       (24) Rotation of units to Bosnia is having a direct and \n     negative impact on the ability of later-deploying divisions \n     to maintain the training and readiness levels needed to \n     execute their mission in a major regional conflict. \n     Indications of this include:\n       (A) The reassignment by the Commander of the 3rd Brigade \n     Combat Team of 63 soldiers within the brigade to serve in \n     infantry squads of a deploying unit of 800 troops, stripping \n     non-deploying infantry and armor units of maintenance \n     personel, and reassigning Non-Commissioned Officers and \n     support personnel to the task force from throughout the \n     brigade;\n       (B) Cancellation of gunnery exercises for at least two \n     armor battalions in later-deploying divisions, causing 43 of \n     116 tank crews to lose their qualifications on the weapon \n     system;\n       (C) Hiring of outside contract personnel by 1st Armored and \n     1st Infantry later-deploying divisions to perform routine \n     maintenance.\n       (25) National Guard budget shortfalls compromise the \n     Guard's readiness levels, capabilities, force structure, and \n     end strength, putting the Guard's personel, schools, \n     training, full-time support, retention and recruitment, and \n     morale at risk.\n       (26) The President's budget requests for the National Guard \n     have been insufficient, notwithstanding the frequent calls on \n     the Guard to handle wide-ranging tasks, including deployments \n     in Bosnia, Iraq, Haiti, and Somalia.\n       (b) Sense of Congress:\n       (1) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (A) The readiness of U.S. military forces to execute the \n     National Security Strategy of the United States is being \n     eroded from a\n\n[[Page S9342]]\n\n     combination of declining defense budgets and expanded \n     missions;\n       (B) The ongoing, open-ended commitment of U.S. forces to \n     the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia is causing assigned and \n     supporting units to compromise their principle wartime \n     assignments;\n       (C) Defense appropriations are not keeping pace with the \n     expanding needs of the armed forces.\n       (c) Report Requirement.\n       (1) Not later than June 1, 1999, the President shall submit \n     to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the \n     Committee on National Security of the House of \n     Representatives, and to the Committees on Appropriations in \n     both Houses, a report on the military readiness of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States. The President shall include in \n     the report a detailed discussion of the competition for \n     resources service-by-service caused by the ongoing commitment \n     to the peacekeeping operation in Bosnia, including in those \n     units that are supporting but not directly deployed to \n     Bosnia. The President shall specifically include in the \n     report the following:\n       (A) an assessment of current force structure and its \n     sufficiency to execute the National Security Strategy of the \n     United States;\n       (B) an outline of the service-by-service force structure \n     expected to be committed to a major regional contingency as \n     envisioned in the National Security Strategy of the United \n     States;\n       (C) a comparison of the force structures outlined in sub-\n     paragraph (c)(1)(B) above with the service-by-service order \n     of battle in Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, as a \n     representative and recent major regional conflict;\n       (D) the force structure and defense appropriation increases \n     that are necessary to execute the National Security Strategy \n     of the United States assuming current projected ground force \n     levels assigned to the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia are \n     unchanged;\n       (E) a discussion of the U.S. ground force level in Bosnia \n     that can be sustained without impacting the ability of the \n     Armed Forces to execute the National Security Strategy of the \n     United States, assuming no increases in force structure and \n     defense appropriations during the period in which ground \n     forces are assigned to Bosnia.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this amendment is a sense of Congress \nregarding the readiness of the U.S. Armed Forces to execute the \nnational security strategy of the United States. So many people are now \ntalking about the hollow military that we seem to be going into, and I \nthink it is time that Congress address the concern that all of us have \nthat we may be driving our military down to the point that we will not \nbe able to respond if something happens where we are needed anywhere in \nthe world.\n  So, I make the following findings:\n  That since 1989:\n  The national defense budget has been cut in half as a percentage of \nthe gross domestic product;\n  The national defense budget has been cut by over $120 billion in real \nterms;\n  The U.S. military force structure has been reduced by more than 30 \npercent;\n  The Department of Defense's operations and maintenance accounts have \nbeen reduced by 40 percent;\n  The Department of Defense's procurement funding has declined by more \nthan 50 percent;\n  U.S. military operational commitments have increased fourfold.\n  It is clear the Army has reduced its ranks by over 630,000 soldiers \nand civilians, closed over 700 installations at home and overseas and \ncut 10 divisions from its force structure.\n  The Army has reduced its presence in Europe from 215,000 to 65,000 \npersonnel.\n  The Army has averaged 14 deployments every four years, increased \nsignificantly from the Cold War trend of one deployment every four \nyears.\n  The Air Force has downsized by nearly 40 percent,while experiencing a \nfour-fold increase in operation commitments.\n  In 1992, 37 percent of the Navy's fleet was deployed at any given \ntime. Today that number is 57 percent; at its present rate, it will \nclimb to 62 percent by 2005.\n  The Navy Surface Warfare Officer community will fall short of its \nneeds a 40 percent increase in retention to meet requirements;\n  The Air Force is 18 percent short of its retention goal for second-\nterm airmen.\n  We know the Air Force is more than 800 pilots short, and we know that \nour experienced pilots have not re-upped, even in the face of a $60,000 \nbonus.\n  The Army faces critical personnel shortages in combat units, forcing \nunit commanders to borrow troops from other units just to participate \nin training exercises.\n  In 1997, the Army averaged 31,000 soldiers deployed away from their \nhome station in support of military operations in 70 countries with the \naverage deployment lasting 125 days.\n  Critical shortfalls in meeting recruiting and retention goals is \nseriously affecting the ability of the Army to train and deploy. The \nArmy reduced its recruiting goal for 1998 by 12,000 personnel.\n  The Navy reports it will fall short of enlisted sailor recruitment \nfor 1998 by 10,000.\n  One in ten Air Force front-line units are not combat ready.\n  Ten Air Force technical specialties, representing thousands of \nairmen, deployed away from their home station for longer than the Air \nForce standard 120-day mark in 1997.\n  In 1997, U.S. Marines in the operating forces have deployed on more \nthan 200 exercises, rotational deployments, or actual contingencies.\n  U.S. Marine Corps maintenance forces are only able to maintain 92 \npercent ground equipment and 77 percent aviation equipment readiness \nrates due to excessive deployments of troops and equipment;\n  The National Security Strategy of the United States assumes the \nability of the U.S. Armed Forces to prevail in two major regional \nconflicts nearly simultaneously.\n  Mr. President, all of us, including the distinguished Senator from \nKansas who is a former marine, know that ``nearly'' has been inserted \ninto our national security strategy. Our strategy used to be that we \nwould have the ability to prevail in two major regional conflicts \nsimultaneously. Today, we are saying ``nearly simultaneously,'' yet \nnone of us who have studied these issues believe that we are ready, \ntoday, even for this ramped down mission.\n  To execute the National Security of the United States, the U.S. \nArmy's five later-deploying divisions, which constitute almost half of \nthe Army's active combat forces, are critical if the success of \nspecific war plans can be achieved.\n  According to commanders in these divisions, the practice of under \nstaffing squads and crews that are responsible for training, and \nassigning personnel to other units as fillers for exercises and \noperations, has become common and is degrading unit capability and \nreadiness.\n  In the aggregate, the Army's later-deploying divisions were assigned \n93 percent of their authorized personnel at the beginning of fiscal \nyear 1998. In one specific case, the 1st Armored Division was staffed \nat 94 percent in the aggregate; however, its combat support and service \nsupport specialties were filled at below 85 percent, and captains and \nmajors were filled at 73 percent.\n  At the 10th Infantry Division, only 138 of 162 infantry squads were \nfully or minimally filled, and 36 of the filled squads were \nunqualified.\n  At the beginning of fiscal year 1998, the five later-deploying \ndivisions critical to the execution of the U.S. National Security \nStrategy were short nearly 1,900 of the total 25,357 Non-Commissioned \nOfficers authorized, and as of February 15, 1998, this shortage had \ngrown to almost 2,200.\n  Rotation of units to Bosnia is having a direct and negative impact on \nthe ability of later-deploying divisions to maintain the training and \nreadiness levels needed to executive their mission in a major regional \nconflict. Indications of this include;\n  The reassignment by the Commander of the 3rd Brigade Combat Team of \n63 soldiers within the brigade to serve in infantry squads of a \ndeploying unit of 800 troops, stripping non-deploying infantry and \narmor units of maintenance personnel, and reassigning Non-Commissioned \nOfficers and support personnel to the task force from throughout the \nbrigade;\n  Cancellation of gunnery exercises for at least two armor battalions \nin later-deploying divisions, causing 43 of 116 tank crews to lose \ntheir qualifications on the weapon system;\n  Hiring of outside contract personnel by 1st Armored and 1st Infantry \nlater-deploying divisions to perform routine maintenance.\n  Mr. President, these are the facts. Every one of the facts that I \nhave read is absolutely in print, in the report of the Quadrennial \nDefense Review, in the DOD budget for fiscal year 1999, and a \ncompilation of statements from the Department of Defense vice chiefs in \na\n\n[[Page S9343]]\n\nhearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, and every other \npart of what I have just read has been documented. These are from the \nDefense Department's own statistics.\n  So I am asking for the sense of Congress, that we declare that:\n  The readiness of U.S. military forces to execute the National \nSecurity Strategy of the United States is being eroded from a \ncombination of declining defense budgets and expanded missions;\n  The ongoing, open-ended commitment of U.S. forces to the peacekeeping \nmission in Bosnia is causing assigned and supporting units to \ncompromise their principle wartime assignments.\n  Defense appropriations are not keeping pace with the expanding needs \nof the Armed Forces.\n  So I am asking for a report by June 1, 1999 from: the President of \nthe United States to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and \nthe Committee on National Security of the House of Representatives, and \nto the Committees on Appropriations in both Houses, a report on the \nmilitary readiness of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n  The President shall include in the report a detailed discussion of \nthe competition for resources service-by-service caused by the ongoing \ncommitment to the peacekeeping operation in Bosnia, including in those \nunits that are supporting but not directly deployed to Bosnia.\n  What we are asking, Mr. President, is for an assessment of where we \nare. We have all talked about the problems we have seen in small \ninstances and different pieces of testimony. What I have done in this \nsense of the Senate is put it all together. I have taken from the \nDepartment of Defense its own authorization, its own budget, its \nQuadrennial Defense Review, from statements made before one of our two \ncommittees that talked about the problems in specific detail.\n  I think it is time that we in Congress now say we have put it all \ntogether and we want a report on the state of our readiness. Let's look \nat all of the factors and let's determine that we have a problem, that \nwe have to determine what to do about it, and let's go forward and try \nto work with the administration, with the President, with the Secretary \nof Defense, and look at the big picture, and the big picture and the \ngoal for all of us is that we would be able to meet the national \nsecurity strategy of the United States, that we would be able to \nprevail in two major regional conflicts nearly simultaneously.\n  I prefer simultaneously, but, nevertheless, we are not even up to the \ngoal that we have stated, and we want to do what is our responsibility \nin the U.S. Congress, and that is, ask for the report, let's study the \nproblem and let's come up with a solution together with the Armed \nServices Committee and the Appropriations Committee of the U.S. Senate \nand the U.S. House.\n  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will support me in this \nsense of Congress. It is just the beginning of our responsibility to \naddress what we see as the problems in our military and that we would \nthen be able to take the report and take the necessary steps to correct \nthe backward motion that we are making with regard to the military \nreadiness and the security of our country.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Texas for her \npresentation. It is my hope we will be able to accept that amendment. I \nhave referred it to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and \nwe are hopeful that we can reach that conclusion later.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9329-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTREASURY AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999--AMENDMENT NO. \n                                  3385\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on another subject, time will expire at 2 \no'clock on the items to be voted on included in the Treasury and \ngeneral government operations bill. I offered amendment No. 3385 \nregarding recomputation of some Federal annuities. I point out that \nthis option is not mandatory. The only way future retired employees can \ntake advantage of this provision is if they make a payment into the \nFederal retirement system.\n  Several times in recent years, Congress has denied COLA adjustments \nfor Federal employees. In some years, only Members of Congress were \ndenied COLAs. In other years, other employees were affected.\n  My amendment provides that Federal employees covered by the Civil \nService Retirement System and the Federal Employees Retirement System \nwho did not receive automatic pay adjustments because of an act of \nCongress may, upon retirement, have their high-three salary recomputed \nas if they received the COLAs provided to annuitants.\n  This option cannot be exercised until the covered employee pays into \nthe Civil Service Retirement Fund the amounts required by the \namendment; namely, the contributions to the retirement fund the \nemployee would have made if the employee had received the annuitant \nCOLA.\n  It is really a fairness issue, to me. I am most concerned about \nsurvivors. Currently, 26 percent of all those who receive Federal \nannuities are survivors and the median time for a survivor annuity is \njust over 12 years. Survivors live on 55 percent of the employee's \nannuity. But, Mr. President, when an employee does not receive a COLA \nreceived by retired annuitants--and I point out that in almost every \nyear, the retired annuitant, the people retired, have received the \nCOLAs--then it simply means that survivors of retired employees receive \ngreater annuities, greater compensation than those received by \nsurvivors of employees who continued to serve during the period when \nCongress denied COLAs to current Members and employees.\n  I believe the right thing to do is to adopt this concept. It allows \nthe employee or the survivor of the employee who has passed on to ask \nfor recomputation of the high-three concept based upon an assumption \nthat the retiree had received the cost-of-living adjustments that were \ngiven to retired annuitants in the period when those were denied to \nCongress or other Federal employees.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment. I will have a minute to \ntalk about it when the amendment comes up for a vote, as we start \nvoting at 2 o'clock. I wanted this in the Record at this point.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9343-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9343-S9346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from California \nwould like to speak on the Hutchinson amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Not on this amendment, Mr. President, but the \nHutchinson amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Hutchinson amendment that I made a motion to table, \nthe one pertaining to China.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Although I made a motion to table, I think it is in \norder until 2 o'clock that they may be able to speak.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3409\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am prepared to leave the floor, but I have two \nthings. First, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Abraham be added as \na cosponsor of amendment No. 3409.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Secondly, I ask the manager of the bill if he still \nwants me to offer the other amendment that I was to offer, or would he \nprefer to go forward with Senator Feinstein, and I can always do that \nafter the votes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I did request the Senator from Texas \noffer her Bosnia amendment so it will be the pending amendment after \nthe votes this afternoon. I appreciate that she did that at this time. \nI urge she save the statement to be made until after the Senator from \nCalifornia, who has been waiting to make comments on the China \namendment which I have already moved to table.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3391, As Modified\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send to the desk a technical correction \nto amendment No. 3391 previously adopted. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe amendment be modified. It is strictly a\n\n[[Page S9344]]\n\ntechnical error in the amendment that was previously adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3391), as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 34, line 24, strike out all after ``$94,500,000'' \n     down to and including ``1999'' on page 35, line 7.\n       On page 42, line 1, strike out the amount \n     ``$2,000,000,000'', and insert the amount ``$1,775,000,000''.\n       On page 99, in between lines 17 and 18, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 8  .

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       Sec.  .(a) The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) United States Armed Forces in the Republic of Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina have accomplished the military mission \n     assigned to them as a component of the Implementation and \n     Stabilization Forces.\n       (2) The continuing and open-ended commitment of U.S. ground \n     forces in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is subject \n     to the oversight authority of the Congress.\n       (3) Congress may limit the use of appropriated funds to \n     create the conditions for an orderly and honorable withdrawal \n     of U.S. troops from the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       (4) On November 27, 1995, the President affirmed that \n     United States participation in the multinational military \n     Implementation Force in the Republic of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina would terminate in about one year.\n       (5) The President declared the expiration date of the \n     mandate for the Implementation Force to be December 20, 1996.\n       (6) The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff expressed confidence that the Implementation \n     Force would complete its mission in about one year.\n       (7) The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff expressed the critical importance of \n     establishing a firm deadline in the absence of which there is \n     a potential for expansion of the mission of U.S. forces.\n       (8) On October 3, 1996, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff announced the intention of the United States \n     Administration to delay the removal of United States Armed \n     Forces personnel from the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina \n     until March 1997.\n       (9) In November 1996 the President announced his intention \n     to further extend the deployment of United States Armed \n     Forces in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina until June \n     1998.\n       (10) The President did not request authorization by the \n     Congress of a policy that would result in the further \n     deployment of United States Armed Forces in the Republic of \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina until June 1998.\n       (11) Notwithstanding the passage of two previously \n     established deadlines, the reaffirmation of those deadlines \n     by senior national security officials, and the endorsement by \n     those same national security officials of the importance of \n     having a deadline as a hedge against an expanded mission, the \n     President announced on December 17, 1997 that establishing a \n     deadline had been a mistake and that U.S. ground combat \n     forces were committed to the NATO-led mission in Bosnia for \n     the indefinite future.\n       (12) NATO military forces have increased their \n     participation in law enforcement, particularly police \n     activities.\n       (13) U.S. Commanders of NATO have stated on several \n     occasions that, in accordance with the Dayton Peace Accords, \n     the principal responsibility for such law enforcement and \n     police activities lies with the Bosnian parties themselves.\n\n     SEC. 2. LIMITATIONS ON THE USE OF FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Funds appropriated or otherwise made available for the \n     Department of Defense for any fiscal year may not be \n     obligated for the ground elements of the United States Armed \n     Forces in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina except as \n     conditioned below.\n       (1) The President shall continue the ongoing withdrawal of \n     American forces from the NATO Stabilization Force in the \n     Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina such that U.S. ground \n     forces in that force or the planned multi-national successor \n     force shall not exceed:\n       (A) 6500, by February 2, 1999;\n       (B) 5000, by October 1, 1999.\n       (b) Exceptions.--The limitation in subsection (a) shall not \n     apply--\n       (1) to the extent necessary for U.S. ground forces to \n     protect themselves as the drawdowns outlined in sub-paragraph \n     (a)(1) proceeds;\n       (2) to the extent necessary to support a limited number of \n     United States military personnel sufficient only to protect \n     United States diplomatic facilities in existence on the \n     date of the enactment of this Act; or\n       (3) to the extent necessary to support non-combat military \n     personnel sufficient only to advise the commanders of North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization peacekeeping operations in the \n     Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina; and\n       (4) to U.S. ground forces that may be deployed as part of \n     NATO containment operations in regions surrounding the \n     Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       (c) Construction of Section.--Nothing in this section shall \n     be deemed to restrict the authority of the President under \n     the Constitution to protect the lives of United States \n     citizens.\n       (d) Limitation on Support for Law Enforcement Activities in \n     Bosnia.--None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available to the Department of Defense for any fiscal year \n     may be obligated or expended after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act for the--\n       (1) conduct of, or direct support for, law enforcement and \n     police activities in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, \n     except for the training of law enforcement personnel or to \n     prevent imminent loss of life;\n       (2) conduct of, or support for, any activity in the \n     Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that may have the effect \n     of jeopardizing the primary mission of the NATO-led force in \n     preventing armed conflict between the Federation of Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina and the Repulika Srpska (`Bosnian Entities');\n       (3) transfer of refugees within the Republic of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina that, in the opinion of the commander of NATO \n     Forces involved in such transfer--\n       (A) has as one of its purposes the acquisition of control \n     by a Bosnia Entity of territory allocated to the other \n     Bosnian Entity under the Dayton Peace Agreement; or\n       (B) may expose United States Armed Forces to substantial \n     risk to their personal safety; and\n       (4) implementation of any decision to change the legal \n     status of any territory within the Republic of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina unless expressly agreed to by all signatories to \n     the Dayton Peace Agreement.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. This is the amendment on Bosnia that we will discuss\n\n[[Page S9345]]\n\nimmediately following the stacked votes this afternoon. I am happy to \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from California is \nfinally recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3124\n\n  Mr. President, as one who has watched China for some 35 years now, \nand been a frequent visitor for the past 20 years, I would like to make \na few comments on the Hutchinson amendment, which effectively would set \nup a protocol whereby officials beneath the rank of Cabinet officials \ncould be refused visas to come to this country.\n  The amendment, while it promotes a worthy goal, goes about it in a \ncompletely, I believe, counterproductive way. I do not think there is \nany Senator in this body who does not condemn the practice of forced \nabortion, forced sterilization, or any other coercive population \ncontrol device or measure. We all condemn it.\n  I do not think there is any Senator in this body who does not condemn \nreligious persecution that prevents people from freely exercising their \nown personal religious beliefs. Of course, not. We all condemn that. \nThis amendment takes a stand on a principle but it does nothing to help \nsolve the problem it is designed to address, and there is the rub.\n  We all agree there are certain practices and policies still in China \nthat we oppose. The question we need to ask ourselves is this: What is \nthe best contribution we can make to producing change, real change, in \nChina? I submit that the answer is, we can engage China at all levels, \nall levels of government. Academia, business, law, and every other kind \nof social interaction should be energized. We should welcome every \nchance to interact with the Chinese people and officials as an \nopportunity to expose them to our values, to expose them to the rule of \nlaw, to Democratic values, to individual liberties.\n  The path set out by this amendment, I believe, is extraordinarily \ndangerous and it takes us on the opposite path. It is a path of \nisolation and containment. It cuts ourselves off from the very people \nwe need to help educate and persuade and expose to Western values. And \nit would surely spark similar countermeasures by the Chinese Government \nto deny visas to U.S. officials, further deepening our isolation from \none another, and developing the adversarial relationship that many of \nus believe need never happen. It could go on and on in a vicious cycle.\n  Do any of my colleagues seriously believe that any Chinese official \nwould be dissuaded from conducting any human rights action because they \nwould be denied a visa to the United States? I think not. I do deeply \nbelieve that if Chinese officials are exposed to U.S. society--and this \nhas begun. I know it has been criticized, but I see it working. I come \nfrom a Pacific rim State where there is a great deal of interaction \nwith Asia. I see our values go across the Pacific. I see them enter the \nChinese mainland. I see the changes that have been made.\n  Mr. President, when Richard Nixon went to China in 1972, China was \nstill in the midst of the Cultural Revolution. There has never been a \nmore brutal period in Chinese history than the Cultural Revolution. We \nhave seen those dark days recede. We have seen a new leadership in \nplace.\n  For the first time, I believe that this new leader now has the face, \nhas consolidated his power, to begin to make certain major reforms. I \nvery deeply believe we are going to see those reforms in the next few \nyears. Already, there is writing here and in China about the order \ngiven to the Chinese military to remove themselves from all commercial \nendeavors.\n  Surprisingly enough, this, for the first time, has been done with \ntransparency--in other words, a public statement for all to know that \nthe new policy of the Chinese Government is that the Chinese military \nwill not run commercial operations in trade, in business, or in any \nother pursuit. This is a very healthy, a very positive advance, which I \nthink the entire free world should take hold of.\n  Additionally, you heard voluntarily the President of China, after \nmany of us have importuned him over a long period of time, I myself \nbeginning in 1991 carrying messages from His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, \nto the President of China, urging that there be a meeting--for the \nfirst time, the President of China has said publicly, with \ntransparency, that if His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, makes a statement \nthat respects the fact that Tibet is a part of China and that \nindependence is not a part of the discussions, that there can be \nmeetings that follow.\n  This is, true, a breakthrough in rhetoric, but it has never happened \nbefore in the 8 years I have been trying to achieve it. That happened \nwhile the President was in China. So these changes are being made.\n  One by one--perhaps not enough--the freeing of political dissidents, \nthe adoption of a 30-day period of administrative leave, the Chinese \ninterests in developing exchanges in the rule of law, to develop a \nmodern commercial code, a modern criminal code, hopefully to press for \nthe independence of the judicial branch of Government which currently \nis subject to party control --all of these are the breakthroughs that \nwe should begin to press.\n  We have certain intellectual property, certain intellectual property \nconcerns. How could those ever be brought about if we could not have an \nexchange of lower level officials to see to it that intellectual \nproperty laws are being carried out? It makes no sense to me. I believe \nit is one step toward containment and isolation. I believe that both of \nthose are unwarranted, highly counterproductive----\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. You were speaking very positively about the changes \nin China. My question is, How do we reconcile the recent round of \narrests that occurred in the 2 weeks--actually, the week subsequent to \nthe President's visit--headlined in all of the newspapers across the \ncountry? Those who had attempted to register as an opposition political \nparty and were arrested, some of whom are still incarcerated, as well \nas the tests of rocket engines that occurred even while the President \nwas in China, how do we reconcile that with this supposed great reform \nthat is taking place in China? And then also, the question I would pose \nis, The amendment that you are opposing simply says that visas should \nnot be granted to those who are involved in forcing--compelling--\nabortions on women against their will and those who are involved in \npersecution of religious believers of various faiths. Do you oppose \ndenying visas to those individuals who are involved in forced abortions \nand religious persecution?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would be happy to answer the questions of the \ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas.\n  Yes, I oppose a measure which would oppose the granting of visas. The \nnormal diplomatic and pragmatic efforts of a government-to-government \neffort to engage and discuss, to bring to light of day, to continue to \npersuade and develop a better sense of values would be truncated and \ncut off.\n  I believe, I say to the Senator, as one who has watched China for \nsome 35 years now, that this is a country which has been humiliated by \nthe West in the past. This is a country that has 5,000 years of \ndictatorship by one individual, generally an emperor, an emperor who \ncould cast aside people, who could kill people at will--then \nrevolutionary war heroes, basically people who were uneducated.\n  This is the first post-revolutionary war leadership that has had some \nWestern education, that has some Western understanding. China closed \nitself off from the West after the Boxer Rebellion and because of what \nhappened in the opium trade, never wanting any kind of interaction with \nthe West.\n\n  Now, for the first time, China is open, I believe, to Western values, \nto Western ideas. I happen to believe it is to our interest. We didn't \nsettle the enormous intellectual property and piracy problems by \nsaying, if you commit a piracy act, you won't have a visa to the United \nStates. We settled it by sending over delegation after delegation of \nofficials to let the Chinese Government know what this was all about, \nto identify and help identify those factories that were producing \nillegal goods, and to follow up and see, in fact, that the Chinese \nGovernment was willing to take action to shut them down. It has worked. \nIt will be a bumpy road.\n\n[[Page S9346]]\n\n But cutting off visas of officials isn't the way to handle problems, \nwhether they relate to IPR, whether they relate to technology transfer, \nwhether they relate to other military endeavors or trade matters, I \nbelieve.\n  I must say, I believe this is the first time in the last year that \nthe administration has really made up their mind that what they are \ngoing to do is engage China fully and completely at the top level. I \nbelieve it is having enormous dividends and that we will see in the \nyears to come a much more open country, a country that has taken steps \nto make greater reforms.\n  You have to realize that to those of us who sit on the west coast, \nthe Pacific rim is our world of trade. The Pacific rim has by far \nexceeded the Atlantic Ocean as the major theater of trade. In my State, \napproximately over a third of the jobs depend on trade with Asia. We \nwant to have positive relations with Asia, positive relations with the \nPhilippines, with Taiwan, with South Korea, with China, with all of the \nASEAN countries as well. Increasingly, we have an opportunity, we \nbelieve, on the Pacific, to form a Pacific rim community that is \npeaceful, where trade can take place, where like values can be shared. \nI must tell you, I buy into that dream. I want to see it happen.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, coerced abortion and religious \npersecution are two practices that the Chinese Communist Government \ndenies take place in China.\n  How, then, would denying visas to Chinese officials in which we have \ncredible evidence that, in fact, they are doing--how would that impede \nthe kind of positive relationship that you want to see?\n  I again reiterate the questions: How do we reconcile the most recent \nrounds of arrests of those who tried to form a democracy party in China \nwhen they were detained and incarcerated? And the test of the rocket \nengines while the President was in China, how do we reconcile that with \nthis supposed breeze of freedom that we now have blowing through China?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I don't think it is all going to be smooth and all \ngoing in one direction. I find the arrest of dissidents in the wake of \nthe President's visit or prior to the President's visit as 100 percent \nwrong.\n  Senator, if there is one thing I have learned about the Chinese, they \ncan be ham-handed in how they function. They can be their own worst \nenemies in how they handle, because they function under a different, I \nthink, value system in this regard. Sometimes, I believe, it is \noverreaction. I have read things, and I sit back and say, why did this \nhave to happen?\n  Now, let's talk for a moment about forced abortion. I think it is an \nabysmal practice, it is a barbaric practice. China says they do not \ncountenance and they do not want to permit it. That is the official \ngovernment policy. Are there occasions where, in this vast country, \nforced abortion is committed, do I believe? I believe there are \ninstances where forced abortions are, in fact, committed. I also \nbelieve, though, that by pointing this out continually, we will see \nsome changes.\n  I think it has to be understood that China still has over 100 million \npeople way under the poverty line, some living in caves, some living in \nthe most impoverished circumstances, particularly in western China. It \nhas to be understood that China is a nation of 1.2 billion people, \ngrowing rapidly.\n  When I first went to China in 1979, what I was told was, what we have \nfor one person must be extended to five people. I have seen since that \ntime the quality of life improving for people. I have seen the easing \nof restrictions. I have seen the improvement in the dialog. I have seen \nthe stress on education. I have seen the opening of the society. I have \nto think that is healthy for the society. I think if we engage that \nsociety, if we talk with people on equal levels, if we treat China \nwithout humiliating China but treat China with equality, that we will \nsee major positive changes in the future.\n  So I appreciate the opportunity to have this dialog. I respect your \nvalues. I respect what you are trying to do in this regard. I just \nhappen to believe, based on my knowledge, my understanding, and my \nexperience with China and the Chinese people, I believe it would be \nhighly unproductive.\n  I just wanted an opportunity to come to the floor and have that \nopportunity to state my views. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Last evening I had asked the majority leader just for 5 minutes at \nsome time during the period when he was propounding the consent \nrequest. I am glad to cooperate with the floor managers on when would \nbe the most appropriate time to do so, but since we are starting off on \nan amendment, I don't want to interrupt the debate on the amendment, \nand I am glad to inquire of my friend from Michigan what period of time \nhe intends to take.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. If the Senator from Massachusetts would like to speak \nfor up to 5 minutes, the Senator from Michigan would be happy to \npropose a unanimous consent agreement by which the Senator from \nMassachusetts is yielded 5 minutes to speak, in morning business or \nwhatever, and then establish that the Senator from Michigan would be \nrecognized to proceed with the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Michigan desire to make \nthat request in the form of a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nMassachusetts be permitted to speak for 5 minutes at this time, to be \nfollowed by the Senator from Michigan to then resume discussion of my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator from Michigan.\n  As the Senator knows, the Judiciary Committee, of which we are both \nmembers, is starting hearings at this time as well. I appreciate his \nkindness in permitting me to address the Senate at this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9343-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9346-S9350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we begin the August recess, the \nAmerican people should understand that the Republican leadership is \nstill bent on blocking meaningful HMO reform. I believe that Senator \nLott owes it to Congress and the American people to schedule a full and \nfair debate as the Senate's first order of business when we return in \nSeptember, but he has refused to do so and continues to hide behind the \nunreasonable restrictions on fair guidelines for the Senate's debate.\n  The Republican leadership in Congress deserves the failing grades it \nis getting for fumbling the issue on HMO reform. At least since last \nJanuary when the press reports began noting that Oscar-winning actress \nHelen Hunt in ``As Good as it Gets,'' who electrified audiences with \nher attack on HMOs, it has been clear that a tidal wave of support is \nbuilding to end the managed care abuses and stop HMOs from profiting in \nways that jeopardize patients' health or their very lives.\n  The GOP's HMO line of defense continues to be to block any strong \nlegislation, refuse to allow fair debate, and to give the HMO industry \nantireform TV ads a chance to bite. The genie is out of the bottle, and \nthat cynical strategy will fail. If the majority leader has not already \ndone so, I urge him to see the film during the recess. I have a \nvideotape of the film here. I ask a page to deliver it to the majority \nleader.\n  I urge the leader to see the film in a theater so he can judge the \naudience reaction and be more convinced of the genuine public outrage \nthat exists over the abuses of HMOs and managed care. It is long past \ntime for the Congress to end these abuses. Too often, the managed care \nis mismanaged care. No amount of distortion or smokescreens by \ninsurance companies or GOP campaign ads can change the facts. A real \nPatients' Bill of Rights can stop these abuses. Let's pass it now \nbefore more patients have to suffer.\n  All we want is a chance, in the time-honored tradition and the \nregular order of this body, to present a full and complete debate on \nthis issue. We have had 5 days of debate and discussion on agriculture, \nwith 55 amendments. We have\n\n[[Page S9347]]\n\nhad 6 days of debate on the defense authorization, with 105 amendments. \nWe have had 7 days of debate on the budget, with over 100 amendments. \nWe are entitled to an opportunity for a full and fair debate. If there \nare provisions to be included in the Daschle bill, we would like to \nhear about them and what the objectives are. We believe that this \ndebate offers the best opportunity to make sure that we are going to \nhave the doctors and patients make decisions and not the insurance \ncompanies. That is the central and fundamental issue that we ought to \nbe debating. We are going to continue to press this issue until we have \nthat debate.\n  The Senate Republican leadership plan is not a bill of rights--it's a \nbill of wrongs. It cannot withstand a full and fair debate on the floor \nof the Senate. Its supporters know that--so they are refusing to bring \nit up for full debate, or at least agree on a fair number of \namendments.\n  The goal of the Republican leadership and their friends in the \ninsurance industry is to prevent legislation this year, or to pass only \na minimalist bill so weak that it would be worse than no bill at all. \nThe initial Republican strategy--the stonewall strategy--lasted for \nmore than a year. But it broke down last month in the face of \noverwhelming public demand for action.\n  Their minimalist approach pays lip service to reform without the \nreality of reform. They refuse to let the Senate debate it, because \nthey know their plan is more loophole than law.\n  The Republican record of delay and denial is clear. Congressman \nDingell and I first introduced patient protection legislation 17 months \nago--on February 25, 1997.\n  Senator Daschle introduced the Patients' Bill of Rights four months \nago--on March 31, 1998.\n  We have repeatedly asked for committee action or consideration by the \nfull Senate of this important legislation, but the Republican \nleadership has repeatedly said ``no.''\n  Now, they know they can no longer just say ``no.'' So the Leadership \nis trying the next best thing. Instead of bringing up the bill for full \nand fair debate, they have offered up a series of phony consent \nagreements that they know are unacceptable. They don't want a full \ndebate with an opportunity to amend their Patient Bill of Wrongs, \nbecause they believe that the less the American people know about their \nsham proposals, the better they will be able to protect their friends \nin the health insurance industry.\n  In fact, the Republican leadership has gone to extraordinary lengths \nin the past six weeks to prevent a full debate on HMO reform.\n  On June 18, Senator Lott proposed to bring up the bill, but on terms \nthat made a mockery of legislative process.\n   That proposal would have allowed the Senate to start debate on HMO \nreform, but Senator Lott would have been permitted to pull the bill \ndown at any time, and the Senate would have been barred from \nconsidering it further for the rest of the year. So if Senator Lott did \nnot like the direction the bill was headed, he could withdraw it and \ntie the Senate's hands on HMO reform for the remainder of the year.\n  On June 23, 43 Democratic Senators wrote to Senator Lott to urge him \nto allow a full debate and votes on the merits of the Patients' Bill of \nRights before the August recess.\n  In response, on June 24, Senator Lott simply repeated his earlier \nunacceptable offer.\n  On June 25, Senator Daschle proposed an agreement under which Senator \nLott would bring up a Republican health care bill by July 6, Senator \nDaschle could offer the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights, and other \nSenators could offer only amendments relevant to the HMO reform issue. \nWe would not allow amendments on any other subject--just those relevant \nto the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  However, Senator Lott rejected this offer. And on June 26, he offered \nonce again an agreement that allowed Senator Lott to withdraw the \nlegislation at any time, and bar any further consideration of any \nhealth care legislation for the remainder of the year.\n  On July 15, after a long silence, Senator Lott made yet another \noffer. This time he proposed an agreement that allowed for no \namendments. He could bring up his bill. We could bring up ours. And \nthat is it. It would be all or nothing. The American people would be \ndenied votes on specific issues.\n  No vote on whether all Americans should be covered, or just one-third \nas the Republicans propose.\n  No vote on whether there should be genuine access to emergency room \ncare.\n  No vote on whether patients should have access to the specialists \nthey need when they are seriously ill.\n  No vote on whether doctors should be free to give the medical advice \nthey feel is appropriate, without fear of being fired by the HMO.\n  No vote on whether patients with cancer or Alzheimer's disease or \nother illnesses should have access to clinical trials after \nconventional treatments fail.\n  No vote on whether patients in the middle of a course of treatment \ncan keep their doctor if their health plan drops the doctor from the \nnetwork, or the employer changes health plans.\n  No vote on whether patients should have meaningful independent review \nof plan decisions--or whether health plans should continue to be judge \nand jury.\n  No vote on whether the special health needs of persons with \ndisabilities, and women, and children should be met.\n  No vote on whether health plans should be held responsible for \ndecisions that kill or injure patients.\n  The list goes on and on.\n  But the Republican Leadership just wants an all-or-nothing vote on \ntheir plan and our plan. They don't want a genuine debate on patient \nprotection. They don't want to be held accountable by the American \npeople for defending industry profits instead of patients. They want to \ngag the Senate, and allow HMOs to continue to gag doctors.\n  On July 16, Senator Daschle proposed that we agree on a limited \nnumber of amendments--20 per side, directly related to the legislation, \nnot on extraneous issues.\n  This offer by Senator Daschle reflects the best traditions of the \nSenate. It is consistent with the conditions under which we have \ndebated many major legislative proposals in the Senate this year.\n  We had 7 days of debate on the budget resolution, and considered 105 \namendments. Two of those were offered by Senator Nickles.\n  We had 6 days of debate on the defense authorization bill, and \nconsidered 150 amendments. Two of those were offered by Senator Lott, \nand he cosponsored 10 others.\n  We had 8 days of debate on IRS reform, and considered 13 amendments.\n  We had 17 days of debate on tobacco legislation--a bill we never \ncompleted--and considered 18 amendments.\n  We had 5 days of debate on the Agriculture Appropriations bill and 55 \namendments.\n  Senator Lott has said to reporters that Democrats might be able to \noffer 3 or 4 amendments. But that means we would have to decide which \nissues of concern to the American people are debated, and which are \ndiscarded. Do we debate access to emergency rooms, but put aside all \nconcerns about access to specialists? Do we offer an amendment to \nensure that all Americans are covered by the legislation, and not just \nthe one-third the Republican plan proposes, but put aside access to \nclinical trials that could save lives?\n  This debate should not be an unfair choice. We agree that the number \nof amendments should be limited. But the number should be large enough \nto accommodate the large number of legitimate issues that need to be \ndebated as part of this important reform.\n  If the Republican leaders are serious about fair debate, they know \nhow to do it. We do it every day in the Senate, and we should do it \nnow. If they are serious about passing meaningful patient protection \nlegislation, they should call up the bill now. All we have asked for is \n20 amendments per side. It will take at least 20 amendments to even \nbegin to remedy the major defects in the Republican proposal.\n  Since the Republican leadership plan was introduced a week ago, we \nhave held meetings and forums with doctors, nurses and patients to \nexplore the critical issues that must be addressed if a Patients' Bill \nof Rights is to be worthy of its name.\n  In each case, doctors, nurses and patients have reached the same \nconclusions. The abuses by HMOs and managed care are pervasive in our \nhealth\n\n[[Page S9348]]\n\nsystem. Every doctor and patient knows that, too often, managed care is \nmismanaged care. Every doctor and patient knows that medical decisions \nthat should be made by doctors and patients are being made by insurance \ncompany accountants. Every doctor and patient knows that profits, not \npatient care, have become the priority of too many health insurance \ncompanies.\n  The message in each of these forums from doctors, nurses and patients \nhas been the same. Pass the Patients' Bill of Rights. Reject the \nRepublican leadership plan. It leaves out too many critical \nprotections. It leaves out too many patients. Even the protections it \nclaims to offer have too many loopholes. It is a plan to protect \nindustry profits, not patients.\n  One of the aspects of their legislation that the Republican \nleadership likes to tout is its alleged protections for women. As part \nof their ongoing disinformation campaign about their legislation, they \neven had a press conference this morning to proclaim the benefits of \ntheir legislation for women. But no credible organization representing \nwomen endorses their bill--because their so-called protections for \nwomen are a sham.\n  Nowhere is the difference between the bipartisan Patients' Bill of \nRights and the Republican Bill of Wrongs more evident than on the issue \nof protecting women's health. The Republican leadership bill leaves out \nmost key patient protections. Even the protections it does include are \nmore cosmetic than real. And even those cosmetic protections are \nlimited to fewer than one-third of the privately insured patients who \nneed help.\n  We held a forum yesterday afternoon during which leading \norganizations for women released a letter urging Senators to support \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights and to reject the Republican leadership \nbill. The letter is signed by more than 30 women's groups, who \nrepresent millions of women in communities across the country.\n  Last Friday, we heard from Diane Bergin of College Park, MD. She has \novarian cancer, and is currently enrolled in a clinical trial. She \neloquently described the need for plans to cover such trials and the \nimportance of having access to specialty care. Diane is a vivid example \nof the promise of such therapies and the need to see that patients have \ngenuine access to specialists.\n  Women need to know that they will receive the benefits covered by \ntheir plan and recommended by their treating physician--without being \nover-ruled by insurance company accountants.\n  Women need to know that they can choose their gynecologist to be \ntheir primary care physician.\n  Women need to know that they will never have to drive past the \nnearest emergency room, because a more distant hospital is part of \ntheir managed care plan.\n  Women with mental illness need to know that they will have access to \npsychiatrists, psychologists and other mental health professionals.\n  Women with ovarian cancer--like Diane Bergin--or other life-\nthreatening conditions need to know that their health plan will let \nthem participate in clinical trials by covering routine costs of such \ncare.\n  Women whose plans provide pharmaceutical benefits need to know that \nthey will have access to drugs that are not on the plan's list.\n  Women need to know that they will have access to a quick and \nindependent appeal if their plan overrules their doctor.\n  Women need to know that they have a genuine remedy when plan abuses \nresult in injury or death.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights guarantees these rights to all women \nwith private health insurance. The Republican plan guarantees none of \nthem.\n  In fact, the closer you look at the Republican bill, the worse it \nlooks. They claim to provide protections for patients who seek \nemergency room care. But the American College of Emergency Physicians \nhas denounced their proposal as a sham.\n  They claim to provide independent third party appeal, but Consumer's \nUnion analyzed their proposal and called it ``woefully inadequate and \nfar from independent.''\n  Virtually every protection they claim to have included turns out to \nfail the truth-in-advertising test--and the protections they have left \nout are a dishonor roll of insurance industry abuses.\n  Part of democracy is accountability. We have votes in the Senate to \npass or defeat bills. We have votes on amendments to improve bills. We \nrecord these votes, because we are elected by the people of our states \nto represent them. The people have a right to know where we stand on \nimportant issues.\n  I ask the Republican leader why he doesn't want the American people \nto know where members of the Senate stand on whether protections for \npatients should apply to all 161 million privately insured Americans--\nor leave more than 100 million out.\n  I ask the Republican leader why he doesn't want the American people \nto know where members of the Senate stand on allowing a sick child with \ncancer to have access to a specialist to treat his disease.\n  I ask the Republican leader why he doesn't want a vote on whether \ndoctors and patients, not accountants, should make medical decisions.\n  I ask the Republican leader why he doesn't want a vote on whether \ndoctors who stand up for their patients should be protected from \nretaliation by insurance companies.\n  I ask the Republican leader why he doesn't want a vote on whether \npatients should have access to the nearest emergency room when \nimmediate medical treatment means the difference between life and \ndeath.\n  I ask the Republican leader why he doesn't want a vote on whether HMO \ndecisions to deny patients the care they need should be subject to \ntimely and independent review by an impartial third party.\n  I ask the Republican leader why he doesn't want a vote on whether \npatients with deadly diseases that no conventional treatment can help \nshould have access to clinical trials that offer them the hope of cure \nor improvement.\n  I ask the Republican leader why he doesn't want a vote to insist on \naccountability for health plans when they kill or injure patients.\n  Each of those votes will address a critical weakness in the \nRepublican plan. It is obvious why the Republican leader does not want \nDemocrats to offer these amendments. He wants to keep the Republican \nbill weak, so that it will protect profits instead of patients. He \nthinks that he can hold Republican Senators for one vote in favor of a \nbad bill, but he cannot keep them together on vote after vote that will \nshow who stands with patients--and who stands with HMOs.\n  The President will not sign--and the Senate should not pass--a bill \nthat is a fig leaf over continued HMO abuses.\n  If the Senate has a full and fair debate in full view of the American \npeople, needed patient protections will pass--and that is what the \nRepublican leadership is trying to avoid.\n  The House Republican plan is so flawed that President Clinton has \nalready sent a strong veto message. But the Senate Republican plan is \neven weaker than the House Republican plan--it's ``Gingrich Lite.'' We \nknow we can do better, and we will do better if we have a fair \nopportunity for full debate.\n  The Senate Republican plan protects industry profits instead of \nprotecting patients. It is so riddled with loopholes that it's a \nlicense for continued abuse. It allows insurance company accountants to \ncontinue to make medical decisions, not doctors and patients. Patients \nwith cancer, heart disease, or other serious illnesses will not have \ntimely access to specialists and the treatment they need. Managed care \nplans are immunized from liability for abuses that injure or even kill \na patient. No other industry in America has this immunity--and the \nmanaged care industry doesn't deserve it either.\n  Just as managed care plans gag their doctors, the Republican \nleadership wants to gag the Senate. Just as insurance companies delay \nand deny care, the Republican leadership is trying to delay and deny \nmeaningful reform. Just as health plans want to avoid being held \naccountable when they kill or injure a patient, the Republican \nleadership wants to avoid being held accountable for killing patient \nprotection legislation.\n  Yesterday, Senator Chafee offered a proposal that is a major \nimprovement over the Senate Republican leadership\n\n[[Page S9349]]\n\nplan, and it provides significant patient protections. But it lacks \nmany of the most important protections in our Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Key provisions omitted in the Chafee plan include the lack of needed \nprotection for breast cancer patients from drive-through mastectomies \nand access to reconstructive surgery--the lack of fair opportunities \nfor patients to join health plans allowing them to go to the physician \nor specialist of their choice--the lack of protection for health \nprofessionals who point out problems in the quality of care provided by \nhealth plans or facilities--and the lack of adequate remedies for \npatients injuries or killed by HMO abuses.\n  All of these reforms are needed, and all of them are strongly \nsupported by an unprecedented alliance of physicians, nurses, patients, \nand working families.\n  Despite these significant gaps, the Chafee plan shows that the wall \nof opposition by Senate Republicans to genuine reform is continuing to \ncrack, and it shows that at least some Republicans in the Senate are \nserious about reform. Now is the time for the Republican leadership to \nrespond. As the Chafee plan shows, their industry profit protection \nplan is becoming less and less tenable with each passing day. The \nAmerican people demand action, but the Republican leadership still \nrefuses to bring patient protection legislation to the floor for full \ndebate and action.\n  The Republican Leadership in Congress deserves the failing grades \nit's getting for fumbling the issue of HMO reform. At least since last \nJanuary--when press reports began noting that Oscar-winning actress \nHelen Hunt in the movie ``As Good As It Gets'' was electrifying \naudiences with her attack on her HMO--it has been clear that a tidal \nwave of support is building to end managed care abuses and stop HMOs \nfrom profiteering in ways that jeopardizing patients' health or their \nvery lives.\n  The GOP-HMO line of defense continues to be to block any legislation, \nrefuse to allow fair debate, and give the HMO industry's anti-reform TV \nads a chance to bite. But the genie is out of the bottle, and that \ncynical strategy will fail.\n  It's time for Congress to end the abuses of patients and physicians \nby HMOs and managed care health plans. Too often, managed care is mis-\nmanaged care. No amount of distortions or smokescreens by insurance \ncompanies can change the facts. A real Patients' Bill of Rights can \nstop these abuses. Let's pass it now, before more patients have to \nsuffer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two articles on the film \n``As Good As It Gets'' be printed in the Record. The first is a March \n29 Boston Globe column by Ellen Goodman. The second is a January 12 \narticle in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, which to my knowledge is the \nfirst report of the extraordinary impact of the film on the HMO debate, \nand which mentions State Representative Thomas Holbrook of Belleville, \nMissouri as the first elected official to recognize this impact.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From The Boston Globe, March 29, 1998]\n\n                           (By Ellen Goodman)\n\n                          The HMO Horror Show\n\n       Too bad they don't have a Oscar for the Single Best Line in \n     a movie. A zeitgeist award for the sentence you want to \n     freeze-frame, the magical moment when Hollywood fantasy meets \n     daily life, with they get it absolutely right.\n       Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson picked up a couple of statues \n     last week for Best Actress and Best Actor in ``As Good as It \n     Gets.'' But the Best Line prize belongs to the scribbler who \n     put a string of ungenteel words in Hunt's mouth. When the \n     distraught mother gave her opinion about the managed medical \n     attention being given her asthmatic son, she exploded: ``F---\n     --- HMO B------ Pieces of S---!''\n       At this outburst--with none of the expletives deleted--\n     audiences all over America spontaneously burst out in \n     applause. It was one of those moments when you know the tide \n     has turned.\n       HMOs have become the new expletive--undeleted. Managed-care \n     companies are rapidly replacing tobacco companies as \n     corporate demons. Indeed, if you watch ``The Rainmaker,'' the \n     HMOs are taking the place of the Russkies as the bad guys. As \n     Ronald Glasser, a Minneapolis pediatrician, HMO critic, and \n     moviegoer who was downing popcorn when the audience roared at \n     Hunt, exclaims, ``I looked around and said, `My God, the \n     people are way ahead of the politicians on this.' ''\n       A few years ago, the public saw doctors as rich \n     professionals who overcharged on Tuesday and played golf on \n     Wednesday. The weakness in the system was cost control--or \n     cost out of control.\n       Now doctors and consumers are becoming allies on the same \n     side, fighting the HMOs, hassling the 800 numbers, trapped in \n     a medical system we suspect is being run by accountants. The \n     weakness in the system is trust. Or rather, mistrust.\n       It is an astonishingly swift transformation. Bob Blendon, \n     who polls health care issues at Harvard's School of Public \n     Health, is about to publish a study of the consumer backlash \n     that confirms Helen Hunt's less professorial opinion. His \n     survey of surveys proves, he says, that ``we have changed the \n     whole politics of the health field. Essentially patients and \n     doctors have come together in a new class of exploited \n     people.''\n       On the one hand, polls show that most Americans are \n     satisfied with their own health care plans. On the other \n     hand, they favor some type of government regulation.\n       These two views seem contradictory, but the backlash is \n     based on the widespread anxiety about what happens if they \n     get sick. ``People have come to believe,'' says Blendon, \n     ``that these plans won't do the right thing for them when \n     they are very sick.''\n       There isn't yet much objective research to show how often \n     health care is refused, or how often the hassles and hurdles \n     have lethal consequences. The backlash is driven by horror \n     stories of health care plans that won't pay for emergency \n     care, by anecdotes of cancer referrals denied or delayed, by \n     firsthand stories about a mother, a sister, a neighbor, a \n     friend.\n       We have gotten the big picture as well. About 15 percent of \n     the population accounts for 80 percent of the medical bills. \n     In the phrase Glasser used in the March issue of Harper's, \n     HMOs are ``a Ponzi scheme'' in which the premiums have to \n     keep ahead of claims.\n       But the backlash scenario presents the HMOs with a dilemma. \n     On the one hand, employers and employees may choose a system \n     based on how it treats the very ill. On the other hand, HMOs \n     want to enroll the very healthy.\n       In general, managed-care companies have shown the public \n     relations skills of Ken Starr. In the past year or so, we've \n     had reports of outpatient breast surgery and drive-through \n     deliveries. All we've seen in return is HMO defensiveness.\n       Now politicians who read the papers and go to the movies \n     are playing catch-up. There have been about 1,000 bills in \n     state legislatures to protect the consumers from the \n     managers.\n       In Washington, Congress is still dithering around with \n     various forms of a patients' bill of rights, with Republican \n     leadership trying to stall, duck, and weave. But it is \n     getting pushed closer to a law that would provide for an \n     external appeal to those denied care, access to emergency \n     room, and an ombudsman program.\n       As for the HMO's those folks who brought us Harry and \n     Louise are now warning us about Frankenstein. The latest ads \n     say, ``Washington: Be careful how you play doctor, you might \n     mandate a monster.''\n       A monster? It's the unmandated, unregulated system that has \n     now produced the horror movie running in everybody's head. \n     Any way you look at health care, even in a darkened theater, \n     this is not as good as it gets.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, January 12, 1998]\n\nHMOS May Highlight Hot Topics in Legislature; Bills Would Target Myriad \n                        of Patients' Complaints\n\n       State Rep. Thomas Holbrook, D-Beltsville, got a preview of \n     what may lie ahead in this year's Illinois legislative \n     session when he saw the new Jack Nicholson movie, ``As Good \n     As It Gets.''\n       In one scene, co-star Helen Hunt, playing the mother of a \n     chronically ill boy, spouts vulgarity about a health \n     maintenance organization that is refusing to give her son the \n     treatment he needs.\n       ``She starts railing on this HMO, and people in the theater \n     actually stood up and started applauding,'' Holbrook recalled \n     last week. ``When's the last time you saw that happen in a \n     theater? That's not an undercurrent, it's a tidal wave.''\n       Proposals to make HMOs more user-friendly to consumers are \n     among the major issues likely to face Illinois legislators \n     when the year's legislative session opens Wednesday.\n       Other potential topics include clamping more restrictions \n     on the campaign and contracting practices of state \n     politicians; continued controversy over hog farm waste; \n     discussions of new transportation projects in the Metro East \n     area; and minor adjustments to the major education funding \n     changes passed into law last year.\n       Technically, this year is the second half of a two-year \n     legislative session. By legislative rule in Illinois, \n     legislators in the second, even-numbered years are supposed \n     to consider only budgetary matters and emergency issues.\n       That has historically been among the most ignored rules in \n     state government, especially since even-numbered years are \n     also election years. And, with the Senate and House under \n     opposing parties--and with the House, especially, under a \n     razor-thin Democratic majority--much of the debate this year \n     is likely to be partisan and acrimonious.\n\n[[Page S9350]]\n\n       Most legislators predict there will be few concrete changes \n     on the books after the dust clears.\n       ``There's no question there will be election-generated \n     bills . . . but it will just be window-dressing,'' said Rep. \n     Kurt Granberg, D-Carlyle. ``Mainly, I think it's going to be \n     a budget year.''\n\n\n   among this year's likely topics of debate in the legislature: hmos\n\n       The House last year passed several bills that would have \n     regulated how HMOs deal with their patients and member \n     doctors. Most of that legislation has remained stalled in the \n     Senate but could be called up again through the end of this \n     year.\n       One measure, labeled the ``Patient Bill of Rights'' by its \n     supporters, would require that insurance companies provide \n     certain information to patients, would set up a formalized \n     grievance process and would make other changes to the HMO \n     industry.\n       ``There seems to be a real ground swell about this,'' said \n     Holbrook, a co-sponsor of the bill. HMO expenses and alleged \n     lack of responsiveness to patients have ``become such a \n     glaring atrocity.''\n       Not everyone agrees with that assessment. But even \n     Republican Senate President James ``Pate'' Philip of Wood \n     Dale, who has prevented most HMO-related legislation in the \n     past year from coming up for a Senate vote, is likely to open \n     the subject to debate this year.\n       ``We're going to find out what's out there,'' in the way of \n     legislation, said Patty Schuh, Philip's spokeswoman. ``This \n     is an issue that hits everyone.''\n       Propoents of the changes believe public frustration will \n     work in their favor in an election year.\n       ``That truly has a chance at moving forward,'' said Rep. \n     Jay Hoffman, D-Collinsville. ``I see bipartisan support.''\n\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Political Freedom in China \n     Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC.   . FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Congress concurs in the following conclusions of the \n     United States State Department on human rights in the \n     People's Republic of China in 1996:\n       (A) The People's Republic of China is ``an authoritarian \n     state'' in which ``citizens lack the freedom to peacefully \n     express opposition to the party-led political system and the \n     right to change their national leaders or form of \n     government''.\n       (B) The Government of the People's Republic of China has \n     ``continued to commit widespread and well-documented human \n     rights abuses, in violation of internationally accepted \n     norms, stemming from the authorities' intolerance of dissent, \n     fear of unrest, and the absence or inadequacy of laws \n     protecting basic freedoms''.\n       (C) ``[a]buses include torture and mistreatment of \n     prisoners, forced confessions, and arbitrary and \n     incommunicado detention''.\n       (D) ``[p]rison conditions remained harsh [and] [t]he \n     Government continued severe restrictions on freedom of \n     speech, the press, assembly, association, religion, privacy, \n     and worker rights''.\n       (E) ``[a]lthough the Government denies that it holds \n     political prisoners, the number of persons detained or \n     serving sentences for `counterrevolutionary crimes' or \n     `crimes against the state', or for peaceful political or \n     religious activities are believed to number in the \n     thousands''.\n       (F) ``[n]onapproved religious groups, including Protestant \n     and Catholic groups . . . experienced intensified \n     repression''.\n       (G) ``[s]erious human rights abuses persist in minority \n     areas, including Tibet, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia[, and] \n     [c]ontrols on religion and on other fundamental freedoms in \n     these areas have also intensified''.\n       (H) ``[o]verall in 1996, the authorities stepped up efforts \n     to cut off expressions of protest or criticism. All public \n     dissent against the party and government was effectively \n     silenced by intimidation, exile, the imposition of prison \n     terms, administrative detention, or house arrest. No \n     dissidents were known to be active at year's end.''.\n       (2) In addition to the State Department, credible \n     independent human rights organizations have documented an \n     increase in repression in China during 1995, and effective \n     destruction of the dissident movement through the arrest and \n     sentencing of the few remaining pro-democracy and human \n     rights activists not already in prison or exile.\n       (3) Among those were Li Hai, sentenced to 9 years in prison \n     on December 18, 1996, for gathering information on the \n     victims of the 1989 crackdown, which according to the court's \n     verdict constituted ``state secrets''; Liu Nianchun, an \n     independent labor organizer, sentenced to 3 years of ``re-\n     education through labor'' on July 4, 1996, due to his \n     activities in connection with a petition campaign calling for \n     human rights reforms; and Ngodrup Phuntsog, a Tibetan \n     national, who was arrested in Tibet in 1987 immediately after \n     he returned from a 2-year trip to India, where the Tibetan \n     government in exile is located, and following a secret trial \n     was convicted by the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China of espionage on behalf of the ``Ministry of Security of \n     the Dalai clique''.\n       (4) Many political prisoners are suffering from poor \n     conditions and ill-treatment leading to serious medical and \n     health problems, including--\n       (A) Gao Yu, a journalist sentenced to 6 years in prison in \n     November 1994 and honored by UNESCO in May 1997, has a heart \n     condition; and\n       (B) Chen Longde, a leading human rights advocate now \n     serving a 3-year reeducation through labor sentence imposed \n     without trial in August 1995, has reportedly been subject to \n     repeated beatings and electric shocks at a labor camp for \n     refusing to confess his guilt.\n       (5) The People's Republic of China, as a member of the \n     United Nations, is expected to abide by the provisions of the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n       (6) The People's Republic of China is a party to numerous \n     international human rights conventions, including the \n     Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or \n     Degrading Treatment or Punishment.\n\n     SEC.   . CONDUCT OF FOREIGN RELATIONS.\n\n       (a) Release of Prisoners: The Secretary of State, in all \n     official meetings with the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China, should request the immediate and \n     unconditional release of Ngodrup Phuntsog and other prisoners \n     of conscience in Tibet, as well as in the People's Republic \n     of China.\n       (b) Access to Prisons: The Secretary of State should seek \n     access for international humanitarian organizations to \n     Drapchi prison and other prisons in Tibet, as well as in the \n     People's Republic of China, to ensure that prisoners are not \n     being mistreated and are receiving necessary medical \n     treatment.\n       (c) Dialogue on Future of Tibet: The Secretary of State, in \n     all official meetings with the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China, should call on that country to begin \n     serious discussions with the Dalai Lama or his \n     representives, without preconditions, on the future of \n     Tibet.\n\n     SEC.  . AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR ADDITIONAL \n                   PERSONNEL AT DIPLOMATIC POSTS TO MONITOR HUMAN \n                   RIGHTS IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to support \n     personnel to monitor political repression in the People's \n     Republic of China in the United States Embassies in Beijing \n     and Kathmandu, as well as the American consulates in \n     Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shenyang, Chengdu, and Hong Kong, \n     $2,200,000 for fiscal year 1999 and $2,200,000 for fiscal \n     year 2000.\n\n     SEC.  . DEMOCRACY BUILDING IN CHINA.\n\n       (a) Authorization of Appropriations for NED.--In addition \n     to such sums as are otherwise authorized to be approprited \n     for the ``National Endowment for Democracy'' for fiscal years \n     1999 and 2000, there are authorized for the ``National \n     Endowment for Democracy'' $4,000,000 for fiscal year 1999 and \n     $4,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, which shall be available to \n     promote democracy, civil society, and the development of the \n     rule of law in China.\n       (b) East Asia-Pacific Regional Democracy Fund.--The \n     Secretary of State shall use funds available in the East \n     Asia-Pacific Regional Democracy Fund to provide grants to \n     nongovernmental organizations to promote democracy, civil \n     society, and the development of the rule of law in China.\n\n     SEC.  . HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA.\n\n       (a) Reports.--Not later than March 30, 1999, and each \n     subsequent year thereafter, the Secretary of State shall \n     submit to the International Relations Committee of the House \n     of Representatives and the Foreign\n\n[[Page S9351]]\n\n     Relations Committee of the Senate an annual report on human \n     rights in China, including religious persecution, the \n     development of democratic institutions, and the rule of law. \n     Reports shall provide information on each region in China.\n       (b) Prisoner Information Registry.--The Secretary of State \n     shall establish a Prisoner Information Registry for China \n     which shall provide information on all political prisoners, \n     prisoners of conscience, and prisoners of faith in China. \n     Such information shall include the charges, judicial \n     processes, adminstrative actions, use of forced labor, \n     incidences of tortue, length of imprisonment, physical and \n     health conditions, and other matters related to the \n     incarceration of such prisoners in China. The Secretary of \n     State is authorized to make funds available to \n     nongovernmental organizations presently engaged in monitoring \n     activities regarding Chinese political prisoners to assist in \n     the creation and maintenance of the registry.\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING ESTABLISHMENT OF A \n                   COMMISSION ON SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN ASIA.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that Congress, the President, \n     and the Secretary of State should work with the governments \n     of other countries to establish a Commission on Security and \n     Cooperation in Asia which would be modeled after the \n     Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe.\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING DEMOCRACY IN HONG KONG.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the people of Hong Kong \n     should continue to have the right and ability to freely elect \n     their legislative representatives, and that the procedure for \n     the conduct of the elections of the legislature of the Hong \n     Kong Special Administrative Region should be determined by \n     the people of Hong Kong through an election law convention, a \n     referendum, or both.\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO ORGAN HARVESTING AND \n                   TRANSPLANTING IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF \n                   CHINA.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Government of the People's Republic of China should \n     stop the practice of harvesting and transplanting organs for \n     profit from prisoners that it executes;\n       (2) the Government of the People's Republic of China should \n     be strongly condemned for such organ harvesting and \n     transplanting practice;\n       (3) the President should bar from entry into the United \n     States any and all officials of the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China known to be directly involved in \n     such organ harvesting and transplanting practice;\n       (4) individuals determined to be participating in or \n     otherwise facilitating the sale of such organs in the United \n     States should be prosecuted to the fullest possible extent of \n     the law; and\n       (5) the appropriate officials in the United States should \n     interview individuals, including doctors, who may have \n     knowledge of such organ harvesting and transplanting \n     practice.\n\n  Mr. President, let me speak a little bit about this amendment. I \ndon't intend to take up too much of the Senate's time discussing it, \nbecause I know other Senators, including Senator Hutchinson, are \ninterested in speaking as well to the amendment.\n  Essentially, this amendment sets forth concrete steps by which the \nUnited States would support the improvement of human rights in the \nPeople's Republic of China. Its provisions regarding human rights are \nidentical to those included in the legislation that was recently passed \nby the other Chamber by an overwhelming vote of 394-29.\n  The amendment I am offering is based on the recognition that the \nUnited States can conduct meaningful engagement with China only if we \nare honest with Chinese leaders, and only if we are willing to stand up \nfor our principles. And chief among the principles on which our nation \nwas founded is an abiding commitment to fundamental human rights.\n  The current regime in China suppresses fundamental human rights on a \ndaily basis:\n  Women pregnant with their second or third child are pressured to have \nabortions and even subjected to forced abortion and sterilization.\n  Religious exercise is violently suppressed among Christians in China, \nand among indigenous Buddhists in Tibet.\n  Proponents of democracy and human rights are imprisoned under \ninhumane conditions and often denied necessary medical treatment.\n  I could go on, Mr. President. The list of human rights abuses in \nChina is as long as it is deplorable.\n  Let no one in this body be mistaken, the current Chinese regime does \nnot respect fundamental human rights.\n  The question I think we have to ask is, Should that influence how \nAmerican policy toward China is shaped? Obviously, there are some who \nsay the only way for us to change those policies in China is to have a \ncomplete and total engagement with the People's Republic of China. \nObviously, that is one point of view. But I subscribe to the view that \nwe can take constructive steps designed to try to change things and to \ntry to make things more consistent with America's views of appropriate \nhuman rights behavior.\n  And the Chinese regime's recent conduct gives us no reason to expect \nimprovement any time soon. Indeed, Mr. President, since President \nClinton returned from his trip to China this June, that government has \ndetained 21 prominent human rights activists. At least three remain in \ncustody today.\n  Through this amendment, Mr. President, we would make clear to the \nChinese government our opposition to its oppressive practices and \ninitiate concrete steps by which we can monitor human rights abuses and \nassist those seeking to promote human dignity and civil society.\n  Among the provisions in this amendment: First, it contains findings \ndetailing the deplorable human rights record of the Chinese government. \nSecond, the amendment calls for greater efforts on the part of our \nSecretary of State to improve the behavior of the current Chinese \nregime:\n  It calls on the Secretary of State, during official meetings with the \nChinese government, to call for the release of political prisoners in \nChina and Tibet.\n  The amendment also calls on the Secretary of State to seek greater \naccess for international humanitarian organizations to prisons in Tibet \nand China--access that will ensure that prisoners are not being \nmistreated and that they are receiving necessary medical treatment.\n  And the amendment calls on the Secretary of State, during official \nmeetings, to request that China begin serious discussions with the \nDalai Lama or his representatives, without preconditions, on the future \nof Tibet.\n  Third, the amendment authorizes funding for several programs intended \nto improve human rights conditions in China. These include: $2.2 \nmillion in 1999 and 2000 for additional personnel at diplomatic posts \nto monitor human rights in China; $4 million in 1999 and 2000 for the \nNational Endowment for Democracy to promote democracy, civil society, \nand the development of the rule of law in China, and permission for \nfunds in the East Asia-Pacific Regional Democracy Fund to be used to \nprovide grants to nongovernmental organizations to promote democracy, \ncivil society, and the development of the rule of law in China.\n  Fifth, the amendment contains provisions aimed at improving our \nmonitoring of human rights in China.\n  These include: A call for preparation of an annual report on human \nrights, religious persecution, and the development of democratic \ninstitutions and the rule of law in China that includes specific \ninformation on each region, and establishment within the State \nDepartment of a Prisoner Information Registry for China to provide \ninformation on all political prisoners, prisoners of conscience, and \nprisoners of faith in China.\n  Finally, this amendment includes several sense of Congress \nresolutions, including: A sense-of-the-Congress resolution concerning \nthe establishment of a Commission on Security and Cooperation in Asia; \nA resolution concerning democracy in Hong Kong; and a resolution \ncondemning organ harvesting and transplantation for profit from \nprisoners executed by the Chinese government.\n  Mr. President, these provisions will make clear our determination to \nstand up for the fundamental human rights of the Chinese people.\n  As the world's first free nation, and the continuing leader of the \nfree world, we have a responsibility, in my view, to defend people's \nbasic rights wherever they are endangered or violated.\n  We cannot, without undermining freedom in our own nation, turn our \nbacks on those who suffer oppression in China, or in any other nation.\n  Our principles as well as our national interest demand that we pursue \nmeaningful engagement with the current government in China. And that \nrequires, at a minimum, an open discussion of human rights abuses and \nconcrete steps aimed at bringing those abuses to an end.\n\n[[Page S9352]]\n\n  These amendments will not destroy our current relationship with \nChina. None of the amendment's supporters seek an isolationist policy. \nI for one support normal trade relations with China because I see them \nas a necessary element of effective engagement.\n  But this amendment serves an important function in our effort to \nachieve and maintain meaningful engagement with China. it signals this \nCongress' continuing concerns for human rights, democracy, and freedom \nin China. It signals our determination to speak up and support the \nfundamental principles of civilized society.\n  Through this amendment we can stand with oppressed people of \nconscience in China, for our sake as well as theirs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Abraham \namendment 2964 to the Defense appropriations bill. The Abraham \namendment would authorize additional human rights monitors at the \nembassy in Beijing, China, as well as our other consulates around \nChina. I think it is exceptionally warranted. It is very, very much \nneeded.\n  The Chinese Government has repeatedly flaunted its lack of respect \nfor human rights. We have seen how the Government controls its people \nthrough registration, through coercive and repressive practices. We \nhave seen how the Chinese Government punishes those who would dare to \nworship by the dictates of their conscience. We have seen how the \nGovernment punishes those who would speak in the name of democracy, \nthose who would seek to register an opposition political party. They \npunish those who simply seek to fulfill normal human aspirations, \naspirations that we too often take for granted.\n  We have seen that in the last two, at least the last two annual State \nDepartment reports on human rights that China was found to be one of, \nif not the worst human rights abuser in the world today. I think that \nfact alone, the fact that our State Department, in monitoring the \ncountries of the world, the nations of the world, issuing reports on \nhuman rights conditions in the various nations of the world, found \nChina as the greatest abuser of human rights justifies the Abraham \namendment in establishing additional human rights monitors, additional \npersonnel in the embassy to monitor situations like this: ``Chinese \nResume Arrests,'' so that we will have the kind of knowledge about what \nis going on in the area of human rights within China that will allow us \nto, I think, engage China in the correct way.\n  Mr. President, we do not expect that China will change overnight, nor \ndo we expect that the amendment that I have offered dealing with forced \nabortions and religious persecution, or the amendment that Senator \nAbraham has offered will magically produce the change that we all \ndesire. But it is essential that we shed light on the kind of human \nrights abuses, the dark practices that have become too evident for too \nmany years. And it is essential that we engage those abuses with a \nsubstantive response.\n  This is part of that substantive response. The question before us is \nnot whether we contain and isolate China. We cannot do that. We should \nnot do that. We would not want to do that. The question before us is \nwhether or not we will engage them on issues of human rights, as well \nas trade, as well as national security issues, whether we will actually \nengage them, and in so doing support the cause of freedom.\n  Frankly, I am puzzled by those who would excuse themselves and pardon \nthemselves by saying that they, too, are opposed to the human rights \nabuses in China but then would oppose any effort to have a substantive \nresponse to those human rights abuses.\n  So I believe that this is not only a well-intended but a well-drafted \namendment. It is, once again, part of the package that passed in the \nHouse of Representatives now almost a year ago with overwhelming \nbipartisan support, and it is long past time for the Senate to weigh in \non that; to support the monitoring of human rights abuses in China, as \nwe seek to do throughout the world; to give the kinds of personnel to \nour State Department, to our diplomatic people to assure that we have \nthe best intelligence, the best reporting possible.\n  It is, I think, evident that this is needed in light of this latest \nround of arrests of political dissidents in China. It is puzzling to me \nthat we can talk about the great improvement in China and the reforms \nthat are taking place, and that this administration could put so much \nfaith in President Jiang and his regime in Beijing when all of the \nevidence that is forthcoming, whether it is in the media, through our \nintelligence agencies, or the State Department itself indicates that, \nin fact, those abuses are as bad as ever, and that the crackdown on \nreligious believers is now only most recently exceeded by the crackdown \non political dissidents. I do believe, as the President has expressed, \nthat eventually China will be free. I believe that. I think someday \nChina will be a country in which free expression is tolerated and the \nfreedoms that are not American values, but are fundamental human \nvalues, will exist in China. But I think it will not be through the \nregime that rules with an iron fist in Beijing, China, today. So, let \nus engage, but let us engage thoroughly and on all fronts.\n\n  The package of amendments that is before the Senate today will enable \nus to do that. So it is essential that we not table the China \namendments, that we support them, that we agree to them as part of the \nappropriations bill. I believe, because the House passed these measures \nby such an overwhelming vote, they will be preserved in the conference \nand we will be able to give the President an opportunity to truly \ninvolve this administration in an engagement policy that will reflect \nthe values that are precious to us and help to bring about the change \nthat we desire to see in China and to give support to the freedom \nfighters, freedom lovers in China today who risk the limited freedom \nthat they have to go about their daily activities by speaking out, by \nseeking to form an opposition political party, by seeking to worship \naccording to the dictates of their conscience.\n  I think it is so imperative that we go on record with these \namendments, to stand shoulder to shoulder with those who are putting \ntheir lives and their limited liberty at stake by taking a far more \ndangerous stand there, in China, today.\n  I applaud Senator Abraham for bringing the human rights monitors \namendment to the floor of the Senate, and I look forward to casting my \nvote against tabling and for the amendment. I ask my colleagues to do \nlikewise.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Matthew \nTourville, who is an intern in my office, be granted the privilege of \nthe floor while we debate and vote on this bill today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Political Freedom in China \n     Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC.   . FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Congress concurs in the following conclusions of the \n     United States State Department on human rights in the \n     People's Republic of China in 1996:\n       (A) The People's Republic of China is ``an authoritarian \n     state'' in which ``citizens lack the freedom to peacefully \n     express opposition to the party-led political system and the \n     right to change their national leaders or form of \n     government''.\n       (B) The Government of the People's Republic of China has \n     ``continued to commit widespread and well-documented human \n     rights abuses, in violation of internationally accepted \n     norms, stemming from the authorities' intolerance of dissent, \n     fear of unrest, and the absence or inadequacy of laws \n     protecting basic freedoms''.\n       (C) ``[a]buses include torture and mistreatment of \n     prisoners, forced confessions, and arbitrary and \n     incommunicado detention''.\n       (D) ``[p]rison conditions remained harsh [and] [t]he \n     Government continued severe restrictions on freedom of \n     speech, the press, assembly, association, religion, privacy, \n     and worker rights''.\n       (E) ``[a]lthough the Government denies that it holds \n     political prisoners, the number of persons detained or \n     serving sentences for `counterrevolutionary crimes' or \n     `crimes against the state', or for peaceful political or \n     religious activities are believed to number in the \n     thousands''.\n       (F) ``[n]onapproved religious groups, including Protestant \n     and Catholic groups . . . experienced intensified \n     repression''.\n       (G) ``[s]erious human rights abuses persist in minority \n     areas, including Tibet, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia[, and] \n     [c]ontrols on religion and on other fundamental freedoms in \n     these areas have also intensified''.\n       (H) ``[o]verall in 1996, the authorities stepped up efforts \n     to cut off expressions of protest or criticism. All public \n     dissent against the party and government was effectively \n     silenced by intimidation, exile, the imposition of prison \n     terms, administrative detention, or house arrest. No \n     dissidents were known to be active at year's end.''.\n       (2) In addition to the State Department, credible \n     independent human rights organizations have documented an \n     increase in repression in China during 1995, and effective \n     destruction of the dissident movement through the arrest and \n     sentencing of the few remaining pro-democracy and human \n     rights activists not already in prison or exile.\n       (3) Among those were Li Hai, sentenced to 9 years in prison \n     on December 18, 1996, for gathering information on the \n     victims of the 1989 crackdown, which according to the court's \n     verdict constituted ``state secrets''; Liu Nianchun, an \n     independent labor organizer, sentenced to 3 years of ``re-\n     education through labor'' on July 4, 1996, due to his \n     activities in connection with a petition campaign calling for \n     human rights reforms; and Ngodrup Phuntsog, a Tibetan \n     national, who was arrested in Tibet in 1987 immediately after \n     he returned from a 2-year trip to India, where the Tibetan \n     government in exile is located, and following a secret trial \n     was convicted by the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China of espionage on behalf of the ``Ministry of Security of \n     the Dalai clique''.\n       (4) Many political prisoners are suffering from poor \n     conditions and ill-treatment leading to serious medical and \n     health problems, including--\n       (A) Gao Yu, a journalist sentenced to 6 years in prison in \n     November 1994 and honored by UNESCO in May 1997, has a heart \n     condition; and\n       (B) Chen Longde, a leading human rights advocate now \n     serving a 3-year reeducation through labor sentence imposed \n     without trial in August 1995, has reportedly been subject to \n     repeated beatings and electric shocks at a labor camp for \n     refusing to confess his guilt.\n       (5) The People's Republic of China, as a member of the \n     United Nations, is expected to abide by the provisions of the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n       (6) The People's Republic of China is a party to numerous \n     international human rights conventions, including the \n     Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or \n     Degrading Treatment or Punishment.\n\n     SEC.   . CONDUCT OF FOREIGN RELATIONS.\n\n       (a) Release of Prisoners: The Secretary of State, in all \n     official meetings with the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China, should request the immediate and \n     unconditional release of Ngodrup Phuntsog and other prisoners \n     of conscience in Tibet, as well as in the People's Republic \n     of China.\n       (b) Access to Prisons: The Secretary of State should seek \n     access for international humanitarian organizations to \n     Drapchi prison and other prisons in Tibet, as well as in the \n     People's Republic of China, to ensure that prisoners are not \n     being mistreated and are receiving necessary medical \n     treatment.\n       (c) Dialogue on Future of Tibet: The Secretary of State, in \n     all official meetings with the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China, should call on that country to begin \n     serious discussions with the Dalai Lama or his \n     representives, without preconditions, on the future of \n     Tibet.\n\n     SEC.  . AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR ADDITIONAL \n                   PERSONNEL AT DIPLOMATIC POSTS TO MONITOR HUMAN \n                   RIGHTS IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to support \n     personnel to monitor political repression in the People's \n     Republic of China in the United States Embassies in Beijing \n     and Kathmandu, as well as the American consulates in \n     Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shenyang, Chengdu, and Hong Kong, \n     $2,200,000 for fiscal year 1999 and $2,200,000 for fiscal \n     year 2000.\n\n     SEC.  . DEMOCRACY BUILDING IN CHINA.\n\n       (a) Authorization of Appropriations for NED.--In addition \n     to such sums as are otherwise authorized to be approprited \n     for the ``National Endowment for Democracy'' for fiscal years \n     1999 and 2000, there are authorized for the ``National \n     Endowment for Democracy'' $4,000,000 for fiscal year 1999 and \n     $4,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, which shall be available to \n     promote democracy, civil society, and the development of the \n     rule of law in China.\n       (b) East Asia-Pacific Regional Democracy Fund.--The \n     Secretary of State shall use funds available in the East \n     Asia-Pacific Regional Democracy Fund to provide grants to \n     nongovernmental organizations to promote democracy, civil \n     society, and the development of the rule of law in China.\n\n     SEC.  . HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA.\n\n       (a) Reports.--Not later than March 30, 1999, and each \n     subsequent year thereafter, the Secretary of State shall \n     submit to the International Relations Committee of the House \n     of Representatives and the Foreign\n\n[[Page S9351]]\n\n     Relations Committee of the Senate an annual report on human \n     rights in China, including religious persecution, the \n     development of democratic institutions, and the rule of law. \n     Reports shall provide information on each region in China.\n       (b) Prisoner Information Registry.--The Secretary of State \n     shall establish a Prisoner Information Registry for China \n     which shall provide information on all political prisoners, \n     prisoners of conscience, and prisoners of faith in China. \n     Such information shall include the charges, judicial \n     processes, adminstrative actions, use of forced labor, \n     incidences of tortue, length of imprisonment, physical and \n     health conditions, and other matters related to the \n     incarceration of such prisoners in China. The Secretary of \n     State is authorized to make funds available to \n     nongovernmental organizations presently engaged in monitoring \n     activities regarding Chinese political prisoners to assist in \n     the creation and maintenance of the registry.\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING ESTABLISHMENT OF A \n                   COMMISSION ON SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN ASIA.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that Congress, the President, \n     and the Secretary of State should work with the governments \n     of other countries to establish a Commission on Security and \n     Cooperation in Asia which would be modeled after the \n     Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe.\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING DEMOCRACY IN HONG KONG.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the people of Hong Kong \n     should continue to have the right and ability to freely elect \n     their legislative representatives, and that the procedure for \n     the conduct of the elections of the legislature of the Hong \n     Kong Special Administrative Region should be determined by \n     the people of Hong Kong through an election law convention, a \n     referendum, or both.\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO ORGAN HARVESTING AND \n                   TRANSPLANTING IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF \n                   CHINA.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Government of the People's Republic of China should \n     stop the practice of harvesting and transplanting organs for \n     profit from prisoners that it executes;\n       (2) the Government of the People's Republic of China should \n     be strongly condemned for such organ harvesting and \n     transplanting practice;\n       (3) the President should bar from entry into the United \n     States any and all officials of the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China known to be directly involved in \n     such organ harvesting and transplanting practice;\n       (4) individuals determined to be participating in or \n     otherwise facilitating the sale of such organs in the United \n     States should be prosecuted to the fullest possible extent of \n     the law; and\n       (5) the appropriate officials in the United States should \n     interview individuals, including doctors, who may have \n     knowledge of such organ harvesting and transplanting \n     practice.\n\n  Mr. President, let me speak a little bit about this amendment. I \ndon't intend to take up too much of the Senate's time discussing it, \nbecause I know other Senators, including Senator Hutchinson, are \ninterested in speaking as well to the amendment.\n  Essentially, this amendment sets forth concrete steps by which the \nUnited States would support the improvement of human rights in the \nPeople's Republic of China. Its provisions regarding human rights are \nidentical to those included in the legislation that was recently passed \nby the other Chamber by an overwhelming vote of 394-29.\n  The amendment I am offering is based on the recognition that the \nUnited States can conduct meaningful engagement with China only if we \nare honest with Chinese leaders, and only if we are willing to stand up \nfor our principles. And chief among the principles on which our nation \nwas founded is an abiding commitment to fundamental human rights.\n  The current regime in China suppresses fundamental human rights on a \ndaily basis:\n  Women pregnant with their second or third child are pressured to have \nabortions and even subjected to forced abortion and sterilization.\n  Religious exercise is violently suppressed among Christians in China, \nand among indigenous Buddhists in Tibet.\n  Proponents of democracy and human rights are imprisoned under \ninhumane conditions and often denied necessary medical treatment.\n  I could go on, Mr. President. The list of human rights abuses in \nChina is as long as it is deplorable.\n  Let no one in this body be mistaken, the current Chinese regime does \nnot respect fundamental human rights.\n  The question I think we have to ask is, Should that influence how \nAmerican policy toward China is shaped? Obviously, there are some who \nsay the only way for us to change those policies in China is to have a \ncomplete and total engagement with the People's Republic of China. \nObviously, that is one point of view. But I subscribe to the view that \nwe can take constructive steps designed to try to change things and to \ntry to make things more consistent with America's views of appropriate \nhuman rights behavior.\n  And the Chinese regime's recent conduct gives us no reason to expect \nimprovement any time soon. Indeed, Mr. President, since President \nClinton returned from his trip to China this June, that government has \ndetained 21 prominent human rights activists. At least three remain in \ncustody today.\n  Through this amendment, Mr. President, we would make clear to the \nChinese government our opposition to its oppressive practices and \ninitiate concrete steps by which we can monitor human rights abuses and \nassist those seeking to promote human dignity and civil society.\n  Among the provisions in this amendment: First, it contains findings \ndetailing the deplorable human rights record of the Chinese government. \nSecond, the amendment calls for greater efforts on the part of our \nSecretary of State to improve the behavior of the current Chinese \nregime:\n  It calls on the Secretary of State, during official meetings with the \nChinese government, to call for the release of political prisoners in \nChina and Tibet.\n  The amendment also calls on the Secretary of State to seek greater \naccess for international humanitarian organizations to prisons in Tibet \nand China--access that will ensure that prisoners are not being \nmistreated and that they are receiving necessary medical treatment.\n  And the amendment calls on the Secretary of State, during official \nmeetings, to request that China begin serious discussions with the \nDalai Lama or his representatives, without preconditions, on the future \nof Tibet.\n  Third, the amendment authorizes funding for several programs intended \nto improve human rights conditions in China. These include: $2.2 \nmillion in 1999 and 2000 for additional personnel at diplomatic posts \nto monitor human rights in China; $4 million in 1999 and 2000 for the \nNational Endowment for Democracy to promote democracy, civil society, \nand the development of the rule of law in China, and permission for \nfunds in the East Asia-Pacific Regional Democracy Fund to be used to \nprovide grants to nongovernmental organizations to promote democracy, \ncivil society, and the development of the rule of law in China.\n  Fifth, the amendment contains provisions aimed at improving our \nmonitoring of human rights in China.\n  These include: A call for preparation of an annual report on human \nrights, religious persecution, and the development of democratic \ninstitutions and the rule of law in China that includes specific \ninformation on each region, and establishment within the State \nDepartment of a Prisoner Information Registry for China to provide \ninformation on all political prisoners, prisoners of conscience, and \nprisoners of faith in China.\n  Finally, this amendment includes several sense of Congress \nresolutions, including: A sense-of-the-Congress resolution concerning \nthe establishment of a Commission on Security and Cooperation in Asia; \nA resolution concerning democracy in Hong Kong; and a resolution \ncondemning organ harvesting and transplantation for profit from \nprisoners executed by the Chinese government.\n  Mr. President, these provisions will make clear our determination to \nstand up for the fundamental human rights of the Chinese people.\n  As the world's first free nation, and the continuing leader of the \nfree world, we have a responsibility, in my view, to defend people's \nbasic rights wherever they are endangered or violated.\n  We cannot, without undermining freedom in our own nation, turn our \nbacks on those who suffer oppression in China, or in any other nation.\n  Our principles as well as our national interest demand that we pursue \nmeaningful engagement with the current government in China. And that \nrequires, at a minimum, an open discussion of human rights abuses and \nconcrete steps aimed at bringing those abuses to an end.\n\n[[Page S9352]]\n\n  These amendments will not destroy our current relationship with \nChina. None of the amendment's supporters seek an isolationist policy. \nI for one support normal trade relations with China because I see them \nas a necessary element of effective engagement.\n  But this amendment serves an important function in our effort to \nachieve and maintain meaningful engagement with China. it signals this \nCongress' continuing concerns for human rights, democracy, and freedom \nin China. It signals our determination to speak up and support the \nfundamental principles of civilized society.\n  Through this amendment we can stand with oppressed people of \nconscience in China, for our sake as well as theirs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Abraham \namendment 2964 to the Defense appropriations bill. The Abraham \namendment would authorize additional human rights monitors at the \nembassy in Beijing, China, as well as our other consulates around \nChina. I think it is exceptionally warranted. It is very, very much \nneeded.\n  The Chinese Government has repeatedly flaunted its lack of respect \nfor human rights. We have seen how the Government controls its people \nthrough registration, through coercive and repressive practices. We \nhave seen how the Chinese Government punishes those who would dare to \nworship by the dictates of their conscience. We have seen how the \nGovernment punishes those who would speak in the name of democracy, \nthose who would seek to register an opposition political party. They \npunish those who simply seek to fulfill normal human aspirations, \naspirations that we too often take for granted.\n  We have seen that in the last two, at least the last two annual State \nDepartment reports on human rights that China was found to be one of, \nif not the worst human rights abuser in the world today. I think that \nfact alone, the fact that our State Department, in monitoring the \ncountries of the world, the nations of the world, issuing reports on \nhuman rights conditions in the various nations of the world, found \nChina as the greatest abuser of human rights justifies the Abraham \namendment in establishing additional human rights monitors, additional \npersonnel in the embassy to monitor situations like this: ``Chinese \nResume Arrests,'' so that we will have the kind of knowledge about what \nis going on in the area of human rights within China that will allow us \nto, I think, engage China in the correct way.\n  Mr. President, we do not expect that China will change overnight, nor \ndo we expect that the amendment that I have offered dealing with forced \nabortions and religious persecution, or the amendment that Senator \nAbraham has offered will magically produce the change that we all \ndesire. But it is essential that we shed light on the kind of human \nrights abuses, the dark practices that have become too evident for too \nmany years. And it is essential that we engage those abuses with a \nsubstantive response.\n  This is part of that substantive response. The question before us is \nnot whether we contain and isolate China. We cannot do that. We should \nnot do that. We would not want to do that. The question before us is \nwhether or not we will engage them on issues of human rights, as well \nas trade, as well as national security issues, whether we will actually \nengage them, and in so doing support the cause of freedom.\n  Frankly, I am puzzled by those who would excuse themselves and pardon \nthemselves by saying that they, too, are opposed to the human rights \nabuses in China but then would oppose any effort to have a substantive \nresponse to those human rights abuses.\n  So I believe that this is not only a well-intended but a well-drafted \namendment. It is, once again, part of the package that passed in the \nHouse of Representatives now almost a year ago with overwhelming \nbipartisan support, and it is long past time for the Senate to weigh in \non that; to support the monitoring of human rights abuses in China, as \nwe seek to do throughout the world; to give the kinds of personnel to \nour State Department, to our diplomatic people to assure that we have \nthe best intelligence, the best reporting possible.\n  It is, I think, evident that this is needed in light of this latest \nround of arrests of political dissidents in China. It is puzzling to me \nthat we can talk about the great improvement in China and the reforms \nthat are taking place, and that this administration could put so much \nfaith in President Jiang and his regime in Beijing when all of the \nevidence that is forthcoming, whether it is in the media, through our \nintelligence agencies, or the State Department itself indicates that, \nin fact, those abuses are as bad as ever, and that the crackdown on \nreligious believers is now only most recently exceeded by the crackdown \non political dissidents. I do believe, as the President has expressed, \nthat eventually China will be free. I believe that. I think someday \nChina will be a country in which free expression is tolerated and the \nfreedoms that are not American values, but are fundamental human \nvalues, will exist in China. But I think it will not be through the \nregime that rules with an iron fist in Beijing, China, today. So, let \nus engage, but let us engage thoroughly and on all fronts.\n\n  The package of amendments that is before the Senate today will enable \nus to do that. So it is essential that we not table the China \namendments, that we support them, that we agree to them as part of the \nappropriations bill. I believe, because the House passed these measures \nby such an overwhelming vote, they will be preserved in the conference \nand we will be able to give the President an opportunity to truly \ninvolve this administration in an engagement policy that will reflect \nthe values that are precious to us and help to bring about the change \nthat we desire to see in China and to give support to the freedom \nfighters, freedom lovers in China today who risk the limited freedom \nthat they have to go about their daily activities by speaking out, by \nseeking to form an opposition political party, by seeking to worship \naccording to the dictates of their conscience.\n  I think it is so imperative that we go on record with these \namendments, to stand shoulder to shoulder with those who are putting \ntheir lives and their limited liberty at stake by taking a far more \ndangerous stand there, in China, today.\n  I applaud Senator Abraham for bringing the human rights monitors \namendment to the floor of the Senate, and I look forward to casting my \nvote against tabling and for the amendment. I ask my colleagues to do \nlikewise.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from \nthe July 20, 1998, edition of U.S. News & World Report and an article \nfrom the July 20, 1998, edition of Newsweek be printed in the Record. \nThe two articles are relevant to the speech that I delivered on Tuesday \nthis week entitled ``Man's Longing for Immortality Shall Achieve Its \nRealization.''\n  I understand the Government Printing Office estimates it will cost \napproximately $1,283 to have these articles printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From U.S. News & World Report, July 20, 1998]\n\n          Scientists and Theologians Discover a Common Ground\n\n       Darwin, Freud, relativity, the mechanics of the big bang--\n     rightly or wrongly, all have been taken as supporting the \n     modernistic conception of a change-based world in which \n     forces devoid of meaning account for all outcomes. Some \n     thinkers have maintained that the big-bang theory shows that \n     no god was necessary at the creation. Intellectuals have \n     wrung their hands in angst about how bang-caused cosmic \n     expansion will result in an inescapable running down of the \n     stars, proving existence to be pointless. A depressing \n     inevitable death of the universe figures prominently in the \n     works of post-modern novelist Thomas Pynchon; while in the \n     movie Annie Hall, Woody Allen's character is psychologically \n     paralyzed by his dread of the galaxies expanding until they \n     die.\n       By contrast new developments in big-bang science are almost \n     supernaturally upbeat: The universe wants us, and the stars \n     will shine forever!\n       This remarkable change in perspectives is helping inspire a \n     warming trend between scientific and spiritual disciplines. A \n     conference last month in Berkeley, Calif., at which \n     cosmologists discussed the theological implications of their \n     work, is representative. Allan Sandage, one of the world's \n     leading astronomers, told the gathering that contemplating \n     the majesty of the big bang helped make him a believer in \n     God, willing to accept that creation could only be explained \n     as a ``miracle.''\n\n\n                                Heresies\n\n       Not that long ago, such a comment from an establishment \n     scientist would have been shocking. The mere existence of the \n     organization that sponsored the Berkeley event, a well-\n     regarded academic group called the Center for Theology and \n     the Natural Sciences, might have been snickered at. Today, \n     ``intellectuals are beginning to find it respectable'' to \n     talk about how physical law seems to favor life, notes Ian \n     Barbour, a professor of both religion and physics at Carleton \n     College, in Northfield, Minn.\n       In this vein, the recent book Consilience by Harvard \n     biologist E.O. Wilson argues that there is no need to wall \n     off scientific from moral thought; rather, people should once \n     again pursue the Enlightenment vision of reconciling the \n     technical and the spiritual. A boomlet of serious books with \n     titles such as A Case Against Accident and Self-Organization \n     and God: The Evidence  goes further, suggesting the unknowns \n     of the big bang eventually will be seen as divine latency.\n       If nothing else, the theological idea of creation ex \n     nihilo--out of nothing--is looking better all the time as \n     ``inflation'' theories (main story) increasingly suggest the \n     universe emerged from no tangible source. The word \n     ``design,'' rejected by most 20th-century scientists as a \n     theological taboo in the context of cosmology or evolution, \n     is even creeping back into the big-bang debate. Physicist \n     Ernest Sternglass, among Einstein's last living acolytes, \n     recently argued that the propitious circumstances of the big \n     bang show that the universe is ``apparently designed for the \n     development of life and destined to live forever, neither to \n     fly apart into dying cinders nor collapse.''\n       Parallels between cosmology and spirituality may be \n     coincidence. Some fine it significant that the Book of \n     Genesis describes God creating existence out of the \n     ``waters,'' because big-bang science asserts the early \n     universe was mostly hydrogen, the chief component of \n     H2O. Maybe that tells us something; probably it's \n     just a word choice.\n       But on more telling issues, the trend line of cosmology \n     unquestionably favors a sense of purpose. Existence may be \n     eternal, prewired somehow for life; consciousness may expand \n     forever, never running out of room or resources; there may be \n     a larger cosmic enterprise waiting for us to join its \n     purpose, if we can just learn wisdom and justice.\n       Because the cosmos is ancient by our measure, people assume \n     they are latecomers, gazing out into a universe worn down and \n     faltering. But if the firmament will expand for an enormous \n     span of time, or even for an eternity, then our universe \n     glistens with morning dew. Homo sapiens may represent a youth \n     movement, arriving at a time when almost everything is still \n     to come. Dreary projections about ultimate fates may be \n     supplanted by the belief that, like the cosmos itself, the \n     human prospect is, as the physicist Freeman Dyson once wrote, \n     ``infinite in all directions.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From Newsweek, July 20, 1998]\n\n                           Science Finds God\n\n                           (By Sharon Begley)\n\n       The more deeply scientists see into the secrets of the \n     universe, you'd expect, the more God would fade away from \n     their hearts and minds. But that's not how it went for Allan \n     Sandage. Now slightly stooped and white-haired at 72, Sandage \n     has spent a professional lifetime coaxing secrets out of the \n     stars, peering through telescopes from Chile to California in \n     the hope of spying nothing less than the origins and destiny \n     of the universe. As much as any other 20th-century \n     astronomer, Sandage actually figured it out: his observations \n     of distance stars showed how fast the universe is expanding \n     and how old it is (15 billion years or so). But through it \n     all Sandage, who says he was ``almost a practicing atheist as \n     a boy,'' was nagged by mysteries whose answers were not to be \n     found in the glittering panoply of supernovas. Among them: \n     why is there something rather than nothing? Sandage began to \n     despair of answering such questions through reason alone, and \n     so, at 50, he willed himself to accept God. ``It was my \n     science that drove me to the conclusion that the world is \n     much more complicated than can be explained by science,'' he \n     says. ``It is only through the supernatural that I can \n     understand the mystery of existence.''\n       Something surprising is happening between those two old \n     warhorses science and religion.\n       Historically, they have alternated between mutual support \n     and bitter enmity. Although religious doctrine midwifed the \n     birth of the experimental method centuries ago (following \n     story), faith and reason soon parted ways. Galileo, Darwin \n     and others whose research challenged church dogma were \n     branded heretics, and the polite way to reconcile science and \n     theology was to simply agree that each would keep to its own \n     realm: science would ask, and answer, empirical questions \n     like ``what'' and ``how''; religion would confront the \n     spiritual, wondering ``why.'' But as science grew in \n     authority and power beginning with the Enlightenment, this \n     detente broke down. Some of its greatest minds dismissed God \n     as an unnecessary hypothesis, one they didn't need to explain \n     how galaxies came to shine or how life grew so complex. Since \n     the birth of the universe could now be explained by the laws \n     of physics alone, the late astronomer and atheist Carl Sagan \n     concluded, there was ``nothing for a Creator to do,'' and \n     every thinking person was therefore forced to admit ``the \n     absence of God.'' Today the scientific community so scorns \n     faith, says Sandage, that ``there is a reluctance to reveal \n     yourself as a believer, the opporobrium is so severe.''\n       Some clergy are no more tolerant of scientists. A fellow \n     researcher and friend of Sandage's was told by a pastor, \n     ``Unless you accept and believe that the Earth and universe \n     are only 6,000 years old [as a literal reading of the Bible \n     implies], you cannot be a Christian.'' It is little wonder \n     that people of faith resent science: by reducing the miracle \n     of life to a series of biochemical reactions, by explaining \n     Creation as a hiccup in space-time, science seems to \n     undermine belief, render existence meaningless and rob the \n     world of spiritual wonder.\n       But now ``theology and science are entering into a new \n     relationship,'' says physicist turned theologian Robert John \n     Russell, who in 1981 founded the Center for Theology and the \n     Natural Sciences at the Graduate Theological Union in \n     Berkeley. Rather than undercutting faith and a sense of the \n     spiritual, scientific discoveries are offering support for \n     them, at least in the minds of people of faith. Big-bang \n     cosmology, for instance, once read as leaving no room for a \n     Creator, now implies to some scientists that there is a \n     design and purpose behind the universe. Evolution, say some \n     scientist-theologians, provides clues to the very nature of \n     God. And chaos theory, which describes such mundane processes \n     as the patterns of weather and the dripping of faucets, is \n     being interpreted as opening a door for God to act in the \n     world.\n       From Georgetown to Berkeley, theologians who embrace \n     science, and scientists who cannot abide the spiritual \n     emptiness of empiricism, are establishing institutes \n     integrating the two. Books like ``Science and Theology: The \n     New Consonance'' and ``Belief in God in an Age of Science'' \n     are streaming off the presses. A June symposium on ``Science \n     and the Spiritual Quest,'' organized by Russell's CTNS, drew \n     more than 320 paying attendees and 33 speakers, and a PBS \n     documentary on science and faith will air this fall.\n       In 1977 Nobel physicist Steven Weinberg of the University \n     of Texas sounded a famous note of despair: the more the \n     universe has become comprehensible through cosmology, he \n     wrote, the more it seems pointless. But now the very science \n     that ``killed'' God is, in the eyes of believers, restoring \n     faith. Physicists have stumbled on signs that the cosmos is \n     custom-made for life and consciousness. It turns out that if \n     the constants of nature--unchanging numbers like the strength \n     of gravity, the charge of an electron and the mass of a \n     proton--were the tiniest bit different, then atoms would not \n     hold together, stars would not burn and life would never have \n     made an appearance. ``When you realize that the laws of \n     nature must be incredibly finely tuned to produce the \n     universe we see,'' says John Polkinghorne, who had a \n     distinguished career as a physicist at Cambridge University \n     before becoming an Anglican priest in 1982, ``that conspires \n     to plant the\n\n[[Page S9354]]\n\n     idea that the universe did not just happen, but that there \n     must be a purpose behind it.'' Charles Townes, who shared the \n     1964 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering the principles of \n     the laser, goes further: ``Many have a feeling that somehow \n     intelligence must have been involved in the law of the \n     universe.''\n       Although the very rationality of science often feels like \n     an enemy of the spiritual, here, too, a new reading can \n     sustain rather than snuff out belief. Ever since Isaac \n     Newton, science has blared a clear message: the world follows \n     rules, rules that are fundamentally mathematical, rules that \n     humans can figure out. Humans invent abstract mathematics, \n     basically making it up out of their imaginations, yet math \n     magically turns out to describe the world. Greek \n     mathematicians divided the circumference of a circle by its \n     diameter, for example, and got the number pi, 3.14159 . . . . \n     Pi turns up in equations that describe subatomic particles, \n     light and other quantities that have no obvious connections \n     to circles. This points, says Polkinghorn, ``to a very deep \n     fact about the nature of the universe,'' namely, that our \n     minds, which invent mathematics, conform to the reality of \n     the cosmos. We are somehow tuned in to its truths. Since pure \n     thought can penetrate the universe's mysteries, ``this seems \n     to be telling us that something about human consciousness is \n     harmonious with the mind of God,'' says Carl Feit, a cancer \n     biologist at yeshiva University in New York and Talmudic \n     scholar.\n       To most worshipers, a sense of the divine as an unseen \n     presence behind the visible world is all well and good, but \n     what they really yearn for is a God who acts in the world. \n     Some scientists see an opening for this sort of god at the \n     level of quantum or subatomic events. In this spooky realm, \n     the behavior of particles is unpredictable. In perhaps the \n     most famous example, a radioactive element might have a half-\n     life of, say, one hour. Half-life means that half of the \n     atoms in a sample will decay in that time; half will not. but \n     what if you have only a single atom? Then, in an hour, it has \n     a 50-50 chance of decaying. And what if the experiment is \n     arranged so that if the atom does decay, it releases poison \n     gas? If you have a cat in the lab, will the cat be alive or \n     dead after the hour is up? Physicists have discovered that \n     there is no way to determine, even in principle, what the \n     atom would do. Some theologian-scientists see that decision \n     point--will the atom decay or not? will the cat live or \n     die?--as one where God can act. ``Quantum mechanics allows us \n     to think of special divine action,'' says Russell. Even \n     better, since few scientists abide miracles, God can act \n     without violating the law of physics.\n       An even newer science, chaos theory, describes phenomena \n     like the weather and some chemical reactions whose exact \n     outcomes cannot be predicted. It could be, says Polkinghorne, \n     that God selects which possibility becomes reality. This \n     divine action would not violate physical laws either.\n       Most scientists still park their faith, if they have it, at \n     the laboratory door. But just as belief can find inspiration \n     in science, so scientists can find inspiration in belief. \n     Physicist Mehdi Golshani of Sharif University of Technology \n     in Tehran, drawing from the Koran, believes that natural \n     phenomena are ``God's signs in the universe,'' and that \n     studying them is almost a religious obligation. The Koran \n     asks humans to ``travel in the earth, then see how He \n     initiated the creation.'' Research, Golshani says, ``is a \n     worship act, in that it reveals more of the wonders of God's \n     creation.'' The same strain runs through Judaism. Carl Feit \n     cites Maimonides, ``who said that the only pathway to achieve \n     a love of God is by understanding the works of his hand, \n     which is the natural universe. Knowing how the universe \n     functions is crucial to a religious person because this is \n     the world He created.'' Feit is hardly alone. According to a \n     study released last year, 40 percent of American scientists \n     believe in a personal God--not merely an ineffable power and \n     presence in the world, but a deity to whom they can pray.\n       To Joel Primack, an astrophysicist at the University of \n     California, Santa Cruz, ``practicing science [even] has a \n     spiritual goal''--namely, providing inspiration. It turns \n     out, explains Primack, that the largest size imaginable, the \n     entire universe, is 10 with 29 zeros after it (in \n     centimeters). The smallest size describes the subatomic \n     world, and is 10 with 24 zeros (and a decimal) in front of \n     it. Humans are right in the middle. Does this return us to a \n     privileged place? Primack doesn't know, but he describes this \n     as a ``soul-satisfying cosmology.''\n       Although skeptical scientists grumble that science has no \n     need of religion, forward-looking theologians think religion \n     needs science. Religion ``is incapable of making its moral \n     claims persuasive or its spiritual comfort effective [unless] \n     its cognitive claims'' are credible, argues physicist-\n     theologian Russell. Although upwards of 90 percent of \n     Americans believe in a personal God, fewer believe in a God \n     who parts seas, or creates species one by one. To make \n     religions forged millenniums ago relevant in an age of atoms \n     and DNA, some theologians are ``incorporat[ing] knowledge \n     gained from natural science into the formation of doctrinal \n     beliefs,'' says Ted Peters of Pacific Lutheran Seminary. \n     Otherwise, says astronomer and Jesuit priest William Stoeger, \n     religion is in danger of being seen, by people even minimally \n     acquainted with science, ``as an anachronism.''\n       Science cannot prove the existence of God, let alone spy \n     him at the end of a telescope. But to some believers, \n     learning about the universe offers clues about what God might \n     be like. As W. Mark Richardson of the Center for Theology and \n     the Natural Sciences says, ``Science may not serve as an \n     eyewitness of God the Creator, but it can serve as a \n     character witness.'' One place to get a glimpse of God's \n     character, ironically, is in the workings of evolution. \n     Arthur Peacocke, a biochemist who became a priest in the \n     Church of England in 1971, has no quarrel with evolution. To \n     the contrary: he finds in it signs of God's nature. He \n     infers, from evolution, that God has chosen to limit this \n     omnipotence and omniscience. In other words, it is the \n     appearance of chance mutations, and the Darwinian laws of \n     natural selection acting on this ``variation,'' that bring \n     about the diversity of life on Earth. This process suggests a \n     divine humility, a God who acts selflessly for the good of \n     creation, says theologian John Haught, who founded the \n     Georgetown (University) Center for the Study of Science and \n     Religion. He calls this a ``humble retreat on God's part'': \n     much as a loving parent lets a child be, and become, freely \n     and without interference, so does God let creation make \n     itself.\n       It would be an exaggeration to say that such sophisticated \n     theological thinking is remaking religion at the level of the \n     local parish, mosque or synagogue. But some of these ideas do \n     resonate with ordinary worshipers and clergy. For Billy \n     Crockett, president of Walking Angel Records in Dallas, the \n     discoveries of quantum mechanics that he reads about in the \n     paper reinforces his faith that ``there is a lot of mystery \n     in the nature of things.'' For other believers, an \n     appreciation of science deepens faith. ``Science produces in \n     me a tremendous awe,'' says Sister Mary White of the \n     Benedictine Meditation Center in St. Paul, Minn. ``Science \n     and spirituality have a common quest, which is a quest for \n     truth.'' And if science has not yet influenced religious \n     thought and practice at the grass-roots level very much, just \n     wait, says Ted Peters of CTNS. Much as feminism sneaked up on \n     churches and is now shaping the liturgy, he predicts, ``in 10 \n     years science will be a major factor in how many ordinary \n     religious people think.''\n       Not everyone believes that's such a hot idea. ``Science is \n     a method, not a body of knowledge,'' says Michael Shermer, a \n     director of the Skeptics Society, which debunks claims of the \n     paranormal. ``It can have nothing to say either way about \n     whether there is a God. These are two such different things, \n     it would be like using baseball stats to prove a point in \n     football.'' Another red flag is that adherents of different \n     faiths--like the Orthodox Jews, Anglicans, Quakers, Catholics \n     and Muslims who spoke at the June conference in Berkeley--\n     tend to find, in science, confirmation of what their \n     particular religion has already taught them.\n       Take the difficult Christian concept of Jesus as both fully \n     divine and fully human. It turns out that this duality has a \n     parallel in quantum physics. In the early years of this \n     century, physicists discovered that entities thought of as \n     particles, like electrons, can also act as waves. And light, \n     considered a wave, can in some experiments act like a barrage \n     of particles. The orthodox interpretation of this strange \n     situation is that light is, simultaneously, wave and \n     particle. Electrons are, simultaneously, waves and particles. \n     Which aspect of light one sees, which face an electron turns \n     to a human observer, varies with the circumstances. So, too, \n     with Jesus, suggests physicist F. Russell Stannard of \n     England's Open University. Jesus is not to be seen as really \n     God in human guise, or as really human but acting divine, \n     says Stannard: ``He was fully both.'' Finding these parallels \n     may make some people feel, says Polkinghorne, ``that this is \n     not just some deeply weird Christian idea.''\n       Jews aren't likely to make the same leap. And someone who \n     is not already a believer will not join the faithful because \n     of quantum mechanics; conversely, someone in whom science \n     raises no doubts about faith probably isn't even listening. \n     But to people in the middle, for whom science raises \n     questions about religion, these new concordances can deepen a \n     faith already present. As Feit says, ``I don't think that by \n     studying science you will be forced to conclude that there \n     must be a God. But if you have already found God, then you \n     can say, from understanding science, `Ah, I see what God has \n     done in the world'.''\n       In one sense, science and religion will never be truly \n     reconciled. Perhaps they shouldn't be. The default setting of \n     science is eternal doubt; the core of religion is faith. Yet \n     profoundly religious people and great scientists are both \n     driven to understand the world. Once, science and religion \n     were viewed as two fundamentally different, even \n     antagonistic, ways of pursuing that quest, and science stood \n     accused of smothering faith and killing God. Now, it may \n     strengthen belief. And although it cannot prove God's \n     existence, science might whisper to believers where to seek \n     the divine.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           How The Heavens Go\n\n                        (By Kenneth L. Woodward)\n\n       That many contemporary scientists make room for god in \n     their understanding of the cosmos should hardly be \n     surprising. For most of history, religion and science have \n     been siblings--feeding off and sparring with each other--\n     rather than outright adversaries in the common human quest \n     for understanding. Only in the West, and only after the\n\n[[Page S9355]]\n\n     French Enlightenment in the 18th century, did the votaries of \n     science and religion drift into separate ideological camps. \n     And only in the 19th century, after Darwin, was the supposed \n     irreconcilability between ``God'' and ``science'' elevated to \n     the status of cultural myth. History tells a different, more \n     complicated story.\n       In the ancient world, religious myth invested nature and \n     the cosmos with divine emanations and powers. But this \n     celestial pantheism did not prevent sober observation of the \n     heavens and sophisticated mathematical calculations. By 1400 \n     B.C. the Chinese had established a solar year of 365 days. \n     Ancient India formulated the decimal system. Ancient Greece \n     bequeathed Euclidean geometry, Ptolemy's map of the solar \n     system and Aristotle's classification of living organisms, \n     which served biologists until Darwin.\n       But none of these advances seriously disrupted religions's \n     more comprehensive worldviews. Buddhists, for example, showed \n     no interest in investigating nature since it was both \n     impermanent and, at bottom, an illusion. Islam made great \n     advances in algebra, geometry and optics, as well as \n     philosophy. But Muslim scholars left the mysteries of \n     physics--motion, causality, etc.--to the power of Allah and \n     to the aphorisms of Aristotle, whose works they recovered and \n     transmitted to the Christian West.\n       The Bible, of course, has its own creation myth, and it is \n     that very story that eventually led scientists to realize \n     that nature had to be discovered empirically and so fostered \n     the development of science in the Christian West. The \n     universe created by a rational God had to be rational and \n     consistent--that much the Creeks already knew. But a universe \n     created out of nothing, as Genesis described, also had to be \n     contingent. In other words, it could have turned out other \n     than it did. It was only one of an infinite number of \n     possibilities open to a wholly transcendent deity. Gradually, \n     scientists realized that the laws governing such a universe \n     could not be deduced from pure thought--as Aristotle \n     supposed--but instead needed to be discovered through \n     experiment. Thus was experimental science nurtured by \n     religious doctrine.\n       When the scientific revolution did occur, in Europe early \n     in the 17th century, and researchers for the first time began \n     to regard the world as a mechanism whose workings they could \n     probe through the scientific method, it wasn't God's \n     existence that was thrown in doubt. Rather, it was \n     Aristotle's ``sacred geography,'' in which Earth and the \n     heavenly bodies were fixed and eternal. Relying on Aristotle, \n     medieval Christianity had imagined a tidy geocentric universe \n     in which nature served man and mankind served God. ``In a \n     certain sense, religion got burned for locking itself too \n     deeply into a particular scientific view which was then \n     discarded,'' says Owen Gingerich, a professor of astronomy \n     and the history of science at Harvard.\n       First Copernicus, then Galileo (aided by one of the first \n     telescopes) and Kepler demonstrated with ever greater \n     precision that the earth and other planets circled the sun. \n     Humankind, it seemed, was peripheral to God and the universe. \n     All three scientists, however, were devout Christians who \n     defended their new worldview as most worthy of the Creator. \n     But Copernicus and Kepler were denounced by Martin Luther for \n     views he thought contradicted the bible, and Galileo was \n     tried and condemned to house arrest by the Roman Inquisition. \n     Although Pope John Paul II declared in 1992 that the church \n     had erred in condemning Galileo, the incident was never a \n     simple conflict between science and religion. Galileo \n     overstated the proof he could provide for a heliocentric \n     (suncentered) cosmos and incautiously caricatured the pope in \n     a published tract. Yet he could also quote one of the pope's \n     own cardinals in his defense: ``The intention of [the Bible] \n     is to teach us how one goes to heaven, not how the heavens \n     go.''\n       In subsequent centuries, however, scientific theories of \n     ``how the heavens go'' increasingly determined the place and \n     power of God. The ``celestial mechanics'' of Isaac Newton \n     produced a god who designed a world machine and somehow \n     sustained it in motion. Theologians readily accepted whatever \n     proofs for God's existence the new science chose to give. The \n     result was a diminished ``god of the gaps'' inhabiting \n     whatever dark corners science had not yet brought to rational \n     light. In this way, says Jesuit theologian Michael Buckley of \n     Boston College, theologians themselves cooperated in the \n     advent of modern atheism by relying on science to explain God \n     and ignoring ``the traditional sources of religious insight \n     and experience that make belief in God intelligible,'' By the \n     18th century, astronomer Pierre Laplace could explain nature \n     as a self-sufficient mechanism. As for God, he told Emperor \n     Napoleon, ``I have no need of that hypothesis,'' Nor, a \n     century later, did Darwin in his theory of evolution.\n       Now, at the end of the millennium, religion and science are \n     beginning to talk, though neither answers to the other's \n     authority. John Paul II consults with his Pontifical Academy \n     of Science--most of whom are not Catholic.

Mr. President, August is from the Latin Augustus, the \neighth month of our calendar year, a time of harvest and of plenty, \nnamed after Augustus Caesar. Augustus Caesar, or, more formally, Gaius \nJulius Caesar Octavianus. He was the grandnephew of Julius Caesar, and \nhe was the first emperor of Rome, from 27 B.C. through 14 A.D. August \nis also an adjective, derived from the Latin verb meaning to increase, \nand in English meaning: to inspire awe and reverence, impose, something \nthat is imposing and magnificent, or dignified and majestic. The \nadjective augustan refers also to the age of Augustus Caesar and his \nreign and suggests that anything so described is classical and elegant. \nThe term Augustan age specifically refers to a period of Latin \nliterature during the reign of Augustus Caesar, when elegance and \ncorrectness were highly valued. Oh, that we might return to that age at \nleast in one sense, when elegance and correctness--not political \ncorrectness, but correctness--were highly valued.\n  Augustine, a diminutive form of Augustus, was the name of two saints, \nSaint Augustine of Hippo (354-430 A.D.), a Latin church father and \nbishop of Hippo, in northern Africa, known for his ``Confessions'' and \nhis work ``The City of God.'' The second Saint Augustine--the dates we \nare not sure of but we can believe that he lived until about 604 A.D. \nHe was a Roman monk who went to spread Christianity among the English \nand who was the first Archbishop of Canterbury.\n  We can see from this that the name Augustus is fraught with \nsignificance and with portent. It is a name to be lived up to with \ngreat deeds and great learning. It is also the name conferred upon the \nnewest member of Senator Ted Stevens' growing family, Augustus Engleken \nStevens. My guess would be the middle name is Anglo-Saxon. And this is \nthe third child of Senator Stevens' third son, Ben.\n\n  It is also the tenth grandchild to join the impressive Stevens clan. \nThis newest Caesar to rule with his chubby and imperious fist, and to \nissue edicts in a piercing wail, was born on Monday, July 27, at 3:20 \np.m., weighing in at a healthy 7 pounds, 10 ounces.\n  I congratulate Senator Stevens and his wife, Catherine, on this \nblessed addition to their family. As they well know, there is no \ngreater joy than to gather into one's arms a tiny, peaceful bundle, and \nto gaze down upon that small, sleeping face, to gently stroke the soft, \nvelvety down of hair and rounded cheek, and to listen closely for the \nfaint murmurs and coos that slip almost unnoticed from that perfect \ncupid's bow of a mouth. What happier moment could there be, than to see \nthat little mouth open in a sleepy, toothless yawn, or to catch a \nglimpse of a little foot--not much longer than a peanut, with toes so \nsmall that they could not possibly have working bones inside them--\nkicking out on bowed leg from within the folded blanket?\n  In choosing a name as ancient and as illustrious as Augustus, his \nparents--I surmise--have high hopes and grand ambitions for their \ninfant son. I am sure that grandfather Ted has great, grandiloquent \nschemes afoot as well, to bounce him on a hobbyhorse knee, or to take \nhim salmon fishing in pristine Alaskan waters. I suspect that those who \nsee Ted on the Senate floor, shepherding appropriations bills through \ncontentious debate to final passage--fists pounding and voice booming--\nmight not recognize Senator Stevens in his happier and more serene role \nas grandfather. But to be a grandfather is to be a happy man.\n  And what feelings of immortality, to be a grandfather. Holding this \nyoungest member of his family, born in the waning days of this second \nmillennium, the namesake of one whose life spanned the opening days of \nthe first millennium, and poised to come into his own birthright in the \nthird millennium, Senator Stevens can see history unfold into the \ncoming ages. Through children and grandchildren, one has a glimpse of \nthe glorious future, the immortality of the human race, tinged with the \nbittersweet sorrow of time passing too swiftly and of children who grow \nup much too quickly.\n\n[[Page S9356]]\n\n  Lest I overwhelm young Augustus with the great weight of such high \nexpectations and such intimations of immortality, I hasten to wish him \na happy childhood, complete with much exploring, great adventures, \nbarked shins and skinned knees, of quiet moments of wonder and \nlearning, of great books to be shared with his parents and \ngrandparents, and of countless hugs and kisses. Be a boy, Augustus, \nwith moments good and bad, tender and terrible. Be like the Augustus in \nthese lines by Heinrich Hoffman (1809-1874), who said:\n\n  Augustus was a chubby lad;\n  Fat ruddy cheeks Augustus had:\n  And everybody saw with joy\n  The plump and hearty, healthy boy.\n  He ate and drank as he was told,\n  And never let his soup get cold.\n  But one day, one winter's day,\n  He screamed out, `Take the soup away!\n  O take the nasty soup away!\n  I won't have any soup to-day.'\n\n  Welcome, young emperor, and carry on, bringing ever your illustrious \ngrandfather under your sway with the dictatorial charms of a much loved \nchild.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am uncharacteristically speechless. I \nthink--to listen to my good friend talk about my latest grandchild--he \nis absolutely right in one thing; and that is, there is nothing so \nhumbling as to look at a grandchild and realize what that child means. \nSenator Byrd told me once that to have a grandchild is to touch \ninfinity. And it is a very sobering thing to think about. But it is a \njoy to have these grandchildren. If one must get old, it helps a lot.\n  I thank the Senator very much.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9355-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9356-S9357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TREASURY AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 2312, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2312) making appropriations for the Treasury \n     Department, the United States Postal Service, and the \n     Executive Office of the President, and certain Independent \n     Agencies, for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1999, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       McConnell amendment No. 3379, to provide for appointment \n     and term length for the staff director and general counsel of \n     the Federal Election Commission.\n       Glenn amendment No. 3380, to provide additional funding for \n     enforcement activities of the Federal Election Commission.\n       Graham/Mack amendment No. 3381, to provide funding for the \n     Central Florida High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area.\n       Stevens amendment No. 3385, to provide for an adjustment in \n     the computation of annuities for certain Federal officers and \n     employees relating to average pay determinations.\n       Campbell (for Grassley) amendment No. 3386, to protect \n     Federal law enforcement officers who intervene in certain \n     situations to protect life or prevent bodily injury.\n       Harkin amendment No. 3387, to provide additional funding to \n     reduce methamphetamine usage in High Intensity Drug \n     Trafficking Areas.\n       Kohl (for Kerrey) amendment No. 3389, to express the sense \n     of the Senate regarding payroll tax relief.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, yesterday I engaged in a colloquy with \nSenators Kohl and Moseley-Braun regarding the intent of report language \nin S. 2312 concerning tax standards for tax-exempt health clubs. In \nthat colloquy, I stated that my expectation was that the report would \n``focus on adult fitness provided by tax-exempt organizations that \nserve only adults.'' However, both tax-exempt health clubs and for-\nprofit health clubs serve entire families including young adults and \nchildren. While I believe the report should focus on adult fitness \nprovided by tax-exempt organizations, tax-exempt organizations also \noffer non-adult service. The fact that they offer service to non-adults \ndoes not qualify an entity for tax-exempt status. Therefore, to \neliminate any entity that provides any level of services to non-adults \nwould greatly restrict the usefulness of this report in providing \nguidance to Congress. Again, I want to emphasize that my intent here is \nonly for the IRS to provide Congress guidance in this area.\n  Therefore, I want to clarify that it is my expectation that the \nreport will reflect the language in the report accompanying S. 2312 \nwith the input of yesterday's colloquies as well as this clarification. \nAgain, I want to thank Senators Campbell and Kohl for their assistance \non this and I look forward to working with them and all other \ninterested Senators and parties on this issue.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3388\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to ask unanimous consent \nthat my name be added as a cosponsor to amendment number #3388 to the \nFY 1999 Treasury-Postal Appropriations legislation currently under \nconsideration. This amendment is a combination of several amendments \naimed at increasing support for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking \nAreas administered by the Office of National Drug Control Policy. The \nMidwest HIDTA program has been extremely helpful to cracking down on \ndrug trafficking in my rural state by coordinating federal, state and \nlocal law enforcement efforts to combat methamphetamine trafficking. \nWhile the Campbell-Kohl amendment addresses HIDTA programs nationwide, \nthe Midwest HIDTA will be increased by $3.5 million, bringing the total \nmethamphetamine elimination funding to $13 million for the Midwestern \nStates of South Dakota, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska and Kansas. The \namendment will also add North Dakota to the Midwest HIDTA program which \nis crucial to tightening law enforcement's grip on meth traffickers in \nthe area. I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues from Colorado and \nWisconsin for recognizing that drug trafficking is not a uniquely \ncoastal or urban problem, and that federal coordination and assistance \nis necessary for fighting drug use and trafficking nationwide.\n\n\n                           denver courthouse\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an important funding \nissue contained in the Treasury and General Government appropriations \nbill. This appropriations bill provides $84 million for construction of \nan annex to the Rogers Courthouse in Denver. The General Services \nAdministration has included this project high on its list of \npriorities, at the recommendation of the Administrative Offices of the \nCourts. GSA and the AOC have provided me with detailed information on \nthe costs of this courthouse and assured me repeatedly that these costs \nare prudent, practical and necessary to meet the future judicial needs \nof Colorado. I have also been assured that the renovated courthouse \nwill be functional, but not extravagant. I have demanded this of every \nproject on the list and will continue to work to ensure that this \nstandard is applied to all new construction. Members of the Federal \nbench in Colorado have expressed gratitude that I have included \nconstruction money for the Rogers Courthouse. I am of course happy to \nhelp meet the needs of our federal legal system, especially in \nColorado. In addition to the Rogers Courthouse, this bill contains \nfourteen other projects totaling almost $500 million. I believe that if \nCongress is going to pass laws, we'd better provide sufficient \nattorneys and judges to enforce those laws and adequate facilities in \nwhich those laws may be administered.\n  I am aware of the growing federal caseload in other parts of \nColorado. For example, the City of Grand Junction is experiencing rapid \ngrowth, and with that comes a need for more government attorneys and \njudges. Being from the West Slope, I appreciate the time and expense \nrequired to travel to Denver. Traveling 5 or 8 hours to get to a \nfederal court can be a burden to all parties in federal lawsuits.\n  While I am happy to accommodate the wish of the federal bench in \nColorado to provide this money, I will continue to listen to members of \nthe Colorado Federal Bar, the Administrative Office of the Courts, and \nother areas of the state that experience growing needs for judges and \ncourtroom space to ensure that this appropriations bill accurately \nprovides for the needs of the entire state.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order, the hour of 2 o'clock having \narrived, the Senate is to proceed to a sequence of votes on Amendments \nto the Treasury-Postal bill.\n\n[[Page S9357]]\n\n                     Amendment No. 3385, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw \namendment No. 3385.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3385) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3379\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The first vote is on amendment No. 3379.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have been ordered.\n  This is the McConnell amendment. There are 2 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I urged last night to put this on the \ntable. This would really knock the socks off any election law \nenforcement over at the FEC. We oppose this very much. It would mean \nthere would be a restriction on the FEC that is not on any other agency \nor department of government as far as their general counsel goes and \ntheir staff director.\n  The efforts to oust him over there, I think, are unconscionable. He \nhas been doing a good job. This just stands starkly opposed to our \nefforts for campaign finance reform.\n  At the appropriate time I will move to table this, but I yield the \nremaining time to Senator Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment is directly aimed at the \nindependence of the Federal Elections Commission. It is aimed at no \nother commission. Its purpose is obvious--to eliminate a general \ncounsel who has taken an independent position, following the Federal \nElection Commission's decision relative to soft money and other issues. \nWe should not muzzle them. We should not throttle them. We should not \ndestroy their independence.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the amendment is really quite simple. \nThe Federal Election Commission is like no other commission of the \nFederal Government. It has three Republicans and three Democrats. The \ngeneral counsel, under the current system, could serve for a lifetime. \nAll the McConnell amendment does is require that every 4 years the \ngeneral counsel come up for reappointment and not be reappointed unless \nhe can achieve at least four votes, thereby demonstrating to the full \nCommission, on a bipartisan basis, enough confidence to continue for \nanother 4-year term.\n  This guarantees that the general counsel will operate in a bipartisan \nmanner, because a general counsel who, after 4 years, could not achieve \nvotes from both parties, it seems to this Senator, clearly would fail a \ntest of bipartisanship.\n  This is not about the current occupant of the office. It is about \nensuring that the Federal Election Commission continues to operate on a \nbipartisan basis. I hope the amendment will be approved.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion to table the \nMcConnell amendment numbered 3379.\n  Mr. GLENN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 3379. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is absent because of illness.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Are there any other \nSenators in the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 45, nays 54, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 246 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--45\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--54\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Helms \n       \n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 3379) was rejected.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have had, obviously, extensive \nconsultation about how to proceed to this point. There is disagreement \nabout this particular amendment and how we can complete the Treasury-\nPostal Service and other related agencies appropriations bill at this \ntime.\n  In the interest of Senators to have time to work on the substance, \nwhat we have agreed to do is to set this bill aside--I will ask \nunanimous consent to that effect in a moment--and we would go on to the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations amendments and continue to work \nprogressively, with the idea of finishing the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill as early as possible--hopefully, even tonight--\nwhich will allow us time to work on some nominations and allow Senators \nto attend the funeral tomorrow and adjourn for the recess at a \nreasonable hour tomorrow, or earlier if there is any way of doing it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending Treasury-Postal Service \nappropriations bill be laid aside, not to recur prior to September 1, \nunless agreement is worked out in the meantime. There is hope that \ncould be done. Maybe we could act on it after the DOD appropriations \nbill is completed. If not, it would be September 1. And no call for the \nregular order serves to displace the treasury bill, when it is pending \nin September, in the status quo.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, just for \npurposes of clarification, this would lock into place the current \nsituation. The pending amendment would be, of course, the McConnell \namendment. Senators wishing to offer amendments in the second degree \nsubject to recognition would be recognized as authors of amendments in \nthe second degree.\n  It is with that understanding that I do not object. I am sure the \nmajority leader would clarify and would conform with that \nunderstanding.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, that is correct. Second-degree amendments \nwould be in order. We are freezing everything in place. We would not \ntake it up again before September 1, unless an agreement were worked \nout. When we do go back to it, we will be right where we are now, and \nsecond-degree amendments will be in order.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I don't \nplan to object, I want to clarify, this would in no way affect the \nvoting order we agreed to last night on other amendments?\n  Mr. LOTT. Everything would be just like it is at this very moment on \nthis appropriations bill.\n  Mr. GLENN. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9356-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9357-S9374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There are 2 minutes equally divided on the \nFeingold amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment is about the National \nGuard. This amendment is about priorities in our Armed Forces, not \nabout the merits of any aircraft proposed to be added to the Navy's \naviation fleet. This amendment fills in almost all of the dangerous \n$225 million shortfall in the National Guard's O account. As an \noffset, we use the House's recommendation on Super Hornet procurement \nfor the coming fiscal year.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment is supported by 25 State \nadjutants general. I hope my colleagues contact their State adjutants \ngenerals to get their opinion before casting their vote. I urge \ncolleagues to support the National Guard and to vote against tabling \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment will eliminate the Navy's \nhighest priority, or I would say the Defense Department's highest \npriority for the Navy, the F-18 E/F. It would move that money into the \nNational Guard. We have already increased the National Guard by more \nthan $500 million above the budget request.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, could we have order for just one moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to inform the Senate that tomorrow \nthere will be another funeral. It is the funeral for Officer Chestnut. \nThe agreement today was we would not have any votes until 1 p.m. Then \nwe made that 2 p.m. because of the Intelligence Committee meeting. But \nwe are going to have the same agreement now that we will not vote on \nthe amendments that we take up later this evening until tomorrow at 1 \np.m.\n  I am soon going to seek agreement that all amendments will have to be \ndebated tonight, and we will start voting tomorrow at 1 p.m. on those \nthat require a vote. We will have taken over half--we have agreed to \ntake over half the amendments we know of now, and we very soon hope to \nbe able to know what amendments there are, but we will work out that \ntime agreement.\n  I think Senators should realize that without regard to anything else \nwe do now, we are going to be here tomorrow, and we are going to start \nvoting at 1 o'clock and not before. The alternative is if we get \nthrough these--we might be able to get through them tonight if Senators \nwant to do that and be finished tonight. But we can't do that unless we \nsee the amendments.\n  Now, I have asked two or three times for an agreement that Senators \nbring amendments through, that we have a time limit on when they must \nbe disclosed, and we will try that again after the next vote. But we \nhave to have some certainty. If Senators want to, we are going to be \nhere until Sunday, because I will never, never allow a defense bill to \nhang over a recess. It just will not do. And I think anybody who \nunderstands defense understands it cannot happen. So we are going to \nfinish this bill tonight or tomorrow or Saturday or Sunday. My plane \ndoesn't leave until Monday.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. What is the next vote?\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Senator yield, Mr. President?\n  I inquire of the chairman of the committee, are we going to have \nvotes this evening? Why wouldn't we vote on into the evening rather \nthan having votes hanging over until tomorrow?\n  Mr. STEVENS. We might be able to do that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that no vote on this bill take \nmore than 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Are we going to have votes then this evening, all into the \nevening?\n  Mr. STEVENS. We are going to vote on amendments when they come up. \nWhenever they come up, we will vote on them. Most of them are going to \nbe motions to table, I will tell you. Most of them are going to be \nmotions to table because most of this stuff is not relevant to this \nbill at all. So you might as well be put on notice, Republican or \nDemocrat, I am going to move to table any nonrelevant amendments.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I can question the floor manager relative to his \nintent, if we are in tomorrow and votes start at 1 o'clock, might it be \npossible to stack the votes in the event that actuality should be \ndetermined, because the last plane that I can catch is 2:20; otherwise, \nI have to leave the next day. And I don't request special \nconsideration. On the other hand, it just means another day's delay. So \nif we did go into tomorrow and we start voting, the 2:20 plane is the \nlast one I can catch.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I tell my colleague I will do my best.\n  I renew my unanimous consent request that all remaining first-degree \namendments in order to be offered to this bill must be presented and \noffered before 5 p.m.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, objection. I object.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There is the answer to my friend. I do not see how we \ncan finish before 2:30 tomorrow afternoon unless we know what we are \nvoting on.\n  What is the next order of business, Mr. President?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3124\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is on the Hutchinson \namendment No. 3124. There are 2 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I might say I am prepared to accept this. \nIt is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment primarily.\n  This is the Senator from Arkansas. I do have a tabling motion in \nplace on this, do I not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the vote after 1 minute on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes equally divided.\n\n[[Page S9359]]\n\n  The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  There are 2 minutes equally divided. The Senator deserves to be \nheard.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, thank you for bringing the Senate to \norder.\n  This is an amendment that would simply deny visas and travel to those \nin the Chinese Government who the Secretary of State finds, by credible \nevidence, are involved in either forced abortions or religious \npersecution. It is not MFN, it is not IMF, it is not sanctions, but it \nwould deny visas. China denies these practices are taking place. If \nthat is the case, there would be no obstruction at all in diplomatic \nrelations.\n  We provide in the amendment, and I hope everybody will look closely \nat the amendment, a Presidential waiver if it is in the national \ninterest. This amendment passed overwhelmingly in the House of \nRepresentatives. I think, since the President returned, the most recent \nround of arrests of democratic dissidents underscores the need for this \namendment.\n  It is a rifleshot, not a shotgun. We want to go after the bad guys, \nand that is all. It is not against trading. It doesn't deal with \ntrading. A vote against tabling this amendment is a vote for freedom in \nChina.\n  I ask my colleagues to oppose the tabling motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on the motion to table.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Senator Thomas has a minute on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair was under the impression the Senator \nfrom Alaska yielded back the time. If that is incorrect----\n  Mr. STEVENS. No; I did not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senator from \nWyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to follow the \nleadership of the floor leader and the bill leader here on this one. \nNo. 1, it doesn't belong in this area. We are taking away all these \namendments. I think that is the right thing to do.\n  The second point is those of us who have been working in this area \nfor a very long time feel as if there is a process that is going on to \nmake things better with China, to make our relations better.\n  No one disagrees with doing something about religious freedom. No one \ndisagrees with any of these issues. The question is, How do you best do \nit? And the best way to do it is not to refuse to provide visas to the \nChinese.\n  I urge we table this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce the the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is absent because of illness.\n  I further announcd that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``no.''\n  The result was announced--yeas 29, nays 70, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 248 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--29\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Domenici\n     Feinstein\n     Glenn\n     Grams\n     Hagel\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Landrieu\n     Levin\n     Lugar\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n\n                                NAYS--70\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Reid\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Thompson\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Helms\n       \n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 3124) was rejected.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am informed now there are at least two, maybe three, \namendments that will be offered to this amendment. Under the \ncircumstances, I would like to just suggest we set that aside for a \nminute and have the proponents of the second-degree amendments talk to \nthe author of the first-degree amendment to see if we might work \nsomething out as to how we limit the time or deal with this, if that is \nagreeable. If it is, then I would ask it be temporarily set aside.\n  I would like to take up the amendment No. 2964.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Is that a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is a request. I ask unanimous consent that it be \ntemporarily set aside, and we take them up one by one. Hopefully, they \nwill talk while we are doing this.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Reserving the right to object, will the Senator yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. When we temporarily set this aside and do the \nnegotiations on the various second-degree amendments that are to be \nconsidered, when do you anticipate returning to----\n  Mr. STEVENS. I say to the Senator, there are two other amendments we \ncould act upon now. Your amendment will automatically be the order when \nwe finish those.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order would bring back the \namendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Alaska?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2964\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the next amendment would be amendment No. \n2964, offered by Senator Abraham. There was no request for time that I \nknow of for this. We are prepared to and do ask that--are the yeas and \nnays ordered on that amendment? I do not think they have been ordered. \nHave they?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the adoption of Senator Abraham's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the Abraham amendment No. 2964.\n  The amendment (No. 2964) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Was there one more amendment we had to dispose of before \nwe come back to the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is the Kyl amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. For the information of the Senate, Senator Kyl asked \nthat his amendment be set aside temporarily because the Armed Services \nCommittee is meeting to consider a similar amendment. We would like to \nhave that set aside until Senator Kyl asks that it be brought up. I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Kyl's amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  We have two amendments pending from the Senator from Texas, Mrs. \nHutchison.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There is one amendment on which the debate has been \nfinished.\n  May I inquire of the Senator from Texas, is debate finished on the \none amendment?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is correct. I have spoken on the first \namendment, No. 3409. I am happy to yield back time on that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am informed there is reluctance to \naccept that amendment until the Bosnia amendment is considered. I ask \nunanimous consent to set it aside temporarily, also, until that is \nresolved.\n\n[[Page S9360]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3124\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. We come back, then, to the pending amendment. As I \nunderstand, it is the regular order. And that is the amendment that was \nnot tabled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment of the Senator from Arkansas, \nMr. Hutchinson. The motion to table was not agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is open to amendment.\n  Mr. President, I think they are following the suggestion and perhaps \ndiscussing those second-degree amendments. I ask unanimous consent \nthat, again, that be the pending business but it be temporarily set \naside until the sponsor of that amendment can return to the floor. I \nalso ask unanimous consent that we proceed with the Bosnia amendment by \nthe Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe amendment No.--I ask the Senator from Texas, 3409 or 3413?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Amendment No. 3413 has to do with Bosnia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 3413.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3413\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, amendment No. 3413 is to condition the \nuse of appropriated funds for the purpose of an orderly and honorable \nreduction of U.S. ground forces in Bosnia.\n  It is a fact that the U.S. Armed Forces have accomplished the \nmilitary mission assigned to them as a component of the implementation \nand stabilization forces. The continuing and open-ended commitment of \nU.S. ground forces in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is subject \nto the oversight authority of Congress.\n  Mr. President, this is the first time that Congress will vote on any \nkind of resolution that would establish some kind of policy on Bosnia \nsince the President decided that it would be an unending mission.\n  On November 27, 1995, the President said that America would be part \nof a multinational military implementation force that would terminate \nin about a year. The President declared the expiration of the mandate \nto be December 20, 1996.\n  The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff at the time expressed the critical importance of establishing a \nfirm deadline in the absence of which there is a potential for \nexpansion of the mission of U.S. forces. That was a forceful statement \nby the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. He said it is a recipe for mission \ncreep not to have a termination date.\n\n  On October 3, 1996, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs announced the \nintention of the United States to delay removal until March 1997. In \nNovember of 1996, the President announced that we would delay until \nJune of 1998. The President did not request authorization by the \nCongress of a policy that would result in the further deployment of \nU.S. forces in Bosnia until June 1998.\n  Notwithstanding the passage of two previously established deadlines, \nthe reaffirmation of those deadlines by senior national security \nofficials, and the endorsement by those same national security \nofficials of the importance of having a deadline, nevertheless, the \nPresident announced on December 17, 1997, that establishing a deadline \nhad been a mistake and that U.S. ground combat forces would be \ncommitted to the NATO-led mission in Bosnia for an indefinite amount of \ntime.\n  What my amendment does is very simple. It says that funds \nappropriated will not be made available except as conditioned below; \nthat the President will bring the number of troops down to 6,500 by \nFebruary of next year and 5,000 by October of 1999, so we are staying \nwithin this fiscal year. Now, the exceptions are very broad at the \ndiscretion of the President and the Secretary of Defense that U.S. \nforces would have enough forces to protect themselves as the drawdowns \nproceed. So we are, of course, going to give the protection to the \nforces as the drawdown goes forward.\n  This doesn't take us out of Bosnia, which many in this body feel that \nwe should do, that we should begin this at the base, for an honorable \nwithdrawal. It just says, by the end of the fiscal year of the budget \nthat we are considering, that our troop level would be down from about \n8,500 to about 5,000. This should start the process of working with our \nallies to have a better distribution and sharing of responsibility \namong our allies and the United States.\n  This is a European security issue. The United States has \napproximately double the number of forces that any of our European \nallies have. We want to be a good ally. In fact, I don't want to pull \nup stakes and leave Bosnia without doing it in a responsible way. I \nthink that is our responsibility. But, in fact, many of us have asked \nthe President repeatedly to lay the groundwork with an established and \nclear mission that has a chance to succeed, a mission that has a finite \nterm so that both our allies and any enemies of our cause would know \nexactly what to expect from America. That would not be possible at this \ntime. We have said we were going to leave twice, and we have not left. \nWe have not left, and we have not laid a proper base to leave.\n  What I am asking the President to consider and what I ask the \nAmerican people to consider is that we start the process of realigning \nthe forces in Bosnia so that our contribution would be reduced and our \nallies in NATO would begin to take a greater share of the burden.\n  Why is this important? We are looking at a time when our military \nreadiness is being called into question. In fact, if you look at all of \nthe responsibilities that America has in the world, we are spending too \nmuch on Bosnia and putting the future security of the United States and \nour ability to respond in the future in other places where America may \nhave to respond, even unilaterally, in jeopardy. That is not the course \nwe should be taking.\n  It is most important that America start with the issue of Bosnia and \naddress it in a way that we should by putting it in context with our \noverall responsibilities in the world. The Bosnia operation has already \ndiverted nearly $10 billion from our national defense. A growing lament \nat the Pentagon among senior officers is that we are in danger of \nreturning to the hollow forces of the militaries of the late 1970s.\n  Let me mention some of the indicators that demonstrate our military \nis once again at risk. Last year, the military had its worst recruiting \nyear since 1979. The Army failed to meet its objective to recruit \ninfantry soldiers, the single most important specialty in the Army. A \nSenate Budget Committee investigator recently reported finding serious \nArmy-wide personnel and readiness problems. At the National Training \nCenter, where our troops go for advanced training, units rotating in \ntypically come with a 60 percent shortage in mechanics and often a 50 \npercent shortage in infantry. These shortages were blamed on the fact \nthat these personnel, especially the mechanics, are deployed abroad for \nmissions such as Bosnia.\n  More than 350 Air Force pilots turned down the $60,000 bonuses they \nwould have received to remain in the cockpit another 5 years--a 29 \npercent acceptance rate. That is compared with 59 percent last year and \n81 percent in 1995. That is a stark trend. The Air Force is finding \nthat whatever the perks, it can't hold its best pilots. Last year, \nabout 500 pilots resigned. Most of them were lured by the airlines. \nThis year the number will be 700, and the Air Force says it is not able \nto train enough new pilots to replace them.\n  When I have gone and visited our bases overseas and at home and I ask \nour enlisted military men and women why we are losing our experienced \npeople, almost every time the answer is: Too much time away from our \nfamilies on operations that don't seem that necessary. A Senate Budget \nCommittee investigator also found that some small units are now being \nled by junior people because sergeants are off on peacekeeping duty. As \na result, subunits from basic squads on up do not train with the \nleaders they would go to war with--breaking the rule of training just \nas you would go to war.\n  Since 1991, the United States has cut its Armed Forces by about a \nthird. It may be more difficult, more risky, and possibly more costly \nto invade Iraq right now. We are going to debate and vote on a \nresolution today, hopefully, expressing our support for the President's \nstrong actions toward Iraq. But\n\n[[Page S9361]]\n\nthe fact is, if anything went wrong, we would have to divert troops \nfrom every theater in the world to prevail. Defense cuts of almost 50 \npercent over the last decade have put our security at risk. But this \nhas been made worse by the diversion of U.S. resources and readiness to \nplaces where there is no security threat to the United States, such as \nBosnia, Haiti, and elsewhere.\n  We have spent more time discussing Bosnia than missile defense, which \nis a security risk to our country. We are not developing a policy that \nis going to put our country in the best position to deal with the \nmyriad of issues that will face this country and our security in the \nnext century.\n  President Clinton and his administration are missing a big-picture \nview of the world and the proper role for the United States. Our \ngrowing involvement in Bosnia is a good example of that. Just last \nweek, U.S. forces were directly involved in tracking down and capturing \na war criminal.\n  The Dayton accords have made it clear that apprehension of war \ncriminals would be the responsibility of the parties to Dayton--\ncivilian police and government officials. In fact, a little more than 1 \nyear ago now, the former NATO commander, George Joulwan, told the \nCongress this:\n\n       The military are not policemen. And I think the proper \n     responsibility rests on the parties. That is what Dayton \n     says. . .[I]f we are not careful, we will go down this \n     slippery slope where the military will be put in the position \n     of hunting down war criminals. That is not within the \n     mandate.\n\n  That is Gen. George Joulwan.\n  I joined with many of my colleagues in the Senate to oppose the \ndecision to send troops to Bosnia. One of our principal concerns was \nthat, once there, our mission would be indefinite, and that it might \nlead to mission creep. We were bolstered in our concerns by former \nSecretary of Defense William Perry and former Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs, General Shalikashvili. They both warned that without a specific \ndeadline for withdrawal there would be the potential for expanding the \nmission.\n  I am concerned that Secretary Perry's warnings are coming true. While \nwe were on a recent recess, the President announced that thousands of \nU.S. troops would remain in Bosnia after the June 30 deadline, \nremembering that the Senate had unanimously endorsed that deadline of \nJune 30, 1998, which his administration had established.\n  After 240 U.S. Marines were killed in Lebanon in 1984, Defense \nSecretary Caspar Weinberger established six principles upon which the \ndecision to send U.S. ground troops should be based. Here is what he \nsaid:\n\n       The U.S. should not commit forces unless the engagement is \n     in our vital national interest. If we do commit forces, we \n     should have clearly defined political and military \n     objectives. We should know how those objectives can be \n     accomplished, and we should send the appropriate forces to \n     complete the objectives. We must constantly reassess and \n     adjust our relationship between our objectives and forces, if \n     necessary. The commitment of troops should be a last resort, \n     not the first.\n\n  We have violated virtually every one of Secretary Weinberger's \nprinciples in Bosnia. It was supposed to be a 1-year peacekeeping \noperation that would keep the factions apart until their own forces \ncould come in and keep the peace from the ground up. They would have \nlocal elections and general elections for their national leadership. \nThey would begin to resettle refugees.\n  Dayton has long since passed. I was in Brcko a year ago, 1 week \nbefore the eruption there in which U.S. troops were harmed. I was able \nto see how far we had come. I have been to Bosnia four times.\n  What I saw in Brcko was the resettling of refugees who did not even \nmeet their next-door neighbors from the other factions, and I thought \nthis is going to take a long time. The atrocities committed right in \nBrcko against thousands of Muslims are as bad as anything I have ever \nheard reported from the Nazi atrocities of World War II. Yet, we are \ntrying to say ``come and live together like Americans do.'' It looks \nlike we are trying to create multiethnic neighborhoods, forcing people \nto do this prematurely, after the atrocities that have occurred in that \ncountry. This in itself can be antipeaceful. I think it is going to \nprolong the uprisings if we try to force this before the people \nthemselves are ready--before the wounds have healed.\n  So I hope that we can let things settle, let the peace settle in, and \nlet's do what we said we were going to do. Let's start training the \npeople who are there to be a peacekeeping and police force. This could \nbe done in an orderly way. We could begin with a NATO force that \ntransitions and trains the forces that would come in behind them. They \nwill be able to keep their peace, but it will not be an incentive for \nthem to take over this job if they know that we are going to be there \nto do it for them.\n  I hope that we can create the base for an honorable exit. My \namendment just tries to get a more equitable distribution of forces so \nthat the burden is more equally shared between the United States and \nour NATO allies in Europe. It validates the legitimate responsibility \nthat Congress has to authorize the long-term deployment of forces \naround the world by requiring a vote on the President's plan.\n  Without this amendment, we will be looking at American troops in \nBosnia indefinitely. We will be looking at a never-ending commitment, \nand we will be taking resources that are vitally necessary for our own \nsecurity and for our responsibilities around the world.\n  It is most important that we establish a policy that can succeed. \nKeeping thousands of American troops in a 30,000-troop enclave in \nBosnia in perpetuity is not good military strategy and is not based on \ngood policy. Remember what Shalikashvili said: ``Having a defined \ndeadline is important to avoid mission creep.'' We have learned that \nbefore and we should not forget the lesson. I think it is important for \nus to begin to act like the superpower that we are. When a superpower \nmakes a commitment, it must be willing to back it up and do what it \nsays it is going to do. It is so important that we act firmly. It was \nimportant in Iraq. It is important in Bosnia that when we set \ndeadlines, we meet them, so that everyone knows what to expect. It is \nmost important, Mr. President, that we look at our security forces and \nthe money that we are spending on our defense. We are lowering our \ndefense expenditures while increasing the OPTEMPO--increasing the \noperations we are getting involved in around the world. This is despite \nwarning after warning from past Presidents, from past Chairmen of the \nJoint Chiefs, from the experts who have seen history and have learned \nfrom it.\n  We can do things that no one else in the world can do. We can provide \nan umbrella of defense for ballistic missiles, for nuclear weaponry, \nbut that takes a commitment of money and a commitment of will. If we \nare dissipating to the tune of about $3 billion a year in a \npeacekeeping mission, which can be done just as well by any of our \nother allies, we are walking away from the responsibility we have to \nour allies to protect them in a way that only we can, because only we \nhave the resources to do it.\n  Mr. President, I don't see how our colleagues can express alarm about \nthe decline in U.S. readiness, and at the same time, ignore the \npolicies that are causing the decline. It is our responsibility to act \nwhen our troops are going to be sent to an overseas conflict or \nmissions of any kind when they are long-term. The President has now \nsaid it is going to be long-term--in fact, unending. If we don't have \nany set time, we will forget and the Bosnia operation will be in \nperpetuity. Those who are relying on us will continue to. Why shouldn't \nthey? What incentive do they have to start the training of their own \nforces, which was envisioned in the Dayton accords?\n  I hope my colleagues will look at this very small first step in \nexercising Congress' responsibility. This is a precedent that has been \nset by Congresses in the past. We have set time deadlines. We have \nstopped the funding for operations that Congress did not think should \nbe continued. This has happened in Cambodia, Vietnam, Somalia, Rwanda, \nand even in Korea, in the Philippines, and in Japan. We have spoken. In \nthe past, Congress has stepped up to its responsibility. I hope it will \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I will stop at this point because others want to \nspeak. I do hope that my colleagues will focus carefully on this step. \nIt is not even a major step of withdrawing from Bosnia. It is to just \nsay we want our allies to accept more of the responsibility so that our \ntroops will be able to do what\n\n[[Page S9362]]\n\nthey do best, and that is to train for the contingency that only we can \naddress; that we will have the money to be able to invest in the \ntechnology that will protect the world from ballistic missiles and \nnuclear, biological, and chemical weapons; and that we will not lose \nour most experienced personnel because they are worn out from mission \nfatigue on operations they do not see as threats to U.S. security.\n\n  Mr. President, I thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the \nHutchison amendment, No. 3413, to the DOD appropriations bill \nconcerning Bosnia.\n  I want to very sincerely commend the Senator from Texas for all the \nhard work she continues to devote to this important issue and for \ntrying to craft a compromise that would be acceptable to a majority of \nour colleagues regarding the United States' ongoing presence in Bosnia \nand Herzegovina.\n  As my friend from Texas has already explained, this amendment \nmandates a withdrawal of U.S. forces participating in the NATO \nStabilization Force, or S-FOR, requiring that that force, or any future \nmulti-national successor force, shall not exceed 6,500 troops by \nFebruary 2, 1999, and 5,000 troops by October 1, 1999. The amendment \nenforces these levels by tying any appropriated funds for the Bosnia \nmission to this troop reduction.\n  This amendment represents something less than a funding cut-off for \nthe mission, although that is a policy I have pursued in the past.\n  Rather, it suggests a slow and careful drawdown of U.S. forces in the \nregion. In fact, it allows for troops to stay there past October of \nnext year!\n  Mr. President, this is July 30. This is exactly 1 month after the \ndate that we were supposed to be out of Bosnia in the first place. That \nisn't even accurate, because really we were supposed to be out of \nBosnia in the first place, according to the promises that were made by \nboth parties, by December 30, 1996. So we are way beyond that date.\n  Our troops have been there since 1995--much longer than the original \n1-year mandate, and already longer than the expanded 18-month mandate \nfor S-FOR--and I do not think anyone has a good idea how many more \nyears we will be there.\n  More significantly, the cost of our involvement in Bosnia has \nincreased dramatically--easily more than quadrupling the original $2 \nbillion estimate to over $9 billion.\n  The estimate is that it is now well over $9 billion for this \ncommitment that has already been spent or obligated.\n  Mr. President, I regret that the managers of this bill earlier today \nagreed to a provision that would allow $1.8 billion in additional funds \nfor the Bosnia mission to be added to this bill with an emergency \ndesignation.\n  Mr. President, the mission in Bosnia has clearly ceased to be an \nemergency, and this amendment even recognizes that fact.\n  The fact that the emergency designation was inserted into the bill \nthis morning unfortunately highlights the fact that we in Congress \ncontinue to be lax in establishing some kind of accountability for our \ncontinued operation in Bosnia, and particularly for the taxpayer \ndollars that are needed to support that operation, soon to approach the \nastounding figure of $10 billion.\n  I recognize that my continued opposition to the mission in Bosnia is \nnot shared by everyone in Congress. But I think all of us would agree \nthat the Congress has a constitutional responsibility to provide a \ncheck on the manner in which the executive branch spends money.\n  This is the way the President spends an annual budget request to the \nCongress with his plans for the following year's spending. From time to \ntime there are emergencies that can not be foreseen, and we deal with \nthose accordingly as emergencies.\n  But let me repeat again, U.S. involvement in Bosnia has ceased to be \nan emergency.\n  Rather, our presence in Bosnia has clearly become a substantial, \nlong-term commitment. It is something the United States has, for better \nor worse, decided to do for the long-term. And we need to evaluate this \noperation on its merits accordingly, and not pretend that it is an \nappropriate occasion for an emergency designation.\n  The amendment by the Senator from Texas can at least put some real \npressure on the administration to develop plans for a reduction in \ntroop levels in Bosnia. The amendment also would have a positive \nbudgetary impact, because we would need fewer resources to support a \nsmaller troop presence.\n  Mr. President, with or without this amendment, I think we all \nrecognize that there will be troops in Bosnia next year.\n  So, this is not an emergency, and I think the Congress has a \nresponsibility to face that fact and deal with it accordingly.\n  I hope, therefore, that those of my colleagues who do support the \nmission in Bosnia will cease to resort to maneuvers regarding the \nfunding of this mission that seek to avoid our budget spending caps! \nThis has been going on far too long, and has eaten up too many of our \nresources--human, financial and otherwise. We cannot continue with this \nbudgetary game.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased once again to join the junior Senator \nfrom Texas in trying to assert some kind of accountability for this \nmission. I urge my colleagues to support her amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, it is with reluctance I rise to oppose the \namendment offered by my colleague, the Senator from Texas, because we \nshare much the same goal. We had the same concerns about the deployment \nof our troops to Bosnia initially. We had the same concerns about the \nDayton accord, which, as presented to us, was transparent on its face. \nIt was disingenuous on its face that we could accomplish the task \nincorporated in Dayton with a 1-year period of time of deployment of \nour troops on the ground, a timetable unachievable by any measure. The \ncontinued existence of our involvement in Bosnia is something that I \ndon't support.\n  But I believe that the amendment has a fatal flaw, and the fatal flaw \nis that it makes Congress the determiner of how many troops and what \ntime period those troops will be deployed once that decision has been \nmade by the Commander in Chief, the President of the United States.\n  I find it difficult to stand up here and defend the powers of the \nPresident of the United States, particularly at a time like this. But \nthere are constitutional prerogatives and constitutional powers that I \nthink need defending regardless of what your personal assessment is of \nany particular President.\n  Second, I believe it is unwise policy for those of us to make \ndecisions about the force levels of our troops or decisions that \nmicromanage how those troops conduct themselves and how they accomplish \ntheir mission once the decision has been made. Clearly, our \nresponsibility, if we disagree with the presence of those troops and \nthe deployment of those troops, is to address that by eliminating the \nfunding for those troops, but not to determine the force level of those \ntroops, the kind of equipment they ought to have, and what their \ntimetable ought to be.\n  I quote from a letter from the Secretary of Defense dated May 21, \n1998, when he says, ``Our military commanders in the field have \ndetermined the level and type of force required to carry out the \nmission within acceptable risks. The mission force and guidance of the \nforce currently planned for have been fully agreed to by military \nauthorities. Military commanders''--under the amendment offered here--\n``Military commanders would be forced to restructure their force and \nmission tasks based on an arbitrarily mandated schedule rather than on \nmission accomplishment, operational consideration, and the fluid \ntactical situations they face. In addition, legislating withdrawal \nwould incite heightened intransigence and extremism.''\n  Mr. President, we sadly learned in Somalia, to cite one example, the \ndisastrous and tragic consequences of political decisions overriding \nmilitary requests. We lost some brave Americans unnecessarily because \nthe political decision was made to not provide those\n\n[[Page S9363]]\n\nforces with the necessary equipment and not base a sufficient force \nthere until our mission was accomplished. I don't want to see us doing \nthat again.\n  We in Congress do not have the expertise to make that decision. Even \nif we did, we shouldn't make that decision. That is a decision that \nought to be made by those who command the troops and make the decisions \nabout their presence and what they need to be there.\n  So I strongly, strongly urge my colleagues to vote to table this \namendment, not because they necessarily agree or disagree with whether \nor not this is a proper deployment, not because this impacts our \nreadiness, which it does, not because it is costing a lot of money, \nwhich it is, not because it was a bad decision to start with, and an \nunachievable mission and objective to start with, because it is, but \nbecause it tells our troops that we in Congress know more about what \nthey need, what the troop levels should be, what the date of withdrawal \nshould be, how we accomplish the mission of our military commanders. \nThose men and women in uniform who we put in harm's way have to have \nevery advantage we can give them in terms of protecting their security, \nin terms of accomplishing their mission, and it is a decision that has \nto be made by people with military expertise and not Members of \nCongress. For that reason, I strongly urge that we table this well-\nintended but, I think, misguided amendment.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Bosnia \namendment introduced by the junior Senator from Texas. Before I discuss \nthe reasons for my opposition, I would like to commend the Senator for \nher continuing interest and involvement in U.S. foreign policy. The \nSenator is one of this body's most active Members, and while I have \noften opposed her legislative initiatives, which seemed to me \nunnecessarily to limit American involvement abroad, I value her \nenthusiasm and engagement.\n  The amendment that Senator Hutchison has proposed today sets \narbitrary caps on our troop strength in Bosnia and micromanages their \nduties from the vantage point of Washington, D.C.--4,000 miles from \nBosnia and Herzegovina! The amendment is fatally flawed.\n  Mr. President, the Hutchison amendment is predicated upon a false \nassertion: that the U.S. contribution to SFOR is inequitable and \ndisproportionately large. I will return to that inaccurate claim in a \nmoment.\n  Moreover, the amendment makes several incorrect claims about the \ncurrent situation in Bosnia, for example that NATO forces participate \nin law enforcement activities there.\n  In circumscribing future activities, it also incorrectly implies that \nNATO forces are transferring refugees or that refugees are relocating \nin order to control the territory of the other Bosnian entity.\n  But, Mr. President, the core of my opposition to the Hutchison \namendment is the same as was my opposition last month to the Thurmond \namendment to the Defense authorization bill.\n  Put quite simply, if the United States wishes to remain the leader of \nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization, then it must continue to lead!\n  Mr. President, leadership means being present in all aspects of NATO \noperations and sharing in the risks.\n  The Hutchison amendment is a prescription for ``NATO a la carte.''\n  By February 1999 it would allow exceptions in Bosnia to the arbitrary \ntroop limits in Bosnia only for self-protection as we withdraw our \nforces, to protect U.S. diplomatic facilities, or in advisory support \nroles.\n  That might work for a junior member of the Alliance, but not for the \nUnited States of America. Not for the leader of NATO.\n  Let me return to the false assumption that underlies the Hutchison \namendment--that our participation in SFOR is disproportionately large.\n  As a matter of fact, Mr. President, while the U.S. contribution to \nSFOR remains the largest single national contribution, the proportion \nof U.S. forces within NATO forces in Bosnia has declined dramatically \nsince initial deployment in December 1995.\n  At the outset, U.S. troops made up fully one-third of IFOR. As a \nresult of steady, measured reductions, U.S. participation has dropped \nto one-fifth of SFOR.\n  In other words, our allies and other SFOR partners have agreed to the \nU.S. taking disproportionate cuts in force numbers at each milestone, \nwhile continuing to accept U.S. command of the overall force.\n  At the current time, our European allies alone contribute more than \nthree-and-one-half times the number of troops in SFOR than we do.\n  Attempting to lower the U.S. proportion to equal or below that of any \nsingle European ally would almost certainly cost us our command \nposition. Some Members of the Senate might welcome such a development. \nI would not.\n  I want the United States to retain command of SFOR in order to ensure \nthat the pace of implementing the Dayton Accords holds steady or \naccelerates.\n  I want the United States to retain command of SFOR in order to \nmaximize the effectiveness and protection of the U.S. forces in Bosnia.\n  We are in Bosnia because helping to resolve the Bosnian problem is in \nour national interest.\n  As was repeatedly pointed out by this Senator and many others during \nthe debate on NATO enlargement last spring, that is the reason we are \nin Europe at all.\n  In political, security, and economic terms, we are a European power. \nOur engagement in Europe, including Bosnia, is not a charity operation. \nStability in Europe benefits us.\n  The European allies of the United States are playing a major role in \nBosnia.\n  Because of our leadership role in NATO, and because of our superior \nlogistical capabilities, we have maintained command of SFOR. This is \nhow it should be.\n  Like my colleagues, I am in favor of the speediest fulfillment of the \nDayton Accords so that Bosnia and Herzegovina will have a self-\nsustaining democracy and all foreign troops may be withdrawn. American \ncommand of SFOR is the best guarantee that we can rapidly achieve this \ngoal.\n  The Hutchison amendment would, I submit, gravely undermine that \nAmerican command in Bosnia and would set in motion a process that could \nultimately result in loss of the position of SACEUR, the command of \nNATO land forces in Europe.\n  For all these reasons, I oppose the Hutchison amendment, and I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in defeating it.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I will take no more time. I know my friend from \nArizona is about to make some comments.\n  Last spring this was a bad idea. Nothing has caused it to become a \ngood idea in the summer. It was a bad idea then; it is a bad idea now. \nI hope it will be tabled.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Delaware, who obviously is very \nknowledgeable on this issue and has stayed focused on these issues for \nmany, many years.\n  I also wish to thank the Senator from Indiana for his very forceful \npresentation.\n  Mr. President, I believe everyone in this body knows that I have long \nhad serious concerns about our mission in Bosnia. From the time the \nIFOR mission was first briefed to the Congress, I knew the job could \nnot be completed in one year--nor against any arbitrary deadline. \nInstead, I urged the Administration to set concrete objectives and \nbenchmarks for measuring success.\n  Now, as many members have pointed out, we are in an open-ended and \nill-defined military commitment. The Administration has scrapped all \nthe artificial deadlines. But no clear set of objectives and well-\ndefined military missions has taken its place. We seem to drift in and \nout of going after war criminals, of using the military to resettle \nrefugees, and of taking on a direct political role in parts of Bosnia \nin the name of supporting international civilian authorities. The role \nof our military has expanded, and there is no end in sight.\n  The answer to this problem, however, is not to go back and set new \nartificial deadlines or troop levels. And make no mistake about it, Mr. \nPresident. The amendment before us is little different than the one the \nSenate rejected last month.\n\n[[Page S9364]]\n\n  Bosnia is a long-term, complicated problem. It involves not only the \nwarring factions, but has direct effects on Croatia and Serbia, \nincluding Kosovo, and threatens to spill over to the wider Balkan \nregion. The credibility of NATO and especially the United States is \ntied up with finding a solution for the Bosnia crisis. It would be \nsheer irresponsibility, probably leading to renewed warfare, if we were \nto precipitously pull Out of Bosnia after investing so much. It would \nbe a betrayal of our commitment to cooperating with our Allies. And it \ncould well lead to an even more costly and dangerous re-introduction of \nAmerican forces to stop the renewed fighting.\n  Dealing with the Bosnia crisis--even if though our objective is to \nget American troops out of there--requires treating Bosnia as a serious \nlong-term challenge. It is not an issue that lends itself to artificial \ndeadlines for withdrawal. Nor is there any rationale to forcing the \nCongress to vote by some artificial deadline. Worse still would be a \nfunding cut-off, which would only punish our troops for the failure of \npolicy makers in Washington to craft a viable long term policy.\n  I would like to offer six principles that I believe should guide our \npolicy:\n  (1) The U.S. has no permanent national interests in Bosnia. We are \nnot interested in nation-building for its own sake. All we want is to \ncreate a self-sustaining peace. We must carry out our responsibilities \nand then get out.\n  (2) Our withdrawal must not precipitate renewed warfare in Bosnia.\n  (3) There must be no phony deadlines--whether for a withdrawal date, \na Senate vote, or anything else. We have all the power we need to act \nwhenever we want. We don't need a deadline. We need sound policy.\n  (4) There must be no funding cut-offs or troop limits. This would \nonly hurt our troops on the ground. The real problem is policy making \nhere in Washington. It needs to be solved here.\n  (5) There must be no micro-management of the military. The Congress \nand Administration must provide political leadership. We must make the \ntough decisions and bear the consequences. The military's job is to \nimplement our decisions as effectively as possible based solely on \nmilitary considerations. The military has no business making political \ndecisions for us, and we have no business making military decisions for \nthem.\n  (6) The U.S. must provide leadership. No other country in the world \nhas the political, military, and moral authority to exert leadership. \nSimply packing our bags and walking away is not an option. We must not \nsimply abandon our Allies. We must leave Bosnia, but with dignity and \nleadership, leaving behind a well-planned succession.\n  Handling the Bosnia crisis requires us to look beyond just this \nfiscal year. It requires the United States to develop a multi-year \nstrategy that sets Out our objectives, the means for achieving these \nobjectives, and a target timetable for getting us there--but no phony \ndeadlines. For the sake of our troops, we need to set out clearly the \nmiltary and nonmilitary missions they are being asked to perform. \n`Creative ambiguity' may be useful in politics, but it is dangerous for \nsoldiers. We need to be honest with ourselves about the risks we are \nasking our troops to face, and the costs to the taxpayers of continuing \nthe mission.\n  I am convinced that the direction we should be taking is to move \ntoward a force made up of European nations inside Bosnia, with U.S. \nforces just ``over-the-horizon'' outside of Bosnia--providing a rapid \nresponse capability to deter security threats, and providing \nlogistical, intelligence, and air support to the European forces inside \nBosnia. This step would free up U.S. forces to prepare for other \ncontingencies.\n  But it is not possible to achieve this goal simply by setting \narbitrary numbers, or even numbers arrived at through an averaging \nprocess involving contributions of countries with militaries' a \nfraction the size of our own, and deadlines for troop withdrawals. \nDoing so could provoke a crisis with our Allies and could have the \neffect of simply setting a timeable for restoring violence to Bosnia. \nInstead, achieving this goal requires working together with our Allies \nand realistically taking account of the situation inside Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, the Senate already approved an amendment, of which I \nsponsored, that seeks to do exactly these things. It imposes a number \nof reporting requirements, designed to provide the basis for moving us \nin the direction we all want to go. According to the amendment already \npassed by the Senate just over one month ago, each time the \nAdministration submits a budget request for funding military operations \nin Bosnia, the Administration must clearly state its best assessment of \nsix items:\n  (1) our overall objectives and multi-year timetable for achieving \nthese objectives--taking account of the benchmarks already required \nunder the supplemental appropriation passed earlier this year;\n  (2) the military and nonmilitary missiosn the President has directed \nU.S. forces to carry out--including specific language on our policy on \nwar criminals, returning refugees, police functions, and support for \ncivil implementation;\n  (3) the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's assessment of the \nrisks these missions present to U.S. military personnel;\n  (4) the cost of executing our strategy over several fiscal years.\n  (5) the status of plans to move forward a European force inside \nBosnia with a U.S. force outside Bosnia that would deter threats and \nprovide support to the European force; and\n  (6) an assessment of the impact of reducing our forces according to \nthe timetable proposed in the original Byrd-Hutchison amendment.\n  This may seem like a detailed and onerous reporting requirement, but \nit is nothing more than the king of long-term planning the \nAdministration should be doing anyway. And by requiring it in a report \nto Congress, we ensure that the Congress is operating off the same set \nof assumptions and plans as the Administration. This will give us an \nopportunity to look more thoughtfully at the real challenges in Bosnia \nand structure our decisions more appropriately. Instead of broad swipes \nthrough artificial deadlines or prohibitions on certain missions, we \nwill be able to target our policy choices more effectively.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to elaborate very much on what the \nSenator from Indiana had to say, except to ask unanimous consent that a \nletter to Senator Strom Thurmond, the chairman of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, written by General Shelton and Secretary Cohen be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, 21 May 1998.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We write to express our concerns with \n     any amendment that would legislate a date or schedule for \n     withdrawal or reduction of US forces from the NATO-led \n     mission in Bosnia. Such amendments would make it more \n     difficult to accomplish the mission, which has been \n     remarkable successful to date.\n       It is our intention to reduce our forces in Bosnia. Based \n     on the progress achieved to date, our commanders already have \n     been able to reduce US troop levels from almost 20,000 in \n     1996 to the 6,900 that will be deployed after the current \n     drawdown is completed in September. We will conduct regular \n     reviews of our force posture and progress toward the \n     benchmarks we have established, and we expect further \n     reductions will be possible. But that determination is best \n     based on the actual situation on the ground, the military \n     advice of our commanders in the field, and the approval of \n     the NATO military and political authorities, not an arbitrary \n     withdrawal or reduction dates determined long in advance.\n       Our military commanders in the field have determined the \n     level and type of force required to carry out the mission \n     within acceptable risk. The mission, forces and guidance of \n     the force currently planned for June 1998 have been fully \n     agreed to by NATO political and military authorities. Under a \n     legislated approach, military commanders would be forced to \n     restructure their force and mission tasks based on an \n     arbitrarily mandated schedule rather than on mission \n     accomplishment, operational considerations, and the fluid \n     tactical situation they face. In addition, while those \n     opposed to the Dayton Accords have been steadily isolated and \n     diminished in their influence, legislating withdrawal of \n     reduction dates would invite heightened intransigence and \n     extremism.\n       Additional factors that Congress should consider in \n     reviewing any such amendment are the following:\n       Under the proposed amendment, command of the SFOR operation \n     and its element in\n\n[[Page S9365]]\n\n     MND-North might well be transferred to a non-US officer early \n     next year.\n       Shifting to a posture in which the US has much smaller \n     force levels in Bosnia but enhances its force presence in \n     regions surrounding Bosnia, as envisioned by the amendment, \n     will not save money and indeed could cost more than our \n     current operation in Bosnia. We are continually evaluating \n     the force posture for Bosnia, and do not consider an over-\n     the-horizon force appropriate now.\n       Accordingly, we strongly urge you to oppose any legislated \n     fixed date or timetable for withdrawal or reduction of US \n     forces in Bosnia.\n       There is one other factor related to operations in Bosnia \n     of great concern to us, and that is funding. The Department \n     submitted an addition to the FY99 budget to fund a 6,900-\n     person force in Bosnia. Authorizing that request is essential \n     to accomplishing the mission without significantly reducing \n     readiness in other areas. Without that funding, we would have \n     to choose between Bosnia operations and the overall readiness \n     of our Armed Forces.\n           Sincerely,\n     Henry H. Shelton.\n     Bill Cohen.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in Secretary Cohen and General Shelton's \nletter the Senator from Indiana just referred to, it is very important \nto understand what they are saying here:\n\n       Under a legislated approach, military commanders will be \n     forced to restructure their force and mission tasks based on \n     an arbitrarily mandated schedule rather than on mission \n     accomplishment, operational considerations and the fluid \n     tactical situation they face. In addition, while those \n     opposed to the Dayton Accords have been steadily isolated and \n     diminished in their influence, legislating withdrawal of \n     reduction dates would invite heightened intransigence and \n     extremism.\n\n  So that is the view of the people to whom we entrust the care of our \nmen and women in the military.\n  I think it would be very appropriate to have a vigorous and, I think, \nilluminating debate on the issue of whether the troops should be there \nat all. Congress clearly has the right to cut off funding for any \nmilitary operation anywhere in the world. But I see nowhere in the \nConstitution where we have the right to, indeed, decide the levels of \ntroops that should be there. I pride myself on the fact that I had some \ntime in the service of our country wearing a uniform, but no way does \nthat give me the expertise or the knowledge to set a troop level. That \nresponsibility is entrusted to our civilian and military commanders.\n  So it is with reluctance, because I agree with the thrust of what \nSenator Hutchison is saying, Mr. President, I move to table the \nHutchison amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator allow me to speak on this \namendment before he moves to table?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Absolutely.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator also allow others who said they \nwould like to speak on this amendment to speak and then move to table?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I do not intend that the request--I will allow the \ndistinguished manager of the bill. It is nearly 5 o'clock. We have 50 \npending amendments.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to be able to close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator withdraw the motion to table?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair needs to know whether the Senator \nhas withdrawn his motion to table.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I withdraw my motion to table and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I was trying to condition that motion to table. I know \nSenator Byrd is one of the original cosponsors, Senator Hutchison also. \nBut we do have to move along. I am a cosponsor also. But I do think we \nhave to have some time limit.\n  Would the Senator be willing to have some discussion as to a time \nwhen we might be able to vote?\n  Mr. BYRD. I, first of all, wish to thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona for withholding his motion. I would probably need 25 \nminutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. And how much time does the Senator want?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, Senator Inhofe and Senator Sessions \nhave both asked to speak for approximately 10 minutes each, and then I \nwould like to close on my amendment with about 10 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Senator Inhofe said he does not wish to speak on the \namendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. He has gone to a meeting.\n  Mr. President, I would like to put some time restraints on this, if \nwe could. I would like to see if we could have the vote take place no \nlater than quarter to 6.\n  Could we have that agreement?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, a lot of us \nwithheld speaking against this amendment, and I hope that maybe just \nthe Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, would speak and then all \nthose who already spoke refrain from speaking again so people such as \nme don't feel compelled to stand up and respond. We are trying to get \nthis done. Because the Senator from Arizona was kind enough to withhold \nhis motion to table, I hope we could agree that after the Senator from \nWest Virginia speaks, and maybe the Senator from Texas takes a couple \nminutes to close out, we then let the Senator move. It would be \nhelpful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would then ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Byrd be recognized, and the Senator from Texas have whatever \ntime is remaining, and the Senator from Arizona be recognized to make \nhis motion to table at 5:30. And it is with the understanding that if \nthe amendment is not tabled, there is no agreement on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. After Senator Byrd speaks, I would be allowed at \nleast 5 minutes to close?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That leaves 10 minutes, I might say to the Senator, in \nher control; 25 minutes in the control of the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That will be fine. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nunanimous consent agreement is accepted.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Pardon me. The agreement is the Senator from Arizona \nwill be recognized, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is part of the unanimous consent \nagreement.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Has the agreement \nbeen entered into?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, it has. Is the Senator from Michigan upset?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would like 5 minutes, if I could.\n  Mr. STEVENS. On which amendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. On the pending amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator has not spoken on the amendment.\n  May I extend him another 5 minutes. We will vote, then--let's put \nthat off. When that time has expired, I do want to ask unanimous \nconsent that we then proceed to the Hutchinson amendment in the second \ndegree to his amendment, and following that, there will be a vote. I \nunderstand there is an agreement so I don't think we need a time \nagreement. But I would ask that the time on this expire at 5:40 and \nthat we then proceed to the Hutchinson amendment in the second degree--\nthere will be three comments about that amendment--and that we vote on \nboth of those amendments at 6 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Reserving the right to object, why didn't the Senator just \nleave it at 5:30 the way you had it? I think the Senator from Michigan \nmay be willing to take, say, a minute.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Very well. At 5:30 he gets a minute, and we will go \nback. We still want to have a vote on the two amendments at the same \ntime. I will renew that request later.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, but I will \nnot object, could I just inquire, did I understand the Senator to say \nthat the second degree will be in order if the amendment is not tabled?\n  Mr. STEVENS. If it is not tabled. There is no second-degree amendment \navailable because the Senator from Arizona will be recognized to table \nat the end of these statements.\n  Mr. COATS. If not tabled, the second degree--\n  Mr. STEVENS. If not tabled, the second degree is still in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from West Virginia.\n\n[[Page S9366]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank all Senators, and I, again, thank \nthe distinguished Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, for \noffering this amendment regarding the continued participation of U.S. \nforces in the NATO operation in Bosnia. She has been a persistent and \nthorough overseer of the situation there. I share her concern that \nBosnia not become another forgotten war, another long term military \nmission whose purpose and even existence is largely ignored, unremarked \nupon unless something terrible happens. In that unhappy event, of \ncourse, much shouting and finger-pointing would ensue, amid calls to \n``bring our boys home, now.''\n  It is Congress's Constitutional duty to provide for the maintenance \nof the military, as we are doing in this bill, and that includes those \ninstances in which U.S. troops are pressed into service. We have an \nobligation to the men and women in our military services not only to \nprovide for them, but also to provide our concurrence and oversight on \nthe ways and places that they are employed. I believe that that calls \nfor something more compelling than Sense of Congress resolutions, such \nas those that have been passed, one that has been passed during the \ndebate on the Department of Defense Authorization bill last month, but \nI recognize that, sadly, the majority of my colleagues do not share my \nopinion. So I applaud Senator Hutchison for steaming ahead on the \nstrength of her convictions, despite the somewhat daunting odds.\n  U.S. troops have been in Bosnia since the Dayton Peace Accords were \nsigned in December 1995. Some 25,000 U.S. troops formed the U.S. \ncontingent of the NATO-led force that replaced the failing United \nNations peacekeeping effort there since 1992. The original mission of \nthe NATO force was quite limited--to separate the warring factions, \ncontain the heavy weapons that were bombarding defenseless towns and \ncities, and begin to mark the hazardous and indiscriminately strewn \nminefields so that civilians could take over the arduous task of \nclearing mines. The U.S. had to lead, because our European allies would \nnot rally behind anyone else. This task, we were assured at that time, \nwould take ``about one year.'' And that was in 1995.\n  As that initial year drew to a close, the military tasks were \ndeclared essentially complete, and the situation on the ground was, \nindeed, transformed. While far from enjoying the kind of security that \nwe in the United States take for granted, people could at least seek \nwater without dodging shells and gunfire. The civilian efforts to \nreestablish Bosnian society, however, had barely begun. NATO leaders \nagreed to leave substantial numbers of troops in place to keep the \npeace while the civilian rebuilding effort continued. That is \nunderstandable. Again, the U.S., we were assured, must take the lead, \nbecause if we left, our European NATO allies would march out right \nbehind us. We were told that the troops would be needed only through \nJune 1998. That was in 1996.\n  Now it is July 1998, almost August. We have been told that the \nconsiderable progress being made in rebuilding a government and \ncivilian infrastructure requires the continued reassurance of a NATO \npeacekeeping force. Elections are scheduled for September, and more \nwork needs to be done to establish a competent and impartial justice \nsystem that has the trust of the populace. Therefore, the \nAdministration announced a substantial shift in U.S. policy on Bosnia \nin December 1997--there would be no further estimates regarding the end \nof a U.S. presence in Bosnia. The U.S. and NATO would leave when \nsufficient progress was made in achieving certain benchmarks. The \ncomplete and detailed benchmarks are classified, but the unclassified \nsummary that I have seen is fairly lengthy. It basically says that when \nBosnian government and institutions resemble those of the United \nStates, then our troops might leave.\n  Mr. President, that is a pretty big order. Bosnia has never \npreviously resembled the United States, with free press, alternative \nmedia, free and fair multiparty elections, a clean and impartial \njudiciary, free access throughout the country, and so forth. For most \nof this century, Bosnia was part of communist Yugoslavia. Prior to \nthat, it was part of a monarchy, and before that, it was part of the \nOttoman Empire. This leads me to suspect that U.S. troops might be in \nBosnia for a very long time, indeed, before Bosnia becomes a happy, \npeaceful, multi-ethnic republic. And this assumes, of course, that \neveryone in Bosnia shares this same aspiration, and that no one will \ntry to undermine the progress towards this utopian vision.\n  Now, Mr. President, I do not want to create the impression that I am \nagainst helping the suffering people of Bosnia to establish a sound \ngovernment that can lead them into a peaceful and prosperous future in \nthe family of nations. The amendment of the Senator from Texas, Mrs. \nHutchison, also does not call for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from \nBosnia. This amendment appreciates the investment that has been made \nfor peace in Bosnia and does not jeopardize that still fragile \nsituation, but it also recognizes the considerable costs of that \ninvestment.\n  I believe that Senator Hutchison's effort addresses three very basic \nquestions regarding the continuing role of U.S. forces in Bosnia. These \nare the questions:\n  First, does this Senate really want to acquiesce to an open-ended \ncommitment in Bosnia for the foreseeable future? The United States has \nspent $8.6 billion, or about $2 billion a year, to maintain our \npresence in Bosnia from Fiscal Year 1996 through Fiscal Year 1999. If \nyou include the U.S. share of the United Nations operation in Bosnia \nfrom 1992 through 1995, the total cost is about $9.5 billion.\n  That is a lot of money. That is $9.50 for every minute since Jesus \nChrist was born, 2,000 years ago. For every minute since Jesus Christ \nwas born, 2,000 years ago, $9.50. For every minute. That is what it \nequals.\n  This bill provides $1.86 billion for Bosnia operating costs for \nFiscal Year 1999, under an emergency declaration.\n  There are approximately 6700 troops inside Bosnia now, down from \nalmost 10,000, and another 3,000 more are supporting them from bases in \nHungary, Italy, and on ships in the Mediterranean. These troops and \nthese funds are not available to meet other crises that might arise, \nsuch as that developing in Kosovo, and they are not available to \nprotect U.S. core national security interests. Further, the support \ntroops employed in this mission are drawn heavily from the Guard and \nReserves, creating hardships for our part-time military and their \nemployers. The President will need to request continued Reserve call-up \nauthority in August to maintain the Bosnia operation. These readiness \nquestions must be measured against the estimate of how many troops are \nneeded to provide continued reassurance for civilian reconstruction in \nBosnia--what is the minimum number of troops required to provide that \nreassurance? And for how long? And at what cost? Let us not be \nsatisfied with the status quo, if a lower number is adequate or if a \nshorter time is sufficient. There are too many other demands being \nplaced upon U.S. Armed Forces for us to be spendthrifts in this regard.\n  Second, does the Senate wish to continue to allow the United States \nto be led by the reluctance of others? Must the United States continue \nto provide a substantially greater number of troops than any of the \nother NATO allies, as is now envisioned? If we cannot pass the baton of \nleadership because our European allies will not lead, then should we \nnot at least push them into carrying an equal military burden for a \nsituation that is, after all, on their borders, not on ours? I know \nthat it is easier to be a follower than a leader, easier to be a critic \nrather than a playwright, but as the Bosnia operation settles into a \nroutine, surely some of this burden could be assumed by our allies.\n  Third, does the Senate want to abstain from placing limits on the \nrole that U.S. forces should play in Bosnia? Or do we want to enhance \nthe safety of the men and women we are supporting on the ground there \nby prohibiting them from performing the kinds of activities that put \nthem in harm's way by making them appear to side with one ethnic group \nover another? NATO forces have played an increasing role in the capture \nof war criminals, and have taken over radio transmission towers linked \nwith propaganda practices. A news story from early July reported that \nU.S. special operations teams\n\n[[Page S9367]]\n\ncame very close to mounting a ``snatch and grab'' exercise designed to \ncapture Serb military leaders before commanders on the ground declared \nthat the intelligence was insufficient to ensure a reasonable chance of \nsuccess. The longer we stay in Bosnia, and the more manpower we have to \nspare, the more such jobs we will be drawn into doing. It is the \nAmerican way, to say, ``we'll pitch in.'' And we are suckers for the \nunderdog. But that can be dangerous in a place as rife with centuries-\nold animosities as Bosnia. These ethnic and religious factions know how \nto carry a grudge, how to nurse an injustice, through centuries if need \nbe.\n  With these questions in mind, consider the current situation in the \nBalkans, as Senator Hutchison has. Bosnia is relatively stable. No one \nis shooting at each other, and no one is shooting at the NATO forces. \nBut, Kosovo, on its borders, is not stable. There, the situation is \nrapidly degenerating. Already more than 10,000 refugees have fled into \nneighboring Albania to seek refuge from Serbian dominated Yugoslav \nmilitary forces who are ruthlessly squashing a separatist movement in \nethnically Albanian Kosovo, which had been an autonomous region of \nYugoslavia until 1989. The situation is complex and, frighteningly, \ncontains the potential to draw in neighboring nations and even NATO \nmembers. This is the dreaded ``spillover'' that was much discussed when \nthe ethnic conflagration in Bosnia erupted in 1992.\n  NATO officials have already contemplated what forces might be \nnecessary to contain the conflict in Kosovo. Even with over 20,000 \ntroops spread along the mountainous border between Kosovo and Albania, \nthey concluded, the probability of success would be low. Air strikes \nare under consideration. Diplomatic efforts are ongoing, but the \nYugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic has an unsavory history of playing \nboth ends against the middle to achieve his goals.\n  It is clear that the cost of maintaining a large presence in Bosnia \ncould be fairly high if forces are needed to contain the conflict in \nKosovo and keep it from engulfing a large part of the Balkans. Our NATO \nallies will happily continue to let the U.S. carry the heaviest load in \naddition to the burdens of leadership, if all it takes is to threaten \nto beat us through the exit door, should we decide to leave. To hear \nthem say it, it would be quite a stampede, no matter what the \nconsequences are for Bosnia and their own continent's future.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Hutchison calls for a gradual \nramping down of the U.S. presence in Bosnia, reducing our forces there \nto 5,000 by October 1, 1999, a number roughly equivalent to that of \nBritain, the next largest contributor to the NATO mission. The \namendment of the Senator from Texas also limits the mission of those \nremaining forces to the security role assigned to them in 1995. This \nhonors U.S. NATO commitments in Bosnia, protects our men and women in \nthe military from being put in a position of playing favorites and \ntherefore creating enemies, while freeing up troops, energy, and funds \nfor other pressing security matters.\n  The United States cannot continue to pick up the largest burden of \nevery NATO military mission. While our allies have been reducing their \nmilitary budgets and forces since the cold war ended, the United States \nmilitary has been strained by the increasing number of calls to respond \nto crises around the world--in Somalia, Rwanda, Haiti, Iraq, Bosnia, \nand next, perhaps, in Kosovo. Our generosity in picking up the bulk of \nthe tab has, I fear, marked us as a patsy, a patsy who can be suckered \ninto bankrolling everyone's problems with funds and troops. If we keep \ndoing it, what incentive is there for anyone else to develop the \nexpertise, training, and tools to take over appropriate parts of that \nrole?\n  I wish that the administration would put its support behind this \namendment. I think it would strengthen the administration's position in \ntalking with our allies in Europe, and it would seem to me that would \nbe a very beneficial thing, insofar as the administration is concerned.\n  Mr. President, I believe that Senator Hutchison has offered a \nblueprint for the continued U.S. participation in Bosnia that supports \nour NATO commitment, even our leadership role, but not at the cost of \nmaintaining a disproportionate force size. The most important thing we \ncan do here today is to let the soldiers and airmen out there so far \naway know that we are watching, and that we care enough about them to \nact in their best interests. They are not America's forgotten heroes, \nout of sight and out of mind unless trouble comes their way. We are \nthere with them, in thought and in deed, and we will not keep any more \nof them engaged in lengthy and lonely overseas deployments for any \nlonger than is absolutely necessary. I will vote for the Hutchison \namendment. I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTexas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I want to say a couple things that I think are very important. I \nthink this amendment is much more important than it may appear to some \nwho probably will be casting their vote on it. We are a great Nation, \nthe greatest Nation in the history of the world. This body, this \nSenate, has traditionally been involved in American foreign policy and \nAmerican national defense. We are spending a very large sum of money on \nthis mission which is ill-defined and provides little immediate benefit \nto our Nation. Other nations which have a far clearer and more direct \ninterest in it are contributing far less to it.\n  This mission has exceeded $10 billion, money which comes from the \nAmerican taxpayers. We went through a BRAC process, a base-closing \nprocess of which the Senator from Texas and the Senator from Oklahoma, \nwho is here today, are all quite aware. We saved $9 billion. We spent \nmore than that already on Bosnia, an operation that has very little \nvision. The President has articulated very poorly and inadequately, in \nmy opinion, any justification for an extended mission with no end in \nsight.\n  As the President said in remarks earlier, it was a political decision \nto move into this area of the world. Therefore, it is a decision quite \nappropriate for this body to respond to. I say it is time for us to \nconfront the issue, demand some answers, require the President to be \nresponsible, and assert our rightful role as a U.S. Senate in American \nnational defense. I am, frankly, disappointed that a Senator would move \nto table and cut off debate on this issue.\n  I think we ought to say a lot more about it, and we ought to have a \nlot of time talking about it, not be cutting off this debate. Maybe \nsome of them have made up their minds, they think they know what is \nbest for everybody else here, but I am not so certain they do. So I \ndon't know.\n  I do not have much time. I know others do. And we are going to have \nthe vote on the motion to table shortly. And I just feel very strongly \nabout it. We have a role in this world, not to be the policemen. We \nhave ballistic missile defense. We have chemical, biological weapons. \nWe have strategic capabilities that we must fulfill. We cannot just \ndrift into this without a clear understanding of our mission.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield up to 3 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Texas for yielding the time. It \nis very precious time. There isn't nearly time to get into the \nseriousness of this issue. The Senator from Alabama is exactly right, \nthere is no issue before this body that is more significant than this \nparticular issue.\n  We have stood here and debated this at least once a month since \nNovember of 1995. If I could criticize the Senator from Texas, I would \nsay this isn't strong enough. But I know she knows it is not strong \nenough either. We should have a date. We should be out of there. And it \nisn't being hardhearted, it isn't being uncompassionate.\n  This is something where the times are different now than they were \nback in 1995. If you just look at a very recent development, the \nRumsfeld report came out. And if you will remember,\n\n[[Page S9368]]\n\nthe national intelligence estimate that came out in 1995, that said we \nwould have a good 3 years' warning, in 3 years, to participate in \npreparing for a national missile defense system. Now the Rumsfeld \nreport has come out and said that isn't true at all, that we are out of \ntime, we are naked--if we started today to deploy a system and put it \ninto effect, we would not be able to do it.\n  What has that got to do with Bosnia? It is very simple, because in \nBosnia right now they are using up our military assets to the extent \nthat we are not able to carry out the minimum expectations of the \nAmerican people, which would be to defend America on two regional \nfronts.\n  If you do not believe this, go to the 21st TACOM in Germany. They are \nresponsible for the ground support, anything that will happen in that \ntheater. That theater includes Iraq. That means that if something \nshould happen, we should have to surgically strike Iraq--I do not think \nthere is a person in America who does not believe that is a \npossibility--we would eventually have to go in on the ground and clean \nit up.\n  How do you do that? If you go to the 21st TACOM in Germany, they will \nsay we are right now over 100 percent capacity in just supporting \nBosnia. We have M-915 trucks that have a million miles on them right \nnow trying to carry the support over there and support Bosnia on the \nground. Until we are able to get that out, we are not going to be able \nto adequately meet the defense needs.\n  I hope that you read, Mr. President, just in this morning's Inside \nthe Pentagon: ``The Navy's ability to retain its carrier aviators has \nhit its lowest historical annual rate. . . .''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thought I had 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We believe the time allocated to the Senator \nwas 2 minutes. If it was 3, the Senator may continue.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I had 10 minutes. I authorized up to 3 minutes for \nSenator Sessions and up to 3 for the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may continue.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will wrap up real quickly. I think the point is here in \ntoday's report. We talk about the fact that only 27 eligible carrier \npilots had applied for the ACP agreements. The minimum expectation of \nthe Navy was 82. That means that approximately one-third are re-upping \nfor this particular duty.\n  It costs $6 million to put a new pilot in the seat of an F-16. We are \nat the lowest retention rate in the history of America. And if you look \nat the exits surveys, they will say it is not because of pay, it is \nbecause of the type of operation they are having to do to support \nBosnia. And they are unable to carry out the red flag training and all \nthe serious training that would be necessary should we have to send \nthem into combat.\n  So I do support this. I would like a much stronger amendment than \nthis, but I would certainly support--this is the best thing out there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas--the Chair would advise \nwe have restored the time taken in discussing the misallocation of time \nback to the Senator. The Senator now has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I will withhold until the Senator from Michigan uses his time that \nwas allocated, and then I will finish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I understand I have been allocated 1 \nminute. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment would set arbitrary dates \nfor reductions of troops. It runs smack against the advice of our top \nmilitary officials, both uniformed and civilian.\n  In a letter which has been quoted by a number of Senators, including \nthe Senator occupying the Chair, General Shelton and Secretary Cohen, \non May 21, told us the following:\n\n       Under a legislated approach, military commanders would be \n     forced to restructure their force and mission tasks based on \n     an arbitrarily mandated schedule rather than on mission \n     accomplishment, operational considerations, and the fluid \n     tactical situation they face.\n\n  Mr. President, that is why military commanders, including our top \ncommander, oppose this amendment. That is why General Shelton opposes \nthis amendment. It is why Secretary Cohen opposes this amendment. It \nwould be mandating an arbitrary date for a troop reduction. That \njeopardizes the well-being of our forces in Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, I want to talk about a number of provisions in the \namendment with which I disagree.\n  First of all, I want to correct an impression that I believe is \ncreated by the findings in this amendment. The findings imply that \nCongress has not played any role nor exercised its oversight authority \nsince U.S. forces were first deployed to Bosnia. I would remind my \ncolleagues of the provisions that were included in the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 and the National Defense \nAppropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1998. Those Acts required the \nPresident to certify that the continued presence of U.S. armed forces \nin Bosnia, after June 30, 1998, is required in order to meet the \nnational security interests of the United States and that it is the \npolicy of the United States that U.S. armed forces will not serve as, \nor be used as, civil police in Bosnia. It also required the President \nto submit to Congress a report on why the U.S. armed forces' presence \nin Bosnia was in the U.S. national security interests, the expected \nduration of such deployment, the mission and objectives of the U.S. \narmed forces, the exit strategy of such forces, and a number of other \nmatters.\n  The President submitted the required certifications and report to \nCongress on March 3, 1998. In detailing the exit strategy for U.S. \nforces, the report contained 10 benchmarks that were the goal of the \nNATO-led Stabilization Force in Bosnia. The report stated that ``These \nbenchmarks are concrete and achievable, and their achievement will \nenable the international community to rely largely on traditional \ndiplomacy, international civil personnel, economic incentives and \ndisincentives, confidence-building measures, and negotiation to \ncontinue implementing the Dayton Accords over the longer term.'' I ask \nunanimous consent that the 10 benchmarks from the President's March 3, \n1998 report to Congress be printed in the Record immediately following \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Those 10 benchmarks, however, were established \nunilaterally by the Administration and were not shared with or agreed \nupon by our NATO allies. Accordingly, I offered an amendment when the \nSenate was considering the emergency supplemental bill at the end of \nMarch. That amendment, which was accepted and eventually became part of \nthe 1998 Supplemental Appropriations and Rescissions Act, urged the \nPresident to seek concurrence among the NATO members on the ten \nbenchmarks, on estimated target dates for achieving the benchmarks, and \non a process for NATO to review progress towards achieving the \nbenchmarks. It also required the President to submit to Congress a \nreport on these matters by June 30, 1998 and semiannually thereafter so \nlong as U.S. ground combat forces remain in the Stabilization Force in \nBosnia.\n  Mr. President, two days ago the President submitted that report as \nrequired by the amendment to the 1998 Supplemental Appropriations and \nRescissions Act. That report advises that benchmarks parallel to ours \nhave been incorporated in NATO's Operation Plan or OPLAN for the post-\nJune 1998 mission in Bosnia. The OPLAN requires SFOR to develop \ndetailed criteria for each of those benchmarks, to be approved by the \nNorth Atlantic Council.\n  The President's report also advises that the NATO allies agreed on \nJune 10 to the United States' proposal that the NATO military \nauthorities provide an estimate of the time likely to be required for \nthe implementation of the military and civilian aspects of the Dayton \nAgreement based on the benchmark criteria. During his testimony before \nthe Armed Services Committee on June 4, General Wes Clark, NATO's \nSupreme Allied Commander, Europe, stated that the development and \napproval of the criteria and estimated\n\n[[Page S9369]]\n\ntarget dates should take two or three months.\n  The President's report further advises that the benchmark criteria \nwill be used during NATO's regular six-month review of the Bosnia \nmission in December. The President added that, although not required by \nthe amendment to the Supplemental Appropriations Act, the Steering \nBoard of the Peace Implementation Council has included language that \ncorresponds to the benchmarks in its Luxembourg declaration of June 9. \nThe Peace Implementation Council also called on the High Representative \nto submit a report on the progress being made in meeting those goals by \nmid-September. This means that both General Shinseki, the NATO on-scene \ncommander, and High Representative Westendorp, the international \ncommunity's senior civilian in Bosnia, will be using the same framework \nand that the North Atlantic Council will have the benefit of the \njudgment of both of these officials.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the President's July 28, \n1998 report to Congress be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See \nExhibit 2)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Finally on this point, I would note that the Senate \nadopted an amendment during its consideration of the Defense \nAuthorization bill for Fiscal Year 1999 that expressed the sense of \nCongress that, among other things, stated that the President should \nwork with our NATO allies to withdraw U.S. ground combat forces from \nBosnia within a reasonable period of time, consistent with the safety \nof those forces and the accomplishment of SFOR's military tasks. That \namendment passed by a vote of 90-5 on June 24--a little more than a \nmonth ago.\n  Mr. President, I thought that it was important to get that \ninformation on the record to correct any impression that Congress has \nnot paid attention to the participation of U.S. military forces in the \nNATO-led force in Bosnia. But it is far more important, in my view, to \nfocus on the other sections of the amendment, particularly the \nmandatory reduction of U.S. ground elements from Bosnia to a level of \n6,500 by February 2, 1999, and 5,000 by October 1, 1999.\n  First, I think it would be useful to put the size of the U.S. \ncontingent in Bosnia in perspective. It should be noted that the United \nStates provided about 20,000 of NATO's Implementation Force in 1996--or \nabout 33 percent of the total force. Up until approximately June of \nthis year, the United States provided about 8,500 troops to NATO's \nStabilization Force--or about 25 percent of the total force. By \nSeptember of this year, the United States will provide about 6,900 \ntroops--or about 22 percent of the total force. So the percentage of \nthe U.S. contribution to the NATO-led force has been declining over \ntime--from 33 to 25 to 22 percent.\n  The amendment before us, however, would use the power of the purse to \nreduce the number of U.S. ground troops in Bosnia by another 400 by \nFebruary 2 of next year and then by an additional 1,500 by October 1 of \nnext year. That is the main purpose and impact of this amendment. That \nis also what makes this amendment unacceptable to the Secretary of \nDefense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and should make \nit unacceptable to us. When the Armed Services Committee was \nconsidering a series of amendments during its markup of the Defense \nAuthorization bill earlier this year, we sought the views of the \nDepartment of Defense. Secretary Cohen and General Shelton, in their \nletter of May 21, 1998, gave us their views and I would like to quote \nfrom a few parts of their letter:\n\n       We write to express our concerns with any amendment that \n     would legislate a date or schedule for withdrawal or \n     reduction of US forces from the NATO-led mission in Bosnia. \n     Such amendments would make it more difficult to accomplish \n     the mission, which has been remarkably successful to date.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       We will conduct regular reviews of our force posture and \n     progress toward the benchmarks we have established, and we \n     expect further reductions will be possible. But that \n     determination is best based on the actual situation on the \n     ground, the military advice of our commanders in the field, \n     and the approval of the NATO military and political \n     authorities, not an arbitrary withdrawal or reduction dates \n     determined long in advance.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Under a legislated approach, military commanders would be \n     forced to restructure their force and mission tasks based on \n     an arbitrarily mandated schedule rather than on mission \n     accomplishment, operational considerations, and the fluid \n     tactical situation they face.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the May 21, 1998 letter \nfrom Secretary Cohen and General Shelton be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it so ordered. (See Exhibit \n1)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Secretary Cohen and General Shelton said it \nwell. I agree with them--Congress should not mandate troop reduction by \narbitrary dates.\n  Mr. President, I also disagree with other sections of this amendment \ndealing with exceptions to the mandated drawdown and limitations on \nsupport for law enforcement activities in Bosnia.\n  Finally, I would note that the Statement on Administration Policy \nstates that the President's senior advisors would recommend veto of \nthis bill if it contains a provision that would prescribe a arbitrarily \nscheduled force drawdown in Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, for all these reasons I will vote against this \namendment and I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment as \nwell.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                             Ten Benchmarks\n\n       1. The Dayton cease-fire remains in place, supported by \n     mechanisms for military-to-military transparency and \n     cooperation.\n       2. Police in both entities are restructured, re-integrated, \n     re-trained and equipped in accordance with democratic \n     standards.\n       3. An effective judicial reform program is in place.\n       4. Illegal pre-Dayton institutions (e.g. Herceg Bosnia, \n     Strategic Reserve Office, Centreks and Selek Impeks) are \n     dissolved and revenue and disbursement mechanisms under \n     control of legitimately elected officials.\n       5. Media are regulated in accordance with democratic \n     standards; independent/alternative media are available \n     throughout B-H.\n       6. Elections are conducted in accordance with democratic \n     standards, and results are implemented.\n       7. Free-market reforms (e.g. functioning privatization and \n     banking laws) and an IMF program are in place, with formal \n     barriers to inter-entity commerce eliminated.\n       8. A phased and orderly minority return process is \n     functioning, with Sarajevo, Mostar, and Banja Luka having \n     accepted significant returns.\n       9. In Brcko, the multi-ethnic administration functioning \n     and a secure environment for returns is established.\n       10. The Parties are cooperating with ICTY in the arrest and \n     prosecution of war criminals.\n       These benchmarks are concrete and achievable, and their \n     achievement will enable the international community to rely \n     largely on traditional diplomacy, international civil \n     personnel, economic incentives and disincentives, confidence-\n     building measures, and negotiation to continue implementing \n     the Dayton Accords over the longer term.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n     To the Congress of the United States:\n       Pursuant to section 7 of Public Law 105-174, I am providing \n     this report to inform the Congress of ongoing efforts to meet \n     the goals set forth therein.\n       With my certification to the Congress of March 3, 1998, I \n     outlined ten conditions--or benchmarks--under which Dayton \n     implementation can continue without the support of a major \n     NATO-led military force. Section 7 of Public Law 105-174 \n     urges that we seek concurrence among NATO allies on: (1) the \n     bench-marks set forth with the March 3 certification; (2) \n     estimated target dates for achieving those benchmarks; and \n     (3) a process for NATO to review progress toward achieving \n     those benchmarks. NATO has agreed to move ahead in all these \n     areas.\n       First, NATO agreed to benchmarks parallel to ours on May 28 \n     as part of its approval of the Stabilization Force (SFOR) \n     military plan (OPLAN 10407). Furthermore, the OPLAN requires \n     SFOR to develop detailed criteria for each of these \n     benchmarks, to be approved by the North Atlantic Council, \n     which will provide a more specific basis to evaluate \n     progress. SFOR will develop the benchmark criteria in \n     coordination with appropriate international civilian \n     agencies.\n       Second, with regard to timelines, the United States \n     proposed that NATO military authorities provide an estimate \n     of the time likely to be required for implementation of the \n     military and civilian aspects of the Dayton Agreement based \n     on the benchmark criteria. Allies agreed to this approach on \n     June 10. As SACEUR General Wes Clark testified before the \n     Senate Armed Services Committee June 4, the development and \n     approval of the criteria and estimated target dates should \n     take 2 to 3 months.\n       Third, with regard to a review process, NATO will continue \n     the 6-month review process that began with the deployment of \n     the Implementation Force (IFOR) in December 1995, \n     incorporating the benchmarks and\n\n[[Page S9370]]\n\n     detailed criteria. The reviews will include an assessment of \n     the security situation, an assessment of compliance by the \n     parties with the Dayton Agreement, an assessment of progress \n     against the benchmark criteria being developed by SFOR, \n     recommendations on any changes in the level of support to \n     civilian agencies, and recommendations on any other changes \n     to the mission and tasks of the force.\n       While not required under Public Law 105-174, we have sought \n     to further utilize this framework of benchmarks and criteria \n     for Dayton implementation among civilian implementation \n     agencies. The Steering Board of the Peace Implementation \n     Council (PIC) adopted the same framework in its Luxembourg \n     declaration of June 9, 1998. The declaration, which serves as \n     the civilian implementation agenda for the next 6 months, now \n     includes language that corresponds to the benchmarks in the \n     March 3 certification to the Congress and in the SFOR OPLAN. \n     In addition, the PIC Steering Board called on the High \n     Representative to submit a report on the progress made in \n     meeting these goals by mid-September, which will be \n     considered in the NATO 6-month review process.\n       The benchmark framework, now approved the military and \n     civilian implementers, is clearly a better approach than \n     setting a fixed, arbitrary end date to the mission. This \n     process will produce a clear picture of where intensive \n     efforts will be required to achieve our goal: a self-\n     sustaining peace process in Bosnia and Herzegovina for which \n     a major international military force will no longer be \n     necessary. Experience demonstrates that arbitrary deadlines \n     can prove impossible to meet and tend to encourage those who \n     would wait us out or undermine our credibility. Realistic \n     target dates, combined with concerted use of incentives, \n     leverage and pressure with all the parties, should maintain \n     the sense of urgency necessary to move steadily toward an \n     enduring peace. While the benchmark process will be useful as \n     a tool both to promote and review the pace of Dayton \n     implementation, the estimated target dates established will \n     be notional, and their attainment dependent upon a complex \n     set of interdependent factors.\n       We will provide a supplemental report once NATO has agreed \n     upon detailed criteria and estimated target dates. The \n     continuing 6-month reviews of the status of implementation \n     will provide a useful opportunity to continue to consult with \n     Congress. These reviews, and any updates to the estimated \n     timelines for implementation, will be provided in subsequent \n     reports submitted pursuant to Public Law 105-174. I look \n     forward to continuing to work with the Congress in pursuing \n     U.S. foreign policy goals in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n                                               William J. Clinton,\n                                   The White House, July 28, 1998.\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 21, 1998.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Ranking Democrat, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Carl: We write to express our concerns with any \n     amendment that would legislate a date or schedule for \n     withdrawal or reduction of U.S. forces from the NATO-led \n     mission in Bosnia. Such amendments would make it more \n     difficult to accomplish the mission, which has been \n     remarkably successful to date.\n       It is our intention to reduce our forces in Bosnia. Based \n     on the progress achieved to date, our commanders already have \n     been able to reduce U.S. troop levels from almost 20,000 in \n     1996 to the 6,900 that will be deployed after the current \n     drawdown is completed in September. We will conduct regular \n     reviews of our force posture and progress toward the \n     benchmarks we have established, and we expect further \n     reductions will be possible. But that determination is best \n     based on the actual situation on the ground, the military \n     advice of our commanders in the field, and the approval of \n     the NATO military and political authorities, not an arbitrary \n     withdrawal or reduction dates determined long in advance.\n       Our military commanders in the field have determined the \n     level and type of force required to carry out the mission \n     within acceptable risk. The mission, forces and guidance of \n     the force currently planned for June 1998 have been fully \n     agreed to by NATO political and military authorities. Under a \n     legislated approach, military commanders would be forced to \n     restructure their force and mission tasks based on an \n     arbitrarily mandated schedule rather than on mission \n     accomplishment, operational considerations, and the fluid \n     tactical situation they face. In addition, while those \n     opposed to the Dayton Accords have been steadily isolated and \n     diminished in their influence, legislating withdrawal of \n     reduction dates would invite heightened intransigence and \n     extremism.\n       Additional factors that Congress should consider in \n     reviewing any such amendment are the following:\n       Under the proposed amendment, command of the SFOR operation \n     and its element in MND-North might well be transferred to a \n     non-U.S. officer early next year.\n       Shifting to a posture in which the U.S. has much smaller \n     force levels in Bosnia but enhances its force presence in \n     regions surrounding Bosnia, as envisioned by the amendment, \n     will not save money and indeed could cost more than our \n     current operation in Bosnia. We are continually evaluating \n     the force posture for Bosnia, and do not consider an over-\n     the-horizon force appropriate now.\n       Accordingly, we strongly urge you to oppose any legislated \n     fixed date or timetable for withdrawal or reduction of U.S. \n     forces in Bosnia.\n       There is one other factor related to operations in Bosnia \n     of great concern to us, and that is funding. The Department \n     submitted an addition to the FY99 budget to fund a 6,900-\n     person force in Bosnia. Authorizing that request is essential \n     to accomplishing the mission without significantly reducing \n     readiness in other areas. Without that funding, we would have \n     to choose between Bosnia operations and the overall readiness \n     of our Armed Forces.\n           Sincerely,\n     Henry H. Shelton.\n     Bill Cohen.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma, the Senator from \nAlabama, the Senator from West Virginia, who have all made very strong \nstatements about their commitment and the commitment of Congress to \nsupport our troops. It is our responsibility to do this.\n  I want to answer a couple of points that were made. Somalia--the \nargument was made that troops were not provided equipment and we lost \n18 rangers. That is exactly correct. I would hold up Somalia as the \nvery reason that we should be doing something today to protect our \ntroops in the field--because, in fact, in Somalia Congress was never \nconsulted. The decision not to send the equipment was made by the \nPentagon. It is precisely because Congress was not consulted and was \nnot committed to this that it failed so miserably. The mission creep in \nSomalia is exactly what we are trying to avoid in Bosnia today. And \nthat is why I have this amendment on the floor.\n  Let us talk about precedent. On July 31, 1989, there was a resolution \nrequiring the President to reduce the number of U.S. forces in Korea. \nThat is exactly what I would hope that we would do today. Nine years \nago, almost to the day, Congress met its responsibility. This was an \namendment that specifically asked the President to come forward with a \nplan to have gradual reductions in the number of U.S. military \npersonnel stationed in the Republic of Korea.\n  This is exactly what we are doing today. We are saying, in this \nappropriations bill for this fiscal year, that we should reduce the \nnumber of forces so that the President can go to our allies and start \nnegotiating for a more equitable spread. That is exactly what we did in \nKorea.\n  With Korea we said, ``The Republic of Korea should assume increased \nresponsibilities for its own security.'' This was an amendment that was \nsponsored by Senator McCain, Senator Nunn, Senator Warner, Senator \nExxon, Senator Dixon, Senator Wirth, Senator Shelby, Senator Thurmond, \nSenator Cohen, Senator Wallop, Senator Gorton, Senator Lott, and \nSenator Coats.\n  This is exactly what I hope we will do today. It is the \nresponsibility of Congress to provide support for our troops. We cannot \nstand by and watch our military disintegrate, lose our most experienced \nwarriors, put them in harm's way, and do nothing.\n  Have we lost our backbone in 9 years? Or have we lost our compass? \nHave we lost the will to do what is right for this country?\n  Congress is responsible for providing the support for our troops. And \nI hope that we will meet our responsibility today.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. And I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Nearing the moment, I think, according to the previous \nunanimous consent agreement, for me to make a motion to table, I would \njust like to make one quick point.\n  Back several years ago, in 1990, I was speaking in support of an \namendment--in support of the Bush administration, the President of the \nUnited States, not in opposition. And it was a peacetime deployment to \nKorea, a rearrangement of forces, not the situation in Bosnia. An \nimportant factor is, I was supporting the President of the United \nStates and the Secretary of Defense.\n  The Hutchison amendment is in opposition to the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense, as well as the President \nof the\n\n[[Page S9371]]\n\nUnited States. I think there is a significant difference there.\n\n  Second, one of the Members came to the floor and said that we need to \ndebate this more. As the Senator from Indiana pointed out, this is the \nsame amendment we voted on last May; basically, fundamentally the same \nthing. We did have lots of debate on it.\n  As the distinguished chairman of the committee pointed out, we have \n50 or 60 amendments that we need to address between tonight and \ntomorrow, all of which deserve also very thorough debate and \ndiscussion, as well, if we expect to get out at a reasonable timeframe \neither tomorrow or Saturday or Sunday, as the distinguished chairman \nand ranking member point out.\n  The hour of 5:30 having arrived, I move to table the Hutchison \namendment and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I want to announce, there appears there now is a second-\ndegree amendment to the Hutchison amendment that could be offered and \nmay settle the issue with regard to the previous amendment which was \nnot tabled.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3419 to Amendment No. 3124\n\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now turn to the \nHutchinson amendment in the second-degree and that there be a short \nperiod of debate. Can you tell me how long you think it will take?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I think the amendment has been agreed to and would \nnot need debate, from my standpoint.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I think we should have at least 10 minutes equally \ndivided between the Senator from Arkansas and the Senators from \nMichigan and Delaware, and I am informed it will require a rollcall \nvote.\n  I ask unanimous consent there be that period now for 10 minutes on \nthis amendment that Senator Hutchinson will offer, and following that \ntime that the rollcall on his amendment take place after the rollcall \nvote on the motion to table that has just been made by the Senator from \nArizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder for me to offer an a second-degree amendment numbered 3419, and I \nsend that amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Hutchinson], for himself and \n     Mr. Levin, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Biden and Mr. Lieberman proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3419 to amendment 3124.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Strike all after the word ``Title'' and insert the \n     following:\n\n                                   IX\n\n                         HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA\n\n                 Subtitle A--Forced Abortions in China\n\n       Sec. 9001. This subtitle may be cited as the ``Forced \n     Abortion Condemnation Act''.\n       Sec. 9002. Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Forced abortion was rightly denounced as a crime \n     against humanity by the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal.\n       (2) For over 15 years there have been frequent and credible \n     reports of forced abortion and forced sterilization in \n     connection with the population control policies of the \n     People's Republic of China. These reports indicate the \n     following:\n       (A) Although it is the stated position of the politburo of \n     the Chinese Communist Party that forced abortion and forced \n     sterilization have no role in the population control program, \n     in fact the Communist Chinese Government encourages both \n     forced abortion and forced sterilization through a \n     combination of strictly enforced birth quotas and immunity \n     for local population control officials who engage in \n     coercion. Officials acknowledge that there have been \n     instances of forced abortions and sterilization, and no \n     evidence has been made available to suggest that the \n     perpetrators have been punished.\n       (B) People's Republic of China population control \n     officials, in cooperation with employers and works unit \n     officials, routinely monitor women's menstrual cycles and \n     subject women who conceive without government authorization \n     to extreme psychological pressure, to harsh economic \n     sanctions, including unpayable fines and loss of employment, \n     and often to physical force.\n       (C) Official sanctions for giving birth to unauthorized \n     children include fines in amounts several times larger than \n     the per capita annual incomes of residents of the People's \n     Republic of China. In Fujian, for example, the average fine \n     is estimated to be twice a family's gross annual income. \n     Families which cannot pay the fine may be subject to \n     confiscation and destruction of their homes and personal \n     property.\n       (D) Especially harsh punishments have been inflicted on \n     those whose resistance is motivated by religion. For example, \n     according to a 1995 Amnesty International report, the \n     Catholic inhabitants of 2 villages in Hebei Province were \n     subjected to population control under the slogan ``better to \n     have more graves than one more child''. Enforcement measures \n     included torture, sexual abuse, and the detention of \n     resisters' relatives as hostages.\n       (E) Forced abortions in Communist China often have taken \n     place in the very late stages of pregnancy.\n       (F) Since 1994 forced abortion and sterilization have been \n     used in Communist China not only to regulate the number of \n     children, but also to eliminate those who are regarded as \n     defective in accordance with the official eugenic policy \n     known as the ``Natal and Health Care Law''.\n       Sec. 9003. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     the Secretary of State may not utilize any funds appropriated \n     or otherwise available for the Department of State for fiscal \n     year 1999 to issue any visa to any official of any country \n     (except the head of state, the head of government, and \n     cabinet level ministers) who the Secretary finds, based on \n     credible and specific information, has been directly involved \n     in the establishment or enforcement of population control \n     policies forcing a woman to undergo an abortion against her \n     free choice, or forcing a man or woman to undergo \n     sterilization against his or her free choice policies \n     condoning the practice of genital mutilation.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Attorney General may not utilize any funds appropriated or \n     otherwise available for the Department of Justice for fiscal \n     year 1999 to admit to the United States any national covered \n     by subsection (a).\n       (c) The President may waive the prohibition in subsection \n     (a) or (b) if the President--\n       (1) determines that it is in the national interest of the \n     United States to do so; and\n       (2) provides written notification to Congress containing a \n     justification for the waiver.\n\n                Subtitle B--Freedom on Religion in China\n\n       Sec. 9011. (a) It is the sense of Congress that the \n     President should make freedom of religion one of the major \n     objectives of United States foreign policy with respect to \n     China.\n       (b) As part of this policy, the Department of State should \n     raise in every relevant bilateral and multilateral forum the \n     issue of individuals imprisoned, detained, confined, or \n     otherwise harassed by the Chinese Government on religious \n     grounds.\n       (c) In its communications with the Chinese Government, the \n     Department of State should provide specific names of \n     individuals of concern and request a complete and timely \n     response from the Chinese Government regarding the \n     individuals' whereabouts and condition, the charges against \n     them, and sentence imposed.\n       (d) The goal of these official communications should be the \n     expeditious release of all religious prisoners in China and \n     Tibet and the end of the Chinese Government's policy and \n     practice of harassing and repressing religious believers.\n       Sec. 9012. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     the Secretary of State may not utilize any funds appropriated \n     or otherwise available for the Department of State for fiscal \n     year 1999 to issue a visa to any official of any country \n     (except the head of state, the head of government, and \n     cabinet level ministers) who the Secretary of State finds, \n     based on credible and specific information, has been directly \n     involved in the establishment or enforcement of policies or \n     practices designed to restrict religious freedom.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Attorney General may not utilize any funds appropriated or \n     otherwise available for the Department of Justice for fiscal \n     year 1999 to admit to the United States any national covered \n     by subsection (a).\n       (c) The President may waive the prohibition in subsection \n     (a) or (b) with respect to an individual described in such \n     subsection if the President--\n       (1) determines that it is vital to the national interest to \n     do so; and\n       (2) provides written notification to the appropriate \n     congressional committees containing a justification for the \n     waiver.\n       Sec. 9014. In this subtitle, the term ``appropriate \n     congressional committees'' means the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate and the Committee on International \n     Relations of the House of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to \nthe Senators on the other side of the aisle who, I think, have made \nvery positive and productive suggestions to improve the amendment that \nI have offered regarding human rights abuses in China.\n  The simple explanation for the changes that are made, we have made \nthe bill generic in nature rather than country-specific. I have some \nreservations about that because I don't want to in any way dilute, I \nthink, the proper attention that should be placed upon what our State \nDepartment says is the greatest abusers of human rights in the\n\n[[Page S9372]]\n\nworld today. But at the same time, I think this makes this a very, very \npowerful human rights amendment applicable to all nations of the world. \nThe ``finding'' section of the amendment remains in which we are able \nto outline some of the abuses evident in China today.\n  We would add, I think, a positive suggestion, that the genital \nmutilation issue be added. So in addition to religious persecution and \nforced abortions, genital mutilation and those who would condone it \nwould be added as criteria for those countries that would be denied \ntheir visas for those condoning that practice, the terrible practice \nthat human rights advocates the world over and all people, I think, \ncondemn.\n  I want to thank Senator Biden for, I think, some very good \nsuggestions regarding the ``definitions'' area on the Secretary's \nobligations in determining who would be denied these visas. The \naddition to the phrase ``credible information,'' adding ``and specific \ninformation,'' and adding to the phrase ``has been involved in the \nestablishment or enforcement,'' the word ``directly''; so, ``has been \ndirectly involved in the establishment or enforcement of population \ncontrol policies.'' I think that is a very helpful change that will \nmake this much more enforceable and make it much more clear. I am \ngrateful for that suggestion, as well.\n  We have struck section 9012, which simply lists a number of \nassociations and organizations which are agents of the government in \ncarrying out some of these abuses. It is really unnecessary, an \nunnecessary provision that has caused confusion, because anyone, any \nindividual, any official, who is involved in perpetrating persecution \nof religious minorities, coerced abortions or the genital mutilation \nwould be covered by the amendment, without what is really extraneous \nlanguage and unnecessary language.\n  So I think these are all very positive changes and that is the \ncontent of the second-degree amendment. I think this is relevant. I \nthink it is a very positive improvement to the appropriations bill. I \nappreciate the support of those on both sides of the aisle in the \ndefeat of the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I want to thank the \nSenator from Arkansas. He has been a gentleman.\n  His amendment is, I think, a good amendment and I thank him for \nconsidering some of the suggestions that I and a few others had.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Levin of Michigan, Senator Kerry \nof Massachusetts and Senator Biden of Delaware be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I particularly want to thank my friend from \nArkansas for adding the prohibition, the ability to deny visas to those \ncountries that engage in the heinous practice of engaging in female \ngenital mutilation. I am not one who thinks we should be erecting \nsanctions all over the world, but there are certain things that are so, \nso contrary to our basic values--forced abortion, forced sterilization, \nmutilation of body parts--that I think that it is appropriate that we \nuse sanctions in those circumstances.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Connecticut, \nSenator Lieberman, be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I realize I have a few more minutes, but in order to \naccommodate this bill moving along, again, I close by thanking the \nSenator from Arkansas for accommodating some of the changes that he has \nfor his amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I understand that the Senator from \nMichigan is on his way.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me commend the Senator from Arkansas \nfor the second-degree amendment, the modification in effect, which he \nhas sent to the desk.\n  I reluctantly voted to table his original amendment because I was \ntroubled by his narrow focus on one country, when the problem exists \nnot only in China, but a number of other countries. The problems he \nidentifies in his amendment are real problems and they are problems we \nmust be concerned with. He has shown that concern, and I think it is \nwise that we reflect the concern relating to people engaging in those \npractices that come from any country--China or anyplace else. And while \nI reluctantly voted to table his original amendment, the first-degree \namendment, for the reason I just gave, I enthusiastically cosponsored \nthe second-degree amendment of the Senator from Arkansas, and I hope it \npasses with a resounding vote.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the second-degree \namendment? Time will be equally divided.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I now have before me here a managers' \npackage that lists some 33 amendments. Following the next two votes, I \nintend to ask that no more amendments be in order. I urge Members to \ncome and look at the list and see if their amendment is here. If there \nare more, fine. I urge Members to let us know if they intend to offer \nthe amendments shown here. Secondly, if they intend to offer any other \namendment, I am pleased to have them do that.\n  Mr. President, as I understand it, the first vote will be on a motion \nto table offered by the Senator from Arizona, and the second will be \nthe amendment in the second degree offered by the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the second-degree amendment of the \nSenator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the pending motion to table is not carried, that \namendment will still be open. If the amendment of the Senator from \nArkansas passes in the second degree, I intend to ask that the--are the \nyeas and nays requested on the Senator's original amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Only on the motion to table the original \namendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Very well. If that is adopted, which I urge the Senate \nto adopt, then we will move to adopt the original amendment, as \namended, with a voice vote. I call for the vote.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3413\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield back any time I have left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment of the Senator from Texas.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is absent because of illness.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, as I \nunderstand what the Senator from Alaska--\n  Mr. STEVENS. I really can't hear the Senator, I am sorry.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, have you eliminated \ntime on debate? I am not quite sure.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We have not yet addressed the question of time on \ndebate. The only real limitation here is that this list be the only \nfirst-degree amendments in order and that they only be subject to \nrelevant second-degree amendments in the event they are considered and \nnot adopted.\n  Mr. FORD. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I have been \ntrying\n\n[[Page S9374]]\n\nto work out on our side as it relates to amendments, and I have not \nseen this list yet. I want to be sure, when I have told my colleagues \nthat their amendment has been accepted, I want it on the managers' list \nor I want it on the amendments yet to be worked out.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I say to the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. President, many \nof the amendments that are on the list that have come from your side \nare, in fact, on the managers' list. But they will all be qualified if \nthey are on the list you have given us.\n  Mr. FORD. I want to be sure that all of these amendments--I have not \nseen the list, I say to my friend, and would like to work it out.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator from Alaska yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will be happy to yield, Mr. President.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, my request is still pending.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, as I understand the unanimous consent \nrequest, what the Senator is saying is that after disposal of the last \namendment, we go right to final passage; is that correct? But there is \nno limit on debate on amendments; is that correct?\n  Mr. STEVENS. These listed amendments will be disposed of. Once they \nare disposed of, the bill will go to third reading. They will have to \nbe either acted upon or withdrawn.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I understand. But there is no limit on debate on the \nindividual amendments; is that correct?\n  Mr. STEVENS. There is no limit there on debate time. I intend to do \nmy best to do that.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FORD.

The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have been asked to amend my request and add this \nfollowing portion--I ask unanimous consent that the Senate insist on \nits amendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses, and the Chair be authorized to appoint the \nfollowing conferees on the part of the Senate: Senators Stevens, \nCochran, Specter, Domenici, Bond, McConnell, Shelby, Gregg, Hutchison, \nInouye, Hollings, Byrd, Leahy, Bumpers, Lautenberg, Harkin, and Dorgan, \nand the foregoing occur without any intervening action or debate, and I \nfurther ask that when the Senate passes H.R. 4103, as amended, that S. \n2132 be indefinitely postponed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are proceeding now to a look at the \namendments that are not in the managers' package. I would like to \naddress that issue with the Senate.\n  It is my understanding that Senator Baucus has an amendment that he \nwishes to have 20 minutes equally divided; Senator Bingaman has two \namendments; Senator Boxer's amendment that was on the list is in the \nmanagers' package; Senator Bumpers' amendment is on the list in the \nmanagers' package; Senator Byrd has two amendments which are to be in \nthe managers' package; Senator Daschle's relevant amendments are \nwithdrawn, as I understand it; Senator Dodd has one amendment dealing \nwith Army pensions which we have not seen; Senator Durbin's amendment \non land conveyance is in the package; his amendment on military \noperations and war powers will be opposed and we will have to deal with \nit; Senator Dorgan's amendment on Indian incentive program is in the \npackage, and I understand his second amendment will not be offered; \nSenator Ford's amendment on National Symphony is not in the package and \nwould have to be debated; Senator Graham has a land transfer amendment \nwhich is in the package now, and the space amendment, as I understand \nit, is the same as the amendment from Senator Mack, and that will have \nto be debated; Senator Harkin has the outlay amendment, and the POO \namendment is in the package, the vets medals amendment we have not seen \nand we cannot discuss now; Senator Hollings' amendment will be \naccepted; Senator Inouye's manager's amendment is in the managers' \npackage; Senator Kerrey's SOS payroll tax amendment cannot be accepted \nand will have to be debated; there are two relevant amendments by \nSenator Kerry which we have not seen; Senator Leahy's amendment cannot \nbe accepted; Senator Reed's amendment we have not seen; and Senator \nRobb's amendment on reimbursement we would like to discuss with Senator \nRobb--it is in the House bill; we prefer not to take it up at this time \nif we can avoid it--and Senator Wellstone's amendment on child soldiers \nhas been accepted, the domestic violence one has not been agreed to \nyet--we will have to discuss it with them.\n  Those are the amendments on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. FORD. I was trying to keep up with you, with the Senator. Senator \nDodd has one as it relates to Lyme Disease.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is in the package.\n  Mr. FORD. That is in the package?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. FORD. Then he still has two left.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I realize the relevant one is just a place holder.\n  Mr. FORD. I understand. That is correct.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Will the chairman yield? I am now working on an amendment \nfor Senator Carol Moseley-Braun. Can I discuss that with you later?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes. I would be happy to do that. The Senator has the \nright to an amendment in the managers' package. That may be the way \nthat is considered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I wonder whether I could ask my colleague from Alaska \nwhether he could include the child soldiers amendment in the managers' \npackage since it has been accepted?\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is in there.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am sorry.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The domestic violence one I do not think I have seen \nyet. That is also being reviewed by the Armed Services Committee and we \ncannot report that yet.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, I am ready to debate it if you \nwant to, but let me know.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I could not hear you.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, I am pleased to debate it if \nyou want, but you just let me know.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, while the chairman is working on the list, I \nhave a quick unanimous consent agreement we have worked out. I would \nlike to go ahead and get that done while we have a break here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9357-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9374-S9375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 629\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I have sent to the desk the first \nmanagers' package. And I believe that it has been cleared on both \nsides. So there is no misunderstanding about it, because Senators may \nwonder whether the amendments are in this or not, I want to read this \npackage and then ask for its immediate consideration.

They have \nbeen cleared on both sides, and unless there is some discussion, I ask \nunanimous consent the first managers' package be adopted and any \nstatements offered by any Senator appear in the Record prior to \nadoption of that Senator's amendment that is in the package.\n  I add to it, Senator Inouye has a managers' amendment--this would be \nthe first amendment of Senator Inouye--for Ms. Moseley-Braun that \npertains to the National Guard Armory in Chicago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The managers' amendment is adopted.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I send the last amendment to the desk to be included, \nand it makes 45 amendments in the package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the en bloc amendments.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] proposes amendments \n     No. 3420 through and including 3463 en bloc, and the Senator \n     from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye], for Ms. Moseley-Braun, proposes \n     amendment numbered 3464.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3420\n\n  (Purpose: To set aside $12,000,000 for continuation of electric and \n                  hybrid-electric vehicle development)\n\n       On page 33, line 25, insert before the period at the end \n     the following: ``: Provided, That of the funds appropriated \n     under this heading, $12,000,000 shall be available only to \n     continue development of electric and hybrid-electric \n     vehicles''.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. I have offered an amendment to the Department of Defense \nAppropriations Bill to provide $12 million for electric and hybrid-\nelectric vehicle development. The funds will be administered by the \nDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as DARPA. Senators \nInouye, Jeffords, Leahy, Coats, and Boxer have joined me as cosponsors \nof the amendment.\n  This is not a new program. Congress provided $115 million to the \nDepartment of Defense for the electric vehicle program over the past \nfive fiscal years. Industry has contributed more than $115 million in \nmatching funds. In fiscal year 1998, the appropriation was $15 million, \nso my amendment represents a budget reduction of 20 percent compared to \nthe current fiscal year.\n  Seven regional consortia, comprised of more than 200 member \ncompanies, participate in the program. Individual consortia, which were \nselected competitively, include Hawaii, Sacramento, the Mid Atlantic \nConsortium in Johnstown, PA, the Northeast Consortium in Boston, the \nSouthern Consortium in Atlanta, the Mid America Consortium in \nIndianapolis, and CALSTART in Burbank, CA.\n  The President's fiscal year 1999 budget proposed that the DARPA \nprogram be transferred to the Department of Energy and the Department \nof Transportation. The object of the fiscal year 1999 change was to \ntransfer DoD-developed technology to commercial service vehicles such \nas buses, delivery vans, and service trucks. I support this transfer.\n  Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of all three federal agencies \nand the consortia that participate in the electric vehicle program, \nanother year of funding through the Department of Defense is needed \nbefore the transition can proceed.\n  The Department of Defense has long been interested in hybrid electric \ncombat vehicles because they can reduce fuel consumption by 50 percent, \nleading to a reduced fuel logistics burden, increased endurance, and \nreduced emissions. In addition, hybrid electric combat vehicles use \nelectric power for mobility, weapons, countermeasures and sensors, and \nhave reduced thermal and acoustic signatures.\n  The five-year DARPA program has resulted in the development of a \nnumber of combat vehicles with hybrid electric propulsion. These \ninclude an Army M-113 Armored Personnel Carrier, a Bradley Fighting \nVehicle, two High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled  Vehicles, commonly \nknown as Humvees, and a prototype composite armored vehicle.\n\n  Other DoD projects are in the planning stages. DARPA and the Marine \nCorps are jointly developing a hybrid-electric reconnaissance, \nsurveillance and targeting vehicle, designed as a stealthy, fuel \nefficient vehicle that can be transported by the V-22 Osprey in support \nof the Marine Corps Sea Dragon operation. DARPA and the Army are \njointly developing a combat hybrid power system for a 15-ton future \ncombat vehicle. The system will provide pulse power for electric guns, \ndirected energy weapons, and electromagnetic armor, as well as other \ncomponents and systems.\n  The funds provided by my amendment should be used in the same manner, \nand for the same program objectives, as in fiscal year 1998 funding. As \nthe author of the amendment, it is my intention that DARPA administer \nthe program as it did in fiscal year 1998, and that funds can be used \nfor the development of defense and non-defense electric and hybrid-\nelectric vehicles.\n  I thank the Chairman, and my colleague from Hawaii, the ranking \nDemocrat on the subcommittee for their consideration of my amendment. I \nyield the floor.\n\n[[Page S9376]]\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3421\n\n (Purpose: To set aside $2,250,000 for the Defense Systems Evaluation \n  program for support of test and training operations at White Sands \n           Missile Range, New Mexico, and Fort Bliss, Texas)\n\n       On page 99 in between lines 17 and 18, insert before the \n     period at the end the following:\n       ``Sec. 8104.

I am pleased to have Senator Harkin as a cosponsor of \nthis amendment.\n  There are two parts to my amendment; both parts have no cost.\n  The first part addresses the 12,000 military families on Food Stamps.\n  For 3 years the Defense Department has refused to take this problem \nseriously.\n  I first wrote to DoD in 1996; then I was told that this was a problem \nonly because military personnel have decided, and I quote, ``to have a \nlarger family than he/she can afford.'' In other words, it is Defense \nDepartment policy to discourage military families and to engineer the \nsize of those families.\n  In 1997, I wrote again to Secretary Cohen because he publicly stated \nthat it was ``not acceptable'' for military personnel to be on Food \nStamps. I regret to say that he wrote back saying only that he would \n``monitor'' the issue.\n  Last year in the fiscal year 1998 Defense Authorization bill, \nCongress mandated a DoD report on potential solutions. The report is \nnow several months late and will not be submitted in the foreseeable \nfuture.\n  Congress is getting the bureaucratic stiff-arm from DoD on this \nissue. It's time to bring that to an end.\n  My amendment will require DoD to propose low cost solutions to this \nproblem, and it requires these proposals as a part of DoD's FY 2000 \nbudget request.\n  Next year. If DoD still refuses to take this problem seriously, I \nwill propose my own solution. If the Chairman and Ranking Member of the \nDefense Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee see fit to support \nme, I'm sure we can be successful.\n  The second part of the amendment will permit us to better understand \nour growing problems in military family life, morale, and retention.\n  This year, I collected information from each of the services on these \nissues. Unfortunately, the information I collected confirms my \nsuspicions that\n\n[[Page S9377]]\n\nthe Defense Department has failed to collect data properly. For \nexample:\n  Each service collects data on these issues differently--or not at \nall--which prevents comparing among the services. This also means that \nsuccesses and failures to address these problems cannot be identified.\n  Now that everyone agrees that readiness is a serious problem, \neveryone wants to do something about it. But, because the issues are \nnot fully understood, some of the proposed `'solutions'' may be off the \nmark. For example, Congress is increasing re-enlistment bonuses for \npilots to compete with airline salaries, but there are indications that \nhigh airline salaries are not the real problem. We won't really \nunderstand the problem until we have better data; only then can we \napply effective solutions.\n  The nature of military life has gone through profound change in the \nlast 20 years, but those changes are not fully understood or taken into \naccount in DoD national security decision making. It is not clear how \nthe new prominence of families in military life should--or should not--\nbe taken into account in making national security decisions.\n  Because of these problems, my amendment requires a special unit in \nthe General Accounting Office to collect and study the data. They will \nuse an Advisory Panel of experts to assist the study and will report \nback to the Appropriations Committees next year.

Not later than December 1, 1998, the Secretary of \n     Defense shall submit to the President and the Congressional \n     Defense Committees a report regarding the potential for \n     development of Ford Island within the Pearl Harbor Naval \n     Complex, Oahu, Hawaii through an integrated resourcing plan \n     incorporating both appropriated funds and one or more public-\n     private ventures. This report shall consider innovative \n     resource development measures, including but not limited to, \n     an enhanced-use leasing program similar to that of the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs as well as the sale or other \n     disposal of land in Hawaii under the control of the Navy as \n     part of an overall program for Ford Island development. The \n     report shall include proposed legislation for carrying out \n     the measures recommended therein.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to raise a matter which I \nbelieve could revolutionize the way we finance our defense \ninfrastructure, our family housing, barracks and other base facilities. \nIf successful, it would allow us to recapitalize our bases with a much \nsmaller investment than is currently required. In so doing, it could \ndramatically improve the quality of life of the men and women in \nuniform.\n  Mr. President often Members rise and offer that theirs is a simple \namendment. This is not a simple matter, and it will take some time to \ndescribe it, but I want all of my colleagues to understand what it \nwould do for national defense.\n  Several years ago, I sponsored legislation to sell defense property \nin Hawaii to the State.\n  In return the proceeds were used to build a new bridge to connect the \nPearl Harbor Naval Base to Ford Island, a piece of Navy property \nlocated in Pearl Harbor.\n  Over the years Ford Island has been the home of Battleship Row, the \nsite of the Arizona Memorial, and just last month it became the final \nhome for the U.S.S. Missouri. It has had a small airstrip on which some \nof the Navy's earliest aviators trained.\n\n[[Page S9378]]\n\n  It has housed a few sailors and families, and has been the workplace \nfor selected other military activities.\n  But because there was no bridge connecting the island, it could never \nbe fully utilized. The Island comprises 450 acres, about half the size \nof Pearl Harbor Navy Base, yet it contains less than one tenth of the \nworking and residential population of Pearl Harbor.\n  The only access to the island has been by ferry. For years, boats \nhave shuttled passengers and cargo from the rest of base about once per \nhour. In short it has been a very inefficient use of space. And for a \nsmall State like mine, especially in and around Honolulu, space is a \npremium.\n  In April of this year, this situation was changed forever. Ford \nIsland was opened to the rest of Oahu by the new Chick Clarey Bridge.\n  Ford Island is now poised to be a more useful part of the Pearl \nHarbor naval facility. However, as is unfortunately so often the case \nin these matters, there simply is not enough money in the Navy budget \nto build the facilities that could make this base more useful. And so, \nwithout action, Ford Island will remain underutilized.\n  About two years ago, when he took over as the Commander in Chief of \nthe Pacific Fleet, Admiral Clemins saw the bridge being constructed and \nrecognized the prospect of developing Ford Island. He began to \ninvestigate how he could maximize its vast potential to improve the \nNavy in Hawaii. He quickly came to the conclusion that there simply was \nnot enough money to build the new facilities the Navy needs.\n  While some might have given up when faced with this obstacle, that is \nnot the Admiral's way. Instead he directed his staff to keep studying \nthis and identify other ways to achieve his objective.\n  The Admiral took to heart what we have often heard coming from the \nCongress, that we need to revolutionize the way the Pentagon does \nbusiness.\n  He agreed that we have to become more efficient, more like the \nprivate sector. He noted that public/private venture legislation had \nbeen approved by the Congress at the request of former Secretary of \nDefense William Perry for a few family housing projects and he \nsuggested that a similar but expanded approach was needed for Ford \nIsland.\n  At every step there were those that told him why he couldn't do this.\n  Some said it would cost billions, others that the State would not \nsupport developing Ford Island, still others raised technical arguments \non our arcane accounting practices in the Government. But, the Admiral \nkept after it.\n  While the lawyers raised legal concerns, and the Navy staff and \nothers raised objections, every decision maker, the leaders of the \nNavy, State, and local governments, and business leaders always had the \nsame response. This is a good idea, we must figure out how we can do \nit.\n  That was the reaction of the Commander in Chief of The Pacific \nCommand, Admiral Prueher. Recently he testified to the Appropriations \nCommittee that he has reviewed the legislation and believes it is the \nright approach to solving some of the critical housing and facility \nshortfalls for the Navy.\n\n  But, because of the difficulty of moving the legislative proposal \nwithin the bureaucracy, the measure was not included in the President's \nformal budget request. Still the Fleet Commander and CINCPAC were \nundeterred.\n  Admiral Clemins brought the idea to Washington directly, where he \nquickly won support from the uniformed Navy.\n  The Chief of Naval Operations gave the proposal his approval. He then \nreceived personal support from the Secretary of the Navy. His arguments \neven won the informal support from the Deputy Secretary of Defense. \nFinally, the Navy gave the proposal its official blessing. And after \nmany, many months, the legislation was finally forwarded unofficially \nto the Congress.\n  Unfortunately, all of this took time and the delays in winding \nthrough the internal chain of command did not allow the Senate's Armed \nServices Committee time to review this matter prior to its mark up.\n  I offered this same amendment to that bill and it was adopted. \nHowever, there are some in the House that do not agree with the Navy, \nDOD and the Senate Armed Services Committee and they hope to gut the \nproposal.\n  This amendment requires DOD to report on the current legislative \nproposal and to submit legislation to carry out the proposal by \nDecember 1, 1998. That will provide sufficient time for the \nauthorization committee to pass judgement on the matter next year.\n  The amendment does not mandate any specific terms for the Defense \nDepartment to follow, but offers several Navy ideas to be considered.\n  What the Navy seeks to do, as a pilot project only for this one base, \nis to provide authority to the Secretary of the Navy to use his \nresources in conjunction with the private sector to develop Ford \nIsland. The plan would examine whether it is feasible to provide \nincentives and other guarantees to businesses to carry out this idea, \nand establish a framework to carry it out.\n  It is important that we understand how this differs from our current \nsystem and how it might work. Under our normal course of operations, \nthe Navy would identify how much the development of Ford Island would \ncost, and it would develop a spending plan. It is estimated that the \ncosts of developing the island under normal procedures could be as much \nas $600 million.\n  Judging from the military construction budget it would probably \nrequire 15 to 20 years to identify sufficient funds to pay for this. \nThat means a whole generation of Navy sailors would enlist, serve and \nretire, before the base could be completed. This is simply unacceptable \nto Admiral Clemins as it should be to all of my colleagues.\n  By relying on a joint venture, the Navy can use resources gained by \nleasing, exchanging, or selling property that it currently holds in \nHawaii and use those assets and revenues to leverage development of the \nisland. It is like taking out a long term loan. The Navy can put down \nthe down payment using its property or newly generated cash resources, \nand, as is the case under the family housing pilot program, the sailors \nhousing allowances can be used to make the mortgage payments.\n  In theory, the Navy might offer a commercial developer the \nopportunity to establish a few small commercial facilities--like \nparking garages, child care facilities, shops and restaurants--on the \nbase to support the families, and in return the private concern would \nbe responsible for developing additional Navy facilities.\n  In each case, the Secretary of the Navy would have to approve the \nspecific uses and the Congress would have to allow the funding to be \nused for the proposed purpose. This means that sufficient oversight \nwould exist at all levels to ensure that the project stayed on course.\n  Let me tell my colleagues that the business community in my State is \nvery excited about this proposal.\n  They are positive that the legislation will provide a mechanism for \ncreating a public-private partnership to develop the island.\n  From Congress' viewpoint, the development will involve very few \ntaxpayer dollars which is exactly what is needed in today's tight \nbudget environment.\n  Most important is what this will do for the men and women in the \nNavy. Today in Hawaii, the Navy is spread out throughout the island of \nOahu at a number of small posts and with large numbers of military \nfamilies living in poor conditions a long way away from their jobs at \nPearl Harbor.\n  The development of Ford Island will allow the Navy to move many of \nits sailors right to the base to live and work. This will cut down on \ntheir commutes, and it will keep them on base.\n  It will also help ease what has become a very congested rush hour on \nthe highways in the area. For many what was an hour commute will now \nbecome minutes. For families disconnected from the Navy community, they \nwill now be living and working in a quality family environment--a nice \nhome in a beautiful location, with the working spouse only minutes \naway.\n  For our commanders this means many more sailors housed right on base \nand readily available if needed.\n  It will probably come as a surprise to my colleagues to learn that my \nState has some of the worst housing in all the Defense Department. The \nArmy says its worst barracks anywhere in the world are in Hawaii. Some \nof the Navy's housing is so bad that it is an embarrassment to the \nservice.\n\n[[Page S9379]]\n\n  Several years ago, Mrs. Margaret Dalton, the wife of Navy Secretary \nJohn Dalton visited Hawaii and was taken on a tour of some family \nhousing units. The conditions were so deplorable that she was very \ntroubled. When she returned to Washington she insisted that the Navy \nprovide her with a full briefing on its housing rehabilitation plans \nfor the State. Single handedly she moved the Navy forward.\n  Since then, the Navy has made great strides toward improving living \nconditions. But it has become painfully clear, that there simply isn't \nenough money to do what is required. There are many areas that still \nneed to be torn down and rebuilt. Or, that property could be turned \nover for a new use by the private sector. Mrs. Dalton will long be \nremembered by the sailors who serve in Hawaii as the person who started \nto turn around the Navy's living conditions in my State. This proposal \nwill provide us a means to expand upon her work, but this time without \nenormous investment in this constrained budget environment.\n  The benefits of the proposal to the Navy and my State are enormous.\n  I am sure many are now thinking this sounds good, but if it is that \nsimple why hasn't it been done before. To that I would say, it is not \nsimple.\n  It will require great leadership and management by the Navy to work \nwith the local authorities and business community to carry this out. \nBut, I am confident that we have the right man for the job in Admiral \nClemins. He was demonstrated his skills as both a warrior and as a \nmanager and he has the skills necessary to accomplish this task.\n  This approach has not been tried before, because no one put the time \nand energy into working through all the details to formulate a \nlegislative plan to achieve this goal. Furthermore, how many \nopportunities arise when a military department, for all practical \npurposes, receives what amounts to a land grant adjoining a base? This \nis in some ways a unique opportunity because of the location of Ford \nIsland and the new bridge. That is why a pilot proposal is proper. It \ncould also serve as a model for other revitalization efforts at other \nbases, perhaps not on this grand a scale, but using elements from this \napproach.\n  My colleagues all know that there will come a time when the Defense \nDepartment will want to establish a new base somewhere. This public \nprivate venture could be the method where building new bases could \nbecome affordable.\n  Mr. President, this is an excellent idea, that has been shepherded \nthis far by the Navy because they recognized that it is the only way \nthat we can take Ford Island and develop it in a timely and cost \neffective manner.\n  Ten years from now, we can be discussing how we will get enough money \nand authority to proceed to develop Ford Island for the Navy, or we can \nbe discussing how this model pilot program established a method whereby \nwe have begun to recapitalize our defense infrastructure affordably. \nThis is our choice, there is only one answer, we need to approve this \nlegislation to get the ball rolling.\n  I think my colleagues for their attention, and I urge all to support \nthis measure.\n\n\n                           Amendment no. 3430\n\n    (Purpose: To reduce funds available for Navy S-3 Weapon System \n Improvement program and to provide funds for a cyber-security program)\n\n       On page 99, insert in the appropriate place the following \n     new general provisions:\n       Sec. 8104. Within the amounts appropriated under Title IV \n     of this Act under the heading ``Research, Development, Test \n     and Evaluation, Navy'', the amount available for S-3 Weapon \n     System Improvement is hereby reduced by $8,000,000: Provided, \n     Within the amounts appropriated under Title IV of this Act \n     under the heading ``Research, Development, Test and \n     Evaluation, Air Force'', the amount available for a cyber-\n     security program is hereby increased by $8,000,000: Provided \n     further, That the funds are made available for the cyber-\n     security program to conduct research and development on \n     issues relating to security information assurance and to \n     facilitate the transition of information assurance technology \n     to the defense community.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Department of Defense and many other \ngovernment agencies are increasing their use and reliance on \ninformation technology for a wide variety of applications.\n  The growing frequency and increasing sophistication of attacks on the \nDefense Department's computer networks is cause for concern. Other \ngovernment agencies, as well as the private sector, are also subject to \nthese attacks on their network infrastructure.\n  Last year, the Administration organized an exercise to test the \nPentagon's ability to deal with cyber attacks. In this exercise, \nseveral computer specialists from the National Security Agency targeted \ncomputers used by our military forces in the United States and our \nforces in the Pacific. Using computers, modems, and software technology \nwidely available on the Internet, these friendly ``hackers'' were able \nto penetrate unclassified military computer networks in Hawaii, \nWashington, D.C., Chicago, St. Louis and Colorado.\n  We need to do more to protect the Defense Department networks that \nare critical for the operation of our military forces around the world. \nMy amendment, which is fully offset, adds $8 million to the Air Force \nInformation Systems Security Program. The additional funds will be used \nfor research by the Air Force and will rely on the expertise of two \nfederally funded research and development centers currently working on \nissues of information security. These efforts will facilitate the \ndevelopment of information security technology for the Armed Forces, \nand I urge the Senate to approve it.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3431\n\n (Purpose: To provide additional funding for repair of the Korean War \n                           Veterans Memorial)\n\n       On page 99, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 8  .

Mr. President, the amendment I am offering would fix \nand restore one of our most important monuments, the Korean War \nVeterans Memorial. It authorizes the Secretary of the Army to provide, \nwithin existing funds, up to $2 million to complete essential repairs \nto the Memorial. Joining me as a cosponsor of this amendment is my \ndistinguished colleague from Colorado--a Korean War veteran himself--\nSenator Campbell.\n  The Korean War Memorial is the newest war monument in Washington, DC. \nIt was authorized in 1986 by Public Law 99-752 which established a \nPresidential Advisory Board to raise funds and oversee the design of \nthe project, and charged the American Battle Monuments Commission with \nthe management of this project. The authorization provided $1 million \nin federal funds for the design and initial construction of the \nmemorial and Korean War Veterans' organizations and the Advisory Board \nraised over $13 million in private donations to complete the facility. \nConstruction on the memorial began in 1992 and it was dedicated on July \n27, 1995.\n  For those who haven't visited, the Memorial is located south of the \nVietnam Veteran's Memorial on the Mall, to the east of the Lincoln \nMemorial. Designed by world class Cooper Lecky Architects, the monument \ncontains a triangular ``field of service,'' with 19 stainless steel, \nlarger than life statues, depicting a squad of soldiers on patrol. A \ncurb of granite north of the statues lists the 22 countries of the \nUnited Nations that sent troops in defense of South Korea. To the south \nof the patrol stands a wall of black granite, with engraved images of \nmore than 2,400 unnamed service men and women detailing the countless \nways in which Americans answered the call to service. Adjacent to the \nwall is a fountain which is supposed to be encircled by a Memorial \nGrove of linden trees, creating a peaceful setting for quiet \nreflection. When this memorial was originally created, it was intended \nto be a lasting and fitting tribute to the bravery and sacrifice of our \ntroops who\n\n[[Page S9380]]\n\nfought in the ``Forgotten War.'' Unfortunately, just three years after \nits dedication, the monument is not lasting and is no longer fitting.\n  The Memorial has not functioned as it was originally conceived and \ndesigned and has instead been plagued by a series of problems in its \nconstruction. The grove of 40 linden trees have all died and been \nremoved from the ground, leaving forty gaping holes. The pipes feeding \nthe Pool of Remembrance' return system have cracked and the pool has \nbeen cordoned off. The monument's lighting system has been deemed \ninadequate and has caused safety problems for those who wish to visit \nthe site at night. As a result, most of the 1.3 million who visit the \nmonument each year--many of whom are veterans--must cope with \nconstruction gates or areas which have been cordoned off instead of \nexperiencing the full effect of the Memorial\n  Let me read a quote from the Washington Post--from a Korean War \nVeteran, John LeGault who visited the site--that I think captures the \nfrustration associated with not having a fitting and complete tribute \nfor the Korean War. He says, ``Who cares?'' ``That was the forgotten \nwar and this is the forgotten memorial.'' Mr. President, we ought not \nto be sunshine patriots when it comes to making decisions which affect \nour veterans. Too often, we are very high on the contributions that our \nmilitary makes in times of crisis, but when a crisis fades from the \nscene, we seem to forget about this sacrifice. Our veterans deserve \nbetter.\n  To resolve these problems and restore this monument to something that \nour Korean War Veterans can be proud of, the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers conducted an extensive study of the site in an effort to \nidentify, comprehensively, what corrective actions would be required. \nThe Corps has determined that an additional $2 million would be \nrequired to complete the restoration of the grove work and replace the \nstatuary lighting. My amendment would provide the authority for the \nfunds to make these repairs swiftly and once and for all.\n  With the 50th anniversary of the Korean War conflict fast \napproaching, we must ensure that these repairs are made as soon as \npossible. This additional funding would ensure that we have a fitting, \nproper, and lasting tribute to those who served in Korea and that we \nwill never forget those who served in the ``Forgotten War.''

Mr. President, I will be brief. I rise to offer an \namendment to the Defense Appropriations bill for fiscal year 1999 on \nbehalf of Senator Kyl and myself. The amendment would authorize the \nSecretary of The Air Force to enter into an agreement to lease from the \nCity of Phoenix, Arizona a parcel of land near Luke Air Force Base that \nis known as Auxiliary Field 3 for a cost not in excess of one dollar.\n  I offer this amendment because the U.S. Air Force may foresee a need \nto acquire or lease land near Luke Air Force Base to more effectively \nmanage public and private development compatibility with the Luke Air \nForce Base mission. Many communities on the west side of Phoenix are \ndedicated to ensuring that the Air Force has the additional flexibility \nit may need in the near and long term to meet Air Force operational and \ntraining requirements and preserve its overall readiness.\n  Mr. President, this simple amendment is discretionary in nature and \nmeets the criteria which I have ensured that my colleagues must meet \nwhen amendments are offered to appropriations bills. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3448\n\n(Purpose: To designate Army RDT funds for integration and evaluation \n        of a passenger safety system for heavy tactical trucks)\n\n       On page 99, insert in the appropriate place the following \n     new general provision:\n       Sec. 8104.

(a) Of the total amount appropriated under title \n     IV for research, development, test and evaluation, Defense-\n     wide, for basic research, $29,646,000 is available for \n     research and development relating to Persian Gulf illnesses.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I offered an amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill \nimportant to Persian Gulf War veterans. My amendment increases \nDepartment of Defense spending on research to determine the causes and \npossible treatments of those suffering from Gulf War illness by $10 \nmillion. It is my understanding that the amendment has been accepted. \nThis is similar to the amendment I offered and was also accepted as \npart of the Defense Authorization bill.\n  While the Persian Gulf War ended in 1991, the physical and \npsychological ordeal for many of the nearly 700,000 troops who served \nour country in Operations Desert Storm and Desert Shield\n\n[[Page S9382]]\n\nhas not ended. It's been seven years since our troops were winning the \nwar in the Gulf. Unfortunately, they continue to suffer due to their \ndeployment.\n  Many of our troops returned from the Persian Gulf suffering from a \nvariety of symptoms that have been difficult to trace to a single \nsource or substance. Our veterans have experienced a combination of \nsymptoms in varying degrees of seriousness, including: fatigue, skin \nrash, muscle and joint pain, headache, loss of memory, shortness of \nbreath, and gastrointestinal and respiratory problems. Unfortunately, \nthe initial response from the Pentagon and the Department of Veterans \naffairs was to express skepticism about veterans' claims of illness and \ndisability. This strained the government's credibility with veterans \nand their loved ones who dealt with the very real affects of their \nservice in the Gulf.\n  I vividly remember a series of roundtable discussions I held with \nveterans across Iowa after being contacted by several families of Gulf \nWar veterans stricken with undiagnosed illnesses. And these folks \nweren't just sick. They were tired. They were tired of getting the \nrunaround from the government they defended. They were tired of people \nwho refused to listen . . . or told them it was in their head . . . or \nthat it had nothing to do with their service in the Gulf.\n  Their stories put a human face on the results of a study I requested \nthrough the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The results add \nto the increasing volume of evidence that what these veterans were \nexperiencing was indeed very real. More than one in three Gulf War \nveterans reported one or more significant medical problems. Fifteen \npercent reported two or more significant medical conditions. These Iowa \nveterans also reported significantly greater problems with quality of \nlife issues than others on active duty at the time but not deployed in \nthe Gulf. For example, Persian Gulf veterans had lower scores on \nmeasures of vitality, physical and mental health, ability to work, and \nincreased levels of emotional problems and bodily pain.\n  In addition, over 80 percent of the Gulf War veterans in the CDC \nstudy reported having been exposed to at least one potentially \nhazardous material during their Persian Gulf Deployment. A recent \nGeneral Accounting Office report provided an alarming laundry list of \nsuch hazards including: ``compounds used to decontaminate equipment and \nprotect it against chemical agents, fuel used as a sand suppressant in \nand around encampments, fuel used to burn human waste, fuel in shower \nwater, leaded vehicle exhaust used to dry sleeping bags, depleted \nuranium, parasites, pesticides, multiple vaccines used to protect \nagainst chemical warfare agents, and smoke from oil-well fires.''\n  To this rather exhaustive list, we can also add exposure to nerve \ngas. The DOD and CIA have admitted that as many as 100,000 or more . . \n. that's 1 in 7 troops deployed in the Gulf . . . may have been exposed \nto chemical agents released into the atmosphere when U.S. troops \ndestroyed an Iraqi weapons bunker. A Presidential Advisory Committee \nalso found credible evidence of exposure to chemical agents in a second \nincident when troops crossed Iraqi front lines on the first day of the \nground war. Chemical weapons specialists in these units said they \ndetected poison gas. Unfortunately, these detections were initially \nneither acknowledged nor pursued by the Pentagon.\n  That being said, the Pentagon and others have been more forthcoming \nrecently with relevant information, documents, and research. But more \nneeds to be done. I am pleased that the President, acting based on \nlegislation I cosponsored, extended the time veterans will have to file \nclaims with the government for illnesses related to their service in \nthe Gulf. Previously, they had to show their illness surfaced within \ntwo years of their service. Now, they have until the end of 2001. This \nis a great victory for our veterans. Gulf War illnesses do not surface \non a time line convenient to the rules of bureaucrats. This extension \nwill help us meet our responsibility to take care of these soldiers. \nBut, more still needs to be done.\n  There is still substantial mystery and confusion surrounding the \nsymptoms and health problems experienced by Gulf War veterans. While \nmany veterans have been diagnosed with a recognizable disease, I am \nconcerned about those who have no explanation, no label, no treatment \nfor their suffering. More needs to be done to help these Americans.\n  For example, the Presidential Advisory Committee has suggested \nresearch in three new areas to help close the gaps in what we know \nabout Gulf War illnesses. They suggest research on the long-term health \neffects of low-level exposures to chemical warfare agents, the combined \neffects of medical injections meant to combat chemical warfare with \nother Gulf War risk factors, and on the body's physical response to \nstress. It is also imperative to ensure that longitudinal studies and \nmortality studies are funded since some health effects, such as cancer, \nmay not appear for several years after the end of the Gulf War.\n  Although there may be no single Gulf-War related disease so to speak, \nit is widely acknowledged that the multiple illnesses and symptoms \nexperienced by Gulf War veterans are connected to their service during \nthe war. Therefore, we must not forget on our solemn obligation to \nthose who willingly served their country and put their lives in harm's \nway.\n  To that end, I offer this amendment to increase research into the \nillnesses experienced by Persian Gulf veterans by $10 million. The \nfunds would support much more research, including the evaluation and \ntreatment of a host of neuro-immunological disorders, as well as \npossible connections to Multiple Chemical Sensitivity, chronic fatigue \nsyndrome and fibromyaglia.\n  Our veterans are not asking for much. They want answers. They want \nthe truth. Our veterans answered our nation's call in war, and now we \nmust answer theirs. Should our priorities include our Gulf War \nveterans?

Mr. President, this amendment directs the General \nAccounting Office to take a close look at the health care benefit that \nwe provide to our military dependents, retirees, and their survivors. \nEnough time has passed since we replaced CHAMPUS with the TRICARE \nprogram that it is now time to see whether or not we are providing a \nproper benefit.\n  When I speak of a ``proper benefit,'' I use a very simple standard. I \nwant to be sure that our men and women in uniform and their loved ones \nare being cared for as well as our civilian federal employees are. The \nFederal Employees Health Benefits program (FEHBP) provides civilian \nfederal employees and retirees with a good health care benefit having a \nwide range of patient choice. It's the program that covers all of us in \nCongress, and my goal is to make sure that TRICARE is just as good for \nour military families.\n  Mr. President, the FEHBP offers many different managed-care, fee-for-\nservice, and preferred-provider plans from which to choose. If the \ncivilian federal employee or retiree finds his or her health care plan \nto be inadequate, another plan of the same type can be chosen. For our \nmilitary families, it is not so simple. With TRICARE, you only get a \nchoice of one managed-care, one fee-for-service, or one preferred-\nprovider plan. To paraphrase Henry Ford, you can pick any HMO-type plan \nthat you want, as long as you choose TRICARE Prime. And if, for \nexample, you are unhappy with TRICARE Prime, you either have to live \nwith it, or go for the one fee-for-service or the one preferred-\nprovider plan--there are no alternate managed-care plans.\n  Now, I recognize that a comparison between the TRICARE plans and the \nFEHBP plans will have to be very subjective. The comparison should not \nbe limited simply to objective cost factors, such as co-pays and \npremiums, but it must be expansive enough to consider factors such as \npatient satisfaction, administrative requirements, ceilings on \nreimbursements and timeliness of their payment, covered services, etc. \nThis is why I want the GAO to do this study. They will be independent \nand can use a combination of objective analyses and subjective surveys \nand interviews to give us the most clear, unbiased picture.\n  Of course, we would not have to worry about conducting studies or \nfiguring out how to compare the quality of TRICARE with the FEHBP if we \nprovided more customer choice. Ultimately, the best ``study'' of the \nquality of a product or service is its acceptance in the marketplace. \nFor this reason, I have long favored considering Medicare subvention \nand making FEHBP available for military beneficiaries as well as \ncivilians. But, with TRICARE only offering one of each type of plan and \nhaving a captive audience, there are no competitive pressures to keep \nproviders focused on customer service, so this study is necessary.\n  I am also concerned that Department of Defense policies with regard \nto TRICARE may be further limiting choice. The GAO should identify \nreasons why TRICARE Prime enrollees should have priority at Military \nTreatment Facilities. This decision may be effectively eliminating the \nTRICARE Standard and Extra options because to choose either of these \noptions may close off treatment at a Military Treatment Facility.\n  And there is another problem. Medicare-eligible military retirees, \nsince the implementation of TRICARE are now having a very difficult \ntime getting to see the doctor at the Military Treatment Facilities, if \nnot facing an impossibility altogether. Let me explain. Because TRICARE \nPrime patients have first priority for medical treatment, retirees who \nwish to be served at a Military Treatment Facility have to sign up for \nTRICARE Prime--their choice for TRICARE Standard or Extra is \neffectively eliminated. But, the worst of it is that Medicare-eligible \nretirees are not eligible to participate in TRICARE at all. They and \ntheir Medicare-eligible dependents and survivors, if there are no \nappointments available at the Military Treatment Facility, are left \nwith no military medical benefit, which we all know is contrary to the \npromise made to these veterans when they decided to make a career in \nthe military.\n  Mr. President, there is no reasonable explanation that I can think of \nthat could justify a health care benefit for our men and women in \nuniform, their dependents, and survivors, and retirees who give and \ngave so much of their lives for our country, that is anything less than \nwhat we have provided for ourselves and for civil servants. My \namendment will give us a clear idea whether the military medical \nbenefit offered is truly ``prime,'' or even ``standard,'' or whether it \nis substandard and we need to take action.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3453\n\n (Purpose: To authorize the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of \n    the Air Force to enter into one or more multiyear leases of non-\n    tactical firefighting, crash rescue, or snow removal equipment)\n\n       On page 99, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8104.

Mr. President, I rise to offer a simple amendment to the \nFiscal Year 1999 Defense Appropriations bill on behalf of Senator Kay \nBailey Hutchison and myself that merits bipartisan support and speedy \npassage.\n  My amendment would repeal the limitations on the military departments \nto waive the requirement for reimbursement of expenses for foreign \nstudents at the service academies. Clearly, the authority to set rates \nand waive reimbursement expenses for persons from foreign countries \nundergoing instruction at U.S. service academies should rest with our \nmilitary departments and not be subject to limitations on their ability \nto determine the costs of instruction of foreign nationals.\n  Mr. President, the Senate Armed Services Committee included this \nprovision in its version of the Fiscal Year 1999 Defense Authorization \nbill, however it was subsequently dropped in Conference. The service \nacademy superintendents all support this legislation, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.

Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Dorgan's \namendment that would clarify the eligibility of small businesses to \nparticipate in the Indian incentive payment program.\n  Mr. President, I can assure my colleagues that in establishing this \nprogram, it was our intent to provide incentives to Defense contractors \nwho would enter into subcontracts with Indian tribal government-\nchartered entities and tribal enterprises.\n  Mr. President, it was not our intent to exclude from the Indian \nincentive payment program, those small businesses that might enter into \ncontracts with the Department of Defense.\n  It is my understanding that because the original authorizing language \nwhich established the Indian incentive payment program refers to a \nsubcontracting plan pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 637(d), the Department of \nDefense has interpreted that provision to exclude small businesses from \nparticipation in the Indian incentive payment program.\n  Senator Dorgan's amendment would simply strike the reference to a \nsubcontracting plan pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 637(d), to make clear that \nsmall businesses who enter into contracts with the Department of \nDefense may participate in the Indian incentive payment program by \nentering into subcontracts with tribally-chartered entities or tribal \nenterprises.\n  Mr. President, I believe we should include Senator Dorgan's amendment \nin S. 2132.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have two pertinent letters printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 19, 1997.\n     Hon. Byron L. Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Byron: This is in response to your letter dated \n     October 31, 1997, concerning the Department of Defense Indian \n     Subcontracting Incentive Program.\n       The situation you describe is the consequence of a \n     provision in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, \n     1998. Specifically, section 8024 of that Act appropriates $8 \n     million for incentive payments authorized by section 504 of \n     the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (25 U.S.C. 1544). Section \n     8024, however, restricts the availability of such incentive \n     payments to contractors that have submitted subcontracting \n     plans pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 637(d). However, subsection \n     637(d)(7) expressly provides that the provisions relating to \n     submission of a subcontracting plan under section 637(d) do \n     not apply to small businesses. Consequently, the $8 million \n     is not available for payments to small business under this \n     authority.\n       Accordingly, in order to permit small businesses to \n     participate in the program supported by the $8 million \n     available under section 8024, new legislation, rather than an \n     administrative change, would be required. We strongly support \n     maximum practicable participation of small businesses in the \n     performance of Department of Defense contracts, and \n     accordingly we intend to explore, in coordination with the \n     Office of Management and Budget, whether to advance a \n     legislative proposal to eliminate the restrictive language in \n     section 8024 in future years appropriations acts.\n       I appreciate your bringing this issue to our attention, and \n     trust that this responds to your concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n     William Cohen.\n                                  ____\n\n         Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition and Technology,\n                                Washington, DC, November 12, 1997.\n     Mr. Marc A. King,\n     Vice President, Business Development,\n     GMA Cover Corp., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. King: This responds to our telephone conversation \n     of October 9, 1997 relative to whether or not small \n     businesses are eligible to receive incentive payments under \n     the DoD Indian Subcontracting Incentive Program. My staff, in \n     consultation with both the Office of General Counsel and the \n     Office of Defense Procurement, thoroughly reviewed the FY \n     1998 DoD Appropriations Act and our implementing policy. The \n     conclusion reached based on that review is that the \n     legislation authorizes incentive payments from the $8 Million \n     appropriated only to firms who submit subcontracting plans \n     pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 637(d). Since 15 U.S.C. 637(d) does not \n     apply to small businesses, even if GMA Cover Corporation \n     agreed to submit a subcontracting plan, such a submission \n     would not be pursuant to this provision of the law. \n     Consequently, payment of incentives for subcontracting with \n     Indian organizations or Indian-owned business enterprises \n     using the $8 Million appropriated in the FY 1998 DoD \n     Appropriations Act is not authorized for GMA Cover \n     Corporation or other small businesses.\n       As the restriction on the use of the $8 Million \n     appropriated for Indian subcontracting incentive payments to \n     large businesses is part of the FY 1998 Appropriations Act, \n     it cannot be eliminated through regulations developed by the \n     Department to implement the legislation. However, since it is \n     our objective to provide for the maximum practicable \n     participation of Indian organizations and Indian-owned \n     business enterprises in our contracts, I have submitted a \n     legislative initiative proposing an amendment to the FY 1998 \n     Appropriations Act language that will allow incentive \n     payments to small businesses which subcontract to Indian \n     organizations or Indian-owned business enterprises.\n       The point of contact for this subject is Mr. Ivory Fisher. \n     You may contact him directly on this or any other issues \n     associated with the Indian Subcontracting Incentive Program. \n     He may be reached at (703) 697-1688.\n\n                                          Robert L.

The question is on agreeing to the amendments \nen bloc.\n  The amendments (No. 3420 through 3464) were agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I say with regard to the unresolved \nissues: We ask Senator DeWine or his staff to show us the drug \ninterdiction amendment; the D'Amato Serbia amendment; the two Coats \namendments on SOS, and the next QDR, so that we can proceed to review \nthose.\n  Similarly, we have a series on the Democratic side that we have not \nseen, and I urge that we see those: the Dodd Army pension issues; the \nHarkin vets' meals issue. Other than that, I believe we have seen them \nall.\n  I might state, it appears that the one amendment that will take the \nlongest time to dispose of is Senator Durbin's amendment, and I see he \nis here. I invite him to offer his amendment so that we might determine \nhow to handle it.\n  Is the Senator prepared to suggest any kind of a time arrangement \nwith regard to that? We would like to have a vote sometime around 8 \no'clock, to make sure people understand we are going to stay here until \nwe get done.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am open to the Senator's request for a time limitation. \nWhatever the Senator from Alaska would like to suggest, I would \ncertainly entertain.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am willing to suggest to the Senator \nthat we divide the time equally between now and 8 p.m., at which time \nit would be my intention to move to table the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree to that. I have no objection. Before agreeing, \ncould I ask the Senator from Alaska, time will be equally divided?\n  Mr. STEVENS. And I add to that, there will be no second-degree \namendments to this motion prior to the motion to table; after the \nmotion to table, it is open.\n\n[[Page S9386]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. And further debate?\n  Mr. STEVENS. And further debate; obviously, there is no limitation if \nthe amendment is not tabled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3465\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the availability of funds for offensive military \n   operations except in accordance with Article I, Section 8 of the \n                             Constitution)\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3465.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 99, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8104. No funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be used to initiate or conduct \n     offensive military operations by United States Armed Forces \n     except in accordance with Article I, Section 8 of the \n     Constitution, which vests in Congress the power to declare \n     war and take certain other related actions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is the usual custom in the Senate as \nlong as I have been here--almost 19 or 20 months now--to dispense with \nthe reading of an amendment. In this case, I did not--first, because \nthe amendment in its entirety is very brief, only one page; and, \nsecond, I wanted those who are following this debate to hear each word \nof the amendment, because in the wording of this amendment I think we \nhave an important decision to make on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  This amendment which I offer reaffirms that the United States should \nonly go to war in accordance with the war powers vested in the Congress \nby the Constitution. My colleague, who has just joined us on the floor, \nSenator Byrd of West Virginia, carries a well-worn and tattered version \nof that Constitution with him. I bet he has it on his person as this \nmoment--and I win my bet--and Senator Byrd refers to it frequently to \nremind all of us that we, when we took the oath of office to become \nMembers of the U.S. Senate, swore to uphold this Constitution.\n  The section of the Constitution which my amendment addresses is one \nwhich is central to the power of the U.S. Senate and the power of \nCongress. Article I, section 8, includes in the powers of Congress, the \npower:\n\n       To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal and \n     make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water.\n\n  Most constitutional scholars will know the meaning of the term \n``marque and reprisal.'' We have read it many times, but for those of \nus who need to be refreshed, that is an effort, short of war, where the \nUnited States, short of some commitment of major troop forces and the \nlike, would seek to impose its will or stand for its own national \nsecurity.\n  The most operative section of Article I, section 8, are the simple \nwords ``To declare War.''\n  This amendment would prohibit the use of funds appropriated to the \nDepartment of Defense for ``offensive military operations,'' except in \naccordance with Article I, section 8, which specifically gives to \nCongress, and Congress alone, the power to declare war and take other \nactions to govern and regulate the Armed Forces.\n  A similar amendment was offered by Congressman David Skaggs of \nColorado and Congressman Tom Campbell of California in a bipartisan \nfashion. It has passed the House of Representatives. It is part of the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill, which will be considered in \nconference with the bill that we are debating.\n  This amendment that I offer today reaffirms that the Constitution \nfavors the Congress in the decision to go to war, and that Members of \nCongress have a constitutional responsibility that they cannot ignore \nwith regard to the offensive use of Armed Forces. Why is this \nnecessary? Let me quote from a scholar who has written on this subject \nextensively. Louis Fisher is a senior specialist in the separation of \npowers with the Congressional Research Service at the Library of \nCongress. He wrote in an article entitled ``Sidestepping Congress: \nPresidents Acting Under the UN and NATO:\n\n       Truman in Korea, Bush in Iraq, Clinton in Haiti and \n     Bosnia--in each instance, a President circumvented Congress \n     by relying either on the UN or NATO. President Bush also \n     stitched together a multilateral alliance before turning to \n     Congress at the eleventh hour to obtain statutory authority. \n     Each exercise of power built a stronger base for unilateral \n     Presidential action, no matter how illegal, unconstitutional \n     and undemocratic. The attitude, increasingly, is not to do \n     things the right way, in accordance with the Constitution and \n     our laws, but to do the ``right thing.'' It is an attitude of \n     autocracy, if not monarchy. How long do we drift in these \n     currents before discovering that the waters are hazardous for \n     constitutional government?\n\n  On January 12, 1991, the Congress, in addition to authorizing the use \nof force to drive Saddam Hussein from Kuwait, took an important vote \nasserting its constitutional responsibilities and insisting that the \nPresident follow the wisdom of the framers of our Constitution when \nconsidering a question as serious as war. Despite the vocal opposition \nof the Bush White House, the House of Representatives in which I served \nvoted 302-131 in favor of a resolution that I offered with Congressman \nBennett of Florida. You may recall what happened. When Saddam Hussein \nof Iraq invaded Kuwait, there was fear that he would continue and then \ninvade Saudi Arabia. The United States began positioning forces in \nSaudi Arabia. At the invitation of the Saudis, we brought in a \nsufficient force to at least discourage, if not deter, Saddam Hussein.\n  Over time, it became clear that the force in place was growing and \nthe intention was just not to protect Saudi Arabia, but in fact to \nremove Iraqi forces from Kuwait. At that moment, the nature of our \ncommitment changed, and at that moment, the congressional \nresponsibility changed, from my point of view. We were no longer in \nSaudi Arabia just at the invitation of the Saudis to defend; we were \npreparing a massive military force to, in fact, invade Kuwait and to \noust the Iraqis. We knew that that would necessarily involve the loss \nof life, and many of us in Congress believed that it clearly fit within \nthe four corners of Article I, section 8, that Congress should act and, \nin fact, we did. There was an extensive debate on the floor of the \nSenate, as well as the House of Representatives, and ultimately, \nCongress voted to authorize the use of force by the President--\nPresident Bush at the time--in order to push the Iraqis out of Kuwait.\n  Another important congressional action was a 1994 Senate resolution \nrejecting the Clinton administration's claim that the United Nations \nSecurity Council 940 constituted ``authorization for the deployment of \nU.S. Armed Forces in Haiti under the Constitution of the United \nStates.'' The Senate passed this resolution by a resounding 99-0 vote. \nThe framers never intended the Armed Forces to be employed by the \nExecutive as a blunt instrument for enforcing U.S. foreign policy \nwithout congressional approval. Yet, in the Iraq crisis earlier this \nyear, and in the unstable situation in Kosovo today, that is exactly \nwhat we have seen. Absent a reaffirmation by Congress of its proper \nconstitutional war powers, we will certainly see it again. The time for \nthis amendment is now. I will speak to the Kosovo situation toward the \nclose of my opening statement.\n  Article I, section 8, clause 11 of the Constitution, the so-called \nwar powers clause, vests in Congress this power that I have read. Other \nclauses of the same article I, section 8 vests in Congress the power to \n``define and punish piracies'' and ``offenses against the Law of \nNations,'' ``raise and support armies,'' ``to provide and maintain a \nnavy,'' and ``make rules for the government and regulation of the land \nand naval forces,'' and ``to provide for organizing,'' arming, and \ndisciplining the militia, and ``governing such part of them as may be \nemployed in the service of the United States.''\n  Very significantly, clause 18 of this section gives Congress the \npower to ``make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for \ncarrying into execution the foregoing powers.'' This clause clearly \nstates that it is Congress that makes the laws for the regulation of \nthe Armed Forces, especially in matters of war.\n  Article II, section 2 of the Constitution states:\n\n       The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and \n     Navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several \n     states, when called into the actual service of the United \n     States.''\n\n  That is all the war powers vested in the President by the \nConstitution. It is instructive for us to look back at the\n\n[[Page S9387]]\n\ndebate which gave rise to these constitutional provisions.\n  Comments by the framers of the Constitution clearly indicate their \nintent in favor of Congress in matters relating to the offensive use of \nmilitary force.\n  James Wilson, speaking at the Pennsylvania State Convention on the \nAdoption of the Federal Constitution, argued that the system of checks \nand balances built into the Constitution ``will not hurry us into war; \nit is calculated to guard against it. It will not be in the power of a \nsingle man or a single body of men to involve us in such distress; for \nthe important power of declaring war is vested in the legislature at \nlarge.''\n  No one less than Thomas Jefferson explained that he desired Congress \nto be ``an effectual check to the dog of war.''\n  James Madison wrote that Congress would have the power to initiate \nwar, though the President could act immediately ``to repel sudden \nattacks'' without congressional authorization.\n  Roger Sherman further delineated on the President's war powers: ``The \nexecutive should be able to repel and not to commence war.''\n  Constitutional scholar Louis Henkin of Columbia University wrote this \nin 1987:\n\n       There is no evidence that the framers contemplated any \n     significant independent role--or authority--for the president \n     as commander in chief when there was no war. . . . The \n     president's designation as commander in chief . . . appears \n     to have implied no substantive authority to use the Armed \n     Forces, whether for war (unless the United States were \n     suddenly attacked) or for peacetime purposes, except as \n     Congress directed.\n\n  International law scholar, John Bassett Moore, wrote in 1944:\n\n       There can hardly be room for doubt that the framers of the \n     Constitution, when they vested in Congress the power to \n     declare war, never imagined that they were leaving it to the \n     Executive to use the military and naval forces of the United \n     States all over the world for the purpose of actually \n     coercing other nations, occupying their territory, and \n     killing their soldiers and citizens, all according to his own \n     notions of the fitness of things, as long as he called his \n     action something other than `war' or persisted in calling it \n     peace.\n\n  The constitutional framework adopted by the framers for the war power \nis remarkably clear in its basic principles. The authority to initiate \nwar lay with Congress. Other U.S. Presidents have affirmed this \ninterpretation of war powers under the Constitution.\n  Abraham Lincoln wrote this in 1848:\n\n       This, our (Constitutional) Convention understood to be the \n     most oppressive of all Kingly oppressions; and they resolved \n     to so frame the Constitution that no one man should hold the \n     power of bringing this oppression upon us.\n\n  Fast forward 100 years into the 20th century, as we debated the \npossibility of creating a United Nations. The U.N. Charter was written \nagainst the backdrop of the disaster of the Treaty of Versailles and \nPresident Wilson's determination to make foreign policy without \nCongress. When President Wilson submitted that treaty to the Senate in \n1919, he attached the covenant of the League of Nations. Senator Henry \nCabot Lodge offered a number of reservations, specifically including a \nprotection of the prerogative of Congress, and Congress alone, to \ndeclare war. President Wilson called this reservation ``a nullification \nof the treaty.'' The issue was joined. The Senate rejected the treaty, \nand thereby the League of Nations, in 1919 and again in 1920.\n  In the midst of World War II, when the concept of another world \norganization began to form, care was taken not to cross the line that \nhad doomed the League of Nations. Any commitment of U.S. forces to a \nworld body would require prior authorization by both Houses of \nCongress. Debate on the Hill between the House and Senate had more to \ndo with each body's prerogative and role than the underlying \nassumption. Even under the auspices of the United Nations, \ncongressional approval was necessary before troops could be committed.\n  Section 6 of the United Nations Participation Act is explicit. \nAgreements ``shall be subject to the approval of the Congress by \nappropriate act or joint resolution.''\n  Ultimately the decision was reached that both Houses of Congress--not \njust the Senate under its treaty authority--was necessary.\n  Soon after President Roosevelt's death, President Harry Truman sent a \ncable from the conference in Potsdam that led to the establishment of \nthe U.N., stating that all agreements involving U.S. troop commitments \nin the U.N. would first have to be approved by both Houses of Congress.\n  President Eisenhower assured the press, in January of 1956, in an \noften-quoted statement, ``When it comes to a matter of war, there is \nonly one place I would go, and that is the Congress of the United \nStates and tell them what I believe. I will never be guilty of any kind \nof action that can be interpreted as war until Congress, which has \nconstitutional authority, says so. I am not going to order any troops \ninto anything that can be interpreted as war until Congress directs \nit.''\n  In the creation of NATO, Secretary of State Dean Acheson told the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee in 1949 that the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization ``does not mean the United States would \nautomatically be at war if one of the other signatory nations were the \nvictim of an armed attack. Under our Constitution the Congress alone \nhas the power to declare war.''\n  Then came Korea. President Truman sent U.S. troops in 1950 without \never seeking, or obtaining, congressional authority. By historical \nfluke, the Soviet Union was absent from the U.N. Security Council when \na crucial vote was taken responding to the possibility that the Korean \npeninsula would be overrun. Without a Soviet veto, the U.N. moved \nforward, and President Truman rationalized the use of force in this \n``police action'' to uphold the rule of law.\n  I recall that particularly, because my two older brothers served in \nthe Korean war, and there was an ongoing joke about the fact that this \nwas just a ``police action.'' They knew better. All of the families and \nall of those involved knew that it was, in fact, a war.\n  The courts, too, have supported the constitutional prerogatives of \nCongress with regard to war-making, including the implied \nconstitutional power to ``authorize'' war.\n  The Supreme Court in Bas v. Tingy, in 1800 said, ``Congress is \nempowered to declare general war, or Congress may wage a limited war; \nlimited in place, in objects, and in time. . . .''\n  Chief Justice Marshall, writing in Talbot v. Seeman in 1801: ``The \nwhole powers of war being, by the Constitution of the United States, \nvested in Congress, the acts of that body can alone be resorted to as \nguides in this inquiry.''\n  U.S. Circuit Court, New York, U.S. v. Smith, 1806: ``It is the \nexclusive province of Congress to change a state of peace into a state \nof war.''\n  More recently, during the Persian Gulf episode, a case was filed in \nthe U.S. district court in Washington. I joined with petitioners who \nfiled this action to ask the court to spell out the power of Congress \nwhen it came to the declaration of war. The court rejected the Justice \nDepartment's contention that ``the question whether an offensive action \ntaken by American armed forces constitutes an act of war (to be \ninitiated by a declaration of war) or an `offensive military attack' \n(presumably undertaken by the President in his capacity as Commander in \nChief) is not one of objective fact but involves an exercise of \njudgment based upon all the vagaries of foreign affairs and national \nsecurity.''\n  The court said, ``This claim on behalf of the Executive is far too \nsweeping to be accepted by the courts. If the Executive had the sole \npower to determine that any particular offensive military operation, no \nmatter how vast, does not constitute war-making but only an offensive \nmilitary attack, the congressional power to declare war will be at the \nmercy of a semantic decision by the Executive. Such an `interpretation' \nwould evade the plain language of the Constitution, and it cannot \nstand.''\n  Mr. President, over the last 40 or 45 years, Congress has virtually \nceded its constitutional war powers responsibilities to the President. \nMany of the significant instances of use of force by the Executive \nwithout congressional authorization, including the only major \nunauthorized war in Korea, and localized conflicts in the Dominican \nRepublic, Grenada, and Panama, among others, occurred during this \nperiod.\n  I will not visit that sad and contentious chapter of American history \nsurrounding the Vietnam war, but suffice\n\n[[Page S9388]]\n\nit to say that after that war Congress made the decision, through the \npassage of legislation, to take a more active role in the \ndecisionmaking process.\n  The 1973 War Powers Resolution, which then-Armed Services Committee \nChairman John Stennis called ``an important step in this Congress to \nassume its duty in representing the people of this Nation,'' \nunfortunately has done little to slow down the gradual assumption of \nwar powers claimed by successive administrations or to embolden \nCongress to properly exercise its war powers responsibilities under the \nConstitution.\n  Even in signing the congressional authorization of the use of force \nagainst Iraq in 1991, President Bush went to great pains to emphasize \nhis claim that he possessed constitutional authority to act. ``As I \nmade clear to congressional leaders at the outset, my request for \ncongressional support did not, and my signing of this resolution does \nnot, constitute any change in the longstanding position of the \nExecutive Branch on either the President's constitutional authority to \nuse the Armed Forces to defend vital U.S. interests, or the \nconstitutionality of the War Powers Resolution.''\n  The Clinton administration echoed President Bush's comments and even \ntook it one step further.\n  During her congressional testimony during the Iraq crisis this last \nFebruary, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright spoke of ``the \nPresident's constitutional authority as Commander in Chief to use armed \nforces to protect our national interests.''\n  In a Statement of Administration policy threatening a veto of the \nHouse version of this bill if the Skaggs-Campbell amendment were \nincluded, the administration stated that, ``The President must be able \nto act decisively to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy \ninterests.''\n  I do not believe that the framers of our Constitution would have ever \naccepted such inflated claims of executive authority, or the idea the \nArmed Forces should be used by the President as a device for \nimplementing administration foreign policy, without the approval of \nCongress.\n  President Bush's comments notwithstanding, Congress made a good start \nin regaining its proper constitutional war powers in its thorough 1991 \ndebate and vote to authorize the war in the Persian Gulf. Congress \naffirmed at that time that its responsibilities extended far beyond \nmerely paying the bills for Presidents' wars.\n  Now it is time for the Congress to take the next step. This amendment \nwill restore the proper constitutional balance between the executive \nand legislative branches in deciding when or if the United States is to \ngo to war.\n  Mr. President, in the time that I have served on Capitol Hill, in \nboth the House and Senate, it has been my sad responsibility on several \noccasions to attend funerals in my home district, in my congressional \ndistrict, for the families of those who have fallen in combat.\n  I can't think of a sadder occasion--one of the saddest that I can \nrecall--than the one that involved the sending of Marines to Lebanon, \nputting them in harm's way, and after a terrible bombing of the \nbarracks, the loss of life of a young man from Springfield, IL. Time \nand again, I thought at those sad services that there is a legitimate \nquestion the family could ask of their elected representative in \nCongress, and now in the U.S. Senate. Was I part of the decision that \nled to the war that took their son's life? Because the Constitution \nmakes it clear that I should have been part of that decision. In so \nmany instances, I was not; the decision was made by the President. The \nonly course for Congress is control of the purse, and virtually nothing \nelse. As a direct result, we lost lives without the American people \nspeaking to the question of war through their elected Congress.\n  I caution my colleagues to read carefully this amendment and to \nrealize that it does more than assert our constitutional authority to \ndeclare war. It also asserts our responsibility. Be careful for what \nyou wish because with the passage of this amendment and the reassertion \nof our constitutional responsibility, we will be and should be called \non more frequently to make important decisions about committing \nAmerican troops.\n  There is one operative and very important word in this amendment. It \nis the word ``offensive,'' as in offensive military operations. So the \nRecord is eminently clear, there is no doubt in my mind nor in anything \nI have read that the President of the United States, as Commander in \nChief, has the power to protect American citizens and the property of \nthe United States. He need not come to the Congress and seek our \napproval when he is, in fact, defending Americans and their property. \nWe are talking about a separate circumstance, a circumstance where \ninstead of taking a defensive action, the President decides to take an \noffensive action.\n  I might also add that for those who say, clearly the Senator from \nIllinois is offering this amendment because he is concerned about some \ncurrent conflict, well, yes, I am concerned. I am concerned about any \nconflict that involves American lives, but that isn't what motivates me \nto join the gentleman from Colorado who offered this amendment in the \nHouse of Representatives. As I mentioned earlier, it was almost 7 years \nago that I joined Congressman Bennett of Florida in a similar effort. I \ndo believe this principle is sound, and those who want to gainsay this \neffort should know that I have tried to stand by this principle through \nthe time that I have been in Congress.\n  Is there a need for us to consider it now? I will leave that to your \njudgment. Consider the statements made by Robert Gelbard, special \nrepresentative of the President and Secretary of State on \nImplementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement, when he spoke before the \nHouse International Relations Committee in Washington on July 23, 1998, \nrelative to the tragedy in Kosovo.\n  Mr. Gelbard said: \n       In NATO councils, planning for possible NATO action is \n     nearly completed. While no decision has been made regarding \n     the use of force, all options, including robust military \n     intervention in Kosovo, remain on the table. NATO planning is \n     on track and Milosevic understands that this is no idle \n     threat. The deteriorating situation in Kosovo is a threat to \n     regional peace and security. The potential for spillover into \n     neighboring States remains a paramount concern. We and our \n     allies have made clear to President Milosevic that spillover \n     of the conflict into Albania or Macedonia will not be \n     tolerated.\n\n  Make no mistake, if Mr. Gelbard's statement is a statement of \nadministration policy, the administration is poised to initiate an \noffensive military action relative to Kosovo, an action which I believe \nclearly requires congressional approval, If the men and women in \nservice to our country who are presently in Bosnia--and I believe the \nnumber is about 6,900--should be called to take offensive military \naction and lives are lost, from all that I have read, it is clearly in \nderogation of article I, section 8 of the Constitution. This President, \nmy President, any President, has the responsibility to come to Congress \nto seek our approval. Of course, then the responsibility is on our \nshoulders to decide whether or not this is in America's national \nsecurity interest.\n  I ask my colleagues in the Senate in considering this amendment to \nconsider the historical perspective here. For the first time since \nWorld War II, when President Franklin Roosevelt hobbled up the steps to \ntake the podium for a Joint Session of Congress in the House of \nRepresentatives, asking for a declaration of war, we will state in \nclear and unequivocal terms that we are asserting our constitutional \nresponsibility and authority when it comes to a declaration of war.\n  I understand that this will require more dialogue and conversation \nbetween the executive and legislative branches about our foreign \npolicy, and particularly about committing troops, but I do believe that \nis what the framers of the Constitution had in mind. Those of us who \nmust face the families and explain to them why their daughters and \nsons, their husbands, their wives and friends and relatives are called \non to not only serve this country, but stand in harm's way and risk \ntheir lives have to have the authority to stand before them and say we \nhave done our part, we have played our role, we have made the judgment, \nthe judgment which the Constitution gives to us and us alone to make.\n  At this point, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, to add Senator \nFeingold as an original cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S9389]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield me some time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I can't get started in 9 minutes on this \nsubject.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I wonder if the Senator from West Virginia might be able \nto secure some time from the other side. I would be happy to ask, if \nthere is anyone in the Chamber. They might be called for that purpose.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I was not in the Chamber when the agreement \nwas entered into. My friend knew of my interest in speaking on the \namendment, and I wish I had been protected.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I ask the Chair, it was my understanding that at \nabout quarter of 7 we agreed we would debate this until 8 o'clock \nequally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is correct. That is how time was calculated. I am \nsorry; I apologize to the Senator from West Virginia, whom I asked to \ncome to the floor, and I would be glad to give him every minute \nremaining. I am sorry that I had gone as long as I did, because I am \nanxious to hear his remarks.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I don't know how much time the opponents of \nthis amendment will require.\n  Mr. President, I think I will just ask for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. I wish to thank the opponents for offering 10 minutes to \nme, but I feel that I will just ask that my speech be printed in the \nRecord.\n  On a matter of this gravity, I am disappointed that the Senate has \nentered into an agreement to speak for what would amount to about 1 \nhour and 15 minutes for both opponents and proponents. Of course, the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois is preeminently correct in what he \nhas said about the Constitution and what he has said about the efforts \ntoward aggrandizement on the part of this administration and most \nrecent administration when it comes to the war powers.\n  We have in the Senate particularly, may I say, additional \nresponsibilities over those of the House in this area of war powers \nbecause of the Constitution and provisions therein, and it seems to me \nthat we ought to take a little more time when it comes to debating an \namendment of this importance. This is an amendment that is calculated \nto protect the prerogatives of the Senate when it comes to our \nconstitutional powers and duties, and here we are limited to 1 hour and \n15 minutes.\n  In saying this, of course, I am complaining, but I also want to thank \nMr. Durbin and I want to thank Mr. Stevens for their consideration and \nkindness in offering to give me some additional time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before the Senator from West Virginia \nleaves the floor, I have just contacted the majority in an effort to \npostpone the vote so we can extend this debate. I certainly would like \nthe Senator from West Virginia to have an opportunity to state his \nposition clearly. I believe it will be a valuable addition to this \ndebate. I will be happy to afford an equal amount of time to the other \nside, so there is no disadvantage created.\n  Before I make that unanimous consent request, I have asked the \nmajority side if there is objection.\n  Mr. STEVENS. What? I object. Just a second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I might ask the Senator from Alaska, Senator Byrd has \ncome to the floor to speak to this issue. I was wondering if it might \nbe allowed by unanimous consent to extend --postpone the vote for a \nsufficient time so that each side could have an equal amount of time, \nto give the Senator from West Virginia his opportunity.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I say to the Senator, I have talked with Senator Byrd. \nWe are perfectly prepared to have him continue to take time.\n  Under a unanimous consent agreement, at 8 o'clock we have Senators \ncoming back to vote, and hopefully we can vote at approximately that \ntime. I don't know how long my good friend is going to speak, but I \nwill limit the amount of time spent in opposition. We will just make \nthe motion to table when the time comes. We do not want to extend it \nnow. We are going to have to be here until 3 or 4 o'clock in the \nmorning as it is, so I object to any further change in this time \nagreement, and I urge my good friend from West Virginia to make his \nstatement. He knows we will accommodate him with such time as he needs. \nBut let's not change the time agreement yet.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9375-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND \n             INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my understanding when the Senator \nreturns to the floor, Senator Byrd will speak. I state to the Senate, \nthere is substantial opposition to this amendment. I am one who voted \nagainst the War Powers Act, but I think this goes too far. It is an \namendment that should be considered by the Armed Services Committee and \nnot debated at the last minute on an appropriations bill.\n  In the old days, we had a point of order against legislation on an \nappropriations bill. This is purely legislation on an appropriations \nbill. That point of order is not available to us now, but the concept \nis still there, and that is what we are trying to establish once \nagain--the concept that we limit this to relevant amendments to the \nprovisions of this bill that regard spending of money for our defense \nin the fiscal year 1999.\n\n[[Page S9390]]\n\n  This is a provision that is ongoing for years. It is not related to \nthis bill. It is not a matter that was before the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee in any way, and it should be part of the Armed Services' \nconsideration. There was an Armed Services bill brought before us \nbefore. It would have been perfectly proper to have that brought up at \nthat time in connection with the Armed Services' bill. But I do not \nthink it is proper to bring it up in this bill.\n  For that reason, as I said before, when the time for Senator Byrd has \nexpired, I intend to move to table the amendment. But, as I indicated \nto him, I offer him the full amount of time that was allocated to this \nside to present his statement, plus what is left to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Could I ask for clarification of the time remaining to \nboth sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has 4\\1/2\\ minutes. \nThe Senator from Alaska, 32 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum, the time to be \ncharged to our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is my understanding the Senator from Illinois will \nuse the remainder of his time. I understand it is 4 and some-odd \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four-and-a-half minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is my understanding Senator Byrd, to my great regret, \nis not going to make his statement. Under the circumstances, I yield \nback the remainder of our time and ask that the time of the Senator \nfrom Illinois start at 4\\1/2\\ minutes before 8 o'clock, and we will \nvote at 8 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I just conferred with Mr. Cortese, the \nstaff director. I am told that we have but one other Senator who has \nindicated an intention to debate an amendment tonight. We are working \nnow on the remainder of the second managers' package which we should be \nable to present to the Senate in about 10 to 15 minutes. I ask the \ncloakrooms to send out notice to Senators that after presentation of \nthat second managers' amendment, I shall move to go to third reading, \nunless Senators who have amendments on this list come forth to debate \nthem.\n  We have a very serious situation tomorrow morning. Many Senators told \nme they want to go to the second funeral of our deceased friend, the \nofficer who was killed in the line of duty. That means we cannot \ncommence voting until 1 o'clock.\n  We have accepted a great many of these amendments and are prepared to \naccept them. If Senators want to know whether that is the case, I urge \nthem to come and review the managers' package.\n  I will not indicate the name of the Senator who we think wants to \ndebate the amendment, because he may not want to debate it. If no one \ncomes after the motion to table the Durbin amendment to present an \namendment, I shall move to go to third reading. It is a debatable \nmotion, and we may have some debate on that. I recall my good friend \nfrom West Virginia taught me how to do that, Mr. President. So we are \ngoing to proceed along that line. I ask my friend from Hawaii if he \nknows of any amendments or any matter to take up at this time.\n  Mr. INOUYE. No, we are prepared to go to third reading.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The managers of the bill are prepared to go to third \nreading, unless a Senator appears to debate an amendment. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum and ask that it extend only until 5 minutes of the \nhour of 8 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3465\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, since there is no \none seeking to speak, to speak for 7 minutes in support of the Durbin \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Under the \nprevious order, debate will end at 5 of the hour.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am asking only to go until 10 of the \nhour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I am going to support the Durbin amendment, and I \nadmire what he is attempting to do and respect his effort. I am not, \nquite frankly, certain it will have its intended effect.\n  I strongly agree with the views expressed by my friend from Illinois, \nthat what I call the ``monarchist'' view of the war power has become \nthe prevalent view at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, and it does \nnot matter whether it is a Democratic President or a Republican \nPresident. And the original framework of the war power clause \nenvisioned by the Founding Fathers, I think, has been greatly \nundermined over the last several decades.\n  On the question of war power, I believe the Constitution is as clear \nas it is plain. Article I, section 8, provides that the Congress has \nthe power ``to declare War, [and] grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal \n. . . .'' Article II, section 2, provides, ``The President shall be \nCommander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States.''\n  To be sure, the Commander in Chief ensures that the President has the \nsole power to direct U.S. military forces in combat. But that power--\nexcept in very few limited instances--derives totally from \ncongressional authority. It is not the power to move from a state of \npeace to a state of war. It is a power, once the state of war is in \nplay, to command the forces, but not to change the state.\n  Until that authority is granted, the President has no inherent power \nto send forces to war--except, as I said, in certain very limited \ncircumstances, such as to repel sudden attacks or to protect the safety \nand security of Americans abroad.\n  On this point, the writings of Alexander Hamilton, a very strong \ndefender, as the Presiding Officer knows, of Presidential power, is \nvery instructive. In Federalist No. 69, Hamilton emphasized that the \nPresident's power as Commander in Chief would be ``much inferior'' to \nthat of the British King, amounting to ``nothing more than the supreme \ncommand and direction of the military and naval forces.''\n  During the cold war, and during the nuclear age, the thesis arose \nthat, at a time when the fate of the planet itself appeared to rest on \ntwo men thousands of miles apart, Congress had little choice, or so it \nwas claimed, but to cede tremendous authority to the Executive.\n  Unfortunately, despite the end of the cold war, the view that the \nPresident had this authority has continued to survive--and flourish--\nunder Presidents of both political parties.\n  On the eve of the gulf war, President Bush insisted that he did not \nneed congressional authorization to send half a million men and women \ninto combat with Iraq. I insisted at that time we hold hearings on that \nsubject and there be a resolution concluding whether or not he had that \npower.\n  More recently, President Clinton asserted sweeping theories about his \npower to deploy forces to Haiti and to begin offensive military action \nagainst Iraq.\n  I believe we need to remedy this constitutional imbalance. \nAccordingly, I have offered in the past, and I have drafted, \ncomprehensive legislation called the Use of Force Act, which is \ndesigned to replace the War Powers Resolution.\n  The Durbin amendment is far shorter and more direct in its approach. \nAnd although I support it, as I said, I am skeptical that it will \nachieve its total desired effect. The Durbin amendment would bar the \nuse of appropriated funds for ``offensive military operations'' by\n\n[[Page S9391]]\n\nArmed Forces ``except in accordance with Article I, section 8 of the \nConstitution.''\n  I believe the Constitution already says that, that we need not \nredeclare that. But I think it is valuable to do it if it sends a \nmessage that we are going to be looking a whole lot closer.\n  In my view, the President may not use force, except in certain \nlimited circumstances, without the authorization of the Congress, \nperiod. The war power is not limited to a formal declaration of war--of \nwhich we have had only five in our history. The Founding Fathers had \nlittle interest, it seems, in the ceremonial aspects of war. The real \nissue was congressional authorization of war.\n  As Hamilton noted in Federalist 25, the ``ceremony of a formal \ndenunciation of war has of late fallen into disuse.'' Obviously, the \nfounders were not talking about a circumstance where the only \ncircumstance that the Congress could impact on whether we use force or \nnot is with a formal declaration of war. Even in 1789--to quote \nHamilton--ceremonial declarations of war had fallen into disuse, so \nobviously that is not what they were talking about alone.\n  The conclusion that Congress has the power to authorize all uses of \nforce is buttressed by the inclusion in the war clause of the power to \ngrant letters of marque and reprisal. An anachronism today, I \nacknowledge, letters of marque and reprisal were, though, in the 18th \ncentury, their version of limited war. Even back then, for a President \nto engage in limited war, he needed the authorization of the U.S. \nCongress. The vehicle was issuing letters of marque and reprisal.\n  I understand that the administration has expressed its strong \nopposition to this provision and is threatening to veto it. I have \ncalled the administration and indicated they are being foolish in even \nmaking that threat, with all due respect. It is merely an institutional \ninstinct that does not surprise me, but I am somewhat surprised by the \nvolume of the objection.\n  The Durbin amendment, if enacted, may have one salutary effect: It \ncould force the President and his advisors to pause before continuing \nto make broad assertions of Presidential war power.\n  If even that result is achieved, the enactment of the Durbin \namendment will be a positive development in restoring the \nconstitutional imbalance.\n  Mr. President, I will not take the time now, but I will, at the \nappropriate time, reintroduce the Use of Force Act that I have in \npreviously attempted to have passed, working with a number of \nconstitutional scholars who have written extensively in this area.\n  Let me conclude in the 30 seconds I have left to again compliment the \nSenator from Illinois. It is time the Congress, with the changed world, \nreassert its rightful role in the conduct of the use of force, and, now \nthat the world has changed, the old saw about the need for this \nemergency power--the Congress being less relevant in that regard--\nshould be put to bed once and for all.\n  I thank him for his effort and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I know that the Senator from Illinois \nstill has 5 and a half minutes. But I ask unanimous consent that it be \nin order for me to put down the first of the series of the second \nmanagers' package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3466\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Air National Guard to provide support for \n    Coast Guard seasonal search and rescue operations at Francis S. \n                  Gabreski Airport, Hampton, New York)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. So I send to the desk an amendment I offer on behalf of \nthe Senator from New York, Mr. D'Amato.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       On page 99, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8014. (a) The Air National Guard shall, during the \n     period beginning on April 15, 1999, and ending on October 15, \n     1999, provide support at the Francis S. Gabreski Airport, \n     Hampton, New York, for seasonal search and rescue mission \n     requirements of the Coast Guard in the vicinity of Hampton, \n     New York.\n       (b) The support provided under subsection (a) shall include \n     access to and use of appropriate facilities at Francis S. \n     Gabreski Airport, including runways, hangars, the operations \n     center, and aircraft berthing and maintenance spaces.\n       (c)(1) The adjutant general of the National Guard of the \n     State of New York and the Commandant of the Coast Guard shall \n     enter into a memorandum of understanding regarding the \n     support to be provided under subsection (a).\n       (2) Not later than December 1, 1998, the adjutant general \n     and the Commandant shall jointly submit to the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the House of Representatives a copy of the \n     memorandum of understanding entered into under paragraph (1).\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this \namendment be set aside to be considered along with the other managers' \npackage at the conclusion of the vote. And I ask unanimous consent that \nthat shall be at 8 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3392, As Modified\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there is a technical correction to \namendment No. 3392. It was earlier adopted. Its citation needs to be \ncorrected. I ask unanimous consent that it be corrected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3392), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 99, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n       Sec. __ For an additional amount for ``Overseas Contingency \n     Operations Transfer Fund,'' $1,858,600,000: Provided, That \n     the Secretary of Defense may transfer these funds only to \n     military personnel accounts, operation and maintenance \n     accounts, procurement accounts, the defense health program \n     appropriations and working capital funds: Provided further, \n     That the funds transferred shall be merged with and shall be \n     available for the same purposes and for the same time period, \n     as the appropriation to which transferred: Provided further, \n     That the transfer authority provided in this paragraph is in \n     addition to any other transfer authority available to the \n     Department of Defense: Provided further, That such amount is \n     designated by Congress as an emergency requirement pursuant \n     to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, at this time the Senator from Illinois is \nleft. I say to my good friend, be my guest for the extra 1\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3465\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for his \ngenerosity. I will conclude at 8 o'clock, as we promised, and ask for a \nvote on this. Allow me to try to describe what is at stake, because for \neverybody in the gallery and those listening to the debate, this could \nhit home some day. It is a question about when or if the United States \nshould ever go to war, who will make the decision. If you were called \non, or one of your children was, who will decide whether or not that \nperson will stand in harm's way, risk their lives for their country?\n  I have the deepest respect and admiration for those who serve in the \narmed services. They have given up their lives to protect this Nation \nand we owe them a great debt of gratitude. What we are talking about is \nhow this decision is made. The men who wrote this Constitution \nunderstood very clearly that if they were going to have a voice in the \nprocess, they would have to rely on the Senators and Members of \nCongress to make that decision on the declaration of war.\n  This amendment is very brief. By Senate standards, it is amazingly \nbrief--just a few lines. But it states very clearly what I think is an \nimportant constitutional concept. First, the President of the United \nStates as Commander in Chief of all of our Armed Forces still retains \nall of his power and authority to defend the United States and its \ncitizens. He does not have to come to Congress on bended knee and beg \nfor that authority. It is his; he is Commander in Chief. But when he \ncrosses that line and no longer is defending us, but rather is pushing \nforward in an offensive capacity, saying that we are now going to \ninvade a nation, we are now going to try to secure a certain objective \nor target, beyond a defensive objective, then the Constitution is \nclear: That is not his decision to make; it is our decision to make. \nBetter yet, it is your decision to make--to speak to your elected \nRepresentatives in the House and Senate and to express your heartfelt \nfeelings.\n  I can recall the debate over the Persian Gulf war. There was quite a \ndivision within the military, and even\n\n[[Page S9392]]\n\nwithin Congress. But I don't think there was a finer moment in the 16 \nyears I have served on Capitol Hill than that period of time when each \nMember of the U.S. Senate and the House came to the floor and took all \nthe time necessary to speak their hearts about whether or not we should \nput our children in harm's way to stop this aggression by Saddam \nHussein.\n  I can speak for myself--and I am sure for many colleagues, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike--there were sleepless nights when you \nknew that a vote to go forward and commit our troops in an offensive \ncapacity was going to lead to the loss of life. It was a painful \ndecision, but it is one that I accepted, and everybody as a Member of \nthe House and Senate accepted as well.\n  I say to my colleagues in the U.S. Senate, who I hope are following \nthis debate, that this is about whether or not the oath of office that \nwe took is meaningful. When we swore to uphold the Constitution of the \nUnited States, I don't believe they asked us to turn to Article I, \nsection 8 and make an amendment to take it out. No, it was included. It \nwas part of that responsibility--an awesome responsibility.\n  My friend, the Senator from Alaska, has raised a procedural point. He \nsays that this is beyond the scope of an appropriation or a spending \nbill. I disagree with his conclusion on that. I have seen what is \nconsidered authorizing language and much more expansive language easily \nadopted on the floor of the Senate and in the House time and time \nagain. So I hope that those who vote on the amendment will vote on it \non all fours, straightforward, up or down; do you agree or disagree? Do \nyou agree with our Constitution, which says this is our responsibility \nin Congress to declare war? Or are you prepared to accept the drift \nthat has gone on for half a century now, which says we will continue to \ngive more and more power to the President to make this decision?\n  If you should decide this is the President's province and we are \ngoing to cede all of our constitutional authority, mark my words, you \nshould think twice before you come to the floor of the Senate--or our \ncolleagues in the House--and question when the President uses this \nauthority, because if you are not prepared to say that we accept our \nresponsibility under the Constitution, that we will stand up and decide \nand vote when it comes to putting our troops in harm's way, then I \nthink you may have forsworn any opportunity to come to this floor and \nsecond-guess the President--a President who uses the power that we have \nhanded to him.\n  As I have said in previous moments in this debate, there is no sadder \nmoment than going home to your State or district and facing a casket, \ndraped with a flag, of a fallen soldier, sailor, airman or marine and \nthen facing that family. I believe that it is our constitutional \nresponsibility to be part of the decisionmaking that leads to military \naction. It will not be an easy task. It will be a tough burden, but it \nis exactly why we have stood for office and why we have asked to \nrepresent our States.\n  I hope my colleagues in the U.S. Senate will support this amendment. \nI believe this is straightforward and honest in its approach. I believe \nthat as you consider the possibilities just in the weeks ahead--perhaps \neven while we are gone over the August recess--that there may be an \neffort in the Bosnian region, in Kosovo or some other place, to assert \nand take offensive military action. Those who have voted against this \namendment tonight will not be able to say the President should have \ncalled on us first, because that is what this amendment says. This \namendment says anywhere in the world where the President wants to take \noffensive military action--not to defend the property and the persons \nof America, but offensive military action--he is bound by the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I believe my time has expired. I yield the remainder \nof my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask that the text of the amendment be \nplaced before both parties on the appropriate table.\n  I move to table the amendment of the Senator from Illinois and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Alaska to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from Illinois. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is absent because of illness.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``aye''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber who desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 84, nays 15, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 251 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--84\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchinson\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--15\n\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Sarbanes\n     Specter\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Helms\n       \n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 3465) was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to change a \nvote. On the last vote, I voted ``nay.'' I meant to vote ``yea.'' The \nvote will not affect the outcome.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nwithdraw the Kyl amendment No. 3398, with the consent of the sponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3398) was withdrawn.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 3466 through 3475, en bloc\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to announce that we have left \noutstanding one amendment of Senator Graham which I understand may be \ndisposed of by separate--two amendments of Senator Harkin, and we have \ntwo outstanding amendments on this side which I hope will be cleared \nsoon.\n  We have a package here ready to present. We have before the Senate--\nthe pending amendment I believe is Senator D'Amato's amendment on \nsearch and rescue. I add to that amendment the following amendments: \nthe Bingaman amendment on donation of surplus dental equipment; the \nBingaman amendment on furnishing of dental care to dependents; the Dodd \namendment on retired pay backlog; the Harkin amendment on backlog of \nmedals; the Harkin amendment on smoking cessation; the Frist amendment \non Marine Corps lightweight maintenance enclosures; the Dorgan \namendment on environmental cleanup; the DeWine amendment on drug \ninterdiction; the Wellstone amendment on family violence.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to consider the managers' \namendment en bloc and that the amendments be adopted en bloc and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid on the table.\n\n[[Page S9393]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am curious what the Dorgan amendment \nis--environmental. Would you briefly describe that?\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is $1.4 million for a site in North Dakota as a \npermissive amendment for cleanup. It has been cleared on both sides, I \nmight say to the Senator.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Not totally.\n  Mr. STEVENS. What?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Not totally cleared on both sides.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is a permissive amendment. It does not mandate. It \nauthorizes. It provides the money if they want to do it.

Mr. President, I appreciate having the opportunity to \noffer this amendment which I hope will be accepted by both floor \nmanagers on this important Defense bill.\n  Mr. President, the amendment that I am offering today would provide \n$5,000,000 for the Marine Corps within the Operation and Maintenance, \nMarine Corps account, and $2,000,000 within the Other Procurement, Army \nac-\n\n\n[[Page S9394]]\n\ncount for the Army to allow both Service branches to obtain lightweight \nmaintenance enclosures or LMEs for deployment in forward maintenance \noperations in the field. More specifically, these funds will provide \nour soldiers and Marines the capability to forward-deploy lightweight, \nlow cost shelter systems that are easy to operate, provide protection \nfor field maintenance operations in difficult environments, and at a \ncost that is one-quarter the cost of the older model units previously \nutilized by the Army and Marine Corps.\n  The House of Representatives recognized the requirement for these \nLightweight Maintenance Enclosures by authorizing the identical level \nof funding that I am recommending in my amendment, in the House version \nof the National Defense Authorization bill for fiscal year 1999 (H.R. \n3616). In the House Committee report (H. Rept. 105-532), the House \nNational Security Committee stated that the Army identified its \nrequirement for the LMEs after the President's budget request was \nsubmitted to the Congress, and therefore authorized funding for LMEs in \nthe House authorization bill. The House also approved a $5,000,000 \nauthorization for the Marine Corps to meet their requirements for LMEs \nas well.\n  Furthermore, Mr. President, the Chief of Staff of the Army, General \nDennis Reimer, identified ``Soldier Life Support'' equipment, including \nLMEs, as being among the Army's top 10 highest unfunded priorities.\n  Unfortunately, despite the authorization in place in the House-passed \nDefense authorization bill, no appropriations have been provided in \neither the House or Senate versions of the Defense appropriations \nbills. Therefore, it is my hope that the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska, Senator Stevens, and his outstanding Ranking Member, Senator \nInouye, would be willing to accept this small amendment and take it to \nconference with the House. Let me quickly say that I would be pleased \nto work with the two managers of the bill to find appropriate offsets \nto accommodate this small but important amendment as we head toward \nconference following final disposition of this bill.\n  Finally, we are working vigorously with our counterparts in the \nHouse, including Representative Van Hilleary of Tennessee, and Members \nof the Virginia delegation, including Representative Rick Boucher, to \nhold the LME authorization levels in conference with the Senate and to, \nhopefully, pave the way for acceptance of this pending amendment in \nconference on the Defense appropriations bill.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I would hope that the Senate would approve \nthis amendment today. The funding that I am seeking meets a real \nsoldier life support requirement for both the Army and the Marines. It \nwill allow our soldiers and Marines to have a cost-effective, \nlightweight, forward-deployed maintenance shelter system that is easy \nto operate, durable and significantly less expensive than the current, \nolder, less effective shelters and tents that we currently use in the \nfield. For these reasons, I would ask that the Senate approve this \nmodest amendment today.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3473\n\n (Purpose: To require the abatement of hazardous substances at Finley \n                Air Force Station, Finley, North Dakota)\n\n       On page 10, line 15, before the period, insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, that out of the funds \n     available under this heading, $300,000 may be available for \n     the abatement of hazardous substances in housing at the \n     Finely Air Force Station, Finely, North Dakota''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3474\n\n      (Purpose: To provide additional resources for enhanced drug \n        interdiction efforts in the Caribbean and South America)\n\n       On page 99, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8104: Of the funds available for Drug Interdiction, up \n     to $8,500,000 may be made available to support restoration of \n     enhanced counter-narcotics operations around the island of \n     Hispaniola, for operation and maintenance for establishment \n     of ground-based radar coverage at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, \n     Cuba, for procurement of 2 Schweizer observation/spray \n     aircraft, and for upgrades for 3 UH-IH helicopter for \n     Colombia.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3475\n\n(Purpose: To provide for enhanced protections of the confidentiality of \n  records of family advocacy services and other professional support \nservices relating to incidents of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, and \n                           intrafamily abuse)\n\n       On page 99, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8104.

Mr. President, may I inquire of the Senator from \nFlorida, Mr. Graham--is he here?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. May we please have order in the Chamber.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is Mr. Harkin here?\n  Mr. President, I am in error on the Leahy amendment on JSAT. That is \nstill on the list. It has not been removed.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3476\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Senator Robb now has a sense of the \nSenate with regard to the Italy incident, which we are prepared to \ntake. I yield to the Senator to present and explain his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, this amendment has been converted to a sense \nof the Senate. It simply recognizes an obligation of the United States \nto compensate the victims of the Marine Corps jet incident involving a \njet aircraft flying out of Aviano. At this point, the Ambassador of the \nUnited States to Italy has already agreed that, under the Status of \nForces Agreement, that the United States\n\n[[Page S9395]]\n\nwould pick up the 25 percent normally assigned to the host nation. We \nwere going to try to present an arrangement where this could be worked \nout more expeditiously. At this point it is simply a sense of the \nSenate. Instead, it ought to be resolved as quickly and fairly as \npossible.\n  Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Robb] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3476.\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Findings:\n       On the third of February a United States Marine Corps jet \n     aircraft, flying a low-level training mission out of Aviano, \n     Italy, flew below its prescribed altitude and severed the \n     cables supporting a gondola at the Italian ski resort near \n     Cavalese, resulting in the death of twenty civilians;\n       the crew of the aircraft, facing criminal charges, is \n     entitled to a speedy trial and is being provided that and all \n     the other protections and advantages of the U.S. system of \n     justice;\n       the United States, to maintain its credibility and honor \n     amongst its allies and all nations of the world, should make \n     prompt reparations for an accident clearly caused by a United \n     States military aircraft;\n       a high-level delegation, including the U.S. Ambassador to \n     Italy, recently visited Cavalese and, as a result, 20 million \n     dollars was promised to the people in Cavalese for their \n     property damage and business losses;\n       without our prompt action, these families continue to \n     suffer financial agonies, our credibility in the European \n     community continues to suffer, and our own citizens remain \n     puzzled and angered by our lack of accountability;\n       under the current arrangement we have with Italy in the \n     context of our Status of Force Agreement (SOFA), civil claims \n     arising from the accident at Cavalese must be brought against \n     the Government of Italy, in accordance with the laws and \n     regulations of ltaly, as if the armed forces of Italy had \n     been responsible for the accident;\n       under Italian law, every claimant for property damage, \n     personal injury or wrongful death must file initially an \n     administrative claim for damages with the Ministry of Defense \n     in Rome which is expected to take 12-18 months, and, if the \n     Ministry's offer in settlement is not acceptable, which it is \n     not likely to be, the claimant must thereafter resort to the \n     Italian court system, where civil cases for wrongful death \n     are reported to take up to ten years to resolve;\n       while under the SOFA process, the United States--as the \n     ``sending state''--will be responsible for 75 percent of any \n     damages awarded, and the Government of Italy--as the \n     ``receiving state''--will be responsible for 25 percent, the \n     United States has agreed to pay all damages awarded in this \n     case;\n       It is the Sense of the Congress that the United States \n     should resolve the claims of the victims of the February 8, \n     1998 U.S. Marine Corps aircraft incident in Cavalese, Italy \n     as quickly and fairly as possible.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have agreed to take this amendment. It \nis now a sense-of-the-Senate amendment and requires a report concerning \nthe Italy incident.\n  I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3476) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3477\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Senator Leahy's amendment on JSAT, has he sent the \namendment to the desk?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3477.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . TRAINING AND OTHER PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--None of the funds made available by this \n     Act may be used to support any training program involving a \n     unit of the security forces of a foreign country if the \n     Secretary of Defense has received credible information from \n     the Department of State that a member of such unit has \n     committed a gross violation of human rights, unless all \n     necessary corrective steps have been taken.\n       (b) Monitoring.--Not more than 90 days after enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of State, shall establish procedures to ensure that \n     prior to a decision to conduct any training program referred \n     to in paragraph (a), full consideration is given to all \n     information available to the Department of State relating to \n     human rights violations by foreign security forces.\n       (c) Waiver.--The Secretary of Defense, after consultation \n     with the Secretary of State, may waive the prohibition in \n     paragraph (a) if he determines that such waiver is required \n     by extraordinary circumstances.\n       (d) Report.--Not more than 15 days after the exercise of \n     any waiver under paragraph (c), the Secretary of Defense \n     shall submit a report to the congressional defense committees \n     describing the extraordinary circumstances, the purpose and \n     duration of the training program, the United States forces \n     and the foreign security forces involved in the training \n     program, and the information relating to human rights \n     violations that necessitates the waiver.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask the Senator's indulgence. We have \nto finally clear this amendment. There is some confusion, I might say \nto my friend from Vermont, because our indication was that there was a \nposition from the Department which opposed the amendment. The Senator's \ninformation is the Department supports the amendment. We intend to take \nit to conference and confer with the Department and then confer with \nthe Senator with regard to the final disposition of it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Alaska is correct. This is a Xerox copy, \nbut I do have the actual signoff from DOD on the amendment, which I \nwill give to the distinguished chairman.\n  Mr. President, I note this was primarily a clarification so the \nDepartment of Defense and Department of State could be saying the same \nthing in this area. I understand the Senator from Alaska and the \nSenator from Hawaii may want to discuss it further between now and \nconference. I will be a conferee on that, and will be happy to do so.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3477) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if the chairman will yield 2 minutes to the \nSenator from New Mexico?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reluctantly, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. When you hear my remarks, you will be pleased that you \ndid.\n  Mr. President, let me suggest the Appropriations Committee has come \nin right on the number, in terms of the budget. They have no directed \nspending or anything else that would seek to gimmick this budget. Some \nwere asking, ``Will you turn the other way and let us have some \ndirected spending that breaks the caps?'' I haven't been able to do \nthat for anyone, and I am very grateful we do not have to do it on this \nbill. The chairman of this committee came in, and everywhere he moved, \nhe said, ``Let's meet the budget right on the money.'' And he did. I \ncommend him for that.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support S. 2132, the Defense Appropriations \nbill for FY 1999. The pending bill provides $250.5 billion in total \nbudget authority and $168.2 billion in new outlays for the Department \nof Defense and related activities. When outlays from prior years and \nother adjustments are taken into account, outlays total $245.2 billion.\n  There are some major elements to this bill that are important for the \nSenate to review.\n  The bill is consistent with the Bipartisan Balanced Budget Agreement.\n  This year the defense budget is once again confronted with a serious \nmismatch between the DoD/OMB and the CBO estimates of the outlays \nneeded to execute the programs in the budget request. CBO's estimate \nwas $3.7 billion higher than OMB and DoD's estimate.\n\n[[Page S9396]]\n\n  Because the President's proposed defense spending was right up to the \ndiscretionary spending caps adopted in the Bipartisan Budget Agreement, \ncompensating for CBO scoring would require large reductions in \nmanpower, procurement, or readiness, or all three. Cuts like that are \nsimply not acceptable.\n  During the Senate's consideration of the congressional budget \nresolution in March, the Senate received an excellent suggestion from \nthe Chairman of the Appropriations Committee. We adopted a Stevens \nAmendment that called on CBO and OMB to resolve their differences. \nSeveral meetings occurred as a result, and under the auspices of the \nBudget Committee, we devised a solution. The solution has three parts:\n  First, Congress would legislate policies recommended by the \nAdministration to better manage cash in DoD's Working Capital Funds. \nThis would lower fiscal year 1999 outlays by $1.3 billion.\n  Second, Congress would agree to changes proposed by the \nAdministration in two classified accounts in the Air Force budget that \nwould lower 1999 outlays by $700 million.\n  Third, Congress would enact asset sales amounting to $730 million.\n  The Chairman of the Appropriations Committee has assured me that \ntaken together these actions help reduce the 1999 outlay shortage to \nmanageable dimensions and help avoid the negative effect on readiness \nor modernization that was feared.\n  I strongly support this bill, and I urge its adoption. I want to \ncompliment the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee on his very \nskillful handling of this important legislation and for his \nstatesmanlike approach to some serious and troubling issues in this \nyear's defense budget.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Senate Budget Committee \ntable displaying the budget impact of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                S. 2132, DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS, 1999: SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                                   [Fiscal year 1999, in millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   Defense     Nondefense     Crime      Mandatory      Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n    Budget authority...........................      250,289           27  ...........          202      250,518\n    Outlays....................................      244,942           27  ...........          202      245,171\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority...........................      250,290           27  ...........          202      250,519\n    Outlays....................................      244,942           27  ...........          202      245,171\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority...........................      250,763           27  ...........          202      250,992\n    Outlays....................................      242,863           27  ...........          202      243,092\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget authority...........................  ...........  ...........  ...........  ...........  ...........\n    Outlays....................................  ...........  ...........  ...........  ...........  ...........\nSenate-reported bill compared to:\n    Senate 302(b) allocation:\n        Budget authority.......................           -1  ...........  ...........  ...........           -1\n        Outlays................................  ...........  ...........  ...........  ...........  ...........\n    President's request:\n        Budget authority.......................         -474  ...........  ...........  ...........         -474\n        Outlays................................        2,079  ...........  ...........  ...........        2,079\n    House-passed bill:\n        Budget authority.......................      250,289           27  ...........          202      250,518\n        Outlays................................      244,942           27  ...........          202      245,171\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

We do appreciate his constant watch over the budget and our \nspending of the money from the Treasury.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3409\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there still is pending the Hutchison \namendment, the sense of the Senate on Bosnia, am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. May I make a parliamentary inquiry? It is my \nunderstanding that is the only other amendment that is pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We still have four more beyond that to deal with. So I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum until we find out what is going to \nhappen with these three amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have a number of problems with the \namendment offered by the Senator from Texas that contains a series of \nfindings, expresses the sense of Congress, and requires the President \nto submit a report relating to the readiness of the United States Armed \nForces to execute the National Security Strategy.\n  I realize that the managers of the Defense Appropriations bill are up \nagainst a tight deadline to finish their bill and I want to cooperate \nwith them. But, I do want to note for the record a few points.\n  I believe a number of statements in the amendment are overdrawn and I \nbelieve that the sense of Congress section of the amendment, \nparticularly subparagraph (B), improperly singles out the Bosnia \noperation and badly overstates its impact on the units participating in \nand supporting that operation.\n  Nevertheless, I believe that it would be useful to the Congress to \nreceive a report from the President on the military readiness of the \nArmed Forces of the United States. Accordingly and despite the problems \nI have noted, I will not object to this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator has indicated he is prepared to not object \nto this amendment. There being no objection to the sense-of-the-Senate \namendment on Bosnia of the Senator from Texas, I ask it be laid before \nthe Senate for action. Is it the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the pending question.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the adoption of the sense-of-the-Senate \namendment of the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3409) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nCampbell be included as a cosponsor of amendment No. 3431 previously \nbeen adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Stewart \nHolmes, a fellow on Senator Cochran's staff, be granted the privilege \nof the floor during consideration of this defense appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nHutchison of Texas be added as a cosponsor to the Gramm amendment No. \n3463 on military voting rights.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S9397]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3394\n\n  (Purpose: To add $8,200,000 for procurement of M888, 60-millimeter, \n   high-explosive ammunition for the Marine Corps, and to offset the \nincrease by reducing the amount for Air force war reserve materials (PE \n                         13950) by $8,200,000)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3394 offered by \nSenator Santorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Santorum, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3394.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 26, line 8, increase the amount by $8,200,000.\n       On page 10, line 6, reduce the first amount by $8,200,000.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. INOUYE. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3394) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I seek recognition for the purpose of \nengaging the manager of the bill in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Thank you Mr. President. I rise to update the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Appropriations Defense Subcommittee on \nthe status of the CH-47 engine upgrade program, which the committee \nreduced by $27.3 million in its reported bill. The basis for the \nreduction was program delays.\n  The committee's action has called Army leadership attention to the \ndelays in getting the FY 1997 and 1998 funds on contract. This delay \nwas due in part to disruptions from relocating the contracting office \nfrom St. Louis to Huntsville and in part to unsuccessful, protracted \nefforts to use commercial pricing practices on the contract.\n  I understand that the strong support from the CINC's combined with \nthe Committee's recommendations made completion of these contracts a \nhigh priority. I am pleased to report that the FY97 kit production \ncontract was signed July 1 and that the FY97 engine conversion contract \nand the FY 1998 kit production contract was signed as of July 29. \nFurther, the full rate production contracts are scheduled to be signed \nearly in fiscal year 1999.\n  Fortunately, production of the engine conversion kits has been \nunderway on a letter contract since December 1997 with actual engine \nupgrades now underway and on schedule at the Greer, South Carolina \nplant to meet the initial delivery of upgraded engines in October 1998.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank my good friend from South Carolina for the \nupdate on action since the committee markup. The committee \nrecommendations were not meant to be pejorative but reflective of what \nwas likely to be a fact of life delay in the program.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the chairman for that assurance. I hasten to \nadd my support for the upgrade program, which is done in part at two \nseparate facilities in Greer, South Carolina.\n  While I voted for the bill in subcommittee and full committee, I \nstrongly urge the chairman to give careful consideration to restoring \nfull program funding in conference based on this new information. The \nupgrade program is just phasing out of its low rate initial production \nphase with the FY 1999 funds. Maintaining the production schedule is \ncritical to controlling costs and achieving efficiencies. The FY 1999 \nfunding in question starts full rate production for which all the \nnecessary Army approvals have been given.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I accept the Senator's point on timing of the committee \nmark. I point out that the House has reduced the program by $12.7 \nmillion for other reasons. I can assure the Senator that we will do our \nbest in conference if the contracts are signed in accordance with the \nschedule given to you.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank my good friend, the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             first program\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, as the Senate continues consideration of \nthe Fiscal Year (FY) 1999 Defense appropriations bill, I would like to \ntake a moment to express my concerns regarding the funding and \nadministration of the Air Force's Financial Information Resources \nSystem (FIRST) program. This is a controversial program for a number of \nreasons. First, legitimate questions have been raised about the \nnecessity of this program. It is my understanding that even though all \nthe military departments and agencies were to move toward a single \nsystem for program, budgeting and accounting (PBAS), the Air Force has \nnot moved in that direction.\n  The Air Force intends for the FIRST program to perform the functions \nintended for PBAS, which would make the program duplicative. This issue \nwas raised by the house National Security Committee, which zeroed out \nfunding for the FIRST program in its version of the Fiscal Year 1999 \nDefense Authorization Bill.\n  The House National Security Committee also noted in its Committee \nreport that the Air Force has chosen to utilize the Global Combat \nSupply System-Air Force (GCSS-AF) contract for the program, rather than \ncompetitively bid for the program. This decision raises both fiscal and \npolicy concerns because this would be work outside the scope of the \nGCSS-AF contract. The GCSS-AF contract was advertised and awarded for \n``base-level systems modernization.'' In contrast, the FIRST program \ninvolves a budget system modernization plan that would impact all Air \nForce functional levels: base level, wholesale level, major air \ncommand, and headquarters. Clearly, the FIRST program would exceed the \nscope of the GCSS-AF contract.\n  I should also point out that the Air Force's decision to utilize \nGCSS-AF for the FIRST program was made after the Air Force announced an \nopen competition, and after eighteen companies acted in good faith and \nsubmitted qualification applications for evaluation and screening. This \ncourse reversal, and the rational behind it has not been made clear to \nme or others that are concerned about this decision.\n  Mr. President, I also believe the Air Force's decision merits close \nreview because it's not clear to me that it would be wise for the Air \nForce to place a disproportionate amount of its systems modernization \nwork all in one contract.\n  Finally, the entire process raises policy concerns with respect to \norganizational planning within the Air Force. Currently, the \ndevelopment and execution of corporate information management systems \nfor combat support is, in my view, not conducted in a coordinated and \nintegrated fashion. In other words, the way the FIRST program is being \nadministered is a symptom of a much larger organizational issue that \ndeserves review by Congress and the Air Force.\n  In short, given all the issues that I have briefly described, I \nbelieve we should withhold going forward with the FIRST program until \nwe can sort these and any other related issues that others may have. In \nfact, I had intended to offer an amendment that would allow for the \nDefense Department to use these funds for drug interdiction programs, \nbut I have worked with the chairman and the ranking member to find \nother ways to help our drug interdiction strategy.\n  Mr. President, we cannot understate the importance of information \ntechnology programs to the future of our armed services. Thousands of \npeople at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and in the surrounding Miami \nValley area play a leading role in the development\n\n[[Page S9398]]\n\nof these programs. However, these programs have to be pursued with an \neye toward fiscal soundness and effective coordination with similar \nsystems defense-wide. I see the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee on the floor and I hope that he will take the \nissues and concerns I have raised into consideration as he proceeds to \nconference with the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Ohio for raising \nthese issues with respect to the FIRST program. I have listened closely \nto his remarks, and he certainly has offered food for thought. I will \ntake his comments into consideration as we move to conference, and look \nforward to working with him and others interested in this issue to find \nan appropriate solution.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee for his remarks, and I look forward to working \nwith him as well.\n\n\n  pulsed fast neutron analysis (PFNA) cargo inspection systems (cis) \n                    operational field demonstration\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I would like to engage the \ndistinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee in a \ncolloquy regarding the Senate's action on the Pulsed Fast Neutron \nAnalysis (PFNA) program. On behalf of the many Senators on both sides \nof the aisle who support this initiative, I wish to thank you for \nagreeing to include an amendment to the FY 1999 DoD Appropriations bill \nthat directs the Department of Defense (DoD) to immediately obligate \nall of the funds which Congress has mandated be used for a fair, and \nrigorous operational field demonstration of the PFNA system at a major \nU.S. border crossing or at a major U.S. port of entry.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The committee has previously supported the PFNA project \nby adding funds to permit this new technology to be developed and \ntested. Like you, I am dismayed that the Department has failed to make \navailable to PFNA the $3 million appropriated by Congress in FY 1998 \nand so far has demonstrated an unwillingness to carry out the PFNA test \nprogram according to congressional intent. It is the clear expectation \nof this Senator, and the Committee as a whole, that the Department will \nplace no further obstacles in the path of a meaningful PFNA field test \nprogram.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I thank the Senator from Alaska. Furthermore, I \nbelieve that the Defense Department should take whatever steps are \nnecessary to transfer full administrative and operational \nresponsibility for the PFNA program to the Office of National Drug \nControl Policy (ONDCP). It is my understanding that General Barry \nMcCaffrey, Director of ONDCP, is willing to serve as the Executive \nAgent for the program next year and then assume full management control \nas long as the funds already appropriated by Congress are used to \ncomplete the activities planned under the FY 98 program. I expect that \nthe Secretary of Defense and the Director of ONDCP will work together \nto ensure this transfer of authority and funding is carried out as \nexpeditiously as possible.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank my colleague. I agree with his understanding of \nthe situation and the Committee expects DoD to proceed with obligation \nof the fiscal year 1998 funds and with the transfer of future program \nresponsibility to ONDCP.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. In the light of the recent terrorist attacks on U.S. \nsoil, our Nation's growing problem with drug smuggling and even the \nproliferation for weapons of mass destruction, it would be a tragedy if \nwe did not take full advantage of the best technologies available to \nmeet these threats. PFNA has enjoyed extraordinary success in \nlaboratory tests, consistently detecting the presence of contraband in \nsealed containers well over 90 percent of the time and with false alarm \nrate near zero. No other technology, including X-ray, can come close to \nthis level of detection.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am aware of these results and believe that the U.S. \nCustoms Service is one government agency which should seriously \nconsider deploying PFNA should the field test program yield positive \nresults. The committee hopes that Customs Service will work closely \nwith ONDCP to provide whatever assistance is necessary to ensure a \ncomplete and honest evaluation of the technology.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. This would include space at a port of entry or border \ncrossing where a test might be conducted. Once this is done, I hope \nthat ONDCP and the Customs Service will provide the committee with a \nrecommendation on the strategy to guide the possible future \nacquisition, deployment, and support of neutron interrogation systems, \nincluding PFNA, at land border crossings and ports of entry around the \nnation. I believe a useful assessment would provide: (1) a range of \ndeployment options for the PFNA system; (2) a cost comparison between \nPFNA deployment options; and (3) an evaluation of how the employment of \nnew and existing contraband detection technologies might be optimized \nto meet changing threats to U.S. security.\n  I will consult with my colleague from Alaska and with the chairman of \nthe Senate Treasury, Postal Appropriations Subcommittee, on what \nresources might be available through that subcommittee to support a \ncontinuation of the PFNA test program and the possible procurement of \nmultiple systems in future years.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank my colleague from North Carolina for his \nthorough and careful review of this matter.\n\n\n                         shipbreaking provision\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would like to engage the chairman and \nranking member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee in a \ncolloquy.\n  The Department of Defense appropriations bill provides funds for a \nNavy ship disposal pilot program. I would like to clarify the Senate's \nintent in creating this pilot program.\n  I support the Navy's goal of disposing of these ships efficiently. \nHowever, by considering only short-term costs, the Navy has ignored the \nlong term costs of worker death and injury and environmental \ndegradation.\n  For example, during the scrapping of the Coral Sea in Baltimore, \nthere were many worker injuries and fires. We don't yet know the \nenvironmental damage caused by the improper disposal of asbestos. The \nship is still in the Baltimore harbor, and it will now cost millions of \ndollars for the Navy to dispose of the ship properly. American \ntaxpayers would have saved a lot if we had disposed of the ship \ncorrectly the first time.\n  To prevent these problems, does the distinguished ranking member \nagree that it is the Senate's intent to encourage the Secretary of the \nNavy to give significant weight to the technical qualifications and \npast performance of the contractor in complying with federal, state and \nlocal laws and regulations for environmental and worker protection?\n  In addition, do you agree that in making a best value determination \nin granting contracts, the Secretary should give a greater weight to \ntechnical and performance-related factors than to cost and price-\nrelated factors?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I agree that the Navy must give more consideration to \nensuring worker and environmental safety to prevent the problems we \nhave had in the past.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator.\n  In addition, does the distinguished chairman agree with me that this \npilot program will help the Navy to develop safer, more efficient \nmethods of disposing of unneeded vessels--and that this pilot program \nshould not be delayed?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I agree that this pilot program is in the best interest \nof the Navy and is not contingent on any other legislative action.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the chairman and ranking member for their \ncourtesy and assistance in this important matter.\n\n\n                    supplemental impact aid program\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE, Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Department \nof Defense's Supplemental Impact Aid Program. As chairman of the \nMilitary Personnel subcommittee of the authorization committee, I \nincluded $35 million in the FY99 Defense Authorization bill for this \nimportant program.\n  As many of my colleagues already know, supplemental Impact Aid \nfunding is focused specifically on school districts that are heavily \nimpacted by large numbers of military connected students or the effects \nof base realignment and closures. The DoD funds are in addition to \nfunds appropriated to\n\n[[Page S9399]]\n\nthe Department of Education for all federally impacted schools. The $35 \nmillion included in the FY99 Defense Authorization bill will be used to \nensure that military impacted schools can maintain the same standards \nas other, non-impacted, school districts. Without these funds, these \ndistricts, quite frankly, would be hard pressed to provide adequate \neducational opportunities.\n  Mr. President, I know many of my colleagues believe that education \nis, and should remain, a local and state issue. I wholeheartedly agree. \nIf there is any role for the Federal Government in funding education, \nhowever, impact aid is it. Without a Federal presence, these impacted \ndistricts would be able to provide for a quality education for their \nstudents. Because of the military presence in the districts we are \ndiscussing today, however, educational resources are severely strained. \nWe owe it to the families of the men and women who proudly serve our \ncountry, and the families who live near an installation, to provide \nadequate resources to offset the military presence.\n  Originally, it was my intention to offer an amendment today that, if \npassed, would have set aside $35 million in this appropriation bill for \nDoD supplemental impact aid. After consultation with Chairman Stevens, \nI will not offer the amendment. Instead, Chairman Stevens has assured \nme this matter will be addressed in conference. I would like to ask the \ndistinguished Chairman, if it is still his intention to do so?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the House passed FY99 Defense \nAppropriations bill contains $35 million for impact aid for school \ndistricts impacted by excessive students from nearby defense \ninstallations. I would like to assure my friend, the Senator from \nIdaho, that it is my intention to give fair consideration to the House \nposition regarding funding for impact aid during the conference to see \nif we can include these funds in the final conference report without \nnegatively impacting the important operations and maintenance accounts \nof the Department of Defense.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Alaska, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, for his \nconsideration of this important program, which is important to the good \ncitizens of Alaska. In addition, this program is equally important to \nthe people of Mountain Home, Idaho, home of the 366th Composite Wing.\n\n\n                             REPORT 105-200\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would like to direct a question to the \nmajority manager of the Defense Appropriations bill, the distinguished \nSenator from Alaska. I note that the Committee on Appropriations \ndirects the Department of Defense to make available, from existing \nfunds, up to $8,000,000 for a community retraining, reinvestment, and \nmanufacturing initiative to be conducted by an academic consortia with \nexisting programs in manufacturing and retraining. It is my \nunderstanding that the consortia referred to is the New Hampshire \nNetwork for Science, Technology and Communication, and further, that \nthe funds should be provided to that organization to create a state \nwide higher education network among small independent colleges to \nimprove and expand research and training opportunities in science, \ntechnology, and communication for undergraduate students and for \ncommunity, business, and K-12 schools. Am I correct, is that not the \nintent of the committee?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The distinguished Senator from New Hampshire is correct. \nThe committee intends that the funds be provided to the New Hampshire \nNetwork for Science, Technology and Communication to conduct the effort \ndescribed.\n\n\n            Advanced Materials Intelligent Processing Center\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a short \ncolloquy with the distinguished Chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, the senior Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens.\n  As I understand it, the committee included $5 million in the \nResearch, development, Test, and Evaluation Navy account of your Fiscal \nYear 1999 Department of Defense Appropriations bill for continued \nfunding of the Advanced Materials Intelligent Processing Center in \nEvanston, Illinois. I want to confirm that the intent of the committee \nwas to provide this additional $5 million to continue the activities of \nthe Center in affiliation with the Naval Air Warfare Center in \nLexington Park, Maryland, as well as other industrial and governmental \npartners. This continuation funding will allow the Center first to \ncomplete a state-of-the-art resin transfer molding system with all \nrequired equipment functionality, monitoring, and intelligent \nsupervisory control, and then to transfer it to the Center's industrial \nand governmental partners for prove out in a production environment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the senior Senator from Illinois for her \ninterest in this matter. I would like to confirm that the intent of our \ncommittee's action was as she stated.\n  Mr. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Senator from Alaska for his \nclarification on this important matter, and for his leadership with \nSenator Inouye of the Committee. I would also like to say to my \ncolleagues that I am confident the work of the Center can help reduce \nthe cost of our defense systems through the use of faster, cheaper, and \nbetter means of processing composite materials for military hardware. \nThese improvements will provide substantial dividends to the American \npeople.\n\n\n        Anti-Corrosion Research At North Dakota State University\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank the \nManagers of this bill, Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye, for the fine \njob they have done on this important legislation. It has been my great \npleasure to work with the Managers as a member of the Defense \nSubcommittee, and they do a masterful job of balancing many competing \nneeds and interests in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I would like to call the Chairman's attention to one \nkey provision in the committee report. In the Defense-Wide Research, \nDevelopment, Test, and Evaluation section, the committee has included \nreport language regarding the importance of anti-corrosion technologies \nto the Department of Defense. As the report says ``New anti-corrosion \ntechnologies are needed to prevent corrosion, reduce corrosion-related \ncosts, and extend the life of aircraft in a manner compatible with \nenvironmental concerns.''\n  North Dakota State University has a long history of excellence and \nnationally-recognized expertise in polymers and coatings, and has \nreceived significant competitively-awarded funding to investigate new \nmethods of fighting corrosion. Last year DoD awarded a $2 million \ncompetitive grant to NDSU for this purpose. Mr. President, given NDSU's \nexpertise in this area and DoD's experience working with NDSU, does the \nChairman believe NDSU would be well-qualified to compete for this work?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Dorgan's comments. \nThe Air Force in particular is confronted with severe coatings problems \nin maintenance of its aging aircraft fleet. To protect the country's \ninvestment in these aircraft, it is important that the committee \nprovide for increased research on anti-corrosive coatings. I agree with \nthe Senator that NDSU would be a solid candidate for these anti-\ncorrosion research funds.\n\n\n                       electronic combat testing\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee in a colloquy regarding \nthreat emitters used to support electronic combat training by the Air \nForce Special Operations Command as well as testing by the Air Force \nand other services. These emitters replicate the surface-to-air missile \nthreats and jammers which our combat aircraft might encounter if \ndeployed to execute a real mission--a mission which would take them \ninto harm's way. It is essential that these systems be available to \ntrain our first to fight, the special operations forces.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to agree and emphasize the \nremarks of my colleague. Unfortunately, there has been a debate over \nthe status of these emitters which are presently at Eglin Air Force \nBase. Some believe the Base Closure and Realignment process mandated \nthe relocation of these emitters. However, the BRAC also insisted that \ntraining requirements must be met. I believe these\n\n[[Page S9400]]\n\nemitters should remain at Eglin to meet the warfighters training \nrequirements until we can resolve this dispute. I believe this would be \nconsistent with the BRAC direction.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, my colleague is correct. We cannot let \nambiguity about words hinder the training and readiness of our forces. \nThese emitters should be supported at Eglin until we can resolve these \nissues. I would ask the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee if he can assist us by working on this issue \nin the appropriations conference if we can find a solution. We will \nwork with the Department of Defense as well as the defense authorizing \ncommittees to find a solution which can be accommodated in the defense \nappropriations conference.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I agree with my colleague from Florida. I have followed \nthis difficult issue for some time. I firmly support the need for \nadequate training. And I believe that training can best be conducted in \nvarying environments, including the terrain and surrounds of Eglin Air \nForce Base. I assure my colleagues from Florida that I will do my best \nto work this issue with my House counterparts during conference.\n\n\n                  Project at Ellsworth Air Force Base\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, my colleague from South Dakota, Senator \nDaschle, and I would like to engage the distinguished Chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, and the distinguished \nRanking Member of the Subcommittee on Defense, Senator Inouye, in a \ncolloquy regarding a housing project at Ellsworth Air Force Base.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Senator Inouye and I are pleased to \ndiscuss this matter with our colleagues from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman and the Ranking \nMember for their indulgence. As both of you know, the Hunt Building \nCorporation (HBC) constructed an 828-unit military family housing \ncomplex, known as the Centennial Housing Project, at Ellsworth Air \nForce Base in 1990 and 1991. Unfortunately, within a year of the \ncompletion of construction, serious and often dangerous defects were \nfound in many of the units. It is my understanding that over half of \nthe units in the Centennial Housing Project constructed by HBC are \ncurrently uninhabitable.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, Senator Daschle is correct. In fact, the \nextensive damage in these units includes: severe racking due to the \nunit's design not holding up to wind; unlevel floors, sticking windows \nand doors, and cracking due to badly designed and constructed rim \njoists; collapse of interior ceilings caused by defective garage eaves, \nwhich allow heavy snow and rain to enter some attics; sewer gas back up \ndue to improperly vented plumbing; deck and porch supports and stairs \nthat have separated from the units and become unlevel because caissons \nsupporting these structures were not placed below the frost line; and \nother problems both with the work done and problems resulting from work \nrequired by the contract but never completed by the Corporation. \nDespite these serious problems, the Air Force continues to pay rent on \nthese units.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Senator Inouye and I are aware of these \nsevere problems.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Air Force \nand HBC agreed to enter into an alternative dispute resolution in an \nattempt to resolve the construction and liability issues associated \nwith the defective housing in the Centennial Housing Project at \nEllsworth.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. The two parties \nhave met with a mediator appointed by the Justice Department and have \nhad several subsequent meetings to continue negotiating an agreement. I \nhave been told that the next meeting between the Air Force and HBC will \nbe next week. Although some progress has been made, it is critically \nimportant that the negotiations between the Air Force and HBC result in \na timely, workable resolution that guarantees the expeditious repair of \nthe housing units and the return of military personnel to the homes. \nWhile it is my understanding that the Department of Justice has been \nlooking into this matter for some time and is considering litigation \nagainst HBC if no resolution can be found through the mediation \nprocess, I am hopeful that action by the Department of Justice can be \navoided.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I agree with the comments made by Senator \nJohnson. I, too, am hopeful that the mediation process will soon yield \nan agreement. Necessary repairs to these homes simply cannot be delayed \nany longer. I would also like to inform the Chairman and Ranking Member \nthat we brought this situation to the attention of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee earlier this year.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I appreciate this update on the situation \nat Ellsworth Air Force Base regarding the Centennial Housing Project.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to thank both the distinguished \nRanking Member, Senator Inouye, and the distinguished Chairman, Senator \nStevens, for your willingness to help Senator Daschle and me monitor \nthis situation, which is of critical importance to the quality of life \nat Ellsworth Air Force Base. We will keep you apprised of progress made \nthrough the negotiating process.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would also like to thank Senator \nStevens and Senator Inouye for their assistance. This matter is \nextremely important to me, Senator Johnson and everyone at Ellsworth \nAir Force Base.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Daschle. I share the \nconcern expressed by the two Senators from South Dakota that taxpayers \nare not getting their money's worth out of the Centennial Housing \nProject. You can be assured that I will assist you in your efforts to \nfind a timely solution to this matter that will result in the repair of \nthe housing units and the return of military personnel to the homes.\n\n\n   Encouraging Greater Use of Distance Learning by the Department of \n                                Defense\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for the \nmany distance learning initiatives contained in the Defense \nAppropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1999. Senators Inouye and Stevens \nhave done an outstanding job in encouraging the Department of Defense \nto take full advantage of the opportunities provided by great advances \nin telecommunications technology, particularly with respect to distance \nlearning.\n  This bill contains funding for distance learning programs for the \nMarine Corps, and a new initiative for the Army National Guard. In \nparticular, the National Guard initiative would create a distance \nlearning network to reduce the cost of training soldiers, enhance \nreadiness and furthering community development. The Subcommittee on \nDefense has a demonstrated its support for these and a number of other \ninitiatives underway.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from Georgia for his comments. The \nSubcommittee on Defense indeed supports these initiatives. Would the \nSenator from Hawaii agree?\n  Mr. INOUYE. That is correct. We have attempted to encourage such \ninitiatives wherever we could, and wherever such initiatives made \nsense.\n  Mr. CLELAND. As the Ranking Member of the Personnel Subcommittee of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee, I believe I can report that our \nSubcommittee is also very supportive of distance learning initiatives. \nWe are keenly aware of the advantages of distance learning. As you \nknow, Mr. President, many of our military personnel are expected to \navailable for deployment at a moments notice. Others are deployed \naround the world where they do not have ready access to educational \nopportunities. Rapid developments in technology have enabled them to \ncontinue in their educational development, even while deployed.\n  The ability to continue in one's educational pursuits is a quality of \nlife issue that is not necessarily always at the top of a soldier's \nlist. However, many military personnel are only able to pursue higher \neducation by leaving the military. I believe the maintenance of a \nviable distance learning program for higher education could be a useful \nretention mechanism to keep highly motivated individuals in the \nservice.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator would yield, the Senator raises an \ninteresting point. I would be interested in learning of some of the \ntypes of initiatives that are under way that may prove useful in \nretaining personnel in the military.\n\n[[Page S9401]]\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Senator. I am particularly proud of one such \nprogram which is managed by the Georgia College and State University. \nThe Distance Education Unit and the Department of Government there were \nrecently awarded a contract by the Navy to provide two graduate courses \naboard the USS Carl Vinson which is deployed in the Pacific Ocean. The \ncourses use two-way video and audio which links educators at the school \nwith students on board the Carl Vinson. We all knew that aircraft \ncarriers were small cities, but this Senator was pleasantly surprised \nto see that sailors could take graduate level courses while at sea.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I am aware of the Carl Vinson project. It is certainly a \npromising concept, but are we providing any educational opportunities \nfor service personnel nearing retirement or leaving the military due to \nthe draw down of the military?\n  Mr. CLELAND. That is a very good question. I am told that more than \n50 percent of military personnel reentering civilian life either change \nor lose their jobs in the first year after leaving the military. Given \nthis, I believe we should consider providing opportunities for job \ntraining and placement for active-duty service members nearing \nseparation or retirement from service without regard to their duty \nlocations.\n  Clayton College and State University has developed a program that \ncould serve as a worthwhile demonstration project to demonstrate how \ntechnology can be utilized to provide pre-separation training for \ncivilian jobs to military personnel. The program would provide training \nvia the Internet and other technology to active-duty personnel at their \nduty locations for specific, existing job opportunities which would be \navailable upon their separation from the military. The program would \nthen link these personnel to these specific jobs ensuring that when the \nleave the military, employment is available.\n  I am not immediately aware of any initiatives underway that would \noffer similar opportunities. It is my view that we should encourage the \nDepartment of Defense to explore such initiatives, perhaps in \nconjunction with the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I agree with the Senator from Georgia. He makes a good \npoint, and I hope the Department of Defense will take a look at such \ninitiatives in the future.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank Senator Cleland for his remarks. He is a good \nfriend of America's men and women in uniform.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank my colleagues for their leadership and for \nallowing me to speak on this matter.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to voice my opposition to the \nfiscal year 1999 Department of Defense appropriations bill.\n  Once again, we have loaded up this bill with unnecessary, \nextravagant, and flat-out wasteful items. In a time when we are cutting \nprograms and fighting for a true balanced budget, we cannot afford to \ninsulate any department from scrutiny as we seek to reduce the Federal \ndebt. Unfortunately, the DoD budget remains immune to any and all \nattempts at responsible spending.\n  Mr. President, I offered an amendment to this bill that aimed to \ninvest fully in the best bargain in the Defense Department. According \nto a National Guard study, the average cost to train and equip an \nactive duty soldier is $73,000 per year, while it costs $17,000 per \nyear to train and equip a National Guard soldier. The cost of \nmaintaining Army National Guard units is just 23 percent of the cost of \nmaintaining Active Army units.\n  It failed, however, but that should not come as a surprise. DoD and a \ncomplicit Congress have never been known as a frugal or practical when \nit comes to defense spending. From $436 hammers to $640 toilet seats to \n$2 billion bombers that don't work and the department doesn't seem to \nwant to use, we have a storied history of wasting our tax dollars. I \npresented an opportunity to spend defense dollars on something that \nworks and is worthwhile, but the lobby for the wasteful and unnecessary \nSuper Hornet prevailed.\n  Speaking of which, the bill appropriates $2.9 billion for the \nprocurement of 30 Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornets.\n  The current Hornet program has been proven reliable and cost-\neffective. Why do we want to replace the Hornet with a bloated, cost-\nprohibitive aircraft that offers marginal benefits over a reliable \nfighter?\n  This bill also contradicts the House's overwhelming recommendation on \nSuper Hornet procurement. Twice, once in their authorization bill and \nagain in their appropriations bill, the House, by margins of nearly 300 \nmembers, voted to procure 27 Super Hornets in fiscal year 1999.\n  The House correctly notes that the Navy asks for an inexplicable \nprocurement increase from fiscal year 1998; that the Navy's low rate \ninitial production schedule is not consistent with its procurement \nobjective of 548 aircraft; and that the wing drop problem has not been \nresolved.\n  Mr. President, it seems we have thrown rationality out the window \nwhen it comes to this plane. Judging by the Super Hornet's past \nperformance, I'm sure we'll be hearing more about it soon.\n  Finally, Mr. President, authors of the bill have again loaded it up \nwith projects and hundreds of millions of dollars the Pentagon didn't \neven ask for. Just to give my colleagues a taste of these extravagant \nmorsels, the bill adds: $78.5 million for 8 additional UH-60 \nhelicopters; $30.0 million for JAVELIN anti-tank missiles; $208.3 \nmillion for Marine Corps procurement priorities; $50 million for \nadvance procurement of the LHD-8 amphibious ship, which is a program \nDoD didn't even want to fund next year; $65.7 million for Humvee \nvehicles; $90 million for C-135 aircraft; and $40 million for F-15 \nEagles.\n  Further, there is $1.8 billion in additional funds for the deployment \nof U.S. troops in Bosnia that are designated as ``emergency'' funds. \nThe Bosnia mission is no longer an emergency. It is a long-term \ncommitment for the United States military, and we should pay for it on \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, this is shameful. We have a duty to act responsibly \nwith our constituents tax dollars. Instead of looking after our \nconstituents, we continue to pick their pockets.\n  We have to make smart choices, Mr. President. A truly balanced \nfederal budget is in sight for the first time in three decades. But we \nare not going to be able to maintain a balanced budget, let alone start \nbringing down the federal debt, so long as we continue to commit to \nprograms and force structures that are so blatantly unaffordable. We \nmust continue to fight for further spending reductions until we achieve \nthe most effective and cost efficient military which serves our \nnational security interests.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                        Prostate Cancer Research\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Department \nof Defense's research in prostate cancer. I know that this program has \nno greater champion than the distinguished Chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Stevens.\n  Throughout my time in Congress, I have fought for women's health \ninitiatives. Women's health is one of my highest priorities and it \nalways will be. However, I also strongly support efforts to improve the \nhealth of men. One such effort that I believe deserves our attention is \nprostate cancer research.\n  In my home state of Maryland alone, 3,500 men receive the ominous \ndiagnosis of prostate cancer each year. Nationwide, the number soars to \nover 200,000. Even more frightening, 42,000 American men lose their \nlives to this ruthless killer annually. This means that every 15 \nminutes, 1 man somewhere in our country dies from prostate cancer, and \nduring the same time span, 5 more men are newly diagnosed with the \ndisease.\n  I am very pleased that the frequency of prostate cancer screening has \nincreased over the past five years. These efforts have led to an \noverall decrease in the prostate cancer death rate. The importance of \nearly detection through regular screening cannot be overstated. When \nprostate cancer is detected early, survival rates are over 90%. But, \nwhen detected late, prostate cancer kills 70% of its victims. The \nincreased emphasis on the use of current screening techniques has \ncertainly been a step in the right direction. However, we can, and \nmust, do better for the men of our country. How? Through improvement\n\n[[Page S9402]]\n\nof diagnostic screening and imaging technology, we can make detection \nof prostate cancer easier and more efficient. We've done it before--\nmammograms have made screening for breast cancer a much more reliable \nprocess. We must do the same for prostate cancer.\n  Last year, Congress provided $40 million to the Department of Defense \nfor prostate cancer research. Overall, $130 million in government-\nfunded prostate cancer research was performed, compared with $650 \nmillion for breast cancer. Of course, we all recognize the importance \nof fighting breast cancer. It is a major threat to the women of our \nnation and the fight to find new and better prevention methods must \ncontinue. I think it is time we started fighting prostate cancer with \nthe same tenacity.\n  In this year's Defense Appropriations bill we have provided $40 \nmillion for prostate cancer research. In addition to funds for peer \nreview prostate cancer research, we have provided funding to the Walter \nReed Army Medical Center for research on prostate cancer diagnostic \nimaging. This research is extremely important, as it could pave the way \nto better, faster, and more reliable screening and diagnosis.\n  One in every ten American men will develop prostate cancer at some \npoint during his life. We need to target sufficient resources for \nresearch into the causes, treatment and cure of prostate cancer.\n  I hope that when the Defense Appropriations bill is in Conference, we \nwill increase funding for prostate cancer research. Increased funding \nis necessary to give our scientists and researchers the tools they need \nto combat this deadly disease.\n  We are blessed with great medical scientists who are scattered across \nour country at universities, medical schools, and government research \nagencies. They are an incredible resource. I believe that we owe it to \nourselves, to our children, and to the American people to ensure that \nthese great men and women have the support they need to continue their \nefforts to bring the people of our nation a better, healthier tomorrow.\n\n\n                             DOD Impact Aid\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to express \nmy concern about the lack of funding within the Senate's Department of \nDefense Appropriations bill for fiscal year 1999 for schools that have \nbeen heavily impacted by their proximity to military installations.\n  Fortunately, the House bill does include $35 million for this \npurpose, and I want to put my colleagues on notice that I will be \nworking through my position on the House-Senate conference committee to \nsee that this funding is preserved.\n  This extra assistance is needed by schools on or near our military \nbases because their tax base is eroded by the large amount of federal \nland taken off the tax rolls. In addition, military personnel often are \nnot required to pay local taxes, which support the schools, even if \nthey have children enrolled in those schools. The DOD funding would be \naimed at those schools most in need of the extra aid--school districts \nwhose student population is made up of at least 20 percent military \nchildren.\n  This funding is sufficiently important to the quality of life of \nmilitary personnel and their families that both the House and Senate \nfiscal year 1999 Defense Authorization bills authorize $35 million for \nthis purpose. It is my strong hope that the Congress will see fit to \ninclude this funding in the final version of the Defense Appropriations \nbill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, during the deliberations over the fiscal \nyear 1999 Defense Authorization bill, I offered an amendment to \nincrease spending for our nation's veterans medical needs. The \namendment, offered on June 25th and numbered as 2982 would have allowed \nthe transfer of $329 million from the defense budget to support the VA \nmedical budget. The amendment would have transferred funds so as to \navoid harming the readiness of the Armed Forces and the quality of life \nof military personnel and their families.\n  The amendment's description was incomplete as to the listing of \ncosponsors and I would like to correct the record at this time. Along \nwith Senator Wellstone of Minnesota, Senator Bingaman of New Mexico, \nalso a longtime champion of veterans, should have been included as a \ncosponsor.\n  Although the amendment did not receive the support of a majority of \nmy colleagues, I appreciate the cosponsorship by Senator Bingaman and \nSenator Wellstone. I also appreciate the support of the 35 other \nSenators who voted in favor of increasing VA medical funding.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I tell the Senate, there are now three \namendments that are not disposed of, to my knowledge: the Graham \namendment on space and two Harkin amendments. I call on those Senators \nto ask what they intend to do.\n  Mr. HARKIN. One amendment; I have one amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will be happy to eliminate one of the two.\n  Mr. President, again, I call on the Senators involved to inform us if \nthey going to proceed with the amendment.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senator from Florida \nis going to make a motion concerning the space amendment. I ask someone \nto inquire about that amendment.\n  May I inquire of the Senator from Iowa, does he intend to proceed \nwith his amendment?\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  adak naval facility at adak, alaska\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee knows, we have been working for some time with the Natives of \nthe Aleut Corporation, the Navy and the Department of the Interior on \nan effective plan for the reuse of Adak Naval Base, and I thank the \nChairman for the inclusion of funding to help resolve remaining \nenvironmental problems with the facilities at Adak.\n  The Aleut Corporation, one of Alaska's 12 Native regional \ncorporations, is the only entity that has expressed an interest in \nassuming the closed base, and has proposed a land exchange involving \nthe Navy and the Department of the Interior. The Senate Energy \ncommittee, as you know, is considering and has held a hearing on S. \n1488, which would authorize an exchange of property that would promote \nthe reuse of Adak and improve the Aleutian refuge through incorporation \nof Aleut Corporation inholdings. This legislation is designed to ratify \nan agreement that will very shortly be executed by the Aleut \nCorporation and the Departments of the Navy and the Interior.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am familiar with that legislation and fully support \nits adoption. In closing out its operations and responsibilities on \nAdak I understand the Navy wishes to transfer from Navy ownership as \nmuch as the base as possible; this includes both facilities that have \nforeseeable reuse and those that do not. Many of the moth-balled \nbuildings on Adak were constructed before restrictions were imposed on \nthe use of asbestos and lead paint. The environmental conditions at \nAdak, to which anyone who has visited there can attest, take a hard and \nquick toll on buildings and other facilities, especially those that are \nunused and not maintained. The Committee has included $15 million to \nresolve potential environmental hazards from deteriorating facilities. \nThis funding will help to protect those who move to Adak to participate \nin its economic revitalization.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. With the expectation that all the parties to the Adak \nexchange will sign an agreement within the next few weeks, it is also \nmy hope that the Conference Committee on S. 2312 would consider the \ninclusion of the language ratifying the agreement.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If all parties to the exchange are supportive, I would \nbe open to the possibility of having the Conference consider that \nlanguage.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the chairman, the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Alaska.\n\n\n      national advanced telecommunications and applications center\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy\n\n[[Page S9403]]\n\nwith the distinguished chairman of the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee. I was disappointed that the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee did not include funding for the National Advanced \nTelecommunications and Applications Center in the Research Triangle \nPark in North Carolina. I ask the chairman whether this is an \nindication that the subcommittee disapproves spending for this project \nor if it is merely because sufficient funds were unavailable?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from North Carolina will be pleased to know \nthat the subcommittee believes that this project is very worthy, but we \ndid not directly provide funding in FY 1999.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Therefore, may I assume that the chairman would \nsupport a reprogramming request from any branch of the Department of \nDefense if that branch found that unavoidable delays in its other \nprograms made funding available for the NATAC?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I thank the chairman. Mr. President, I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I understand the Senator from Iowa will ask to be \nrecognized, and I urge Members of the Senate to stay around. In my \nopinion, we are very close to final passage. We are very close to final \npassage. I expect final passage within 20 minutes. I might not get my \nexpectations, right?\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3478\n\n    (Purpose: Express sense of Senate regarding payroll tax relief)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send to the desk a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution on behalf of Senator Kerrey and Senator Moynihan and Senator \nBreaux, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mr. Kerrey, for \n     himself, Mr. Moynihan and Mr. Breaux, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3478.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING PAYROLL TAX RELIEF.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The payroll tax under the Federal Insurance \n     Contributions Act (FICA) is the biggest, most regressive tax \n     paid by working families.\n       (2) The payroll tax constitutes a 15.3 percent tax burden \n     on the wages and self-employment income of each American, \n     with 12.4 percent of the payroll tax used to pay social \n     security benefits to current beneficiaries and 2.9 percent \n     used to pay the medicare benefits of current beneficiaries.\n       (3) The amount of wages and self-employment income subject \n     to the social security portion of the payroll tax is capped \n     at $68,400. Therefore, the lower a family's income, the more \n     they pay in payroll tax as a percentage of income. The \n     Congressional Budget Office has estimated that for those \n     families who pay payroll taxes, 80 percent pay more in \n     payroll taxes than in income taxes.\n       (4) In 1996, the median household income was $35,492, and a \n     family earning that amount and taking standard deductions and \n     exemptions paid $2,719 in Federal income tax, but lost $5,430 \n     in income to the payroll tax.\n       (5) Ownership of wealth is essential for everyone to have a \n     shot at the American dream, but the payroll tax is the \n     principal burden to savings and wealth creation for working \n     families.\n       (6) Since 1983, the payroll tax has been higher than \n     necessary to pay current benefits.\n       (7) Since most of the payroll tax receipts are deposited in \n     the social security trust funds, which masks the real amount \n     of Government borrowing, those whom the payroll tax hits \n     hardest, working families, have shouldered a disproportionate \n     share of the Federal budget deficit reduction and, therefore, \n     a disproportionate share of the creation of the Federal \n     budget surplus.\n       (8) Over the next 10 years, the Federal Government will \n     generate a budget surplus of $1,550,000,000,000, and all but \n     $32,000,000,000 of that surplus will be generated by excess \n     payroll taxes.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) if Congress decides to provide tax relief, reducing the \n     burden of payroll taxes should be a top priority; and\n       (2) Congress and the President should work to reduce this \n     payroll tax burden on American families.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. I am delighted to be joined by Senators Moynihan and \nBreaux in offering this important Sense of the Senate on reducing the \npayroll tax burden. This Sense of the Senate is simple: the payroll tax \nis the biggest, most regressive tax that working families in this \ncountry face. According to the CBO, 80 percent of American families pay \nmore in payroll taxes than they do in income taxes.\n  Here's what that means. The average household income in 1996 was \n$35,492. That family, taking the standard deductions and exemptions, \npaid $2,719 in Federal income tax. But they paid a whopping $5,430 in \npayroll taxes--double what they paid in income taxes!\n  What this Sense of the Senate says is that if we talk about relieving \nthe tax burden on American's families, we ought to look first at the \npayroll tax burden. After all, of the over $1.5 trillon surplus we \nexpect to generate over the next ten years, all but $32 billion is \nbeing generated through payroll taxes. If anyone is going to get tax \nrelief in this country, it ought to be the working people responsible \nfor that surplus. I urge my colleagues to support this Sense of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, my colleague Senator Kerrey, with whom I \nam pleased to cosponsor this Sense of the Senate resolution, has it \nexactly right. The payroll tax is regressive. The statistic he quoted \nbears repeating. Among families that pay payroll taxes 80 percent pay \nmore in payroll taxes than in income taxes.\n  If--and I say if--we are going to have a tax cut look no further than \nthe payroll tax. Albert Hunt, writing in today's Wall Street Journal, \nagrees, noting that for most families it is ``the most onerous levy. . \n..''\n  Even excluding interest income, the Social Security Trust Funds will \ngenerate $698 billion of surpluses over the next 10 years. That is just \nabout enough to finance the 2 percentage point reduction in the payroll \ntax that Senator Kerrey and I have proposed in our comprehensive Social \nSecurity rescue plan.\n  In contrast, the operating budget will only have a $32 billion \nsurplus over the next 10 years--and no significant surplus until 2006.\n  Finally, maybe we shouldn't be considering any tax cuts. Those \nsurpluses can easily evaporate, even in the absence of a recession. \nGrowth of one percent for the next two or three years --rather than the \n2 percent projected by CBO--just about wipes out surpluses for the next \nseveral years.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor \nof the Sense of the Senate offered by Senator Kerrey and accepted \ntonight by unanimous consent regarding payroll tax relief.\n  We keep hearing the good news about surpluses but of the $1.55 \ntrillion surplus over the next decade, all but $32 billion comes from \nthe social security trust fund--from payroll taxes paid by working \nAmericans on their wages--taxes that American workers paid to insure \nthe viability of their Social Security benefits.\n  Of families who pay payroll taxes, 80 percent pay more in payroll \ntaxes than in income taxes. The payroll tax is the most regressive tax \nin America, disproportionately burdening low income families. Remember \nthat almost 50 percent of households in this country earn under $35,000 \nper year and most of this income is from wages which are subject to the \npayroll tax. Given these facts, the payroll tax cut is clearly the tax \ncut this Congress should be discussing.\n  And we should be discussing it along with the reforms necessary to \nfix Social Security for all Americans for all time. I know there are \nmany Senators\n\n[[Page S9404]]\n\nhere who share my sentiments. I served with Senator Gregg on a \nbipartisan commission that thorougly studied this issue and we have \nrecommended a comprehensive reform package. Senator Kerrey and Senator \nMoynihan have been working on a bill. Others in this bodies are also \nworking on social security reforms. I look forward to working with all \nof my colleagues in a bipartisan effort to not only reduce taxes but to \nshore up social security and create wealth for working Americans.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask for the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3478) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I state for the record, according to my \nunderstanding, the only amendment we have not disposed of that was \nlisted on the two lists is the amendment that Senator Harkin is about \nready to discuss.\n  Does any Senator have another amendment?\n  Mr. President--I repeat the request--does any Senator have another \namendment?\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my understanding the Senator from \nIowa will speak in a minute. And no Senator has raised any amendment to \nbe considered; so, therefore, I ask unanimous consent that no more \namendments be in order to this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I further ask unanimous consent that following the \nstatement of the Senator from Iowa, we shall immediately go to third \nreading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from New Jersey \nalso be recognized for 10 minutes prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk that \nbasically would equalize the treatment that the Budget Committee gave \nto the defense side of the ledger, would equalize that with the \nnondefense side of the ledger.\n  Now, let me try to explain it as best I can. A couple of years ago in \na situation involving Social Security here on the Senate floor, the \nParliamentarian of the Senate ruled in a way that gave the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee the authority to decide whether or not scoring \nwould be done under the CBO estimates and rules or under OMB.\n  This year, using that authority, the chairman of the Budget Committee \nsent a letter dated April 27, 1998, to the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Stevens. This letter, among other \nthings, basically said--and I will quote from the letter:\n\n       Staff have also identified $2.0 billion in potential policy \n     outlays scorekeeping adjustments. If the Administration's own \n     policy initiatives are legislated for the DWCF, I will \n     exercise my authority to score the legislation recognizing \n     the administration's outlay estimates.\n\n  What that means, in ``bureaucratese,'' is that the chairman of the \nBudget Committee decided to use his authority to use the \nadministration's policy initiatives--read that to be OMB--to adjust the \noutlay figures for the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  What did that add up to? We looked at it and those adjustments added \nup to $2.2 billion--$2.2 billion under OMB. Then the Budget Committee \nidentified another $737 million in asset sales to come up with $2.9 \nbillion additional for the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  But I am looking at the $2.2 billion. Forget about the other. The \n$2.2 billion came about because the chairman of the Budget Committee \ndecided to use the administration's own policy initiatives and use the \nadministration's outlay estimates from OMB. Mr. President, what that \nmeans is that the Budget Committee chairman has the authority because \nof a ruling by the Parliamentarian of this body that he can decide \nwhether to use OMB or CBO estimates for outlay purposes.\n  I think it is appropriate to ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a copy of the letter from the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, Senator Domenici, to Senator Stevens, dated April 27, 1998.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                      Committee on the Budget,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 27, 1998.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am reporting to you on your amendment \n     to S. Con. Res. 86, the Senate-passed Budget Resolution, \n     concerning defense and non-defense outlay scoring. Over the \n     recent recess, representatives of the Department of Defense \n     (DoD), the Office of Management and the Budget (OMB), and the \n     Congressional Budget Office (CBO) have met and discussed \n     these issues. As a result, we have identified from $2.6 \n     billion to $2.9 billion in outlay reductions based on asset \n     sales and proposed policy changes in the President's 1999 DoD \n     budget request, including: (1) management initiatives for the \n     Defense Working Capital Funds (DWCF) and, (2) alterations in \n     classified activities in two Air Force accounts.\n       These identified outlay scoring adjustments for policies \n     enumerated here do not prejudge other technical adjustments \n     that might be considered with this year's reported defense \n     authorizations or appropriations bills.\n       If legislation provides for defense asset sales subject to \n     appropriations, appropriate savings will be scored. I \n     understand the assets currently being considered would \n     generate between $0.6 billion and $0.9 billion in negative \n     outlays. The precise amount would, of course, depend on the \n     text provisions reported to the Senate.\n       Staff have also identified $2.0 billion in potential policy \n     outlay scorekeeping adjustments. If the Administration's own \n     policy initiatives are legislated for the DWCF, I will \n     exercise my authority to score the legislation recognizing \n     the Administration's outlay estimates. For the classified \n     policy initiatives in intelligence community activities, I \n     will respect your judgment that the proposed policy \n     initiatives will have the downward impact on outlays asserted \n     by the Department of Defense and that the legislation \n     reported to the Senate would not reverse or materially alter \n     this impact, and will, therefore, score the outlays for \n     reported legislation appropriately.\n       The disagreements between CBO, OMB and DoD on outlay \n     estimates for the President's defense budget are not new. I \n     believe Congress must insist on the most accurate projects \n     from both the executive branch and our own estimators. \n     Accordingly, I believe we should work together to achieve the \n     following results.\n       1. Prompt submission of the annual joint report to Congress \n     required by 10 U.S.C. 226 concerning CBO and OMB scoring of \n     outlays on December 15 of each year;\n       2. The routine and timely transmission by CBO of its \n     scoring of defense budget requests and relevant legislation \n     to the appropriate representatives of DoD's Office of the \n     Comptroller and OMB;\n       3. An analysis by CBO and the Administration, submitted as \n     a part of their fiscal year 2000 Presidential budget \n     presentations, of the actual outlays and rates that occurred \n     for fiscal year 1998 for the Department of Defense with: (a) \n     the outlays and outlay rates originally estimated by CBO and \n     the Administration, respectively, for the fiscal year 1998 \n     Department of Defense budget when that budget was originally \n     presented to Congress, and (b) any revised outlays and outlay \n     rates estimated for the final appropriations legislation, \n     pursuant to Section 251 of the Balanced Budget Enforcement \n     and Deficit\n\n[[Page S9405]]\n\n     Control Act, for the Department of Defense for fiscal year \n     1998, including supplementals, transfers, rescissions, and \n     any other adjustments;\n       4. An analysis by CBO and the Administration, submitted as \n     a part of their fiscal year 2000 Presidential budget \n     presentations, of the outlays and outlay rates currently \n     estimated to be appropriate for fiscal year 1999 for the \n     Department of Defense with: (a) the outlays and outlay rates \n     originally estimated by CBO and the Administration for the \n     fiscal year 1999 Department of Defense budget when that \n     budget was originally presented to Congress, and (b) any \n     revised outlays and outlay rates estimated for the final \n     appropriations legislation, pursuant to Section 251 of the \n     Balanced Budget Enforcement and Deficit Control Act, to date, \n     for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 1999, including \n     supplementals, transfers, rescissions, and any other \n     adjustments;\n       5. A timely explanation by DoD of (a) any policy \n     initiatives in the fiscal year 2000 DoD budget that, in DoD's \n     judgement, CBO did not recognize in the latter's scoring of \n     the fiscal year 2000 DoD budget, (b) DoD's analysis of how \n     such policy initiatives will affect outlays in fiscal year \n     2000 and subsequent years, and (c) how DoD intends to \n     implement the proposed policy initiatives.\n       Pursuant to your amendment we are also looking into the \n     issue of non-defense outlays scoring and will report back to \n     you shortly.\n       I look forward to working with you on this year's DoD \n     appropriation and on action to ensure we have the most \n     accurate estimate possible for defense expenditures in future \n     years.\n           With best regards,\n                                                 Pete V. Domenici,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Now, why am I taking the time here late at night to talk \nabout this? Because we are about to go out on a break. We are going to \ngo out for the month of August. In the first week of September when we \ncome back, the chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation Appropriations Subcommittee, the largest of the nondefense \nappropriations subcommittees--and that is my colleague and my friend, \nSenator Specter from Pennsylvania--will be calling us together to mark \nup the nondefense portion of the appropriations bill.\n  Right now, the allocation that was given to our subcommittee with \nrespect to outlays is almost $300 million below a freeze from last \nyear--$300 million below a freeze from last year.\n  The House, using those figures, marked up a bill, and the only way \nthey marked it up was by completely eliminating all of the funding for \nthe summer jobs program and all of the funding for the heating \nassistance for the elderly and poor--the LIHEAP program. They just \neliminated all of that, and then they came in with the allocations that \nthey had.\n  What my amendment basically says is that the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee ought to apply the same rationale, the same decision, on \nusing OMB estimates for nondefense as he did for defense. We need the \noutlays that this amendment will give us to fund programs important to \nMembers on both sides of the aisle. This is not a Democrat amendment.\n  Now, we have heard many calls on the other side of the aisle to get \nmore funding for IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. \nWe have had more calls from the other side of the aisle to fund more \nprograms for the National Institutes of Health. We have heard calls on \nthis side of the aisle for more funding for Head Start, for low-income \nheating energy assistance programs for the elderly and the working \npoor. This cuts across both sides of this aisle. Those are just a few \nof the programs that will be drastically cut if we don't have the \nfigures that could be given to us by the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee.\n  Now, I will point out one thing. Recently, the Senators here voted on \na sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It passed 99-0--I don't know who was \nmissing, but it passed 99-0-- a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that \nwould raise NIH funding by $2 billion next year. That increase alone \nwould require over $600 million in outlays. And I just said that our \nallocation puts us $300 million below a freeze.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am delighted to yield to my friend and chairman.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague. When the distinguished Senator \nfrom Iowa points out that the vote was 99-0, is the Senator aware that \nwhen we sought the transfer, that it was turned down 57-41?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am aware that the Senator from Pennsylvania, I think, \nwithin a week after that, offered an amendment----\n  Mr. SPECTER. An amendment on which the Senator from Iowa joined this \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I proudly did so.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I believe the Senator from Iowa raises a valid point on \nhaving the same scoring for the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education as for the Department of Defense. I am \noptimistic that in working with the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee there are ways that we can resolve these differences \non policy grounds. The Senator from Iowa and I have worked very closely \nfor many years now, when the Senator from Iowa was chairman and I was \nranking--in reverse. We will move ahead with our markup in the \nsubcommittee on September 1, the day after we get back. The chairman \nhas agreed to have the markup on September 3 to bring this complex bill \nto the floor at an early date. I have taken the preliminary step in a \nvery small meeting with Secretary Shalala of Health and Human Services \nand Secretary Riley of Education and Secretary Herman of Labor, to try \nto ascertain their real priorities so that we can try to move this bill \nahead and get it passed.\n  I think the Senator from Iowa is performing a real service in \nhighlighting the necessity for similar scoring so we can have \nadditional funds. I think we will get there. I thank my colleague for \nhis yielding and for his cooperation this year and through the years.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my chairman for his kind words. We have worked \ncollaboratively. I could not ask for a better chairman than Senator \nSpecter. We have worked closely together. We have talked privately \nabout this and, quite frankly, I believe we are going to be able to \nwork this out. That is why I will, at the appropriate time, withdraw my \namendment, because I do believe we are going to be able to work this \nout with the chairman of the Budget Committee and with the chairman of \nthe Labor-HHS appropriations subcommittee. I believe we will be able to \nwork this out in a manner that will be, I hope, conducive to getting \nthe money that we need immediately--just the basic requirements that we \nwant for the National Institutes of Health, that we want for LIHEAP, \nand a lot of the other programs that so many Members support here. I \nwanted to raise this issue because I think it is vitally important that \nwe use the same set of scoring for both defense and nondefense.\n  So, Mr. President, with the assurances of my chairman that we will be \nable to get this thing worked out, I just wanted to refer to one thing \non the chart. With the reallocation, with the amount of money we would \nget from the rescoring, we would have $770 million. That would get us \nthe money that we need for NIH. That would get us the money that we \nneed for LIHEAP and for the other programs--Head Start and others--that \nwe need, which Senators support here.\n  Mr. President, again, I raise this issue because it is vitally \nimportant. I don't know how many other Senators want to speak on this \nissue. But I would be willing to yield the floor at this time for any \nother Senators who might want to speak on the issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, first, I want to hear the response of \nthe Senator from New Mexico, because in a private conversation we just \nhad here there was an assurance that I would like to hear publicly made \nand then I will be able to respond.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if the Senator will give me 3 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes of the time I have \nto the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe one of the most difficult \nbills to appropriate and stay within the caps and the allocations under \nthe Balanced Budget Act is the bill that the distinguished Senator, \nSenator Harkin, is referring to. It is difficult every single year. It \nwill be difficult this year; he knows it and I know it.\n  I want to make sure that everybody understands that the Senator from \nNew Mexico did not adopt OMB numbers in arriving at the corrections \nthat\n\n[[Page S9406]]\n\nwere made in the amounts of money available for the Defense \nappropriations bill. We will be very glad to show Senators precisely \nwhat we did. In fact, I am going to insert a statement into the \nRecord--I won't give it--showing that we actually made policy \nadjustments that permitted the changes in the expectation of \nexpenditures, and then on top of that we allowed for the sale of assets \nthat were a certainty, and we counted those sales in terms of receipts \nthat could be spent in this bill.\n  What I am going to say to Senator Specter, chairman of the \ncommittee--and I told him this already--is that the staff and I are \ngoing to work with them, and we intend to do everything in our power to \nadjust the numbers so that they get the benefit of any policy changes \nthat are justifiably on the side of OMB's different numbers. If that \nyields more money to spend, we are going to do that, and we are going \nto try our best. Let me repeat that we did not use OMB's numbers; we \nused OMB policy adjustments in a very confused procurement account, and \nthey convinced us that in the policy that they were going to adopt, \nthere would be more expenditures than we had expected--or less, \nwhichever the case may be that yields more money to spend.\n  I also want to say to the distinguished chairman and ranking member \nof the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nthat they chose last year to forward-fund a lot of their accounts. I am \nnot critical. What they did is, they said, on a number of big accounts, \nwe will not fund them for the whole year. We will fund them at the end \nof the year, thus, getting charged for only a small amount of money. \nNow, I can't help it that the chickens have come home to roost. The \nmoney is now being spent in this year, and we don't even have to \nappropriate; we already spent it. I can't fix that on every bill.\n  So, Mr. President, let me just say to the Senate, the bill, which \nSenator Specter will chair and Senator Harkin is ranking member on, is \nthe most difficult bill we have. And this Senator, in my responsibility \nto the Senate, will do everything I can to see that the numbers are \naccurate and that we maximize the amount of outlays. It is outlays they \nneed; they don't need any budget authority. I will do that as soon as \npracticable, and our staff and theirs will start working as soon as \nthey want us to.\n  The amendment and its author do not accurately characterize what has \nbeen done respecting outlays for the National Defense budget function.\n  There has been no arbitrary adjustment of CBO's scoring of defense \noutlays as some characterize.\n  Instead, the following actions have been taken:\n  The DoD Authorization bill contains legislation to reduce outlays in \nDoD's Working Capital funds by $1.3 billion.\n  The DoD Authorization bill also implements policies that would reduce \noutlays in two Air Force accounts in classified programs by $700 \nmillion.\n  The DoD Appropriations bill we are debating today contains a new \nPentagon Renovation Fund; there has been a scoring adjustment for this \nnew fund to bring its outlays in line with typical military \nconstruction outlay rates, rather than the higher overall rates that \nCBO would otherwise attribute to this spending. This adjustment amounts \nto about $190 million.\n  That's the totality of any outlay scoring adjustments in this \nappropriations bill. There are no other adjustments to CBO scoring. I \nbelieve it is important to realize that for the adjustments that have \nbeen made, in each case there is a specific legislative and/or policy \nprovision that is key to the adjustment, and each legislative provision \nshould have a material impact on outlays.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The remaining speaker is the Senator from New Jersey, is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished chairman \nthat I am going to be very brief, in view of what has just been said. I \ntrust the chairman of the Budget Committee. There is some time \navailable, is there not, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Very quickly, I am pleased to hear the assurances. \nFirst, I commend the Senator from Iowa for bringing this to our \nattention because we were both of the same mind. Even as I read the \nletter sent to Senator Stevens and Senator Thurmond, to me, it looked \nlike we were going to be put in a position where defense was going to \nbe particularly well treated, and nondefense was going to be left out. \nBut we have had an interesting colloquy here, a dialog, and I trust the \nchairman of the Budget Committee. I work with him all the time and have \ngreat respect for him.\n  When he gives us an assurance that there will be no distinction, or \nno difference between the treatment given to defense and nondefense, I \ndon't have to go a lot further. We have heard it. We have heard it \ndirectly from the chairman. We have heard it in this public forum.\n  Mr. President, I yield the time I have in the interest of moving this \nalong.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, under the agreement \nthe amendments, if they are not called up, just go away. We do not \noffer them all. But the Senator is at liberty to withdraw his \namendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Was it called up?\n  Mr. STEVENS. It was not called up.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, and was \nread the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to H.R. 4103, all after the enacting clause is stricken, the \ntext of S. 2132, as amended, is inserted in lieu thereof.\n  The House bill is considered read a third time.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask that we stop there for just one \nmoment for leaders to have a chance to talk about this bill just \nbriefly.\n  I want to make a statement to the Senate. I often make mistakes. I \nhave not made one as great as the one I made tonight when I interrupted \nthe Senator from West Virginia. I had no intention of interrupting him. \nI know he intended to make his speech. I assured him that he would have \nthe time to make the speech that he wished. We had entered into an \nagreement concerning a time limit on the amendment of the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  I deeply regret the misunderstanding that occurred. I know my good \nfriend from West Virginia has a long and serious speech to make about \nthe war powers and the amendment that was offered by the Senator from \nIllinois concerning the power of Congress to declare war.\n  I admire and respect him greatly, and I sincerely regret that \nincident.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the \nSenate will momentarily proceed to passage of the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill.\n  But I can't let this moment escape without first commending the \nchairman, Senator Stevens, and his ranking member, Senator Inouye, for \nthe unbelievable speed in which they have been able to handle this \nappropriations bill and bring it to a close.\n  They are absolutely the best when it comes to knowing this \nlegislation, and perhaps all legislation. I think they probably have \nset a record. But I think they did it in a way that was sensitive to \nall Senators' needs. And it took a lot of cooperation on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  So I thank Senator Stevens. He set an example for all of us to \nfollow. And the better part of wisdom was for me to get out of the way \nand let him do his job. He did a great job. I thank him, and I know \nthat all Senators extend their thanks to him, and congratulations.\n  Having said that, the Senate still must consider two additional items \nbefore I can announce the voting situation for the rest of the evening.\n  Those items are the Emergency Farm Financial Relief Act, and \nlegislation coming from the House relative to H-\n\n[[Page S9407]]\n\n1B, the Nonmigrant Immigrant Program.\n\n\n    CONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT OR RECESS OF THE SENATE AND CONDITIONAL \n              ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I send an adjournment resolution to the desk \ncalling for a conditional adjournment for the August recess, and ask \nthat the resolution be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 114) was agreed to, as \nfollows:\n\n                            S. Con.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Agriculture \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 2344, and that \nthe Senate proceed to its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk reported as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2344) to amend the Agricultural Market \n     Transition Act to provide for the advance payment, in full, \n     of the fiscal year 1999 payments otherwise required under \n     production flexibility contracts.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I thought \nthe majority leader and I were working on this. I am a little bit \nsurprised he has chosen to call it up right now. We can object. But I \nwould prefer that we continue to see if we can't resolve this matter. \nWe have been cooperating all night.\n  I guess I expected a little more reciprocation on the other side. I \nam disappointed that I was surprised in this manner, and at this hour \nunder these circumstances it is uncalled for.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I think the Senator would like to withhold \nthat last comment about it being uncalled for. I don't do this lightly.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I was not informed this was going to happen.\n  Mr. LOTT. I did it for a reason.\n  Mr. President, if I could respond to the Senator's comments, this is \nnot a controversial issue. This is an issue that I am sure that all \nagriculture Members would very much like for us to get resolved. There \nis no budget impact. All it does is say that this allows farmers \nsuffering from drought, El Nino, fire, and other natural disasters to \nbegin considering and receiving emergency transition payments that they \nare entitled to under the Freedom to Farm Act. As a matter of fact, I \nunderstand that it will allow them to get these benefits in October \nrather than having to wait until January. I did it for a reason.\n  If we don't get it resolved before we get to a final vote, then \nobjections later on tonight would make it impossible for us to get any \nconsideration.\n  If the Senator would indicate to me that there is some idea that we \ncould get this agreed to tonight, I would be glad to work with him like \nI always do. But the timing was such that we have to do it now in order \nto get it considered, or it could be objected to after Senators have \ngone, and we would not get it completed.\n  I am trying to complete action so that we can go through a long list \nof Executive Calendar nominations, so that we could complete some more \nof them tomorrow. If we don't do these two issues now, they are \nbasically gone until September.\n  I thought that--I understood there was an objection, but that we had \nworked through that, and that we would not have any problem in getting \nthis cleared.\n  I had talked to Senators on your side of the aisle that have \nagriculture interests that indicated they would not object to this.\n  If there is some problem that we could resolve right quick, I would \nbe glad to withhold. But we need to try to get this resolved, because \nit is something that is very important timewise to the Department of \nAgriculture and to the farmers that have been affected by drought.\n  We have worked this year on both sides of the aisle on the \nagriculture appropriations bill to get considerations for farmers that \nhave been impacted by these disasters. This is just one way to do that.\n  Since there is no cost factor involved, it just gives authority for \nthis to be moved forward.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object again, I \nwas consumed, I guess, in assisting the chairman of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee in working down the amendments. We have \nbeen working on that tirelessly all day. The majority leader and I have \nworked throughout the day on a number of issues. Not once did he raise \nthis issue with me. That explanation would have been welcomed, would \nhave been appreciated 5 minutes ago, a half hour ago, 2 hours ago. But \nhe surprises me at this hour after we cooperated all week on an array \nof issues working over these appropriations bills amendment after \namendment. And I guess it is very, very disappointing to me.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an amendment that would provide $500 \nmillion in indemnity payments to farmers and that was passed \nunanimously on the Senate floor during the debate on the agricultural \nappropriations bill be attached to the bill that is now under \nconsideration, and for which the majority has asked unanimous consent.\n  Would he accept that addition to the bill? Because, if he would, I am \nsure then that we could accommodate the majority leader and those who \nwish to pass this, as it was a surprise to the rest of us.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this comes as no surprise to Senators \ninterested in agriculture on either side of the aisle. In fact, I did \nbring this subject up to Senator Daschle earlier today, standing right \nthere.\n  By the way, I have been working on amendments and Executive Calendar \nitems while we have been having these last few votes. I have been \ntalking to Senators on both sides of the aisle about nominations. I \ntalked to Senator Dorgan who I know confers with Senator Daschle all \nthe time about this\n\n[[Page S9414]]\n\nparticular unanimous consent request within the hour.\n  I don't believe there is anybody on either side of the aisle \nsurprised by this.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am one.\n  Mr. LOTT. As a matter of fact, we just discussed it a moment ago.\n  If the Senator wants to object, he can go ahead and object. I think \nthe implication here is that there is some sinister effort here. And it \nis certainly not true. This is something that is very noncontroversial. \nI don't know of any problem with it. I can't imagine why any Senator \nwould object to it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. With regard to his unanimous consent request, I have no \nidea of the ramifications of the unanimous consent request he just \nasked. I don't know what is involved there. We already passed the \nagriculture appropriations bill. There was action taken on that \nparticular item.\n  I would not be able to agree to that at this point without checking \nwith Senators that have been involved in that legislation with that \namendment.\n  So there is no need in holding up the Senate any further. If the \nSenator wants to object, he can do so.\n  I am going to also ask unanimous consent that he go ahead and move on \nthe H-1B issue which has been worked out previously in conference by \nboth sides of the Capitol by both parties. This is an issue that we \nneed to get resolved.\n  I thought that we had a reasonable resolution of the issue.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, the basic reason I think this is so \nimportant is that the other body, the House, is going to pass this very \nsame bill, and all it is, is one of the many steps that we need to \nconsider and hopefully pass in regard to growing problems we are \nexperiencing in farm country.\n  There was a great deal of press last week about the intention of the \nHouse to provide something called ``advanced transition payments.'' All \nthat does is provide the farmer an opportunity for a voluntarily \ndecision which he can make as to whether or not he can accept next \nyear's transition payments this year.\n  It means a considerable amount of money. And if we are able to pass \nthe Farm Savings Account that Senator Grassley has introduced, it will \nbe of tremendous cash flow assistance.\n  I thought it was not controversial. Since the House is going to pass \nit next week, since the House is out of session, it made a lot of \nsense, it seemed to me, and many others, for us to deem it passed, or \nto pass it.\n  Farmers would then have, under the banner of consistency and \npredictability, the knowledge that they would have this as a tool.\n  Now, I can't tell you what we are going to do in September with the \n$500 million that was referred to by the distinguished Democratic \nleader. That is a place hold, and it is sitting there, and as we go \nthrough the situation of judging what is happening with adverse weather \nall around the country--in Texas, Oklahoma, Florida, Georgia, South \nCarolina, and the Northern Plains certainly--perhaps that number will \nchange. We can take a look at it at that particular point.\n  As a matter of fact, I was just going to give to all the \ndistinguished Senators from the Dakotas a proposal that I have had in \nregard to crop insurance and see maybe if the $500 million could be \nincreased somewhat and funneled through crop insurance to answer these \nindemnity payment questions that have been raised.\n  But for goodness' sake, to object to this at this particular time--to \ngive farmers the advance news that this is, as a matter of fact, on the \ntable, that they can expect this, that they have some consistency, some \nidea of what is coming--I think is very untoward.\n  More to the point, I think it has been agreed to in a tremendous \nbipartisan effort in the House and, I had thought, in this as well.\n  Now, I understand that people perhaps don't get the word on each and \nevery occasion, but I cannot imagine anybody objecting to this knowing \nfull well in September we will get to the $500 million that the \ndistinguished Senator has mentioned. I would certainly urge that we not \nobject to this, we give the farmers a very clear signal, and we get on \nwith the business.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator respond to a question?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I would be delighted to respond if I can.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe the Senator from Kansas has been working on this \nissue. He knew we were trying to get it cleared tonight. I made a \nspecific call to him to contact Senators on both sides of the aisle and \ndiscuss this issue. I assumed that he was doing that. I had the \nimpression that it had been--any holds or objections had been cleared.\n  Did it come as surprise to the Senator? Does the Senator think it \ncame as a surprise?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I am always pleased, if I can respond to the majority \nleader, to be Garcia and run the trap lines for anything that could be \nproposed by the Senator and the distinguished leader of the minority. I \nhave checked with a great many Senators. I thought it was pretty much \ncommon knowledge. I have checked with the chairman of the Subcommittee \non Ag Appropriations, the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, checked with Senator Dorgan, checked with \nSenator Conrad, and checked with others. I could go down the list. But \nI just did not anticipate that there would be an objection, and so \nconsequently--or, more especially, when the very subject that Senator \nDaschle indicated is already in the Agriculture appropriations bill.\n  As a matter of fact, I think if we fund it now, you could make the \nargument that later down the road, in regard to disaster assistance, \nthere would not be any more forthcoming. I apologize if it is my fault, \nif in fact I was supposed to run the trap line and I didn't run all the \ntraps. I am sorry, but I just did not anticipate that this would be \nthis much of a problem.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we can \nplay these games all night long, and there are a lot of people who are \ntired. This isn't the way to end what I thought was a fairly productive \nweek.\n  We are not going to object. Let's just quit playing these kinds of \ngames. Let's just get on with it. Let's pass it. But let's all be aware \nof what we have done.\n  You and I have a good relationship. We ought to keep it that way. I \ndon't like being dealt with this way. I will accept it this time, but I \nwish we would work in the manner in which we have been working all \nweek.\n  This is a very serious, important issue. There are a lot of political \nramifications, and we can play the political game. The fact is that \nthere are a lot of people out there who want some help. This is going \nto be a little help. I wish we could pass the indemnity payment \ntonight. I don't see why we could not. The fact is that we would pass \nit unanimously, and that would be new money, $500 million in new money. \nI wish we could do that just as easily as we are going to agree to pass \nthis thing that isn't going to mean that much. But we will pass it.\n  But I must say, we shouldn't be doing it this way. I have been here \nall night. I haven't left the floor. Somebody could have come to me to \nsay, look, we want to do this. Instead, what has happened is that this \nwas sprung on me.\n  Now, you don't have to apologize. Nobody has to apologize. It just \nisn't the way we ought to do business.\n  So, Mr. President, we don't object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I appreciate the fact the Senator did not \nobject.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object--I will reserve the right \nto object. Is this unanimous consent on advancing AMTA payments? Is \nthat what is before the body right now?\n  Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. What is the unanimous consent \nbefore the Senate right now?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond, it is unanimous consent \nthat the Agriculture Committee be discharged from further consideration \nof S. 2344, which is a bill that allows farmers who are suffering from \nthe drought to begin receiving emergency transition payments that they \nare entitled to in October instead of having to wait until January.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would ask the proponents, I would ask the majority \nleader then, is this the unanimous consent\n\n[[Page S9415]]\n\nthat would reopen the 1996 farm bill? Because the farm bill stipulates \nthat a farmer could get half of the payment if he wanted to in December \nor January and could get the other half the next September.\n  That was in the farm bill. As I understand it, this then changes what \nthe farm bill provides. Is that correct?\n  Mr. LOTT. It says, as I understand it, that they would get the same \namount they would get either way. They would just get it earlier in the \nyear instead of later in the year so they could begin to deal with the \nproblems that they have had to face as a result of disasters.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Further reserving the right to object then, this then \nwould undo some of the provisions that were in the 1996 farm bill, \nbecause it changes the dates and circumstances under which the farmer \ncould get the AMTA payment, as it is called.\n  I understand that some people want to do that and they want to reopen \nthe farm bill. That is fine. But I would remind my colleagues that a \ncouple of weeks ago we offered an amendment to take the caps off the \ncommodity loan rates. For a typical Iowa farmer with 500 acres of corn \nthat amendment would have put about $20,000 of additional income in the \nfarmer's pocket this fall. Not only does this bill involve \nsignificantly less money for that farmer, but it only advances money \nthat he is already going to get anyway. As far as increasing income to \nthe farmer, this bill doesn't do a darned thing.\n  What we need to do is to get the indemnity payments through that \nSenator Daschle is talking about, $500 million. There are a lot of \nfarmers out there who are hurting very badly. I have to tell you, there \nis a crisis in agriculture today. Farmers have been devastated by bad \nweather, by crop disease in the Upper Midwest, and especially in the \nDakotas.\n  We can pass the $500 million for indemnity payments tonight. Why \ndon't we pass that measure by unanimous consent right now to get that \n$500 million in indemnity payments out to farmers immediately? Why \ncan't we do that?\n  I ask the majority leader, why can't we pass that?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this is a bill that has been offered. It \nprovides help now. I know no Senator would want to delay that help that \nthey were going to get anyway. We just get it earlier. This is a bill \nthat is going to pass the House next Monday, probably unanimously, \nwhich would provide some more immediate help to these farmers.\n  There is no effort to play games here. This is an effort to provide \nsome help to the farmers who need it as soon as they can possibly get \nit. That is all there is to it. The idea we are playing games here--I \nwill be glad to yield to the Senator from Idaho.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I had the privilege of working with Senator \nConrad on crafting the indemnity payment. We cooperated with Senator \nCochran in getting it in the agriculture bill. We are going to go to \nconference right soon. We think that will be in the new fiscal year. \nYou talk about immediacy of payment? We hope that will be available by \nlate this year to deal with some of these agricultural problems.\n  But I must say, it has not been shaped to my satisfaction. Senator \nConrad and I have talked about how we would work within the conference \nto make sure that it is a legitimate approach toward a true disaster \nenvironment. This is a broader approach that deals with more farmers.\n  The definition under which Senator Conrad and I shaped that--he being \nthe primary author--dealt with double, back-to-back disasters. It is \nnarrower by scope. We may want to adjust that some. I would not think \ntonight we would want to just accept it as it was originally crafted \nwith its narrowness. The problem is already much larger today than when \nwe passed it, by character of the drought and heat in Texas and in \nother States. It is already broader. We will want to look at that \nagain.\n  It is not that I am objecting. I am saying I think we will be working \ntogether in the conference of the Ag approps to make that a viable \napproach as we originally thought it ought to be.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me ask Senator Craig, if he would respond, do you think \nthis bill, which is very limited, with no budget impact, would, at any \nrate, still provide some help quicker to the farmers who had been \naffected by these disasters?\n  Mr. CRAIG. There is no question it does. Is it something new? No. Is \nit advanced? You bet it is. When the crops dried out in the field and \nthe banker wants you to pay your bills and you can pay them sooner than \nlater, then it is a big help. This is not opening up Freedom to Farm. \nThis is advancing a payment that is already built within that \nstructure. That is why there is the budget impact about which the \nmajority leader spoke.\n  I hope we can work together to resolve this, as we thought we had, so \nthat this can move forward this week to deal with the problems that are \nvery current in our agricultural sector.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I renew my unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object--but I do object to what has occurred here, in terms of the \nway we are dealing with each other.\n  When I worked to put together an indemnity plan, I went to Members on \nthe other side and I consulted with everyone. On this matter, there was \nno consultation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President--did we not have conversations with Senators?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. No, no, I have reserved the right to object. I just say \nthis: My name was raised as having been consulted; I haven't been \nconsulted. I was not consulted. So, when my name is raised on the floor \nof this body and it has been said publicly that I was consulted, that \nis not the case. In fact, I heard a rumor that this was occurring and \nwent to another Member.\n  I am just saying, in terms of the way we treat each other here, this \nis not quite the way it ought to be done. I would hope we would truly \nwork together to advance the interests of our farmers who, in many \nparts of our country, are, indeed, financially troubled.\n  There is no question this proposal is of some help. It is no new \nmoney, but it is of some assistance.\n  But I couldn't be silent when it is suggested people came and \nconsulted with us. That did not happen. The Democratic leader is \nprecisely right; there was no consultation, at least with this Senator.\n  Mr. LOTT. We are late in the hour. I see a number of Senators from \nfarm States who would like to speak, perhaps, on this.\n  Senator Hutchison, I know her State of Texas has been affected by the \ndrought. Is this a matter that would be helpful in your State of Texas?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if we let the perfect be the enemy of \nthe good, we are going to let a lot of people down who are in \ndesperation right now. This is a good bill. I think the debate can be \nlegitimately waged, but, please, at this late hour, as we are leaving \nfor a month, do not fail to let us have this relief. These farmers can \nget credit if they can get that payment moved up. It is no new money. \nBut they need this help. This will help my State, which is the most \ndrastically affected at this point with this drought.\n  I urge you, for whatever other reasons it may not have been handled \nright, let this unanimous consent go through. It will be to everyone's \nbenefit who has a stake here. Let's work out the other problems when we \ncan. We are going into a month recess.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me say again, Mr. President, when you get to the end of \na period of time like this, when you are fixing to go on a recess for \nan extended period of time, there are a lot of bills, there are a lot \nof issues we are dealing with, a lot of nominations we are trying to \nclear.\n  I am either going to have to do it now or later tonight or tomorrow, \nwhen everybody else is gone. We wouldn't have been able to get this \ncleared, probably, tomorrow. But by doing it now, I think everybody \nwill realize that this is something that will help. It is not that \ncontroversial, and we can get it done and we can move on to the recess \nand feel like we did something here that will be helpful. We will have \nother opportunities before the\n\n[[Page S9416]]\n\nyear is out to provide more help as we go through the conference.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know there are a lot of Senators on their \nfeet, but in an effort to try to be fair before I move for regular \norder, I am going to withhold so the Senator from North Dakota can \ncomment and then the Senator from Georgia, and then I will ask for the \nregular order.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I do not intend to object. I have no quarrel with this \nprovision that is being proposed tonight.\n  Mr. LOTT. Didn't I call the Senator and ask if there was a problem?\n  Mr. DORGAN. You did call within the last hour or so. I indicated to \nyou there was no problem with this provision, and I do not object to \nthis provision.\n  But I do want to make the point that the Senate has debated and \npassed an emergency provision calling for $500 million of indemnity \npayments. That is the only new money available. It is the only new \nmoney around in the appropriations process. If it is completed by \nOctober 1, then perhaps we may get money into the pockets of some \nfarmers. We have seen prices collapse even further in recent weeks. It \nmay get money into the hands of some farmers, perhaps in October--\nunlikely--perhaps November, maybe December.\n  My proposition is that to the extent that we have already debated \nthis subject, the Senate, by 99 to nothing, has said we have an \nemergency in farm country. They have already passed a $500 million \nindemnity payment program. It makes eminent good sense to me that we \nwould be able to pass that indemnity program this evening and move it \nto the House. Does the House want to deal with it? I don't know. But \nthey won't have an opportunity to deal with it in any timely way if we \ndon't proceed.\n  I have no objection at all to what the Senator is requesting. I \nsimply ask that he consider, and we consider, taking the $500 million \nwe have already decided upon and see if we can't move that to the hands \nof family farmers, many of whom are desperately strapped for cash.\n  As soon as the Senator has completed getting his unanimous consent \nand as soon as I am able to get the floor, I intend to ask unanimous \nconsent the Senate will proceed to the bill providing the $500 million \nof agriculture indemnity payments, which was agreed to as an amendment \nto the agricultural appropriations bill, and the bill be read a third \ntime and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  If someone objects to that, fine. But I hope they would not object to \nit. We will not object to this. I think this may help. I hope you will \nnot object to that, because I know it will help. It would help in a \nmore timely way than will be the case if we wait until after recess, \nand farmers have to wait until November or December. Perhaps we can \nhelp farmers to get some help from that provision earlier.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I have just returned from a disaster \narea in our State. It is the most emotional difficulty, I believe, with \nwhich I have ever dealt. And I have dealt with a 1000-year flood and a \n500-year flood. Back-to-back crises like this are enormous.\n  I heard the exchange between the majority and minority leaders. I \nunderstand the tensions of the day. I appreciate the minority leader, \nin deference to the issue involved, removing his right to object. I \nappreciate that.\n  That removal of an objection will lead to the movement and option of \nfarmers, in many States, to relieve their cash flow problem. They have \nan equity problem. The proposal that the minority leader has mentioned, \nabout the $500 million, and others, is something for the broader issue. \nThere are many issues we are going to have to bring to the table to \ndeal with this crisis. That is one idea. It is probably not near \nenough. It wouldn't take care of Georgia and South Carolina, much less \nAlabama and Texas and the Midwestern States.\n  We do have a major issue in front of us dealing with food and fiber \nand the Nation's security. I hope we could proceed this evening with \nthat which does not require new funds and it is simply a logistical and \nadministrative decision that will move money more rapidly.\n  I say to the leader, I appreciate the chance to speak on this. Again, \nI thank the minority leader for removing his objection.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read the third time and passed; that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; and that any statement relating to \nthe bill appear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 2344) was considered read the third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                S. 2344\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate \nreceives the House bill relative to H-1B, the text of which I send to \nthe desk, the bill be deemed agreed to and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table. I further ask that if the text of the House-passed \nbill is not identical to the text just sent to the desk, then the House \nbill will be appropriately referred.\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, as I indicated to the majority leader, it \nis my intent to ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nbill which provides $500 million in agricultural indemnity payments \nwhich was agreed to as an amendment to the agricultural appropriations \nbill, and the bill be read the third time and passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  Mr. GREGG. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I heard on the other side of the aisle \na chorus of ``I object.'' I am not quite sure why.\n  I was on a show this morning, WCCO Radio, in Minnesota. It is hard to \nexplain to farmers why we can't take the action right now on the \nindemnity payment, the $500 million. We passed it. The correction would \nbe made later on, but we can get assistance to farmers right now.\n  Why can't we send this over to the House? I say to my colleagues.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I helped craft that indemnity payment. It is very \nimportant we do work with the House. Senator Conrad, I, and others, \ndeserve to go to conference. Senator Dorgan was a part of that.\n  I can understand a rush to immediacy. That is in the next fiscal \ncycle. I think it is important we deal with it in a fair and balanced \nway. As it is written, already the circumstances of agriculture have \nchanged significantly enough. We deserve to look at it in a broader \nspectrum.\n  We, the Senate, tonight acted to bring some immediacy to the \ndifficulty you are expressing. There may be more to be done in the \ncoming weeks as this whole difficulty with production agriculture \nincreases across our country.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let the Record show I am speaking for \nmyself, but let the Record show that there was no objection to moving \nforward on advance payments for this ``freedom to fail'' bill, which is \njust an admission what an awful piece of legislation it was on our \nside. In addition, we could have gotten a $500 million indemnity \npayment out to farmers.\n  People are asking, when are we going to see this assistance? People \nare thinking about a lifetime of 2 months or 3 months.\n  I hear this discussion that we need to take a broader view, it needs \nto go over to the House, and we need to work it in conference \ncommittee, and we haven't had a chance to meet yet in conference \ncommittee. Do you know how ridiculous that sounds to the people whom we \nrepresent?\n  Mr. President, I will just say I don't think it is just that simple. \nObviously, I am not going to change the course of events tonight.\n  My colleague from Iowa came out here earlier and spoke about this. \nFirst, the minority leader asked whether or not we also could have \nunanimous consent to get this indemnity payment out to the countryside, \nout to families in rural America. Then the Senator from Iowa spoke \nabout it. Then the Senator from North Dakota comes to the floor, after \nwe have agreed to go forward--fast forward the advance payments was \njust fine with this Freedom to Farm bill. And now we come out and the \nSenator from North Dakota asks unanimous consent that we get the $500 \nmillion--when did we pass that? I ask my colleagues.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Almost a month ago.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. A month ago. We get this out now, over to the House of \nRepresentatives; they take action this week or next week; and then we \nget the assistance out to farmers.\n  And what I hear on this side is this chorus of ``No,'' and then \neveryone leaves. With all due respect, it is not that simple. I want \nthe farmers in Minnesota and I want the farmers across the country to \nknow that there was an effort made tonight to get some additional help \nto people above and beyond these advance payments, which will help only \na little.\n  It is a desperate situation. Many people are going to go under over \nthe next several months. There was an effort tonight to get $500 \nmillion passed, over to the House, and out to farmers all across the \ncountry, especially in those areas that have been hardest hit. And my \ncolleagues on the other side said no. And they are gone.\n  I will be willing to yield in 1 second. I would like to speak a \nlittle bit more about this for another 3 minutes. It is not that \nsimple. I will just say to my colleagues on the other side, I see that \nit is late at night, but I will just say to them, it is not as simple \nas saying no. You said no to a proposal, to an effort to get assistance \nto people now. We could have done it. We have done it.\n  I think the Record should be very clear. I want every single farm \nfamily in northwest Minnesota that is in desperate shape to know that \nthis proposal was turned down by the Republican Party--unwilling to do \nit. We were more than willing to help out a little bit with moving \nforward on the advance payments. No reciprocation or cooperation on the \nother side in getting the $500 million out to people right now.\n  I don't think it will be very easy to explain to people why we are \nwaiting another month. I don't know whether we should have even left. \nIt is sort of interesting to me, a bitter irony. Now we are gone. We \nprobably shouldn't have gone. We probably shouldn't be going into \nrecess.\n  How do you say to people, well, it will be in a conference committee \nand we haven't quite got that together and we just didn't want to do it \ntonight because there are some things that I am not satisfied with as a \nSenator and I would like to work on that longer?\n  The future is now for people. Time is not neutral. We could have \npassed something which would have provided $500 million to farmer \nfamilies that are in real trouble, and we didn't do it. I am \nembarrassed that we are going into recess. I am embarrassed that the \nU.S. Senate blocked this. I am embarrassed, specifically, that my \nRepublican colleagues blocked it.\n  I didn't get a chance to talk earlier because the majority leader \ntried to move things along, said he would recognize two Senators, and \nthe Senator from Georgia was the last Senator. So now I get to speak. I \nthink it is just outrageous.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I simply wanted to make the point that the reason I asked \nthe unanimous consent request really has nothing to do with the request \nby others to advance the Agriculture Marketing Assistance Act, or AMTA \npayments as they are called, under the Freedom to Farm bill. I didn't \nobject to that. If that will help a producer here and there, that is \ngood. Anything that helps gets assistance into the pockets of family \nfarmers, I am for that. So I didn't object to that. I told folks this \nevening I wouldn't object to that.\n  But, this is not new money at all. This is just a payment that they \nare supposed to get later on. Now, they might get this payment earlier \nor at least they will have the option to get it earlier.\n  I was thinking about the farmer who testified yesterday at our farm \npolicy hearing. This was young fellow from South Dakota who testified. \nWhen he talked about putting the crop in this spring, he could barely \ncontinue. His chin was quivering, and he had tears in his eyes. He \ntalked about having to find something on his farm to sell in order to \nget the money together to put in his crop. Then things went bad for him \nand he was out of money again. He had to sell some of the feed for his \ncattle that he put aside for this winter. He\n\n[[Page S9418]]\n\ndidn't have any money. He talks about the need to feed his kids, the \nneed to provide for his family. He could barely continue because he was \ntalking about something that is much more than a business. It is a way \nof life. This was life, and his dream. I had a call from a guy in \nSarles, ND. You could hear the pain in his voice. Everything that he \nhas, everything that he owns, everything that he aspires to, everything \nthat he has fought and worked for in his family is on the line. He \nsaid, ``You know, I'm going to harvest my barley and I'm going to have \nto take it right to the elevator. Prices have crashed, I am not going \nto get anything for it. I don't have a choice. I have to pay back my \nlender, and feed my family.'' The pain was so evident in his voice. He \nwas asking, ``What can I do? Is there help someplace?''\n\n  The point of both of these producers is that they didn't cause these \nconditions. They didn't cause the Asian financial crisis that has \ncaused our exports to start to slow down and prices collapse. They \ndidn't cause the crop diseases that have devastated these crops. They \ndidn't cause the price collapse of wheat and barley. It is not their \nfault. The question for this country is whether we are going to have \nany family farmers left. And, does anybody care about that?\n  This Senate did something that I thought was the right thing to do. \nWe passed an indemnity program of $500 million. Frankly, that is going \nto have to increase substantially. Since that time, in the last several \nweeks, we have learned that the Texas cotton crop is gone, with over $2 \nbillion in damage. In Louisiana and Oklahoma, the agricultural \neconomies are devastated. So the $500 million is going to have to be \nincreased. The point is, while I think advancing the Freedom to Farm \npayments is fine, I think we can do more by deciding to take the $500 \nmillion we have already agreed upon and advance that and move that out.\n  The earliest farmers are going to get these indemnity payments would \nbe perhaps November or December. Tonight, we could have taken that $500 \nmillion and made it available. We could have sent it to the House, and \nlet them pass it. Next week, or the week after, the Department of \nAgriculture could have begun to try to deal with this deepening farm \ncrisis. This isn't an ordinary crisis. I have mentioned before that we \nhave so many auction sales of family farms in North Dakota that they \nwere calling auctioneers out of retirement to handle the sales. You can \ngo to those sales and see these little tykes wearing their britches and \ncowboy hats with hair in their eyes, wondering why mom and dad have to \nsell the farm, and why their life is going to change. You can see the \nhusband and wife with tears in their eyes, watching people bid on their \nmachinery. Most of the equipment is old because they can't afford the \nnew machinery. You can see the pain being suffered out in the great \nplains.\n  I am disappointed tonight. I wish we could have done what we have \nalready decided to do. We should make $500 million available now. We \nshould do it sooner rather than later. We will come back in September \nand have another significant debate. Advancing the Freedom to Farm \npayment is fine. It may help some producers. If it does, I am for that. \nBut we must do more. This Congress must decide that family farmers \nmatter. This isn't just about dollars and cents, or about economic \ntheory. With all that is going on in agriculture, including unfair \ntrade, unfair competition, a choked market, monopolies up and down and \nsideways, and everywhere, we are losing something very important. We \nare losing family farmers. Then all the yard lights will be turned off \non these farms. You will fly from California to Maine and you won't see \nfamily farms because agri-factories don't have yard lights. They plow \nas far as you can plow for 10 hours, and they plow back. There will be \nnobody living out in the country. That seed bed of family values that \nexisted and that nurtures us from small towns to America's cities, and \nwhich has always refreshed this country will be gone. Then somebody \nwill scratch their head and say: What happened to our country? What \nwill have happened is that this Congress didn't understand, as some \nother countries do, that family farmers make a difference in our \nnational life. It is not just dollars and cents. It is a lot more than \nsome economic calculation made by those who give us a bunch of \nconstipated theories about agriculture. This is everyday living by farm \nfamilies that just ask for an even chance to make a decent living. Yet \nthey are confronted in every direction by monopolies, price collapse, \ndisease, and then by a Government that says they want to pull the rug \nout from under them on price supports.\n  What if the Government tried to do that on the minimum wage? They \nwould say, ``Let's reduce the minimum wage to $1 an hour and call it \nfreedom to work.'' It's the same thing. The fact is, we must come back \nhere in September and have a real debate about real policies that will \ngive family farmers in this country a real opportunity to make a decent \nliving. They are the economic all stars in this country. Make no \nmistake about it. This country will make a serious mistake if it turns \nits back to the economic opportunity that ought to be offered to the \nfamily farmers in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, perhaps it is healthy that we had a \ndiscussion on the farm crisis started again tonight. It is unfortunate \nthe way it came up because, typically, those of us who represent farm \ncountry have tried to work together. That did not happen tonight. That \nis unfortunate. There is no great harm done. In fact, we passed \nsomething that will be modestly helpful, although it represents no new \nmoney.\n  Mr. President, the reason there is such a high level of feeling about \nwhat is happening in farm country is because we face an unmitigated \ndisaster. In North Dakota, farm income declined 98 percent from 1996 to \n1997. The result is a massive number of auction sales, and the result \nis that the Secretary of Agriculture came to North Dakota and his \ncrisis response team said that we are in danger of losing 30 percent of \nour farmers in the next 2 years. That is a disaster of staggering \nproportion.\n  Of course, it is not limited to North Dakota because we have the \nlowest prices for wheat and barley in 50 years. Those prices continue \nto crash. I just received a phone call from a farmer back home in North \nDakota, who heard this debate occurring and he said, ``Don't they know \ndown there that just shuffling payments is not going to solve the \nproblem? Don't they know that this kind of shell game is not what is \nneeded? What is needed are additional resources to fight what is an \ninternational trade war. Don't they know that Europe spends 10 times \nmore supporting their producers than we do supporting ours? Don't they \nknow Europe is spending 100 times more than we are supporting exports? \nDon't they understand the result is not only the lowest prices in 50 \nyears, but in addition to that, disasters that are not being \naddressed?''\n  The disaster in North Dakota is the outbreak of a disease called \nscab, a fungus that is loose in the fields, which cost us a third of \nthe crop last year. That combination of the lowest prices in 50 years \nand losing a third of the crop to this horrible disease, scab, has \nmeant devastation to farm income. As I indicated, there has been a 98 \npercent reduction in farm income from 1996 to 1997, with literally \nthousands of farmers being forced off the land this year, and many more \ncoming next year. One of the major agricultural lenders in my State \ncalled me and told me, ``Senator, there is something radically wrong \nwith this country's farm policy. If a State like North Dakota, which is \none of the breadbasket States of our country, is in a farm depression, \nthen there is something radically wrong with the farm policy.\n  Mr. President, I just want to conclude by saying that we do face low \nprices in North Dakota. It is not just in North Dakota because now it \nis spreading to other States as well. They are being hit by the low \nprices, but they are also being hit by these disaster conditions. In \ndifferent parts of the country, it is different kinds of weather \ndisasters. In Oklahoma and Texas, it is overly dry conditions, a \ndrought. It's the same thing in Louisiana. In our part of the country, \nit is overly wet conditions that led to this outbreak of\n\n[[Page S9419]]\n\nthe fungus called scab. In other parts of the country, it has been \nhurricanes.\n  The combined result is a farm crisis worse than anything we have seen \nsince I have been in public life. I have been in public life now for \nover 20 years.\n  Mr. President, I hope when we return that we are ready to \naggressively address this problem. What we did tonight will help. It is \nnot new money. It just moves money forward. That will be of some \nassistance. But it in no way solves the problem. We have a crisis of \nstaggering dimensions, and it requires our full response.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we are now in the closing process for \nthe evening, and we have several matters to be considered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9417-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, I rise to recognize the continuing efforts \nof Americans for Computer Privacy (ACP), a broad-based advocacy \ncoalition, to energize the discussion now taking place in Washington on \nencryption. ACP has a role since they represent industry, private \ncitizens and interest groups from all sides of the political spectrum. \nThe computer industry believes, as do many members in both the House \nand Senate, that it is time to reform America's outdated encryption \nregime. Last week, an important step was taken when a multimedia \ncampaign was launched to raise Congressional and public awareness on \nthe encryption issue. This campaign includes television commercials, \nprint media, and an online banner component with such statements as, \n``would you give the government the keys to your safety deposit box or \nhome.'' In the past few days, television commercials highlighting the \nneed for encryption reform have appeared during Good Morning America, \nthe Today show, Hardball, and Cross Fire.\n  Mr. President, ACP has an impressive membership which includes such \norganizations as the Law Enforcement Alliance of America, the Louisiana \nSheriff's Association, American Small Business Alliance, Americans for \nTax Reform, Electronic Commerce Forum, Information Technology Industry \nCouncil, the National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, and over sixty technology companies. It's bipartisan advisory \npanel includes several intelligence and law enforcement experts such as \nformer National Security Advisor Richard Allen, former NSA Deputy \nDirector William Crowell, former CIA Director John Deutch, former FBI \nDirector William Webster, and former San Jose Police Chief Joseph \nMcNamara. This array adds credibility to their message.\n  As you are well aware, encryption plays a significant role in our \ndaily lives. This technology scrambles and unscrambles computer text to \nkeep private communications from being read by unauthorized individuals \nsuch as hackers, thieves, and other criminals. Encryption protects \nprivate citizens credit card numbers when they buy something over the \nInternet, ensures that only authorized medical personnel can read a \npatients' medical records stored on a hospital database, shields tax \ninformation that we send to the IRS, and safeguards personal letters \nthat we E-mail to loved ones. Encryption means that American companies \ncan protect confidential employee information, such as salary and \nperformance data; valuable trade secrets and competitive bidding \ninformation; and critical target market data.\n  Encryption also benefits America's security by protecting our \nnation's critical infrastructures, like the power grid, \ntelecommunications infrastructure, financial networks, air traffic \ncontrol operations, and emergency response systems. Strong encryption \nthwarts infiltration attempts by computer hackers and terrorists who \nhave destructive, life threatening intent.\n  Yes, this is an issue that truly affects all Americans.\n  By allowing a public policy that limits encryption to continue, we \nrisk sending more potential U.S. business overseas. This approach only \nserves to harm America's economic and national security interest by \nencouraging criminals to purchase foreign made products now widely \navailable with unlimited encryption strength. By contrast, the broad \ndevelopment and use of American encryption products should be \nadvantageous to our law enforcement and intelligence communities.\n  I must say that I am deeply troubled by the comments made by Commerce \nUnder Secretary William Reinsch, head of the Bureau of Export \nAdministration, in response to ACP's efforts. Apparently, Under \nSecretary Reinsch doubts that this initiative will work--that industry \nand privacy advocates are wasting their money. I disagree. This media \ncampaign is rightfully educating the public about the importance of \nencryption in our every day lives. These advertisements make clear that \nencryption technology preserves our First Amendment right to freedom of \nspeech and our Fourth Amendment freedom against unreasonable search and \nseizure. They illustrate that we need strong security to keep all \nAmericans safe from infrastructure attack. And they explain that \nAmericans and computer users everywhere must feel confident in the \nknowledge that their private information will remain private. Clearly, \nthe development and use and strong encryption is critical if Internet \ncommerce is going to grow to its full potential and sustain the \neconomic engine that is driving this country into the 21st century.\n  I believe this advertising campaign is yet another indication of \nindustry's willingness and desire to find a reasonable solution to the \nencryption issue. Industry and privacy groups, for example, have been \nworking in earnest with Administration officials for several months. In \nMay, a proposed interim solution to the encryption issue was offered. \nThe Administration responded that it would take five to six months to \nreview the proposal. This reaction in conjunction with Under Secretary \nReinsch's recent comments, lead many in Congress, from both sides of \nthe aisle, to conclude that the Administration, despite what it has \nbeen saying publicly, does not want to see a balanced resolution before \nthis Congress adjourns.\n  Mr. President, I think it is also important to reiterate that the \nAdministration's restrictions against U.S. encryption exports and its \nproposals to control domestic use just cannot work. Innovation in the \nhigh tech industry is relentless and ubiquitous. The government cannot \nstop it. It is for this reason that industry is trying to persuade the \nAdministration that innovation is the solution to this issue, not the \nenemy. Two weeks ago, a coalition of thirteen companies proposed \n``private doorbells'', a technology solution that would provide law \nenforcement with court approved access to computer messages. Clearly, \nindustry leaders want to help officials capture criminals and \nterrorists. I believe the ideas they have put forward are reasonable \nand responsible. On the other hand, I do not believe the \nAdministration's response has been forthcoming. Encryption policy can \nbe modernized with the stroke of a pen, but the Administration has \nshown little willingness. Thus, industry takes appropriate action by \nimplementing a media campaign.\n  While encryption is a complex and divisive information technology \nissue, this media initiative reinforces the need for legislation to \nbring America's encryption policy into the 21st century. The national \nsecurity and law enforcement communities have legitimate concerns that \nmust be considered. I believe that the best way to deal with these \nconcerns is to pass during this Congress legislation that strikes a \nbalance on encryption. Legislation that would help keep private and \ncorporate communications away from\n\n[[Page S9420]]\n\nhackers, terrorists and other criminals, provide a level playing field \nfor U.S. encryption manufacturers, and ensure Constitutional \nprotections for all Americans. A number of my colleagues have been \npushing for this type of reform for years and several competing \nencryption bills have been offered in both the House and Senate during \nthis session.\n  Mr. President, as you may recall, I engaged in a colloquy with my \ncolleagues last week which reinforced the need for Congress to act \nduring this session to break the impasse. This is a difficult issue, \nnot easily explained or understood, but it is a crucial one. Momentum \nhas been built in both the House and Senate toward finding a workable \nsolution. Congress must seize upon these efforts and pass a consensus \nencryption bill now or risk starting all over during the next session. \nCongress has come too far on this issue to go back to the beginning.\n  Americans need a sound and reasonable encryption policy that protects \npublic safety, reinforces security, promotes digital privacy, and \nencourages online commerce and economic growth. Without the development \nand use of powerful encryption, we may bear the consequences of the \nnext hacker's attack on the Pentagon's information network, a terrorist \nattack on the city's power supply, or a thief's attack on the \ninternational financial markets.\n  With over $60 billion and over 200,000 jobs at stake by the year \n2000, the House and Senate cannot continue to hope that the \nAdministration will reach an amicable solution that satisfies the needs \nof all parties. I strongly encourage my colleagues to report out a \nbalanced encryption bill that Congress can act on before the end of \nthis session. Before it is too late.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9419-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n INSTALLATION OF WILLIAM B. GREENWOOD AS PRESIDENT OF THE INDEPENDENT \n                      INSURANCE AGENTS OF AMERICA\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise today to commend a fellow Kentuckian \nand my friend, William B. Greenwood of Central City, who will be \ninstalled as president of the nation's largest insurance association--\nthe Independent Insurance Agents of America (IIAA)--next month in \nBoston. Bill is president of C.A. Lawton Insurance, an independent \ninsurance agency located in Central City.\n  Bill's career as an independent insurance agent has been marked with \noutstanding dedication to his clients, his community, IIAA, the State \nassociation--the Independent Insurance Agents of Kentucky--his \ncolleagues and his profession.\n  At the state level, Bill served as president of the Independent \nInsurance Agents of Kentucky in 1983, and was named the Kentucky \nassociation's Insurer of the Year in 1986. He was Kentucky's \nrepresentative to IIAA's National Board of State Directors for seven \nyears beginning in 1985.\n  Bill also has been very active with IIAA. He served as chairman of \nits Communications and Membership Committees as well as chairman of the \nFuture One Communications Task Force. Bill was elected to IIAA's \nExecutive Committee in 1992 and since then he has exhibited a spirit of \ndedication and concern for his 300,000 independent agent colleagues \naround the country.\n  Bill's selfless attitude also extends to his involvement in numerous \nCentral City-area community activities. He received the 1989 Kentucky \nChamber of Commerce Volunteer of the Year Award. He is on the Boards of \nDirectors for the Leadership Kentucky Foundation, Kentucky Audubon \nCouncil Boy Scouts of America, and Central City, Main Street, Inc.\n  In the past, Bill served on the Board of Directors of the Muhlenberg \nCommunity Theater, the Everly Brothers Foundation, and the Central City \nMain Street and Redy Downtown Development Corporation. Also, Bill is \npast president of the Central City Chamber of Commerce and the Central \nCity Lions Club.\n  Bill's professional endeavors outside IIAA extend to serving on the \nboard of directors and serving as president of the First United Holding \nCompany, which owns Central City's First National Bank.\n  I have complete confidence that Bill will serve with distinction and \nprovide strong leadership as president of the Independent Insurance \nAgents of America. I wish him and his lovely wife, Leslie, all the best \nas IIAA President and First Lady over the next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9420-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UTAH ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the noteworthy \nefforts of the Utah Assistive Technology Program, which has helped \nempower individuals with disabilities, allowing them to live more \nrewarding, productive, and independent lives.\n  An estimated 216,100 Utahns of all ages--approximately 10 percent of \nour state's population--live with a disabling condition. Assistive \ntechnology provides a means whereby these individuals can live and work \nin virtually all areas of society. Stated plainly, assistive technology \nnot only improves the quality of life for individuals with disabilities \nbut also enables the rest of us to have the benefit of their \ncontributions.\n  The term ``assistive technology'' encompasses all devices that \nimprove the functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities. \nSuch devices can be as simple as a wheelchair or as high-tech as an \nelectronic Liberator, a technological apparatus that makes \ncommunication possible for disabled individuals who are not able to \nspeak. Organizations such as the Utah Assistive Technology Program \nprovide services that assist disabled individuals in the selection and \nacquisition of these products.\n  With the help of assistive technology, children have received a more \nmeaningful and challenging education; adults have undertaken rewarding \ncareers; and senior citizens have continued to live independently in \ntheir own homes.\n  The Tech Act, as it is known, passed by Congress in 1988, has proven \ninvaluable to the realization of these goals. Under this act, Utah has \nestablished an impressive assistive technology program. According to my \nfellow Utahn, Ms. Corey Rowley, chairperson of the National Council on \nIndependent Living Assistive Technology Task Force, the effectiveness \nof the Utah Assistive Technology Program lies in its ability to \ninitiate and coordinate projects with all relevant Utah agencies--an \nintegrated effort that transcends any one piece of federal legislation.\n  Prominent among its achievements is the creation of the Utah Center \nfor Assistive Technology in Salt Lake City--a statewide service center \nthat provides invaluable assessments and demonstrations of applicable \nassistive technology devices to consumers. This center also provides \npeople with informative guidance concerning available resources to \nacquire these services. While federal funds from the Tech Act were \ncrucial to the center's creation, it is now fully funded by the state. \nThis is an excellent example of how Utah has been able to leverage a \nsmall amount of federal funding.\n  Mr. President, we must make sure that the Tech Act is reauthorized. \nWhile this act has already enhanced the lives of many Americans, a \ngreat need still exists. We must do more. It seems clear that the need \nfor assistive technology in the coming years will increase as America's \npopulation ages. Moreover, we must take full advantage of scientific \nand technological advances that can be applied to persons with \ndisabilities.\n  Congress will have the opportunity this year to continue a modest \nfederal effort to empower individuals with disabilities to learn, to \nwork, and to prosper. I hope that all my colleagues will support this \nprogram.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9420-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9420-S9421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         HONORING THE WRIGHTS ON THEIR 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

In an era \nwhen nearly half of all couples married today will see their union \ndissolve into divorce, I believe it is both instructive and important \nto honor those who have taken the commitment of ``till death us do \npart'' seriously, demonstrating successfully the timeless principles of \nlove, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics make our country \nstrong.\n  For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Lonnie and Regina \nWright of Goshen, Arkansas, who on August 4, 1998, will celebrate their \n50th\n\n[[Page S9421]]\n\nwedding anniversary.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nthank Senator Coats, the Chairman of the Labor Committee's Subcommittee \non Children and Families, for the excellent work he has done in \ndrafting legislation to reauthorize the Community Services Block Grant, \nwhich recently passed in the Senate. The CSBG program is intended to \nfight poverty and alleviate its effects on people and their \ncommunities. Through these block grants, federal money is given to the \nstates and local communities to create programs that help low-income \npeople secure employment, get an adequate education, make better use of \ntheir available income, obtain and maintain adequate housing, and \nultimately achieve self-sufficiency.\n  These block grants free states and local communities of federal red \ntape and give them the flexibility they desire to initiate programs \nthat meet the needs of people who need help. As a former governor, I \nlearned that state and local governments are far more effective in \nserving local communities than Washington's bureaucracy.\n  Further, Community Services Block Grants provide opportunities for \nthe government to partner with the non-governmental sector to provide a \nvariety of services to the poor. I am grateful that Senator Coats has \nled a bipartisan effort to include within this reauthorization bill \nlanguage that can expand the opportunities for charitable and faith-\nbased organizations to serve their communities with CSBG funds. The \nprovisions included will help faith-based organizations to maintain \ntheir religious character and integrity when providing social services \nwith government funds.\n  For years, America's charities and churches have been transforming \nshattered lives by addressing the deeper needs of people--by instilling \nhope and values which help change behavior and attitudes. As a matter \nof sound public policy, we in Congress need to find ways to allow these \nsuccessful organizations to unleash the cultural remedy that our \nsociety so desperately needs. Senator Coats' legislation reauthorizing \nthe Community Services Block Grant will help to further this goal.\n  The language in this bill regarding charitable and faith-based \nproviders is similar to my Charitable Choice provision contained in the \nwelfare reform law which we passed two years ago, but it does contain \nsome differences. For non-governmental organizations wishing to \nparticipate in both the Community Service Block Grant and the Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families programs, the differences between the two \nprovisions may cause some confusion and lead to additional \nadministrative burdens.\n  This situation demonstrates the need to pass legislation that applies \nthe same Charitable Choice language to all federally funded social \nservice programs in which the government is authorized to use \nnongovernmental organizations to provide services to beneficiaries. \nUnder my Charitable Choice Expansion Act, which I introduced in May of \nthis year, uniform protections and guidelines would apply to faith-\nbased entities using federal dollars to provide housing, substance \nabuse prevention and treatment, juvenile services, seniors services, \nabstinence education, and child welfare services, as well as services \nunder the Community Development Block Grant, the Social Services Block \nGrant, and of course, the Community Services Block Grant. One uniform \nCharitable Choice provision will certainly make it easier for both the \ngovernment and faith-based organizations to work together more \nefficiently to help our nation's needy.\n  Again, I thank Senator Coats and all the members of the Labor \nCommittee, as well as their staff, for their hard work on this \nlegislation, and I commend them for their decision to include \nprovisions that invite the greater participation of charitable and \nfaith-based providers in the Community Services Block Grant program. I \nhope that we in the Senate will continue working together to pursue \nlegislative proposals that encourage successful non-governmental \norganizations to expand their life-transforming programs to serve our \nnation's poor and needy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9421-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9421-S9423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION AND SENATE RATIFICATION OF THE COMPREHENSIVE \n                        NUCLEAR TEST-BAN TREATY\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  It is a truism that despite the end of the Cold War, we live in a \ndangerous world. The ultimate danger we face, perhaps, is that nuclear \nweapons will be obtained--or even used--by unstable countries or \nterrorist groups.\n  We must undertake a range of activities to reduce that danger. There \nis no magic bullet. No single program or initiative will rid the world \nof the threat of nuclear cataclysm at the hands of a new or unstable \nnuclear power.\n  Rather, we need a coherent strategy with many elements--a strategy \ndesigned to reduce both the supply of nuclear weapons technology to \nwould-be nuclear powers and the regional tensions that fuel their \ndemand for those weapons.\n  I would like to spend a few minutes today talking about one piece of \nthat strategy that this body can implement: We can and should give our \nadvice and consent to ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-\nBan Treaty. And we should do that promptly.\n  In her speech on the 35th anniversary of John F. Kennedy's American \nUniversity speech, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called for \nU.S. ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. Noting \nthe recent Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests, she said that \nratification was needed ``now, more than ever.''\n\n[[Page S9422]]\n\n  Senator Specter and I have also called for ratification now, both in \nfloor statements and by drafting a resolution calling for expeditious \nSenate consideration of the Test-Ban Treaty.\n  Why is the Test-Ban so crucial? Because it is directly related to the \nglobal bargain that is the heart of the global nonproliferation regime. \nOther countries will give up their ambition to acquire nuclear weapons, \nbut only if the declared nuclear powers honestly seek to end their \nnuclear advantage. We have to keep up our side of the bargain--and that \nmeans ratifying and adhering to the comprehensive test ban--or the non-\nnuclear weapons states will not feel bound to theirs.\n  One lesson of this decade's nuclear developments in India, Pakistan, \nIraq and North Korea is that very basic nuclear weapon design \ninformation is no longer a tightly held secret. The technology required \nto produce nuclear weapons remains expensive and complex, but it is \nwell within the reach of literally scores of countries.\n  To keep countries from producing what scores of them could produce, \nyou need more than pressure or sanctions. You must constantly maintain \ntheir consent to remain non-nuclear weapons states.\n  Ideally, we would maintain that consent by removing the security \nconcerns that propel countries to seek nuclear weapons. But that is \nterribly difficult, be it in Kashmir or the Middle East, in the Balkans \nor the Korean Peninsula or the Taiwan Straits.\n  In the world of today and of the foreseeable future, peace does not \nreign. Nuclear non-proliferation will not prevail in this world either, \nunless we convince states that nuclear weapons are not the key to \nsurvival, to status or to power.\n  The Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty is not merely emblematic of \nthe nuclear powers' commitment to the non-nuclear weapons states. It \nalso will put a cap on the development of new classes of nuclear \nweapons by the nuclear powers.\n  The test-ban treaty will also limit the ability of any non-nuclear \nweapons state to develop sophisticated nuclear weapons or to gain \nconfidence in more primitive nuclear weapons if it were to illegally \nacquire or produce them. If you can't test your weapon, you are very \nunlikely to rely upon it as an instrument of war.\n  These are important reassurances to the non-nuclear nations of the \nworld. They are why those countries agreed to foreswear all nuclear \ntests and to accept intrusive on-site inspection if a suspicion arose \nthat they might have tested a nuclear device.\n  Will the Test-Ban Treaty also gradually reduce a country's confidence \nin the reliability of its nuclear weapons over the next 30 or 50 years, \nas some of its opponents assert? If so, that is actually reassuring to \nthe non-nuclear weapons states, for it gives them hope of the eventual \nrealization of that ``cessation of the nuclear arms race'' encouraged \nby Article VI of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. So even the cloud that \nmost frightens test-ban opponents has a silver lining: it helps keep \nthe rest of the world on board the non-proliferation bandwagon.\n  Now it is true, Mr. President, that some countries have never \naccepted the world non-proliferation bargain. The so-called ``threshold \nstates'' of India, Pakistan and Israel all viewed nuclear weapons as \nessential to their national security, and India denounced the Non-\nProliferation Treaty because it did not require immediate nuclear \ndisarmament.\n  Still other countries, like Iran, Iraq and North Korea, signed the \nNon-Proliferation Treaty but maintained covert nuclear weapons \nprograms.\n  But the vast majority of the world's states, including many \nprospective nuclear powers, have gone along with this bargain. And it \nis vital to our national security that we maintain their adherence to \nthe world non-proliferation regime. They must not become ``threshold \nstates,'' let alone actually test nuclear weapons.\n  So, how will we maintain the adherence of the world's non-nuclear \nweapons states to the nuclear proliferation regime? The Indian and \nPakistani nuclear tests are a direct challenge to that regime. The \nregime--and the countries who support it--can only meet that challenge \nif the United States leads the way.\n  On one level, we are already doing that. We have imposed severe \nsanctions on both India and Pakistan, and both of their economies are \nat risk. We have adjusted our sanctions to limit their effect upon \ninnocent populations, and we are working to give the President the \nflexibility to lift them in return for serious steps by India and \nPakistan toward capping their arms race and addressing their \ndifferences.\n  On the world-wide level, however, our record is mixed. Some countries \nhave joined us in imposing sanctions on India and Pakistan. We have \nalso been joined in strong statements by countries ranging from Japan \nto Russia and China.\n  Statements and resolutions by the G-8, the Organization of American \nStates, the Conference on Disarmament, and the United Nations Security \nCouncil have rightly condemned India and Pakistan's nuclear tests and \ncalled upon them to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to \nrefrain from actual deployment of their weapons, to ratify the \nComprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty and to move toward a peaceful \nsettlement of the Kashmir dispute.\n\n  But the world is acutely aware of our failure to persuade more \ncountries to impose sanctions, and also of our own failure, so far, to \nratify the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty. Until we ratify this Treaty, \nthe nuclear hard-liners in India and Pakistan will be able to cite U.S. \nhypocrisy as one more reason to reject the nuclear non-proliferation \nregime. And until we ratify the Treaty, the rest of the world will find \nit easier to reject U.S. calls for diplomatic and economic measures to \npressure India and Pakistan.\n  We must keep our part of that non-proliferation bargain, if we are to \nmaintain U.S. leadership on non-proliferation, keep the rest of the \nworld on board, and influence India and Pakistan. The truth is that we \nhave little choice.\n  If we fail to keep faith with the non-nuclear states because we \ncannot even ratify the Test-Ban Treaty, then we will also fail to keep \nthem from developing nuclear weapons of their own. And in that case, \nMr. President, we might as well prepare for a world of at least 15 or \n20 nuclear weapon states, rather than the 5 or 7 or 8 we have today. \nThat is the stark reality we face.\n\n\n                    the fate of the test-ban treaty\n\n  But we need not fail, Mr. President. The Comprehensive Nuclear Test-\nBan Treaty is a very sensible treaty that is clearly in our national \ninterest. It binds the rest of the world to refrain from nuclear \ntesting, just as we have bound our own government for the last 6 years.\n  The Test-Ban Treaty forces us to rely upon so-called ``stockpile \nstewardship'' to maintain the safety and reliability of our nuclear \nweapons, but we are in a better position economically and \nscientifically to do that than is any other country in the world.\n  Treaty verification will require our attention and our resources, but \nthose are resources that we would have to spend anyway in order to \nmonitor world-wide nuclear weapons programs.\n  Indeed, the International Monitoring System under the Treaty may save \nus money, as we will pay only a quarter of those costs for monitoring \nresources that otherwise we might well have to finance in full.\n  But we do have a problem. We have been unable to hold hearings on \nthis treaty in the Foreign Relations Committee, even though committees \nwith lesser roles have held them. And the Majority Leader has said that \nhe will not bring this treaty to the floor.\n  Why is that, Mr. President? I know that my good friends the chairman \nand the majority leader have raised arguments against the Treaty, but \nthey seem curiously unwilling to make those arguments in the context of \na proper committee or floor debate on a resolution of ratification.\n  Could they be afraid of losing? Could they be afraid that, once the \npros and cons are laid out with a resolution of ratification before us, \ntwo thirds of this body will support ratification? Perhaps; I know that \nI think the Treaty can readily get that support.\n  For the arguments in favor of ratification look pretty strong. The \nconditions that the President has asked us to attach to a resolution of \nratification will assure that we maintain our weapons and the ability \nto test them, and\n\n[[Page S9423]]\n\nthat he will consider every year whether we must withdraw from the \nTreaty and resume testing to maintain nuclear deterrence.\n  I also know, Mr. President, that the American people overwhelmingly \nsupport ratification of the Test-Ban Treaty. A nation-wide poll in mid-\nMay, after the Indian tests, found 73 percent in favor of ratification \nand only 16 percent against it. Later polls in 5 states--with 7 \nRepublican senators--found support for the Treaty ranging from 79 \npercent to 86 percent.\n  The May poll also found that the American people knew there was a \nrisk that other countries would try to cheat, so the public is not \nsupporting ratification because they wear rose-colored glasses. The \npeople are pretty level-headed on this issue, as on so many others. \nThey know that no treaty is perfect. They also know that this Treaty, \non balance, is good for America.\n  So perhaps those who block the Senate from fulfilling its \nConstitutional duty regarding this Treaty are doing that because they \nknow the people overwhelmingly support this Treaty, and they know that \nratification would pass.\n  Perhaps they just don't like arms control treaties. Perhaps they \nwould rather rely only upon American military might, including nuclear \nweapons tests. Perhaps they want a nation-wide ballistic missile \ndefense and figure that then it won't matter how many countries have \nnuclear weapons. Perhaps they figure our weapons will keep us safe, \neven if we let the rest of the world fall into the abyss of nuclear \nwar.\n  I don't share that view, Mr. President. I believe we can keep non-\nproliferation on track. I believe that we can maintain nuclear \ndeterrence without engaging in nuclear testing, and that the \nComprehensive Test-Ban Treaty is a small price for keeping the non-\nnuclear states with us on an issue where the fate of the world is truly \nat stake.\n  I cannot force a resolution of ratification on this Treaty through \nthe Foreign Relations Committee and onto the floor of this body.\n  But the American people want us to ratify this Treaty. They are \nabsolutely right to want that. I will remind my colleagues--however \noften I must--of their duty under the U.S. Constitution and to our \nnational security. I will make sure that the American people know who \nstands with them in that vital quest.\n  My colleague, the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, and I have \ndrafted a resolution calling for expeditious consideration of this \nTreaty. So far, we have been joined by 34 of our colleagues as co-\nsponsors of that resolution.\n  We know that many others support us quietly, Mr. President, but \nhesitate to part company with their leaders. We are confident, however, \nthat as more of them reflect on what is at stake, and on the need for \ncontinued U.S. leadership in nuclear non-proliferation, they will \nrealize that they will do their leaders a favor by helping the Senate \nto do what is so clearly in the national interest.\n  The Senate will give its advice and consent to ratification of the \nComprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. The only question is when.\n  The world is a dangerous place, Mr. President, and we must no \nunderestimate the challenges our country faces. But the spirit of \nAmerica lies in our ability to rise to those challenges and overcome \nthem. The immediate challenge of non-proliferation is to bring forth a \nresolution of ratification on a useful treaty, Mr. President. We should \nshow more of that American spirit in our approach to that task.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9421-4", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9423-S9424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE IMPORTANCE OF IMF FUNDING\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, no less an authority than Alan Greenspan \nrecently pronounced our economy in the best shape he has seen in his \nprofessional life.\n  Unemployment, inflation, and interest rates are low; incomes, \ninvestment, and optimism remain high.\n  Clearly, Mr. President, now is the time to worry.\n  Now is the time to worry, Mr. President, because these are exactly \nthe circumstances that breed overconfidence and complacency. Pride, Mr. \nPresident, goeth before the fall.\n  Mr. President, we enjoy this excellent economic performance because \nwe have got our own house in order--we have gone through a painful \nperiod of restructuring that has made our economy more efficient, and \nwe have taken the tough steps to balance our federal budget.\n  So our factories and businesses are operating efficiently, our \nworkers are earning more, and our sound government finances are helping \nto keep interest rates down. What could go wrong?\n  Well, what if the markets for this new, more productive economy were \nnot there? What if international investors pull their money out of some \nof our major trading partners? What if those countries stop buying our \nproducts and services? What if they can't pay back their loans, and \nAmerican investments there lose money instead of sending profits back \nhome?\n  Unfortunately, that is just what is happening now, and instead of \nacting quickly to limit the threat of these developments, the majority \nin the House of Representatives has chosen to play a dangerous game of \nchicken with international financial markets.\n  Mr. President, the Senate went on record in March, by an overwhelming \nvote of 84 to 16, in favor of full funding of U.S. participation in the \nInternational Monetary Fund. But those funds were dropped by the House \nin Conference.\n  I am pleased to see that Chairman Stevens, who, along with my \ncolleague Senator Hagel on the Foreign Relations Committee has shown \nreal leadership on this issue, has taken a second crack at the problem \nby including this funding on the Foreign Operations Appropriations \nbill. Unfortunately, we will not act on that bill until after the \nAugust recess.\n  But just last week, the House pulled its version of the Foreign Ops \nbill from further consideration because of their internal squabbling \nover funding for the IMF.\n  I fear that those squabbles may mask an even more cynical motive--to \nhold the IMF, and by extension global financial stability, hostage to \nincrease their bargaining leverage on unrelated issues at the end of \nthe legislative session this fall.\n\n  Mr. President, I want to stress what is at stake while the majority \nin the House dithers. The financial crisis that began a year ago in \nAsia has not gone away--it continues to fester, and threatens to \nspread. Indeed, with the resources of the IMF already stretched thin, \nwe may be entering the most critical phase of this threat to the global \neconomy.\n  If the worst case happens, Mr. President, we will have no place to \nhide, no matter how well things have been going for us lately. Just \nlook at the risks.\n  Japan is the keystone of the Asian economy--it could pull that \nalready fragile region into a real depression if current trends are not \nquickly and dramatically reversed. That's why the recent elections \nthere were so important, and why international investors are watching \nclosely to see if Japan has the political muscle to overhaul its \nfinancial system and restore growth at the same time. That is a lot to \nask, and much hangs on the outcome, including the health of important \nmarkets for American exports throughout Asia.\n  Mr. President, in May our trade deficit soared to $15.8 billion, as \nexports to Asia dropped by 21 percent compared to a year ago. Still, \nour friends in the House suggest that we wait until the fall to see if \nthings get worse.\n  Russia presents an additional threat to our economic and security \ninterests. Despite the announcement of a new IMF package, the Moscow \nstock market index has dropped 24 percent. An economically foundering \nRussia, facing political collapse, opens a Pandora's box of issues for \nstability in Europe and around the world.\n  On top of all this, other countries, including South Africa, Ukraine, \nand Malaysia, are lined up in the IMF's waiting room.\n  But because of the severity of the Asian crisis, the IMF's resources \nare so low that international investors must now have real fear that it \nwill not be able to provide further support to its current clients, or \nsupport any additional countries now on the brink. This will add \nuncertainty to an already shaky situation, and can only make further \npanic more likely.\n\n[[Page S9424]]\n\n  Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Maryland, Senator \nSarbanes, recently warned those who think we can do without the IMF \nthat they are ``playing with fire.'' He's right.\n  They have decided, for short-term political reasons--some as small as \ntheir own fight over the Speaker's job--that they are willing to fiddle \nwhile the international economy burns. The IMF is not a perfect \ninstitution, Mr. President, but right now it is the only fire insurance \nwe have got.\n  By delaying indefinitely the funding for the IMF, these gamblers are \ntaking deadly risks with our own economy, an economy that has taken \nyears of sacrifice to restore to health. They are squandering our \nability to lead economically and politically in a time of international \ncrisis in exchange for some short-term political gains.\n  It is time to cease this recklessness, Mr. President. It's time to \nprovide the IMF with the funds it needs, and remove short-sighted \nbickering and self-serving calculations in the U.S. Congress from the \nlist of threats to our own economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9423-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting three \nwithdrawals and sundry nominations which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9424-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:08 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it request the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 872.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reduce \nindividual capital gains tax rates and to provide tax incentives for \nfarmers; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              family investment and rural savings tax act\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today several of us from rural States \nand the leadership of the Senate take a step to help America's farmers \nas representatives of States with major agricultural economies. All of \nus introducing this legislation agree that farmers are facing some \ndifficult times.\n  While we must do what we can to make sure that farmers survive for \nthe short term, the key to the agricultural economic situation is long-\nterm solutions. While we can't eliminate every risk and we can't \ncontrol every factor that governs the success of the family farm, there \nare initiatives that we can pursue that will help smooth out some of \nthe bumps that are in the road.\n  That is why today several of us are introducing the FIRST Act, the \nFamily Investment and Rural Savings Tax Act of 1998. As I said at the \noutset, there are some genuine problems in the ag community. Some parts \nof the country are experiencing problems that are worse than we are \nseeing in my own State of Iowa. We can offer reforms that address \nshort-term and long-term needs.\n  To address short-term needs and help give farmers that extra support \nthat some will need to get through this year, I have joined with \nseveral of my colleagues in supporting legislation that will speed up \ntransition payments, payments that would be made during 1999 and could, \nupon election by individual farmers, be taken in 1998. In my State of \nIowa, that will bring 36 cents per bushel into the farmer's income in \n1998 that would otherwise not be there.\n  But the focus of this legislation which I am speaking about today, \nthe FIRST Act, is to address long-term need, because what I just \ndescribed to you, advancing the transition payments, is obviously a \nshort-term solution.\n  What we are saying is that we must ensure economic stability for \neveryone first through the transition proposition I described, and then \nwe must help our farmers plan for the future.\n  This measure takes a three-prong approach to assist farmers and \nfamilies through tax reform.\n  The first section of our bill reduces the capital gains tax rate for \nindividuals from 20 percent to 15 percent. This will spur growth, \nentrepreneurship and help farmers make the most of their capital \nassets. It will also encourage movement of capital investment from one \ngeneration to the other to help young farmers get started.\n  This language builds on the capital gains tax reform that we made in \nlast year's Tax Relief Act.\n  Secondly, the FIRST Act includes my legislation that creates savings \naccounts for farmers. This initiative would allow farmers to make \ncontributions to tax-deferred accounts. These Grassley savings \naccounts, as I call them, will give farmers a tool to control their \nlives. This savings account legislation will encourage farmers to save \nduring good years to help cushion the fall from the inevitable bad \nyears. The accounts will give farmers even greater freedom in their \nbusiness decisions rather than giving the Government more authority \nover farmers and their lives.\n  As a working farmer myself, and an American, I know that we want to \ncontrol our own destiny. We want to manage our own business. We want to \nmake those decisions that are connected with being a good business \noperator. We do not want to have to wait for the bureaucrats at the \nUSDA in Washington, DC, in that bureaucracy to tell us how many acres \nof corn and how many acres of soybeans that we can plant. This allows, \nthrough the balancing out of income, the leveling out of the peaks and \nvalleys from one year to another, because in farming, it seems to be \nall boom or all bust. This farmers' savings account that I suggest will \ngive farmers an opportunity to do that.\n  Finally, our tax legislation allows for the permanent extension of \nincome averaging. Income averaging helps farmers because when prices \nare low and when farmers' income goes down, their tax burden will also \nbe lowered. This helps farmers prepare for the especially volatile \nnature of their income.\n  This is a tough time for a lot of farmers. I know there is a great \ndeal of anxiety among farmers about what the future might bring. This \nproposal will help them to know that we in Congress recognize the \nparticular difficulties they face in trying to plan for the future. I, \nalong with other Members who have worked on this bill, believe that our \ninitiatives will provide farmers with additional financial insurance \nthey need to help face the future.\n  The initiatives of this legislation have been endorsed by virtually \nevery major agricultural organization. These organizations know that \nthese measures are what farmers need to have more confidence and \nsecurity in the future.\n  I am very pleased to see the majority leader, Trent Lott, the Senator \nfrom Mississippi, taking a strong stand in favor of this. I thank my \ncolleagues who have worked with me on this legislation. We all agree \nthat passing this measure as soon as possible is one of the best things \nthat we can do for our farmers in our States and across the country.\n  This legislation is a long-term solution. It helps our farmers and \nour families survive and to keep control of their own decisions, so \nthat we can let Washington make decisions for Washington but let \nfarmers make decisions for themselves.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is right now we are facing a variety \nof troubling circumstances: an economic crisis in southeast Asia, a \ndrought combined with the hot weather in Texas today, fires in Florida, \ntoo much wheat coming across the Canadian border, unfairly, to drive \ndown the price of\n\n[[Page S9427]]\n\nwheat in North Dakota, and the prospect of having bumper crops this \nyear and big carryovers from last year. These are things that are \nbeyond the control of the family farmer.\n  Because we in family farming assume the responsibility--each one of \nus--of feeding, on average, 126 other people, we must keep the family \nfarms strong as a matter of national policy, as a matter of good \neconomics. We do that not because of nostalgia for family farmers but \nbecause when there is a good supply of food, the urban populations of \nthis country are going to feel more secure and more certain about the \nfuture.\n  We want to continually remind people, though, through actions of this \nCongress that we in the Congress know that food grows on farms, it does \nnot grow in supermarkets. If there were not farmers producing, if there \nwere not the labor and processing people, if there were not truckers \nand trains taking the food from the farm to the city, we would not have \nthe high quality of food we have, we would not have the quantity of \nfood we have, we would not have the stability that we have in our \ncities, we would not have the quality of life that we have beyond food \nfor the American people. Let's not forget that food as a percentage of \ndisposable income at about 11 percent is cheaper for the American \nconsumer than any consumer anywhere else in the world.\n  This legislation that we are all introducing is in support of \nmaintaining that sort of environment for the people of America, and \nalso as we export food for people around the world. We are committed to \nit, but also as a Congress we are committed to maintaining the family \nfarm as well. So I introduce this bill for Senator Lott, myself, \nSenator Hagel, Senator Roberts, Senator Burns, Senator Craig, Senator \nShelby, and Senator Sessions. I thank my colleagues for their hard work \nand support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HAGEL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise to support, as an original cosponsor, the \nFamily Investment and Rural Savings Tax Act of 1998. I thank the \nmajority leader, Senator Lott, for working with many of us to make tax \nrelief for farmers and ranchers a very top priority this year.\n  Mr. President, I am not a farmer. When I want advice about \nagricultural issues, I ask farmers, I ask ranchers. About a month ago, \nthe Senators offering this bill, and several others concerned about the \nproblems facing rural America, agriculture today, right now, sat down \nwith every major farm and commodity group in America. These \nrepresentatives of American agriculture--real agriculture--told us the \nsame thing I hear repeatedly from ranchers and farmers across my State \nof Nebraska: ``We do not want to go back to the failed Government \nsupply and demand policies of the past.'' That is clear. They told us \nvery clearly that there are three things--three things--Congress can do \nto help America's farmers and ranchers: One, open up more export \nmarkets; two, tax relief; and, three, reduce Government regulation. \nThis, after all, Mr. President, was indeed the promise of the 1996 \nFreedom to Farm Act.\n  Those of us on the floor today and our colleagues have been working \nvery hard over the last few months to open more markets overseas, \nespecially in the area of dealing with unilateral sanctions. And we are \ngoing to keep pushing aggressively for important export tools, \nimportant for all of America, not just American agriculture, important \ntools like fast track, and reform and complete funding for the IMF.\n  This bill we are introducing today goes to the second point. It will \nprovide real and meaningful tax relief, tax relief to America's \nagricultural producers. It will provide farmers and ranchers with the \ntools they need in managing the unique financial situations that they \nalone face on their farms and ranches.\n  This bill has three provisions, which Senator Grassley has just \noutlined accurately and succinctly: One, the farm and ranch risk \nmanagement accounts; two, the permanent extension of income averaging \nfor farmers; and, three, reduction of capital gains rates not just for \nAmerican agriculture but for all of America.\n  Mr. President, I have said over the last 2 years I would like to see \nthe capital gains tax completely eliminated. But that is a debate for \nanother day. However, this bill is a major step in the right direction. \nThis bill will mean lower taxes for our farmers and ranchers and many \nAmericans. It is the right thing to do.\n  I hope a majority of my colleagues will join us in support of this \nbill, an important bill for America, an important bill for our farmers \nand ranchers.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise for just a moment to thank the \nSenator from Nebraska and the Senator from Iowa for their leadership on \nthis agricultural issue that we have before us. I join as an original \ncosponsor to the effort.\n  It seems to me that clearly there are two areas that have to be \npursued. The Senator from Nebraska talked about one, and that is \nseeking to reopen and to strengthen these foreign markets that are \nthere that are critical to agricultural production.\n  One of the areas, of course, in this matter is unilateral sanctions, \nof which some action has already been taken in the case of Pakistan and \nIndia. We need to do more of that. The other, of course, is to do \nsomething domestically. I agree entirely that we should not try to \nreturn to the managed agriculture that we had before, but to continue \nto move towards market agriculture in which our production is based on \ndemand. But it is a difficult transition. And that, coupled with the \nAsian crisis, coupled with the fact that, particularly in the northern \ntier and in the south, we have had drought, we have had floods, we have \nhad freezes--we have had a series of difficult things that lend to the \ndifficulty of agriculture.\n  So I am pleased that the Congress has taken some steps. I think this \nidea of moving forward with the transition payments is a good idea.\n  Certainly we can do that for farmers. Then if we can provide a farmer \nsavings account which will allow them to have these payments, in \nadvance, without being taxed until they are used, is a good one.\n  Certainly, as the Senator from Nebraska has indicated, I, too, favor \nthe idea of reducing and, indeed, eventually eliminating the capital \ngains taxes. I just want to say I support this very much.\n  There perhaps are other activities that we can undertake that will be \nhelpful, but we do need to get started. I think this is a good \nbeginning. I want to say again that I appreciate the leadership of the \nSenator from Iowa and the Senator from Nebraska.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I, too, have come to the floor this morning \nto thank you, and certainly the Senator from Iowa, the Senator from \nWyoming, who has been involved with us, along with our leader, Trent \nLott, Senator Burns of Montana, Senator Roberts, and myself in looking \nat the current agricultural situation in this country, which is very \nconcerning to all of us as commodity prices plummet in the face of what \ncould be record harvests and as foreign markets diminish because of the \nAsian crisis and world competition.\n  As a result of that, we have come together to look at tools that we \ncould bring to American agriculture, production agriculture, farmers \nand ranchers, that would assist them now and into the future to build \nstability there and allow them not only to invest but to save during \nyears of profit in a way that is unique for American agricultural.\n  In 1986, when this Congress made sweeping tax reform, they eliminated \nincome averaging. I was in the House at that time and I opposed that \nlegislation. I remember an economist from the University of Virginia \nsaying that it would take a decade or more, but there would come a time \nwhen all of us in Congress would begin to see the problems that a \ndenial of income averaging would do to production agriculture; that \nslowly but surely the ability to divert income during cyclical market \npatterns would, in effect, weaken production agriculture at the farm \nand ranch level to a point that they could not sustain themselves \nduring\n\n[[Page S9428]]\n\nthese cyclical patterns. Bankruptcies would occur; family operations \nthat had been in business for two or three generations would begin to \nfail.\n  We are at that point. We have been at that point for several years. I \nremember the words of that economist in a hearing before one of the \nHouse committees echoing, saying, ``Don't do this. This is the wrong \napproach.'' In those days, though, I wasn't, but others in Congress \nwere anxious to crank up the money and spend it here in Washington and \nreturn it in farm products, recycle it, skim off the 15 or 20 percent \nthat it oftentimes takes to run a government operation, and then \nsomehow appear to be magnanimous by returning it in some form of farm \nprogram.\n  That day is over. We ought to be looking at the tools that we can \noffer production agriculture of the kind that is now before the Senate \nin the legislation that we call the Family Investment and Rural Savings \nAct, not only looking at a permanency income averaging, but looking at \nreal estate depreciation, recapturing, and a variety of tools that we \nthink will be extremely valuable to production agriculture at a time \nwhen they are in very real need.\n  Also, the transition payments' extension that we have talked about \nmoving forward to give some immediate cash to production agriculture, \nthat is appropriate under the Freedom to Farm transitions in which we \nare currently involved, becomes increasingly valuable.\n  I join today and applaud those who have worked on this issue, to \nbring it immediately, and I hope that we clearly can move it in this \nCongress, to give farmers and ranchers today those tools--be it drought \nor be it a very wet year or be it the collapse of foreign markets. \nPrices in some of our commodity areas today are at a 20-plus year low, \nyet, of course, the tractor and the combine purchased is at an all-time \nhigh.\n  I do applaud those who have worked with us in bringing this \nlegislation to the floor, and I thank the chairman for the time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished former chairman of the House \nAgriculture Committee, the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Presiding Officer and the distinguished \nSenator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friends and \ncolleagues in introducing the Family Investment and Rural Savings Tax \n(FIRST) Act. I would especially like to thank our Leader, Senator Lott, \nfor his strong commitment to this effort. His dedication and interest \nin these important issues should underscore how serious we are about \nproviding tax relief and improvements for farmers and ranchers before \nthe 105th Congress adjourns.\n  America's producers are currently experiencing a troubling time. \nThanks in large part to the Asian economic crisis and the \nAdministration's inability to open up new markets for U.S. farm \nproducts, commodity prices across the board have fallen to dangerously \nlow levels. Low prices, combined with isolated weather-related problems \nin some regions of the country on one hand and election-year posturing \non the other, have prompted some of our Democratic colleagues to call \nfor a return to the failed agriculture policies of the past. They \nsupport loan programs that price the United States out of the world \nmarket. They support a return to the system whereby the U.S. Government \nis in the grain business. And they support a return to command-and-\ncontrol agriculture whereby producers are required to limit their \nproduction in a foolish and futile attempt to try to bolster commodity \nprices. These policies did not work for 50 years and they will not work \nnow.\n  The FIRST Act is designed to address the real needs of producers \ntoday. The FIRST Act provides tax relief for every farmer and rancher \nin the United States. Specifically, income averaging--which was an \nimportant component of the 1996 tax bill--would become permanent, the \ncapital gains tax brackets would be cut by 25 percent across the board \nand a new Farm and Ranch Risk Management Account would be established \nto allow producers to manage the volatile shifts in farm income from \none year to another.\n  I specifically want to address the capital gains tax cut and the \nFARRM accounts. The capital gains tax represents one of the most \nburdensome, expensive provisions of the U.S. Tax Code for America's \nfarmers and ranchers and for America's families. Production agriculture \nis a capital-intensive business. Without equipment and inputs--\nexpensive equipment and inputs--you simply can't survive in the \nincredibly competitive agriculture world. Therefore, because of the \ntremendous costs of depreciating that expensive equipment, the capital \ngains tax hits farmers and ranchers especially hard. In addition, today \nthe Congress encourages middle-income families to save for their future \nin part to take pressure off of the Social Security system. However, we \ncontinue to allow capital gains taxes to hit America's families twice. \nInvestors' money is taxed both as income when they get their paycheck \nand as capital gain when they make a smart investment. That's a strange \nand counterproductive way to encourage personal responsibility and \nsavings for the future. As a result, I am very grateful to our Majority \nLeader for including the ``Crown Jewel'' of his tax and Speaker \nGingrich's tax bill in the FIRST Act today and I look forward to \nworking with the Leader to pass meaningful tax relief before the Senate \nadjourns.\n  I also want to address the creation of the new FARRM Accounts. While \nChairman of the House Agriculture Committee, I was charged with \nproducing the 1996 farm bill. As we were producing that legislation, I \nwanted very badly to create what I called a ``farmer IRA.'' Basically, \nthe farmer IRA would be a rainy day account whereby if a farmer or \nrancher had a good year, he could invest part of his profits in a tax-\ndeferred account. Then, when a bad year hits, he could withdraw that \nmoney to offset the downturn. That's exactly what the FARRM Accounts \nwould do. Producers will be able to invest up to 20 percent of their \nSchedule F (farm) income in any interest-bearing account. They may \nwithdraw that money at any time during a five-year period. If passed, \nFARRM Accounts will correct the huge problem in our existing Tax Code \nthat encourages producers to buy a new tractor or combine at the end of \nthe year in order to reduce taxable income instead of saving for the \nfuture. Again, I wanted to do this during the farm bill but we ran out \nof time. I'm very pleased that the Congress may finally get the \nopportunity to provide the flexibility and tax relief producers so \ndesperately need.\n  I want to thank my colleagues again for their leadership in this area \nand I look forward to working with them and the rest of the Senate to \npass this important legislation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2371\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PERMANENT EXTENSION OF INCOME AVERAGING FOR \n                   FARMERS.\n\n       Section 933(c) of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 is \n     amended by striking ``, and before January 1, 2001''.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senators Lott, \nCraig, Grassley, Hagel, Roberts, Sessions, Shelby, and Thomas to \nintroduce the Family Investment and Rural Savings Tax (FIRST) Act of \n1998.\n  Mr. President, today's family farms are in jeopardy. This bill will \nhelp all Americans as well as our nation's farming families.\n  The bill consists of two titles--the first will reduce the top \nindividual capital gains tax rate from 20% to 15% and reduces the \ncapital gains tax rate for individuals with lower incomes from 10% to \n7.5%.\n  Title two of the bill consists of two separate measures which work \nhand in hand: First, the bill will allow farmers to open their own tax \ndeferred savings accounts. These accounts would provide farmers and \nranchers an opportunity to set aside income in high-income years and \nwithdraw the money in low-income years. The money is taxed only when it \nis withdrawn and can be deferred for up to five years.\n  In 1995, 2.2 million taxpayers, qualified as farmers under IRS \ndefinitions, would have been eligible to use these accounts. Only \n725,000 of those filed a net income while 1.5 million filed a net loss.\n  Now that could mean one of two things: (1) fewer and fewer farmers \nare able to stay in the black or; (2) more and more farmers are going \nout of business. We cannot continue to treat our farmers and ranchers \nas second class citizens in our tax code.\n  The second part of this title contains language that I introduced \nearlier this year. This language would allow farmers to use average \ntheir income over three years and make that tool permanent in the tax \ncode. This bill will give American farmers a fair tool to offset the \nunpredictable nature of their business.\n  The question is who will benefit most from income averaging and farm \nsavings accounts. This is the best part--this legislation will allow \nfarmers to delay payment of their taxes by reducing their overall \nincome and spreading it out over a number of years.\n  However, based on the tax rate schedule, this bill would favor \nfarmers in the lower tax bracket. If a farmer could use these tools to \nreduce their tax burden from one year to the next, it is very \nconceivable that taxpayer would pay only 15% on his income compared to \n28%. That is a significant savings.\n  This bill leaves the business decisions in the hands of farmers, not \nthe government. Farmers can decide whether to defer income and when to \nwithdraw funds to supplement operations.\n  Farmers and ranchers labor seven days a week, from dawn until dusk, \nto provide our nation with the world's best produce, dairy products and \nmeats. Farming is a difficult business requiring calloused hands and \nrarely a profitable financial reward. This profession is not getting \nany easier. Today, we are seeing more and more of our family farms \nswallowed up by the corporate farms.\n  Farming has always been a family affair. Rural communities rely on \nthe family farm for their own economic sustenance. Although family \nfarms are traditionally passed on from father to son--it is becoming \nmore and more difficult as the economics of farming are becoming more \nand more complicated. Further tightening of the belt on these folks can \nonly mean the eventual loss of the family farm.\n  Montana's farmers take pride in their harvests. You could call  \ntoday's farmer the ultimate environmentalist. They know how to take \ncare of the land and ensure that future harvests\n\n[[Page S9431]]\n\nwill be plentiful. As land managers, farmers understand the importance \nof proper land stewardship.\n\n  Those colleagues of mine who grew up on a farm or ranch would \ncertainly understand the frustration of this business. Farmers and \nranchers don't receive an annual salary. They cannot rely on income \nthat may not be there at the end of the year and they certainly cannot \ncount on a monthly paycheck. This is a crucial time for family farms \nand tax relief can mean the difference between keeping the family farm \nfor future generations or losing it.\n  With the recent passage of the Farm Bill, farmers are more than ever \nimpacted by market forces and in the farming business, those market \nforces can be very unpredictable.\n  Market forces in farming are very unique--drought, flooding, \ninfestation and disease all play a vital role in a farmer's bottom \nline. And it's not often when the elements of mother nature allow for a \nprofitable harvest.\n  At best, most farmers are lucky to break even more than two years in \na row. One year may be a windfall, while the next may mean bankruptcy. \nFarmers and ranchers are forced to make large capital investments in \nmachinery, livestock and improvements to their properties.\n  Agricultural markets are rarely predictable. Farmers, more than any \nother sector of our economy are likely to experience substantial \nfluctuations in income.\n  We also need to address the issue of the estate tax. This is a death \nblow to a family farm that has been passed down through the \ngenerations. A family farm in Montana is not really referred to as an \nestate. We call it home, we call it work, and we call it our lives, but \nwe don't call it an estate.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and urge you also to \nsupport future bills such as estate tax relief legislation to encourage \nAmerica's farming family of a safe and secure future.\n  I have letters in support of this bill signed by numerous agriculture \ngroups as well as a letter from the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses (NFIB). I ask unanimous consent to have both of these \nletters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 23, 1998.\n     Hon. Conrad Burns,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Burns: Farming and ranching is a high risk \n     endeavor. Problems due to this year's adverse weather and low \n     prices provide a vivid illustration of the difficulties that \n     can be caused by nature and markets.\n       The tax code can and should help producers deal with \n     financial uncertainties unique to agriculture. Agricultural \n     organizations have recommended estate tax relief, permanent \n     income averaging for farmers, the full deductibility of \n     health insurance premiums for the self-employed and the \n     creation of farm and ranch risk management accounts (FARRM).\n       We applaud you for introducing legislation that encompasses \n     the creation of FARRM accounts and makes income averaging a \n     permanent part of the tax code. FARRM accounts will help \n     producers by providing incentives to save during good times \n     for times that are not. Income averaging will help producers \n     by allowing them to manage their volatile incomes for \n     financial planning.\n       A reduction in capital gains tax rates is also part of your \n     legislation. Because farming and ranching is a capital \n     intensive business, capital gains taxes have a huge impact on \n     agriculture. Lower capital gains tax rates will help \n     producers by making it easier for them to invest in their \n     businesses and make the best use of their capital assets.\n       We support your legislation and pledge our help to secure \n     its passage into law.\n       Agricultural Retailers Association.\n       Alabama Farmers Federation .\n       American Farm Bureau Federation.\n       American Horse Council.\n       American Nursery and Landscape Association.\n       American Sheep Industry Association.\n       American Soybean Association.\n       American Sugarbeet Growers Association.\n       Communicating for Agriculture.\n       Farm Credit Council.\n       The Fertilizer Institute.\n       National Association of State Departments of Agriculture.\n       National Association of Wheat Growers.\n       National Barley Growers Association.\n       National Cattlemen's Beef Association.\n       National Corn Growers Association.\n       National Cotton Council of America.\n       National Council of Farmer Cooperatives.\n       National Grain Sorghum Producers Association.\n       National Grange.\n       National Pork Producers Council.\n       National Sunflower Association.\n       North Carolina Peanut Growers Association.\n       United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association.\n       USA Rice Federation.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Federation of Independent Business--The Voice of \n           Small Business,\n                                                    July 29, 1998.\n     Hon. Conrad Burns,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Burns: I am writing to commend you for \n     introducing legislation, ``The Family Investment and Rural \n     Savings Tax (FIRST) Act of 1998, that will provide needed tax \n     relief to small businesses and farms.\n       Among other provisions, this legislation would reduce and \n     simplify the current capital gains tax for the many small \n     business owners who file as individuals. Small businesses \n     face unique difficulties trying to obtain capital, including \n     lack of access to the securities market and difficulty in \n     getting bank loans. They often must get their capital from \n     the business itself, family members or associates. Small \n     businesses, therefore, need capital gains relief that will \n     promote investment by both investors and business owners \n     themselves.\n       The FIRST Act also contains needed relief to help farmers \n     and ranchers by allowing eligible ones to make contributions \n     to tax deferred accounts and by restoring income averaging. \n     We very much support extending income averaging to small \n     businesses, as well, and hope that Congress will consider \n     this soon.\n       We applaud your efforts to reduce the tax burden on small \n     businesses, farmers and ranchers, and look forward to working \n     with you in the future.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Dan Danner,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n                                   Federal Governmental Relations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 2372. A bill to provide for a pilot loan guarantee program to \naddress Year 2000 problems of small business concerns, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Small Business.\n\n\n                 small business year 2000 readiness act\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small Business \nYear 2000 Readiness Act along with my colleagues Senators Bennett and \nSnowe. This bill provides small businesses with the resources necessary \nto repair Year 2000 computer problems. This legislation is an important \nstep toward avoiding the widespread failure of small businesses.\n  The problem, as many Senators are aware, is that certain computers \nand processors in automated systems will fail because such systems will \nnot recognize the Year 2000. My colleague Senator Bennett, who is the \nChairman of the Senate Special Year 2000 Technology Problem Committee \nand is co-sponsoring this bill, is very well versed in this problem and \nhas been active in getting the word out to industries and to agencies \nof the federal government of the drastic consequences that may result \nfrom the Y2K problem.\n  Recently, the Committee on Small Business, which I chair, held \nhearings on the effect the Y2K problem will have on small businesses. \nThe outlook is not good. The Committee received testimony that the \ncompanies most at risk from Y2K failures are small and medium-sized \nindustries, not larger companies. The major reasons for this anomaly is \nthat many small companies have not begun to realize how much of a \nproblem Y2K failures will be and may not have the access to capital to \ncure such problems before they cause disastrous effects.\n  A study on Small Business and the Y2K Problem sponsored by Wells \nFargo Bank and the NFIB found that an estimated four and three-quarter \nmillion small employers are exposed to the Y2K problem. This equals \napproximately 82 percent of all small businesses that have at least two \nemployees. Such exposure to the Y2K problem will have devastating \naffects on our economy generally. As the result of communications with \nsmall businesses, computer manufacturers, consultants and groups, the \nSmall Business Committee has found there is significant likelihood that \nthe Y2K issue will cause many small businesses to close, playing a \nlarge role in Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan's prediction of a 40 \npercent chance for recession at the beginning of the new millennium.\n  The Committee received information indicating that approximately \n330,000 small businesses will shut down due to the Y2K problem and an \neven larger number will be severely crippled. Such failures will affect \nnot only the employees and owners of such small businesses, but also \nthe creditors, suppliers and customers of such failed small businesses. \nLenders, including banks\n\n[[Page S9432]]\n\nand non-bank lenders, that have extended credit to small businesses \nwill face significant losses if small businesses either go out of \nbusiness or have a sustained period in which they cannot operate.\n  It must be remembered that the Y2K problem is not a problem for only \nthose businesses that have large computer networks or mainframes. A \nsmall business is at risk if it uses any computers in its business, if \nit has customized software, if it is conducting e-commerce, if it \naccepts credit card payments, if it uses a service bureau for its \npayroll, if it depends on a data bank for information, if it has \nautomated equipment for communicating with its sales or service force \nof if it has automated manufacturing equipment.\n  A good example of how small businesses are dramatically affected by \nthe Y2K problem is the experience of John Healy, the owner of Coventry \nSpares Ltd. in Holliston, Massachusetts, as reported in INC Magazine. \nCoventry Spares is a distributor of vintage motorcycle parts. Like many \nsmall business owners, Mr. Healy's business depends on trailing \ntechnology purchased over the years, including a 286 computer, with \nsoftware that is 14 years old and an operating system that is six or \nseven versions out of date. Mr. Healy uses this computer equipment, \namong other matters, for handling the company's payroll, ordering, \ninventory control, product lookup and maintaining a database of \ncustomers and subscribers to a vintage motorcycle magazine he \npublishes. The system handles 85 percent of his business and, without \nit working properly, Mr. Healy stated that ``I'd be a dead duck in the \nwater.'' Unlike many small business owners, however, Mr. Healy is aware \nof the Y2K problem and tested his equipment to see if his equipment \ncould handle the Year 2000. His tests confirmed his fear--the equipment \nand software could not process the year 2000 date and would not work \nproperly after December 21, 1999. Therefore, Mr. Healy will have to \nexpand over $20,000 to keep his business afloat. The experience of Mr. \nHealy has been and will continue to be repeated across the country as \nsmall businesses realize the impact the Y2K problem will have on their \nbusiness.\n\n  The Gartner Group, an international computer consulting firm, has \nconducted studies showing small businesses are way behind--the worst of \nall sectors studied--where they need to be in order to avoid \nsignificant failures due to non-Y2K compliance. It estimates that only \n15 percent of all businesses with under 200 employees have even begun \nto inventory the automated systems that may be affected by this \ncomputer glitch. That means that 85 percent of small businesses have \nnot be even begun the initial task of determining how much of a problem \nthey may have or taken steps to ensure that their businesses are not \nimpaired by this problem.\n  Given the effects a substantial number of small business failures \nwill have on our nation's economy, it is imperative that Congress take \nsteps to ensure that small businesses are aware of the Y2K problem and \nhave access to capital to fix such problems. Moreover, it is imperative \nthat Congress take such steps before the problem occurs, not after it \nhas already happened. Therefore, today I am introducing the Small \nBusiness Year 2000 Readiness Act.\n  This Act will serve the dual purpose of providing small businesses \nwith the means to continue operating successfully after January 1, \n2000, and making lenders and small firms more aware of the dangers that \nlie ahead. The Act requires the Small Business Administration to \nestablish a limited-term loan program whereby SBA would guarantee 50 \npercent of the principal amount of a loan made by a private lender to \nassist small businesses in correcting Year 2000 computer problems. The \nloan amount would be capped at $50,000. The guarantee limit and loan \namount will limit the exposure of the government and ensure that \neligible lenders retain sufficient risk so that they make sound \nunderwriting decisions.\n  The Y2K loan program guidelines will be based on the guidelines SBA \nhas already established governing its FA$TRACK pilot program. Lenders \noriginating loans under the Y2K loan program would be permitted to \nprocess and document loans using the same internal procedures they \nwould on loans of a similar type and size not governed by a government \nguarantee. Otherwise, the loans are subject to the same requirements as \nall other loans made under the (7)(a) loan program.\n  Under the loan program, each lender designated as a Preferred Lender \nor Certified Lender by SBA would be eligible to participate in the Y2K \nloan program. This would include approximately 1,000 lenders that have \nreceived special authority from the SBA to originate loans under SBA's \nexisting 7(a) loan program. The Year 2000 loan program would sunset \nafter October 31, 2001.\n  To assure that the loan program is made available to those small \nbusinesses that need it, the legislation requires SBA to inform all \nlenders eligible to participate in the program of the loan program's \navailability. It is intended that these lenders, in their own self-\ninterest, will contact their small business customers to ensure that \nthey are Y2K complaint and inform them of the loan program if they are \nnot.\n  The Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act is a necessary step to \nensure that the economic health of this country is not marred by a \nsubstantial number of small business failures following January 1, \n2000, and that small businesses continue to be the fastest growing \nsegment of our economy in the Year 2000 and beyond.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2372\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Year 2000 \n     Readiness Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend title 28, United States Code, with respect \nto the use of alternative dispute resolution processes in United States \ndistrict courts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                   alternative dispute resolution act\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nAlternative Dispute Resolution Act of 1998. My Judiciary Subcommittee \non Administrative Oversight and the Courts has jurisdiction over this \nmatter, and I am very pleased that the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Durbin, has joined me in sponsoring this bill. It \nwill require every Federal district court in the country to institute \nan alternative dispute resolution, or ADR, program. The bill will \nprovide parties and district court judges with options other than the \ntraditional, costly and adversarial process of litigation.\n  ADR programs have been gaining in popularity and respect for years \nnow. For example, many contracts drafted today--between private \nparties, corporations, and even nations--include arbitration clauses. \nMost State and Federal bar associations, including the ABA, have \nestablished committees to focus on ADR. Also, comprehensive ADR \nprograms are flourishing in many of the States.\n  ADR is also being used at the Federal level. In 1990, for example, \nPresident Bush signed into law a bill that I introduced called the \nAdministrative Dispute Resolutions Act. The law promoted the increased \nuse of ADR in Federal agency proceedings. In 1996, because ADR was \nworking so well, we permanently re-authorized the law. And earlier this \nyear, the executive branch recommitted themselves to using ADR as much \nas possible.\n  Since the late 1970s, our Federal district courts have also been \nsuccessfully introducing ADR. In 1998, we authorized 20 district courts \nto begin implementing ADR programs. The results were very encouraging, \nso last year we made these programs permanent. It's time to take \nanother step and make ADR available in all district courts.\n  Mr. President, ADR allows innovations and flexibility in the \nadministration of justice. The complex legal problems that people have \ndemand creative and flexible solutions on the part of the courts. There \nare numerous benefits to providing people with alternatives to \ntraditional litigation. For example, a recent Northwestern University \nstudy of ADR programs in State courts indicated that mediation \nsignificantly reduced the duration of lawsuits and produced significant \ncost savings for litigants. That means fewer cases on the docket and \ndecreased costs. The Federal courts should be taking every opportunity \nto reap the benefits that the state courts have been enjoying.\n\n  Mr. President, the fact of the matter is that ADR works. The future \nof justice in this country includes ADR. Perhaps one of the signs of \nthis is that many of the best law, business, and graduate schools in \nthe country are beginning to emphasize training in negotiation, \nmediation, and other kinds of dispute resolution.\n  Quite simply, this bill will increase the availability of ADR in our \nFederal courts. It mandates that every district court establish some \nform of professional ADR program. It provides the district, however, \nwith the flexibility to decide what kind of ADR works best locally. The \nbill also allows a district with a current ADR program that's working \nwell to continue the program.\n  This bill is the Senate companion to H.R. 3528, which was reported \nout of the Judiciary Committee today without any opposition. Our bill \ntracks the original House bill, except for some findings and a few \ntechnical changes to improve the legislation. These changes were \nincluded in the bill reported out of committee. The House bill received \noverwhelming, bipartisan support, passing 405-2.\n  The Department of Justice, along with the administration, the \nAdministrative Office of the Courts, and the American Bar Association, \nincluding its business section, all support the legislation with these \nimprovements. The consensus is clear: ADR has an important role to play \nin our Federal court system.\n  Mr. President, this bill is a step in the right direction for the \nadministration of justice in our country. Increased availability of ADR \nwill benefit all of us. It should be an option to people in every \njudicial district of the country. This bill assures that it will be.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES:\n  S. 2374. A bill to provide additional funding for repair of the \nKorean War Veterans Memorial; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                korean war veterans memorial legislation\n\n   Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation to fix and restore one of our most important monuments, the \nKorean War Veterans Memorial. My bill would authorize the Secretary of \nthe Army to provide, within existing funds, up to $2 million to \ncomplete essential repairs to the Memorial.\n  The Korean War Memorial is the newest war monument in Washington, DC. \nIt was authorized in 1986 by Public Law 99-752 which established a \nPresidential Advisory Board to raise funds and oversee the design of \nthe project, and charged the American Battle Monuments Commission with \nthe management of this project. The authorization provided $1 million \nin federal funds for the design and initial construction of the \nmemorial and Korean War Veterans' organizations and the Advisory Board \nraised over $13 million in private donations to complete the facility. \nConstruction on the memorial began in 1992 and it was dedicated on July \n27, 1995.\n  For those who haven't visited, the Memorial is located south of the \nVietnam Veteran's Memorial on the Mall, to the east of the Lincoln \nMemorial. Designed by world class Cooper Lecky Architects, the monument \ncontains a triangular ``field of service,'' with 19 stainless steel, \nlarger than life statues, depicting a squad of soldiers on patrol. A \ncurb of granite north of the statues lists the 22 countries of the \nUnited Nations that sent troops in defense of South Korea. To the south \nof the patrol stands a wall of black granite, with engraved images of \nmore than 2,400 unamed servicemen and women detailing the countless \nways in which Americans answered the call to service. Adjacent to the \nwall is a fountain which is supposed to be encircled by a Memorial \nGrove of linden trees, creating a peaceful setting for quiet \nreflection. When\n\n[[Page S9434]]\n\nthis memorial was originally created, it was intended to be a lasting \nand fitting tribute to the bravery and sacrifice of our troops who \nfought in the ``Forgotten War.'' Unfortunately, just three years after \nits dedication, the monument is not lasting and is no longer fitting.\n  The Memorial has not functioned as it was originally conceived and \ndesigned and has instead been plagued by a series of problems in its \nconstruction. The grove of 40 linden trees have all died and been \nremoved from the ground, leaving forty gaping holes. The pipes feeding \nthe ``pool of remembrance's'' return system have cracked and the pool \nhas been cordoned off. The monument's lighting system has been deemed \ninadequate and has caused safety problems for those who wish to visit \nthe site at night. As a result, most of the 1.3 million who visit the \nmonument each year--many of whom are veterans--must cope with \nconstruction gates or areas which have been cordoned off instead of \nexperiencing the full effect of the Memorial.\n  Let me read a quote from the Washington Post--from a Korean War \nVeteran, John LeGault who visited the site--that I think captures the \nfrustration associated with not having a fitting and complete tribute \nfor the Korean War. He says, ``Who cares?'' ``That was the forgotten \nwar and this is the forgotten memorial.'' Mr. President, we ought not \nto be sunshine patriots when it comes to making decisions which affect \nour veterans. Too often, we are very high on the contributions that our \nmilitary makes in times of crisis, but when a crisis fades from the \nscene, we seem to forget about this sacrifice. Our veterans deserve \nbetter.\n  To resolve these problems and restore this monument to something that \nour Korean War Veterans can be proud of, the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers conducted an extensive study of the site in an effort to \nidentify, comprehensively, what corrective actions would be required. \nThe Corps has determined that an additional $2 million would be \nrequired to complete the restoration of the grove work and replace the \nstatuary lighting. My legislation would provide the authority for the \nfunds to make these repairs swiftly and once and for all.\n  With the 50th anniversary of the Korean War conflict fast \napproaching, we must ensure that these repairs are made as soon as \npossible. This additional funding would ensure that we have a fitting, \nproper, and lasting tribute to those who served in Korea and that we \nwill never forget those who served in the ``Forgotten War.'' I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2374\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR KOREAN WAR VETERANS \n                   MEMORIAL.\n\n       Section 3 of Public Law 99-572 (40 U.S.C. 1003 note) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n  ``(c) Additional Funding.--\n       ``(1) In general.--In addition to amounts made available \n     under subsections (a) and (b), the Secretary of the Army may \n     expend, from any funds available to the Secretary on the date \n     of enactment of this paragraph, $2,000,000 for repair of the \n     memorial.\n       ``(2) Disposition of funds received from claims.--Any funds \n     received by the Secretary of the Army as a result of any \n     claim against a contractor in connection with construction of \n     the memorial shall be deposited in the general fund of the \n     Treasury.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS:\n  S. 2376. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax incentives for land sales for conservation purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n              the conservation tax incentives act of 1998\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the \nConservation Tax Incentives Act of 1998, a bill that will result in a \nreduction in the capital gains tax for landowners who sell property for \nconservation purposes. This bill creates a new incentive for private, \nvoluntary land protection. This legislation is a cost-effective non-\nregulatory, market-based approach to conservation, and I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in support of it.\n  The tax code's charitable contribution deduction currently provides \nan incentive to taxpayers who give land away for conservation purposes. \nThat is, we already have a tax incentive to encourage people to donate \nland or conservation easements to government agencies like the Fish and \nWildlife Service or to citizens' groups like the Vermont Land Trust. \nThis incentive has been instrumental in the conservation of \nenvironmentally significant land across the country.\n  Not all land worth preserving, however, is owned by people who can \nafford to give it away. For many landowners, their land is their \nprimary financial asset, and they cannot afford to donate it for \nconservation purposes. While they might like to see their land \npreserved in its underdeveloped state, the tax code's incentive for \ndonations is of no help.\n  The Conservation Tax Incentives Act will provide a new tax incentive \nfor sales of land for conservation by reducing the amount of income \nthat landowners would ordinarily have to report--and pay tax on--when \nthey sell their land. The bill provides that when land is sold for \nconservation purposes, only one half of any gain will be included in \nincome. The other half can be excluded from income, and the effect of \nthis exclusion is to cut in half the capital gains tax the seller would \notherwise have to pay. The bill will apply to land and to partial \ninterests in land and water.\n  It will enable landowners to permanently protect a property's \nenvironmental value without forgoing the financial security it \nprovides. The bill's benefits are available to landowners who sell land \neither to a government agency or to a qualified conservation nonprofit \norganization, as long as the land will be used for such conservation \npurposes as protection of fish, wildlife or plant habitat, or as open \nspace for agriculture, forestry, outdoor recreation or scenic beauty.\n  Land is being lost to development and commercial use at an alarming \nrate. By Department of Agriculture estimates, more than four square \nmiles of farmland are lost to development every day, often with \ndevastating effects on the habitat wildlife need to thrive. Without \nadditional incentives for conservation, we will continue to lose \necologically valuable land.\n\n  A real-life example from my home state illustrates the need for this \nbill. A few years ago, in an area of Vermont known as the Northeast \nKingdom, a large well-managed forested property came on the market. The \nland had appreciated greatly over the years and was very valuable \ncommercially. With more than 3,000 acres of mountains, forests, and \nponds, with hiking trails, towering cliffs, scenic views and habitat \nfor many wildlife species, the property was very valuable \nenvironmentally. Indeed, the State of Vermont was anxious to acquire it \nand preserve it for traditional agricultural uses and habitat \nconservation.\n  After the property had been on the market for a few weeks, the seller \nwas contacted by an out-of-state buyer who planned to sell the timber \non the land and to dispose of the rest of the property for development. \nAfter learning of this, the State quickly moved to obtain appraisals \nand a legislative appropriation in preparation for a possible purchase \nof the land by the State. Subsequently, the State and The Nature \nConservancy made a series of purchase offers to the landowner. The out-\nof-state buyer however, prevailed upon the landowner to accept his \noffer. Local newspaper headlines read, ``State of Vermont Loses Out On \nNortheast Kingdom Land Deal.'' The price accepted by the landowner was \nonly slightly higher than the amount the State had offered. Had the \nbill I'm introducing today been on the books, the lower offer by the \nState may well have been as attractive--perhaps more so--than the \namount offered by the developer.\n  This bill provides an incentive-based means for accomplishing \nconservation in the public interest. It helps tax dollars accomplish \nmore, allowing public and charitable conservation funds to go to \nhigher-priority conservation projects. Preliminary estimates indicate \nthat with the benefits of this bill, nine percent more land could be \nacquired, with no increase in the amount governments currently spend \nfor conservation land acquisition. At a time when little money is \navailable for conservation, it is important that we\n\n[[Page S9435]]\n\nstretch as far as possible the dollars that are available.\n  State and local governments will be important beneficiaries of this \nbill. Many local communities have voted in favor of raising taxes to \nfinance bond initiatives to acquire land for conservation. My bill will \nhelp stretch these bond proceeds so that they can go further in \nimproving the conservation results for local communities. In addition, \nbecause the bill applies to sales to publicly-supported national, \nregional, State and local citizen conservation groups, its provisions \nwill strengthen private, voluntary work to save places important to the \nquality of life in communities across the country. Private fundraising \nefforts for land conservation will be enhanced by this bill, as funds \nwill be able to conserve more, or more valuable, land.\n  Let me provide an example to show how I intend the bill to work. \nLet's suppose that in 1952 a young couple purchased a house and a tract \nof adjoining land, which they have maintained as open land. Recently, \nthe county where they lived passed a bond initiative to buy land for \nopen space, as county residents wanted to protect the quality of their \nlife from rampant development and uncontrolled sprawl. Let's further \nassume that the couple, now contemplating retirement, is considering \ncompeting offers for their land, one from a developer, the other from \nthe county, which will preserve the land in furtherance of its open-\nspace goals. Originally purchased for $25,000, the land is now worth \n$250,000 on the open market. If they sell the land to the developer for \nits fair market value, the couple would realize a gain of $225,000 \n($250,000 sales price minus $25,000 costs), owe tax of $45,000 (at a \nrate of 20% on the $225,000 gain), and thus net $205,000 after tax.\n\n  Under my bill, if the couple sold the land for conservation purposes, \nthey could exclude from income one half of any gain they realized upon \nthe sale. This means they would pay a lower capital gains tax; \nconsequently, they would be in a position to accept a lower offer from \na local government or a conservation organization, yet still end up \nwith more money in their pockets than they would have had if they had \naccepted the developer's offer. Continuing with the example from the \npreceding paragraph, let's assume the couple sold the property to the \ncounty, for the purpose of conservation, at a price of $240,000. They \nwould realize a gain of $215,000 ($240,000 sales price minus $25,000 \ncost). Under my bill, only half of this gain $107,500, would be \nincludible in income. The couple would pay $21,500 in capital gains tax \n(at a rate of 20% on the $107,500 gain includible in income) and thus \nnet $218,500 ($240,000 sales price minus $21,500 tax). Despite having \naccepted a sales price $10,000 below the developer's offer, the couple \nwill keep $13,000 more than they would have kept if they had accepted \nhis offer.\n  The end result is a win both for the landowners, who end up with more \nmoney in their pocket than they would have had after a sale to an \noutsider, and for the local community, which is able to preserve the \nland at a lower price. This example illustrates how the exclusion from \nincome will be especially beneficial to middle-income, ``land rich/cash \npoor'' landowners who can't avail themselves of the tax benefits \navailable to those who can afford to donate land.\n  As this bill also applies to partial interests in land, the exclusion \nfrom income--and the resulting reduction in capital gains tax--will, in \ncertain instances, also be available to landowners selling partial \ninterests in their land for conservation purposes. A farmer could, for \nexample, sell a conservation easement, continuing to remain on and farm \nhis land, yet still be able to take advantage of the provisions in this \nbill. The conservation easement must meet the tax code's requirements \ni.e., it must serve a conservation purpose, such as the protection of \nfish or wildlife habitat or the preservation of open space (including \nfarmland and forest land).\n  There are some things this bill does not do. It does not impose new \nregulations or controls on people who own environmentally-sensitive \nland. It does not compel anyone to do anything; it is entirely \nvoluntary. Nor will it increase government spending for land \nconservation. In fact, the effect of this bill will be to allow better \ninvestment of tax and charitable dollars used for land conservation.\n  The estimated cost of this bill is just $50 million annually. This \nmodest cost, however, does not take into account the value of the land \nconserved. It is estimated that for every dollar foregone by the \nFederal treasury, $1.76 in land will be permanently preserved.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join me in support of the Conservation \nTax Incentives Act of 1998.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Leahy, \n        Mr. Cleland, Mr. Durbin, Mr. D'Amato, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 2377. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to limit the concentration \nof sulfur in gasoline used in motor vehicles; to the committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n                       clean gasoline act of 1998\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce today the \nClean Gasoline Act of 1998, a bill to establish a nationwide, year-\nround cap on the sulfur content of gasoline. My bill presents an \nopportunity to make tremendous progress in improving our national air \nquality through a simple, cost-effective measure. Today, 70 million \npeople--30 percent of the nation's population--live in counties which \nexceed heatlh-based ozone standards. For just a few pennies a gallon, \nwe can make our urban environment appreciably better.\n  Sulfur in gasoline contaminates catalytic converters so that they \nremove less of the nitrogen oxide (NOx), carbon monoxide \n(CO), and hydrocarbons (HC) contained in tailpipe emissions. These \npollutants elevate the levels of particulate matter (PM) and contribute \nto ground-level ozone. By reducing the amount of sulfur allowed in \ngasoline sold nationwide, my bill will substantially improve air \nquality, especially in America's largest cities.\n  The current average sulfur content in U.S. gasoline is approximately \n330 parts per million (ppm), and ranges as high as 1,000 ppm. the Clean \nGasoline Act will impose a year-round cap of 40 ppm on the sulfur \ncontent of all gasoline sold in the United States. Under my bill, \nrefineries will also have the option of meeting an 80 ppm cap, provided \nthat they maintain an overall average sulfur content of no more than 30 \nppm.\n  Imposing limits on the sulfur content of gasoline will achieve \ntremendous--and virtually immediate--air quality benefits. The \nemissions reductions achieved by lowering gasoline sulfur levels to 40 \nppm would be equivalent to removing 3 million vehicles from the streets \nof New York, and nearly 54 million vehicles from our roads nationwide.\n  California imposed a similar cap on gasoline sulfur beginning in \n1996, resulting in significant air quality gains. Japan has already \nestablished a 50 ppm gasoline standard, and the European Union \ncurrently has a gasoline sulfur standard of 150 ppm--which will drop to \n50 ppm beginning in the year 2005.\n  The gasoline sulfur cap established by my bill will apply year-round. \nA seasonal cap is insufficient because the damage done to catalytic \nconverters by sulfur poisoning is not fully reversible by typical \ndriving--meaning that vehicle emission controls would be re-poisoned \nevery year when high-sulfur gasoline returned to the market. In the \nabsence of national standards, travel over state boundaries could \ndisable emissions controls.\n  The current high-sulfur content of U.S. gasoline will also preclude \nthe introduction of the next generation of fuel efficiency \ntechnologies--most notably fuel cells and direct-injection gasoline \nengines. U.S. citizen will not have access to these advanced \ntechnologies--unless we adopt low sulfur gasoline standards.\n  Mr. President, I believe our task is clear. A national low sulfur \ngasoline standard will result in considerable health and environmental \nbenefits. It will maximize the effectiveness of currently available \nvehicle emissions technology, and will enable the introduction of the \nnext generation of vehicle technology into the U.S. market. Refineries \ncan reduce the sulfur content of gasoline using existing technology \nthat is already being used to supply markets in California, Japan, and \nthe European Union. Our national fleet is already comprised of world-\nclass vehicles. It is time for us to provide this fleet with world-\nclass fuel. I\n\n[[Page S9436]]\n\nurge my colleagues to join my cosponsors and me in supporting this \nimportant legislation.\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I join Senator Moynihan in \noffering legislation that would reduce the sulfur content of gasoline. \nCurrent levels of sulfur in gasoline lead to high nitrogen oxide, \ncarbon monoxide, and hydrocarbon emissions by weakening catalytic \nconverter emission controls. These emissions elevate ground-level ozone \nand particulate matter pollution.\n  As we all have learned, long-term exposure to ozone pollution can \nhave significant health impacts, including asthma attacks, breathing \nand respiratory problems, loss of lung function, and lowered immunity \nto disease. The EPA has compared breathing ozone to getting a sunburn \nin your lungs. Children, including Vermont's approximately 10,000 \nasthmatic children, are at special risk for adverse health effects from \nozone pollution. Children playing outside in the summer time, the \nseason when concentrations of ground-level ozone are the greatest, may \nsuffer from coughing, decreased lung function, and have trouble \ncatching their breath. Exposure to particulate matter pollution is \nsimilarly dangerous causing premature death, increased respiratory \nsymptoms and disease, decreased lung function, and alterations in lung \ntissue. These pollutants also result in adverse environmental effects \nsuch as acid rain and visibility impairment.\n  Mr. President, this bill will reduce these pollutants in our \ncommunities, and more importantly it will reduce these pollutants cost-\neffectively. To reduce the sulfur content of gasoline, refineries can \nuse currently available technology. These measures will not break the \nbank. California has already adopted the measures in this bill on a \nstatewide basis. So have Japan and the members of the European Union.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Let's clean \nup our air so we can all breathe just a little bit easier.\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am pleased today to announce \nthat I have added my name as an original co-sponsors of the Low Sulfur \nFuel Act of 1998 and to express my reasons for supporting this \nimportant legislation. I would first like to thank my colleague from \nNew York, Senator Moynihan, for his authorship of this measure and his \nleadership on this issue. The bill establishes a national, year-round \ncap on gasoline sulfur levels, and would impose a reduction of sulfur \ncontent in gasoline from 300 parts per million (ppm) to 40 ppm within \ntwo years from the date of enactment.\n  High sulfur levels in gasoline increase vehicle emissions of nitrogen \noxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrocarbons (HC) \nwhich in turn produce higher levels of particulate matter (PM) and \ncontribute to ground level ozone. Reducing sulfur content levels to 40 \nppm has been shown to reduce Nitrogen Oxides by 51 percent, Carbon \nMonoxide by 40 percent, and Hydrocarbons by 24 percent. Essentially, \nthe sulfur in gasoline inhibits the catalyst in an automobile from \ndoing its job--which is to reduce the emissions of the aforementioned \npollutants. Sulfur is a contaminant only and does not in any way \nenhance engine performance.\n  There are two compelling reasons which led me to support this bill: \nFirst, helping our states attain the health requirements set forth by \nthe Clean Air Act by providing them with a viable tool for reducing \nNOx and CO emissions; and second, updating our gasoline to \nkeep pace with other industrialized nations thereby keeping our \nautomotive fleet competitive in the international marketplace.\n  In my home state of Georgia, the Metro Atlanta area has experienced \nextensive difficulties in complying with the standards set forth by the \nClean Air Act. In a recent attempt to meet these standards, the Georgia \nDepartment of Natural Resources (DNR), has voted to implement reduced \nsulfur content in fuel. The rule would require gasoline in the 25 \ncounty area surrounding Atlanta to be reduced to 30 ppm by 2003. \nGeorgia is only the second state, after California, to take such \ninnovative steps to meet air quality goals. In my review of this bill, \nI sent a copy to Harold Reheis, Director of the Georgia Environmental \nProtection Division (EPD), an agency of the Georgia DNR for his \ncomments. In his response, which I will ask unanimous consent to add as \npart of the Record after my statement, Mr. Reheis states that the \nMoynihan bill would ``result in a reduction in air pollutants statewide \nand nationwide.'' Further, he added that this bill ``could help prevent \nozone nonattainment problems in other urban areas of Georgia like \nAugusta, Columbus, and Macon, which all could have difficulty meeting \nthe tighter federal ozone standards adopted by the USEPA last year.'' I \nencourage all my colleagues to contact their State Environmental \nAgencies to request their input on this matter.\n  Relating to the second point in support of the bill, the U.S. must \nmaintain our innovative and forward thinking approach and support this \nmeasure because other countries, such as Japan, Egypt, Thailand, and \nevery member of the European Union have already required similar caps \non the sulfur content of their gasoline. Thus, in order for us to \ncompete with these and other countries, we must take this extremely \nvaluable step. California has already taken such action and now we have \nthe opportunity to send a message to the rest of the world, that we, as \na nation, are committed to cleaner, more fuel efficient gasoline. \nFurther, we should signify that we are committed to ensuring that our \nauto industry and the U.S. consumer are equipped with the \ninfrastructure necessary to take advantage of the emerging market for \nnew, innovative, less polluting automobiles.\n  There is a real possibility that if the U.S. does not take this \naction, we would fall behind the rest of the industrialized world--a \nposition that the US should never be in--and become the dumping ground \nfor higher sulfur level fuels--making it more difficult to shift to the \nlower sulfur fuels and inhibiting U.S. automakers from producing and \nU.S. consumers from purchasing, cleaner and more fuel efficient \ntechnologies.\n  The crux of this issue is that reducing sulfur content in gasoline to \n40 ppm, year round, is a viable, cost-effective tool to dramatically \nreduce pollutants which cause high levels of Particulate Matter as well \nas Ozone and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Mr. Reheis be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                Georgia Department\n\n\n                                         of Natural Resources,\n\n                                       Atlanta, GA, June 22, 1998.\n     Hon. Max Cleland,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cleland: Thank you for sharing with EPD the \n     proposed bill by Senator Moynihan to require the use of low \n     sulfur gasoline all over the United States. The bill is a \n     fine idea, and we have done something similar in Georgia. The \n     Board of Natural Resources, upon my recommendation, recently \n     promulgated rules to require low sulfur gasoline to be sold \n     in 25 counties in and around Metro Atlanta starting May 1999.\n       The proposed Senate bill would result in a reduction in air \n     pollutants statewide and nationwide. This could help prevent \n     ozone nonattainment problems in other urban areas of Georgia \n     like Augusta, Columbus, and Macon, which all could have \n     difficulty meeting the tighter federal ozone standards \n     adopted by USEPA last year.\n       I think the bill deserves your support. Please contact me \n     if you need future information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Harold F. Reheis,\n                                                 Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 2378. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nincrease the amount of payment under the Medicare program for pap smear \nlaboratory tests; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             investment in women's health care act of 1998\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I introduce the Investment in Women's \nHealth Act of 1998, a bill to increase Medicare reimbursement for Pap \nsmear laboratory tests. This is the Senate companion measure to the \nbill introduced in the House by my colleague and friend, Representative \nNeil Abercrombie.\n  Last year, I was contacted by pathologists who alerted me to the \ncost-payment differential for Pap smear testing in Hawaii. According to \nthe American Pathology Foundation, Hawaii is one of 23 states where the \ncost of performing the test significantly exceeds the Medicare payment. \nIn Hawaii, the cost of performing the test\n\n[[Page S9437]]\n\nranges between $13.04 and $15.80. The Medicare reimbursement rate is \nonly $7.15.\n  This large disparity between the reimbursement rate and the actual \ncost may force labs in Hawaii and other states to discontinue Pap smear \ntesting. Additionally, the below-cost-reimbursement may compel some \nlabs to process tests faster and in higher volume to improve cost \nefficiency. This situation increases the risk of inaccurate results and \ncan severely handicap patient outcomes.\n  If the Pap smear is to continues an effective cancer screening tool, \nit must remain widely available and reasonably priced for all women. \nAdequate payment is a necessary component of ensuring women's continued \naccess to quality Pap smears.\n  My bill will increase the Medicare reimbursement rate for Pap smear \nlab work from its current $7.15 to $14.60--the national average cost of \nthe test. This rate is important because it establishes a benchmark for \nmany private insurers.\n  No other cancer screening procedure is as effective for early \ndetection of cancer as the Pap smear. Over the last 50 years, the \nincidence of cervical cancer deaths has declined by 70 percent due in \nlarge part to the use of this cancer detection measure. Experts agree \nthat the detection and treatment of precancerous lesions can actually \nprevent cervical cancer. Evidence also shows that the likelihood of \nsurvival when cervical cancer is detected in its earliest stage is \nalmost 100 percent with timely and appropriate treatment and follow-up.\n  Mr. President, an estimated 13,700 new cases of invasive cervical \ncancer will be diagnosed in 1998 and 4,900 women will die of the \ndisease. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of the average Pap \nsmear production costs for 23 states be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                       Pap Smear Production Costs\n\nCalifornia.......................................................$18.84\n                                                                  17.11\n                                                                  17.00\n                                                                  13.05\nColorado..........................................................16.94\nConnecticut.......................................................16.87\nDelaware..........................................................22.00\nFlorida...........................................................14.00\nGeorgia...........................................................10.73\nHawaii............................................................13.04\n                                                                  14.04\n                                                                  15.40\n                                                                  15.80\nIllinois..........................................................13.12\nIowa..............................................................13.78\nKansas............................................................14.62\nKentucky..........................................................16.00\n                                                                  13.01\nMaryland..........................................................14.05\nMichigan..........................................................13.16\nNebraska..........................................................16.12\nNew Mexico........................................................20.65\nOhio..............................................................18.46\n                                                                  14.15\n                                                                  14.50\nSouth Carolina....................................................16.89\n                                                                  13.00\nSouth Dakota......................................................10.25\nTennessee.........................................................12.36\nTexas.............................................................13.50\nVermont...........................................................18.92\nWashington........................................................11.64\n                                                                  12.00\n                                                                  12.52\n                                                                  12.90\n                                                                  12.91\n                                                                  13.22\n                                                                  13.42\n                                                                  14.69\nWisconsin.........................................................13.00\n\nNote.--This data was obtained from the American Pathology Foundation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Daschle):\n  S. 2379. A bill to establish a program to establish and sustain \nviable rural and remote communities; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs\n\n\n          the rural and remote community fairness act of 1998\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I introduce the Rural and \nRemote Community Fairness Act of 1998. This Act will lead to a brighter \nfuture for rural and remote communities by establishing two new grant \nprograms that will address the unique economic and environmental \nchallenges faced by small communities in rural and remote areas across \nthis country. I am pleased that this legislation is co-sponsored by the \nMinority Leader, Senator Daschle.\n  The bill authorizes up to $100 million a year in grant aid from 1999 \nthrough 2005 for any commuunities across the nation with populations of \nless than 10,000 which face electric rates in excess of 150 percent of \nthe national average retail price. The money can go for electricity \nsystem improvements, energy efficiency and weatherization efforts, \nwater and sanitation improvements or work to solve leaking fuel storage \ntanks.\n  The bill also amends the Rural Electrification Act to authorize Rural \nand Remote Electrification Grants of an additional $20 million a year \nto the same communities. The grants can be used to increase energy \nefficiency, lower electricity rates or provide for the modernization of \nelectric facilities.\n  This nation has well-established programs for community development \ngrants. The majority of these programs were established to help resolve \nthe very real problems found in this Nation's urban areas. However, our \nmost rural and remote communities experience different, but equally \nreal, problems that are not addressed by existing law. Not only are \nthese communities generally ineligible for the existing programs, their \nunique challenges, while sometimes similar to those experienced by \nurban areas, require a different focus and approach.\n  The biggest single economic problem facing small communities is the \nexpense of establishing a modern infrastructure. These costs, which are \nalways substantial, are exacerbated in remote and rural areas. The \nexistence of this infrastructure, including efficient housing, \nelectricity, bulk fuel storage, waste water and water service, is a \nnecessity for the health and welfare of our children, the development \nof a prosperous economy and minimizing environmental problems.\n  There is a real cost in human misery and to the health and welfare of \neveryone, especially our children and our elderly from poor or polluted \nwater or bad housing or an inefficient power system. Hepatitis B \ninfections in rural Alaska are five times more common than in urban \nAlaska. We just have to do better if we are to bring our rural \ncommunities into the 21st Century.\n  The experience of many Alaskans is a perfect example. Most small \ncommunities or villages in Alaska are not interconnected to an \nelectricity grid, and rely upon diesel generators for their \nelectricity. Often, the fuel can only be delivered by barge or \nairplane, and is stored in tanks. These tanks are expensive to \nmaintain, and in many cases, must be completely replaced to prevent \nleakage of fuel into the environment. While economic and environmental \nsavings clearly justify the construction of new facilities, these \ncommunities simply don't have the ability to raise enough capital to \nmake the necessary investments.\n  As a result, these communities are forced to bear an oppressive \neconomic and environmental burden that can be eased with a relatively \nsmall investment on the part of the Federal government. I can give you \nsome examples: in Manley Hot Springs, Alaska, the citizens pay almost \n70 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity. In Igiugig, Kokhanok, \nAkiachak Native Community, and Middle Kuskokwim, consumers all pay over \n50 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity. The national average is \naround 7 cents per kilowatt hour.\n  Further, in Alaska, for example, many rural villages still lack \nmodern water and sewer sanitation systems taken for granted in all \nother areas of America. According to a Federal Field Working Group, 190 \nof the state's villages have ``unsafe'' sanitation systems, 135 \nvillages still using ``honey buckets'' for waste disposal. Only 31 \nvillages have a fully safe, piped water system; 71 villages having only \none central watering source.\n  Concerning leaking storage tanks, the Alaska Department of Community \nand Regional Affairs estimates that there are more than 2,000 leaking \nabove-ground fuel storage tanks in Alaska. There are several hundred \nother below-ground tanks that need repair, according to the Alaska \nDepartment of Environmental Conservation.\n  These are not only an Alaskan problem. The highest electricity rates \nin America are paid by a small community in Missouri, and communities \nin Maine, as well as islands in Rhode Island and New York will likely \nqualify\n\n[[Page S9438]]\n\nfor this program. Providing safe drinking water and adequate waste \ntreatment facilities is a problem for very small communities all across \nthis land.\n  What will this Act do to address these problems? First, the Act \nauthorizes $100 million per year for the years 1999-2005 for block \ngrants to communities of under 10,000 inhabitants who pay more than 150 \npercent of the national average retail price for electricity.\n\n  The grants will be allocated by the Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment among eligible communities proportionate to cost of \nelectricity in the community, as compared to the national average. The \ncommunities may use the grants only for the following eligible \nactivities:\n  Low-cost weatherization of homes and other buildings;\n  Construction and repair of electrical generation, transmission, \ndistribution, and related facilities;\n  Construction, remediation and repair of bulk fuel storage facilities;\n  Facilities and training to reduce costs of maintaining and operating \nelectrical generation, distribution, transmission, and related \nfacilities;\n  Professional management and maintenance for electrical generation, \ndistribution and transmission, and related facilities;\n  Investigation of the feasibility of alternate energy services;\n  Construction, operation, maintenance and repair of water and waste \nwater services;\n  Acquisition and disposition of real property for eligible activities \nand facilities; and\n  Development of an implementation plan, including administrative costs \nfor eligible activities and facilities.\n  In addition, this bill will amend the rural Electrification Act of \n1936 to authorize Rural and Remote Electrification Grants for $20 \nmillion per year for years 1999-2005 for grants to qualified borrowers \nunder the Act that are in rural and remote communities who pay more \nthan 150 percent of the national average retail price for electricity. \nThese grants can be used to increase energy efficiency, lower \nelectricity rates, or provide or modernize electric facilities.\n  This Act makes a significant step toward resolving the critical \nsocial, economic, and environmental problems faced by our Nation's \nrural and remote communities. I encourage my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT:\n  S. 2380. A bill to require the written consent of a parent of an \nunemancipated minor prior to the provision of contraceptive drugs or \ndevices to such a minor, or the referral of such minor for abortion \nservices, under any Federally funded program; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                       putting parents first act\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nreaffirm the vital role parents play in the lives of their children. My \nlegislation, the Putting Parents First Act, will guarantee that parents \nhave the opportunity to be involved in their children's most important \ndecisions--whether or not to have an abortion and whether or not to \nreceive federally-subsidized contraception.\n  The American people have long understood the unique role the family \nplays in our most cherished values. As usual, President Reagan said it \nbest. Within the American family, Reagan said, ``the seeds of personal \ncharacter are planted, the roots of public value first nourished. \nThrough love and instruction, discipline, guidance and example, we \nlearn from our mothers and fathers the values that will shape our \nprivate lives and public citizenship.''\n  The Putting Parents First Act contains two distinct provisions to \nprotect the role of parents in the important life decisions of their \nminor children. The first part ensures that parents are given every \nopportunity to be involved in a child's decision whether or not to have \nan abortion. Specifically, the Act prohibits any individual from \nperforming an abortion upon a woman under the age of 18 unless that \nindividual has secured the informed written consent of the minor and a \nparent or guardian. In accordance with Supreme Court decisions \nconcerning state-passed parental consent laws, the Putting Parents \nFirst Act allows a minor to forego the parental involvement requirement \nwhere a court has issued a waiver certifying that the process of \nobtaining the consent of a parent or guardian is not in the best \ninterests of the minor or that the minor is emancipated.\n  For too long, the issue of abortion has polarized the American \npeople. To some extent, this is the inevitable result of vastly \ndistinct views of what an abortion is. Many, including myself, view \nabortion as the unconscionable taking of innocent human life. Others, \nincluding a majority of Supreme Court Justices, view abortion as a \nconstitutionally-protected alternative for pregnant women.\n  There are, however, a few areas of common ground where people on both \nsides of the abortion issue can agree. One such area of agreement is \nthat, whenever possible, parents should be involved in helping their \nyoung daughters to make the critically important decision of whether or \nnot to have an abortion. A recent CNN/USA Today survey conducted by the \nGallup Organization found that 74 percent of Americans support parental \nconsent before an abortion is performed on a girl under age 18. Even \nthose who do not view an abortion as a taking of human life recognize \nit as a momentous and life-changing decision that a minor should not \nmake alone. The fact that nearly 40 states have passed laws requiring \ndoctors to notify or seek the consent of a minor's parents before \nperforming an abortion also demonstrates the consensus in favor of \nparental involvement.\n\n  The instruction and guidance of which President Reagan spoke are \nneeded most when children are forced to make important life decisions. \nIt is hard to imagine a decision more fundamental in our culture than \nwhether or not to beget a child. Parental involvement in this crucial \ndecision is necessary to ensure that the sanctity of human life is \ngiven appropriate consideration. There are few more issues deserving of \nour attention than promoting parental involvement.\n  Only half of the 39 states with parental involvement laws on the \nbooks currently enforce them. Some states have enacted laws that have \nbeen struck down in state or federal courts while in other states the \nexecutive department has chosen not to enforce the legislature's will. \nAs a result, just over 20 states have parental laws in effect today. In \nthese states, parents do not have the right to be involved in their \nminor children's most fundamental decisions, decisions that can have \nsevere physical and emotional health consequences for young women.\n  Moreover, in those states where laws requiring consent are on the \nbooks and being enforced, those laws are frequently circumvented by \npregnant minors who cross state lines to avoid the laws' requirements. \nSadly, nowhere is this problem more apparent than in my home state of \nMissouri. I was proud to have successfully defended Missouri's parental \nconsent law before the Supreme Court in Planned Parenthood versus \nAshcroft. Unfortunately, the law has not been as effective as I had \nhoped. A study last year in the American Journal of Public Health found \nthat the odds of a minor traveling out of state for an abortion \nincreased by over 50 percent after Missouri's parental consent law went \ninto effect.\n  The limited degree of enforcement and the ease with which state laws \ncan be evaded demand a national solution. The importance of protecting \nlife demands a national solution. It is time for Congress to act. \nRequiring a parent's consent before a minor can receive an abortion is \none way states have chosen to protect not only the role of parents and \nthe health and safety of young women, but also, the lives of the \nunborn. Congress shares with the states the authority--and duty--to \nprotect life under the Constitution. Thus, enactment of a federal \nparental consent law will allow Congress to protect the guiding role of \nparents as it protects human life.\n  The Putting Parents First Act is based on state statutes that already \nhave been determined to be constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. \nThe legislation establishes a minimum level of parental involvement \nthat must be honored nationwide. It does not preempt state parental \ninvolvement laws that provide additional protections to the parents of \npregnant minors.\n\n[[Page S9439]]\n\n  The second part of the Putting Parents First Act extends the idea of \nparental involvement to the arena of federally-subsidized \ncontraception. Currently, the federal government funds many different \nprograms through the Department of Health and Human Services and the \nDepartment of Education that can provide prescription contraceptive \ndrugs and devices, as well as abortion referrals, to minors without \nparental consent.\n  The case of the little girl from Crystal Lake, IL is just one \nexample, but it makes clear everything that is wrong with current law \nin this area. In that case, the young girl was just 14 years old when \nher 37-year-old teacher brought her to the county health department for \nbirth control injections. He wanted to continue having sex with her, \nbut had grown tired of using condoms. A county health official injected \nthe young girl with the controversial birth control drug Depo-Provera \nwithout notifying the girl's parents. The teacher knew that federal \nTitle X rules prohibited clinics from notifying parents when issuing \nbirth control drugs to minors. He continued to molest her for 18 months \nuntil the girl finally broke down and told her parents. The teacher was \narrested and sentenced to ten years in prison. The young girl spent \nfive days a week in therapy and is still recovering from effects of \nanorexia nervosa.\n  Although the teacher's crime was unspeakable, it was the federal \ngovernment's policy that allowed him to shield his crime for so long. \nThis is an outrage. The policy of the Government of the United States \nshould be to help parents to help their children. Providing \ncontraceptives and abortion referrals to children without involving \nparents undermines, not strengthens the role of parents. Worse yet, it \njeopardizes the health of children.\n  The current law for federally-funded contraceptives puts bureaucrats \nin front of parents when it comes to a child's decision-making process. \nThat is intolerable. We must put parents first when it comes to such \ncritical decisions. The legislation I am introducing today restores \ncommon sense to government policy by requiring programs that receive \nfederal funds to obtain a parent's consent before dispensing \ncontraceptives or referring abortion services to the parent's minor \nchild.\n  In my view, Mr. President, sound and sensible public policy requires \nthat parents be involved in critical, life-shaping decisions involving \ntheir children. A young person whose life is in crisis may be highly \nanxious, and may want to take a fateful step without their parents' \nknowledge. But it is at these times of crisis that children need their \nparents, not government bureaucrats or uninvolved strangers. This \nlegislation will strengthen the family and protect human life by \nensuring that parents have the primary role in helping their children \nwhen they are making decisions that will shape the rest of their lives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 2382. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nallow certain community-based organizations and health care providers \nto determine that a child is presumptively eligible for medical \nassistance under a State plan under that title; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n  children's health assurance through the medicaid program (champ) act\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am proud to rise with my \ncolleague and dear friend, John Kerry, to introduce legislation which \nwould help provide thousands, if not millions, of children with health \ncare coverage. Clearly, a bipartisan priority in the 105th Congress has \nbeen to find a solution for providing access to health insurance for \nthe approximately 10 million uninsured children in our nation. This \nmatter has been a very high priority for me since coming to Congress. \nThe legislation we are introducing today, the ``Children's Health \nAssurance through the Medicaid Program'' (CHAMP), would help our states \nreach more than 3 million uninsured children who are eligible for the \nMedicaid program but not enrolled.\n\n  The consequences of lack of insurance are problematic for everyone, \nbut they are particularly serious for children. Uninsured and low \nincome children are less likely to receive vital primary and \npreventative care services. This is quite discouraging since it is \nrepeatedly demonstrated that regular health care visits facilitate the \ncontinuity of care which plays a critical role in the development of a \nhealthy child. For example, one analysis found that children living in \nfamilies with incomes below the poverty line were more likely to go \nwithout a physician visit than those with Medicaid coverage or those \nwith other insurance. The result is many uninsured, low-income children \nnot seeking health care services until they are seriously sick.\n  Studies have further demonstrated that many of these children are \nmore likely to be hospitalized or receive their care in emergency \nrooms, which means higher health care costs for conditions that could \nhave been treated with appropriate outpatient services or prevented \nthrough regular check ups.\n  Last year, as Congress was searching for ways to reduce the number of \nuninsured children, I kept hearing about children who are uninsured, \nyet, could qualify for health care insurance through the Medicaid \nprogram. I was unable to find specific information about who these \nchildren are, where they reside, and why they are not enrolled in the \nMedicaid program. Subsequently, I requested that the General Accounting \nOffice conduct an in-depth analysis to provide Congress data on \nuninsured Medicaid eligible children. This information would provide \nthe necessary tools to develop community outreach strategies and \neducation programs to address this problem.\n  The GAO study was completed in March. The data shows that 3.4 million \nchildren are eligible for the Medicaid program (under the minimum \nfederal standards) but are not enrolled. It also shows that these kids \nare more likely to be part of a working family with parents who are \nemployed but earning a low income. A significant number of these \nchildren come from two-parent families rather than single-parent \nfamilies. The study also discovered that more than thirty-five percent \nof these children are Hispanic, with seventy-four percent of them \nresiding in Southern or Western states. Finally, the GAO report \nsuggested that states need to be developing and implementing creative \noutreach and enrollment strategies which specifically target the \nunenrolled children.\n  It is important that we build upon these findings and develop methods \nfor states to reach out to these families and educate them about the \nresources which exist for their children. The CHAMP bill is an \nimportant step in this process and would assist these children by \nexpanding the state offices which can presume Medicaid eligibility for \na child.\n  As you know, the 1997 Balanced Budget Act provided states with the \noption of utilizing ``presumptive eligibility'' as an outreach method \nfor enrolling eligible children into their state Medicaid programs. \nPresumptive eligibility allows certain agencies to temporarily enroll \nchildren in the state Medicaid program for a brief period if the child \nappears to be eligible for the program based on their family's income. \nHealth care services can be provided to these children if necessary \nduring this ``presumptive'' period while the state Medicaid agency \nprocesses the child's application and makes a final determination of \ntheir eligibility.\n  Presumptive eligibility is completely optional for the states and is \nnot mandatory.\n  Under current law, states are only given the limited choice of using \na few specific community agencies for presumptive eligibility \nincluding: Head Start Centers, WIC clinics, Medicaid providers and \nstate or local child care agencies. The McCain-Kerry CHAMP bill would \nexpand the types of community-based organizations which would be \nrecognized as qualified entities and permitted to presume eligibility \nfor children. Under our bill, public schools, entities operating child \nwelfare programs under Title IV-A, Temporary Assistance to Needy \nFamilies (TANF) offices and the new Children Health Insurance Program \n(CHIP) offices would be permitted to help identify Medicaid eligible \nkids. Allowing more entities to participate in outreach would increase \nthe opportunities for screening children and educating their families \nabout the Medicaid services available to\n\n[[Page S9440]]\n\nthem. By increasing the ``net'' for states, we would be helping them \n``capture'' more children who are going without health care services \nbecause their families are not familiar, comfortable or aware of the \nMedicaid program and its enrollment process.\n  Our bill would help millions of children gain access to health care \nwithout creating a new government program, imposing mandates on states, \nor expanding the role of government in our communities. This is \nimportant to note--we would not be creating new agencies, bureaucracies \nor benefits. Instead we would be increasing the efficiency and \neffectiveness of a long-standing program designed to help one of our \nmost vulnerable populations, children. We urge our colleagues to \nsupport this innovative piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2382\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Children's Health Assurance \n     through the Medicaid Program (CHAMP) Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Twenty-three percent or 3,400,000 of the 15,000,000 \n     medicaid-eligible children went without health insurance in \n     1996.\n       (2) Medicaid-eligible children with working parents are \n     more likely to be uninsured.\n       (3) More than 35 percent of the 3,400,000 million uninsured \n     medicaid-eligible children are Hispanic.\n       (4) Almost three-fourths of the uninsured medicaid-eligible \n     children live in the Western and Southern States.\n       (5) Multiple studies have shown that insured children are \n     more likely to receive preventive and primary health care \n     services as well as to have a relationship with a physician.\n       (6) Studies have shown that a lack of health insurance \n     prevents parents from trying to obtain preventive health care \n     for their children.\n       (7) These studies demonstrate that low-income and uninsured \n     children are more likely to be hospitalized for conditions \n     that could have been treated with appropriate outpatient \n     services, resulting in higher health care costs.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I want to thank my friend and \ncolleague Senator McCain for his work on this important issue. I am \nhonored to introduce with him this legislation, entitled the Children's \nHealth Assurance Through the Medicaid Program (CHAMP), which would \nincrease health coverage for eligible children and increase state \nflexibility.\n  Mr. President, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 gave States the option \nto bring more eligible but uninsured children into Medicaid by allowing \nstates to grant ``presumptive eligibility.'' This means that a child \nwould temporarily be covered by Medicaid if preliminary information \nsuggests that they qualify. Providing health insurance for children is \nimportant because studies show that children without health insurance \nare more likely to be in worse health, less likely to see a doctor, and \nless likely to receive preventive care such as immunizations.\n  Mr. President, the legislation Senator McCain and I are introducing \ntoday would strengthen the existing option and give states more \nflexibility. First, it will allow states to rely on a broader range of \nagencies to assist with Medicaid outreach and enrollment. By expanding \nthe list of community-based providers and state and local agencies to \ninclude schools, child support agencies, and some child care \nfacilities, states will be able to make significant gains in the number \nof children identified and enrolled in Medicaid. States would not be \nrequired to rely on these additional providers but would have the \nflexibility to choose among qualified providers and shape their own \noutreach and enrollment strategies.\n  The cost of these changes to the presumptive eligibility option for \nMedicaid under last year's Balanced Budget Act are modest. Our \nunderstanding is that our proposal would cost approximately $250 \nmillion over five years. This is a positive step in the right \ndirection, helping ensure that the growing population of American \nchildren start off on the right foot. Access to affordable health care \nin the early years saves the country's financial resources in the long \nrun.\n  Once again, I would like to thank Senator McCain for his invaluable \nwork on behalf of children. I look forward to working with him and the \nSenate to pass this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, and Ms. \n        Moseley-Braun):\n  S. 2383. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nreform the provisions relating to child labor; to the Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources.\n\n\n             THE CHILDREN'S ACT FOR RESPONSIBLE EMPLOYMENT\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Mr. Kennedy, \nMr. Kerry and Ms. Moseley-Braun I introduce the Children's Act for \nResponsible Employment or the CARE Act that will modernize our \nantiquated domestic child labor laws. Congressman Richard Gephardt and \nCongressman Tom Lantos are introducing companion legislation in the \nHouse.\n  It is hard to imagine that we are on the verge of entering the 21st \ncentury and we still have young children working under hazardous \nconditions in the United States. Unfortunately, outdated U.S. child \nlabor laws that have not been revamped since the 1930's allow this \npractice to continue.\n  I have been working on the eradication of child labor overseas since \n1992. At that time, I introduced the Child Labor Deterrence Act, which \nprohibits the importation of products made by abusive and exploitative \nchild labor. Since then, we have made some important progress, but in \norder to end child labor overseas the U.S. must lead by example and \naddress child labor in our own backyard.\n  Now, when I talk about child labor, I'm not talking about a part time \njob or a teenager who helps out on the family farm after school. There \nis nothing wrong with that. What I am talking about is the nearly \n300,000 children illegally employed in the U.S. I would like to insert \nfor the record at this time the testimony of Sergio Reyes, who was \nexpected to testify at a hearing before the Senate Subcommittee on \nEmployment and Training I requested on June 11 of this year. Mr. Reyes \nwas unable to attend that hearing but his written testimony tells a \nstory that is becoming all to familiar in the United States.\n  According to a recent study by economist Douglas L. Krause of Rutgers \nUniversity, there are nearly 60,000 children under age 14 working in \nthe U.S. Of those children, one will die every five days in a work \nrelated accident according to the National Institute of Occupational \nSafety and Health. Nowhere is this more true than children who work in \nagriculture.\n  In general, children receive fewer protections in agriculture than \nother industries. The minimum age for hazardous work in agriculture is \n16, it is 18 for all other occupations. In a GAO preliminary report \nreleased in March 1998, the researchers noted that ``children working \nin agriculture are legally permitted to work at younger ages, in more \nhazardous occupations, and for longer periods of time than their peers \nin other industries.'' For example, a 13 year old child can not work as \na clerk in an air conditioned office building, but can pick \nstrawberries in a field in the middle of summer. That same report noted \nthat over 155,000 children\n\n[[Page S9441]]\n\nare working in agriculture. However, because that number is based on \ncensus data, the Farm Worker Union places the number at nearly 800,000 \nchildren working in agriculture.\n  In December 1997, the Associated Press (AP) did a five part series on \nchild labor in the United States documenting 4 year olds picking chili \npeppers in New Mexico and 10 year olds harvesting cucumbers in Ohio. In \none tragic example reported by the AP, 14 year-old Alexis Jaimes was \ncrushed to death when a 5000 lb. hammer fell on him while working on a \nconstruction site in Texas. I was outraged.\n  At the June hearing of the Senate Employment and Training \nSubcommittee, two things became clear with regard to U.S. domestic \nchild labor. First, agricultural child laborers are dropping out of \nschool at an alarming rate. Over of 45 percent of farm worker youth \nwill never complete high school. Second, the laws that we do have \nregarding child labor are inadequate to protect a modern workforce. Our \npresent civil and criminal penalties are simply insufficient to deter \ncompliance with the law and need to be strengthened and more vigorously \nenforced.\n  My legislation, which is supported by the Administration and \nchildren's advocates groups across the country, such as the Child Labor \nCoalition and the Solidarity Center, will help rectify this alarming \nsituation. It will; raise the current age of 16 to 18 in order to \nengage in hazardous agricultural work, close the loopholes in federal \nchild labor laws which allow a three year old to work in the fields, \nand increase the civil and criminal penalties for child labor \nviolations to a minimum of $500, up from $100 and a maximum of $15,000, \nup from $10,000.\n  In closing. Let me say that we must end child labor--the last vestige \nof slavery in the world. It is time to give all children the chance at \na real childhood and give them the skills necessary to compete in \ntomorrow's work place. There is no excuse for the number of children \nbeing maimed or killed in work related accidents when labor saving \ntechnologies have been developed in recent years. So, on today's farms, \nit makes even less sense than ever to put kids in dangerous situations \noperating hazardous machinery.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we will be able to vote on this \nlegislation in the near future so that we can prepare our children for \nthe 21st century. I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill, a \nletter from the Child Labor Coalition, and the testimony of Sergio \nReyes be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2383\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: The Child Labor Coalition thanks you \n     for your leadership over the last six years to end child \n     labor exploitation overseas. Your influence has spurred much \n     of the progress that has been made in the international \n     community.\n       As you are certainly aware, the United States is not immune \n     to child labor problems. Two of our most significant problems \n     are the escalating injuries to young workers and the \n     inadequate protection of children working in agriculture. The \n     legislation you are introducing is a positive step toward \n     addressing these problems.\n       Evey year, more than 200,000 minors are injured and more \n     than 100 die in the workplace. Research has shown that \n     injuries often occur when youth are engaged in prohibited \n     duties or occupations. Your legislation to increase penalties \n     for child labor violations will send a clear message to \n     employers to ensure the safety of their young workers through \n     increased diligence in following the child labor laws.\n       The FLSA does not adequately protect children working as \n     hired farmworkers. Children may work at younger ages, for \n     more hours, and engage in hazardous employment at a younger \n     age than a minor employed in any other workplace or \n     occupation. This has to change and your legislation to \n     equalize the protections of all children who are working, \n     regardless of the occupation, is applauded.\n       On behalf of the more than 50 organizational members of the \n     Child Labor Coalition we thank you for your efforts to update \n     our nation's child labor laws and wholeheartedly support this \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Darlene S.

My name is Sergio Reyes, and I'm 15 years \n     old. This is my brother Oscar and he is nine years old. We're \n     from Hollister, California, and we are farmworkers like our \n     father and our grandfather. We are permanent residents here \n     in the United States. Thank you for inviting us to speak \n     today about our experience being frameworkers. We both have \n     been farmworkers for five years now, ever since our family \n     came from Mexico. I started working when I was 10 years old, \n     and Oscar started when he was four. He has been working for \n     more than half of his life. We work for as many as 10 hours a \n     days, cutting paprika, topping garlic and pulling onions. The \n     work is very hard and it gets very hot. It's tough working \n     these long and going to school too. We work after school, \n     during the weekends, during the summer and on holidays. Oscar \n     can show you some of the tools that we use and how we top \n     garlic and cut onions. I don't have any idea when pesticides \n     are used on these crops or not.\n       To do this work we have to stay bent over for most of the \n     time and have to lift heavy bags and buckets filled with the \n     crops that we're picking. It's hard work for adults and very \n     hard work for kids. We work because our family needs the \n     money. I'd rather be in school. I am in the 10th grade and \n     someday I'd like to be a lawyer. Oscar wants to be fireman \n     when he grow up. My family knows how important it is to go to \n     school and get an education. But there are times when working \n     is more important. We know lots of families like ours where \n     the kids drop out of school because they need to work. It's \n     sad because they really need an education or to learn another \n     job skill if they're ever going to get out of the fields. \n     Without an education, I will never become a lawyer and Oscar \n     will never be a fireman.\n       My dad is trying to get out of farmwork. He is working in \n     farmwork and also in a farmworker job training program to \n     learn another skill. He is trying to get another job so that \n     he can earn more money and have some health insurance. We've \n     never had health insurance before. As hard as my dad works, \n     he's not guaranteed to make a good living. And my dad works \n     very hard. I just hope that when I get older and if something \n     happens to keep me from graduating from school, that there \n     will be a program for Oscar and me.\n       Thank you for letting us come. We appreciate all the you do \n     that will help our dad, other farmworker kids and my brother \n     Oscar and me.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT (for himself and Mr. Faircloth):\n  S. 2384. A bill entitled ``Year 2000 Enhance Cooperation Solution''; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                     YEAR 2000 SOLUTION LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \naddresses a critical problem that demands immediate attention from the \nCongress.\n  For many years now I have been involved with a variety of issues that \naffect the technology sector. As I have said before, no other sector of \nthe economy is as vibrant and forward looking. The ingenuity, drive and \nvision of this industry should be a model for all of us, including \nthose of us in the Senate. Moreover, the importance of this industry \nshould only grow in the coming years. However, as I look to the future \nwith the hope of seeing the next century stamped ``Made in America'' I \nsee one large impediment--the Year 2000 bug.\n  The 105th Congress must consider this problem and assist the country \nin trying to avoid a potentially disastrous crisis. We cannot wait for \ndisaster to strike. We must act now to enable companies to avert the \ncrisis. No individual will be left untouched if the country fails to \naddress this problem and experiences widespread ramifications. No \ncompany will escape huge costs if they cannot successfully fix their \nown problems and have some assurances that their business partners and \nsuppliers have fixed their problems. A great deal of effort has been \nundertaken to bring attention to this problem, including several \nefforts here in the U.S. Senate. However, it is now time to move beyond \nsimply highlighting the problem. We need to roll up our sleeves and get \nto work on a solution.\n  I begin today to lay out my plan for assisting individuals and \nbusinesses to walk safely through the minefield called the Y2K problem. \nThe first part of this overall plan is the Year 2000 Enhanced \nCooperation Solution. This legislation provides a very narrow exemption \nto the antitrust laws if and when a company is engaged in cooperative \nconduct to alleviate the impact of a year 2000 date failure in hardware \nor software. The exemption has a clear sunset and expressly ensures \nthat the law continues to prohibit anti-competitive conduct such as \nboycotts or agreements to allocate markets or fix prices.\n  This simple, straightforward proposal is critical to allowing for \ntrue cooperation in an effort to rectify the problem. No company can \nsolve the Y2K problem alone. Even if one company devises a workable \nsolution to their own problems they still face potential disaster from \ncomponents provided by outside suppliers. What is more, when companies \nfind workable solutions we certainly want to provide them with every \nincentive to disseminate those solutions as widely as possible. \nCooperation is essential. But without a clear legislative directive, \npotential antitrust liability will stand in the way of cooperation. We \nmust provide our industries with the appropriate incentives and tools \nto fix this problem without the threat of antitrust lawsuits based on \nthe very cooperation we ought to be encouraging.\n  I do want to be very clear on one point--as important as it is that \nthis legislation be enacted and enacted soon, it is merely the first \npiece of a difficult puzzle. The Administration has presented the \nCongress with their view of how information sharing on the Y2K problem \nshould be furthered. Based on my initial review, that proposal appears \nto be headed in the right direction but falls far short of the target \ndestination. Most importantly, the proposed approach which purports to \npromote information sharing does not accomplish its objective as it \nleaves the problem of potential antitrust liability. In other words, it \ndoes not accomplish the task that it set out to complete.\n\n  I will seek the introduction of the second piece of the solution, the \nYear 2000 Enhanced Information Solution, which while working within the \nguidelines of the Administration's language will add the teeth, make \nclear that good faith disclosure of information will be protected, and \nprovide for protection of individual consumers. Together with the \nantitrust legislation I introduce today, this should provide sufficient \nprotection to promote the kind of cooperation that will be essential to \naddressing this looming problem.\n  The final piece of the package will be the Year 2000 Litigation \nSolution. Real harm from inadequate efforts to address this problem \nmust be compensated. However, we cannot allow the prospect of frivolous \nlitigation to block efforts to avoid such harm. We also must ensure \nthat frivolous litigation over the Y2K problem does not consume the \nlion's share of the next millennium. While it is not possible for \nCongress to guarantee that private individuals and companies will be \nable to solve the Y2K problem, Congress can eliminate legal obstacles \nthat stand in the way of private solutions. Information regarding \nexisting software and known problems must be shared as completely and \nopenly as possible. The current fear of litigation and liability that \nimposes a distinct chilling effect on information sharing must be \nalleviated.\n  Resources to address the Y2K problem, particularly time, are finite. \nThey must be focused as fully as possible on remediation, rather than \non unproductive litigation. Moreover, the availability of adequate \ndevelopment and programming talent may hinge upon a working environment \nthat protects good faith remediation efforts from the threat of \nliability for their work. Congress must prevent a fiasco where only \nlawyers win.\n  I look forward to working with those that are interested as this \nprocess moves forward. I believe that this Congress cannot wait to \naddress this problem. This issue is about time, and we have precious \nlittle left in this Congress and before the Y2K problem is upon us. I \nhope we can work together to free up talented individuals to address \nthis serious problem.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNETT (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 2385. A bill to establish the San Rafael Swell National Heritage \nArea and the San Rafael National Conservation Area in the State of \nUtah, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n         The San Rafael National Heritage and Conservation Act\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the ``San \nRafael\n\n[[Page S9443]]\n\nNational Heritage and Conservation Act'' and I am pleased to be joined \nby Senator Hatch in this effort.\n  The San Rafael National Heritage and Conservation Act not only \naccomplishes the preservation of an important historic area, but it is \nthe result of a collaborative approach among Federal land managers, \nstate and local governments and other concerned agencies and \norganizations. This revised legislation incorporates several of the \nsuggestions of the Administration, the House and those who originally \nexpressed concerns about the bill as introduced in the House. The \nlegislation we introduce today is the result of months of discussions \nbetween the Bureau of Land Management, the citizens of Emery County and \nMembers of Congress. It is a good-faith effort to initiate what we hope \nwill bring resolution to the larger philosophical differences between \nland management practices in Utah. With a little luck, we might even \nbegin a process which could lead to a resolution to the ongoing Utah \nwilderness debate.\n  The San Rafael Swell region in the State of Utah was one of America's \nlast frontiers. I have in my office, a map of the State of Utah drafted \nin 1876 in which large portions of the San Rafael Swell were simply \nleft blank because they were yet to be explored. Visitors who comment \non this map are amazed when they see that large portions of the San \nRafael area remained unmapped thirty years after the Mormon pioneers \narrived in the Salt Lake Valley.\n  This area is known for its important historical sites, notable \ntradition of mining, widely recognized paleontological resources, and \nnumerous recreational opportunities. As such, it needs to be protected. \nThe San Rafael Swell National Conservation Area created through this \nlegislation will be approximately 630,000 acres in size and will \ncomprise wilderness, a Bighorn Sheep Management Area, a scenic Area of \nCritical Environmental Concern, and Semi-Primitive Area of Non-\nMotorized Use. The value of the new management structure for the \nNational Conservation Area can be found in the flexibility it gives in \naddressing a broad array of issues from the protection of critical \nlands to the oversight of recreational uses.\n  The San Rafael National Heritage and Conservation Act sets aside \n130,000 acres as BLM wilderness lands. It permanently removes the \nthreat of mining, oil drilling, and timbering from the Swell. It also \nsets aside a conservation area of significant size to protect Utah's \nlargest herd of Desert Bighorn Sheep. Vehicle travel is restricted to \ndesignated roads and trails in other areas and visitors recreational \nfacilities are provided. Finally, it will assist the BLM and the local \ncommunities in developing a long term strategy to preserve the history \nand heritage of the region through the National Heritage Area. Careful \nstudy of the bill shows that the San Rafael Swell National Heritage and \nConservation Act is a multidimensional management plan for an area with \nmultidimensional needs. It provides comprehensive protection and \nmanagement for an entire ecosystem.\n  My colleagues in the House have worked hard to address the concerns \nof the Administration and they have made several changes to the House \nversion as introduced in an effort to improve the legislation. We have \nredrawn maps, eliminated roads from wilderness areas, eliminated cherry \nstems of other roads and increased the size of wilderness and semi-\nprimitive areas. Specifically, by including new provisions dealing with \nthe Compact and Heritage Plan, the new language ensures that the \nresources found in the county will be properly surveyed and understood \nprior to the Heritage Area moving forward.\n  With regards to the Conservation Area, bill language guarantees that \nthe management plan will not impair any of the important resources \nwithin the Swell. We have also included new language that ensures the \nSecretary of Interior is fully represented on the Advisory Council.\n  The San Rafael Swell National Heritage and Conservation Act is unique \nin that it sets the San Rafael Swell apart from Utah's other national \nparks and monuments. It protects not only the important lands in this \narea but also another resource just as precious--its captivating \nhistory and heritage. This bill is an example of how a legislative \nsolution can result from a grassroots effort involving both state and \nlocal government officials, the BLM, historical preservation groups, \nand wildlife enthusiasts. Most important, it takes the necessary steps \nto preserve the wilderness value of these lands.\n  This legislation has broad statewide and local support. It is sound, \nreasonable, and innovative in its approach to protecting and managing \nthe public land treasures of the San Rafael Swell. Finally, it is based \non the scientific methods of ecosystem management and prevents the \nfracturing of large areas of multiple use lands with small parcels of \nwilderness interspersed between.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude with this point; the wilderness debate \nin Utah has gone on too long. My colleagues will be reminded that in \nthe last Congress, the debate centered around whether two million acres \nor 5.7 million acres were the proper amount of wilderness to designate. \nWe are now trying to protect more than 600,000 acres in one county in \nUtah alone. The Emery County Commissioners should be commended for \ntheir foresight and vision in preparing this proposal. I hope that this \nlegislation can become a model for future conflict resolutions.\n  Unfortunately, the shouting match over acreage has often drowned out \nthe discussion over what types of protection were in order for these \nlands. I doubt that there are few people who would debate the need to \nprotect these lands. But too often in the past we have argued over the \ndefinition of what constitutes ``protection.'' Unfortunately for some \ngroups, a certain designation is the only method of acceptable \nprotection. I urge those groups to look beyond the trees and see the \nforest for a change. Should these groups decide to come to the table, \nlend their considerable expertise to our efforts and try to reach a \nconsensus, the first steps toward resolving the decades-old wilderness \ndebate in Utah will have been taken.\n  I hope my colleagues will carefully review this legislation and \nsupport for this bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the San Rafael Swell \nNational Heritage and Conservation Act. As a cosponsor of this measure, \nI applaud the efforts of my friend and colleague, Senator Bennett, for \nbringing this matter before the United States Senate. This is a \nrefreshing approach to managing public lands in the West.\n  This legislation reflects the ability of our citizens to make wise \ndecisions about how land in their area should be used and protected. It \nis an article of our democracy that we recognize the prerogatives and \npreferences of citizens who are most affected by public policy. This \nmeasure gives citizens who live next to these lands a say as to what is \nright and appropriate for the land's management. I believe this \ninitiative, which began locally at the grassroots level, is a cynosure \nfor future land management decisions in the West.\n  Much more than simply protecting rocks and soil, this legislation \nsafeguards wildlife and their habitat, cultural sites and artifacts, \nand Indian and Western heritage. This is not your standard one-size-\nfits-all land management plan. It provides for the conservation of this \nunique area, opting to encourage visitors not development.\n  Mr. President, the San Rafael Swell is an area of immense scenic \nbeauty and cultural heritage. It was once the home to Native Americans \nwho adorned the area with petroglyphs on the rock outcrops and canyon \nwalls. What were once their dwellings are now significant \narchaeological sites scattered throughout the Swell. After the Indian \ntribes came explorers, trappers, and outlaws. In the 1870s, ranchers \nand cowboys came to the area and began grazing the land, managing it \nfor its continued sustainability. Today, there are still citizens with \nroots in this long western tradition. These citizens understand the \nland; they understand conservation and preservation principles; and \nthey want to see the land they love and depend on preserved for present \nand future generations.\n  First of all, Mr. President, this legislation sets up a National \nHeritage Area, the first of its kind west of the Mississippi. In the \nnew National Heritage Area, tourists will walk where Indians walked and \nwhere other outstanding historical figures such as Kit\n\n[[Page S9444]]\n\nCarson, Chief Walker, Jedediah Smith, John Wesley Powell, Butch \nCassidy, and John C. Fremont spent time. The area already boasts a \nnumber of fine museums, including the John Wesley Powell Museum, the \nMuseum of the San Rafael, the College of Eastern Utah Prehistoric \nMuseum, the Helper Mining Museum, and the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur \nQuarry. Consolidated under the new National Heritage Area, these \nimportant sites and museums will add a Western flavor to the already \ndiverse network of existing National Heritage Areas in our nation.\n  Next, this legislation sets up one of our nation's most significant \nand dynamic conservation areas. The San Rafael Conservation Area will \nencompass the entire San Rafael Swell and protect approximately 1 \nmillion acres of scenic splendor. The area will be managed according to \nthe same standards set by Congress for all other conservation areas. In \nfact, this legislation withdraws the entire San Rafael Swell from \nfuture oil drilling, logging, mining, and tar sands development. \nMoreover, the area will protect important paleontological resources \nincluding an area on the northern edge of the Swell know as the \nCleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry which was set aside in 1966 as a \nNational Natural Landmark, preserving one of the largest sources of \nfossils in the New World.\n  Of particular interest, Mr. President, is the designation of the \nDesert Bighorn Sheep National Management Area. This provision ensures \nthat our precious herd of bighorn sheep will continue to be monitored \nby state wildlife managers. The bill also provides strict protections \nto other resources in the area. Last but not least, Mr. President, this \nlegislation formally designates certain areas within the Swell as \nwilderness.\n  This proposal preserves a portion of the West as it currently exists \nand allows for traditional uses, where appropriate, such as hunting, \ntrapping, and fishing. It will foster the development and management of \ntourism in keeping with the overall goals of preservation. This \nmanagement concept is one of multiple use and allows for the \ncontinuation of working landscapes including agriculture, irrigation, \nand ranching, which are a part of our Western tradition.\n  Mr. President, this initiative is compatible with local and regional \nneeds, but it invites the world to come and enjoy the natural and \nhistorical treasures of the San Rafael Swell. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important citizens' initiative to preserve the San Rafael \nSwell.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 2387. A bill to confer and confirm Presidential authority to use \nforce abroad, to set forth procedures governing the exercise of that \nauthority, and thereby to facilitate cooperation between the President \nand Congress in decisions concerning the use or deployment of United \nStates Armed Forces abroad in situations of actual or potential \nhostilities; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                            use of force act\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation \ndesigned to provide a framework for joint congressional-executive \ndecision-making about the most solemn decision that a nation can make: \nto send men and women to fight and die for their country.\n  Entitled the ``Use of Force Act,'' the legislation would replace the \nwar powers resolution of 1973 with a new mechanism that, I hope, will \nbe more effective than the existing statute.\n  Enacted nearly a quarter century ago, over the veto of President \nNixon, the war powers resolution has enjoyed an unhappy fate--scorned \nby Presidents who questioned its constitutionality, and ignored by a \nCongress too timid to exercise its constitutional duty.\n  That was not, of course, the intent of its framers, who sought to \nimprove executive-congressional cooperation on questions involving the \nuse of force--and to remedy a dangerous constitutional imbalance.\n  This imbalance resulted from what I call the ``monarchist'' view of \nthe war power--the thesis that the President holds nearly unlimited \npower to direct American forces into action.\n  The thesis is largely a product of the cold war and the nuclear age: \nthe view that, at a time when the fate of the planet itself appeared to \nrest with two men thousands of miles apart, Congress had little choice, \nor so it was claimed but to cede tremendous authority to the executive.\n  This thesis first emerged in 1950, when President Truman sent forces \nto Korea without congressional authorization. It peaked twenty years \nlater, in 1970, when President Nixon sent U.S. forces into Cambodia--\nalso without congressional authorization, but this time accompanied by \nsweeping assertions of autonomous Presidential power.\n  President Nixon's theory was so extreme that it prompted the Senate \nto begin a search--a search led by Republican Jacob Javits and strongly \nsupported by a conservative Democrat, John Stennis of Mississippi--for \nsome means of rectifying the constitutional imbalance. That search \nculminated in the war powers resolution.\n  Unfortunately, the war powers resolution has failed to fulfill its \nobjective. If anything, the monarchist view has become more deeply \ningrained with the passage of time.\n  This trend was been on display throughout this decade. Before the \ngulf war, for example, with half a million American forces standing \nready in Saudi Arabia--a situation clearly requiring congressional \nauthorization--President Bush still refused to concede that he required \nan act of Congress before using force. Only at the last minute, and \nonly grudgingly, did President Bush seek congressional support. Even \nthen, he continued to assert that he sought only support, refusing to \nconcede that congressional authorization was a legal necessity.\n  Several years ago, the notion of broad executive power was claimed on \nthe eve of a proposed invasion of Haiti--an invasion that, thankfully, \nwas averted by a last-minute diplomatic initiative.\n  In 1994, officials of the Clinton administration characterized the \nHaiti operation as a mere ``police action''--a semantic dodge designed \nto avoid congressional authorization--and a demonstration that the \nmonarchist view prevails in the White House, without regard to \npolitical party.\n\n  And, most recently, the Clinton administration asserted that it had \nall the authority it needed to initiate a military attack against \nIraq--though it never publicly elaborated on this supposed authority.\n  In this case, the question was not clear-cut--as it was in 1991. But \ntwo things emerged in the debate that reinforce the need for this \nlegislation. First, it demonstrated that the executive instinct to find \n``sufficient legal authority'' to use force is undiluted.\n  Second, it demonstrated that Congress often lacks the institutional \nwill to carry out its responsibilities under the war power. Although \nthere was strong consensus that a strong response was required to \nSaddam Hussein's resistance to U.N. inspections, there was no consensus \nin this body about whether Congress itself should authorize military \naction. Lacking such a consensus, Congress did nothing.\n  Congress' responsibilities could not be clearer. Article one, section \neight, clause eleven of the Constitution grants to Congress the power \n``to declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal and to make \nrules concerning captures on land and water.''\n  To the President, the Constitution provides in article two, section \ntwo the role of ``Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United \nStates.''\n  It may fairly be said that, with regard to many constitutional \nprovisions, the Framers' intent was ambiguous. But on the war power, \nboth the contemporaneous evidence and the early construction of these \nclauses do not leave much room for doubt.\n  The original draft of the Constitution would have given to Congress \nthe power to ``make war.'' At the Constitutional Convention, a motion \nwas made to change this to ``declare war.'' The reason for the change \nis instructive.\n  At the Convention, James Madison and Elbridge Gerry argued for the \namendment solely in order to permit the President the power ``to repel \nsudden attacks.'' Just one delegate, Pierce Butler of South Carolina, \nsuggested that the President should be given the power to initiate war.\n  The rationale for vesting the power to launch war in Congress was \nsimple.\n\n[[Page S9445]]\n\nThe Framers' views were dominated by their experience with the British \nKing, who had unfettered power to start wars. Such powers the Framers \nwere determined to deny the President.\n  Even Alexander Hamilton, a staunch advocate of Presidential power, \nemphasized that the President's power as Commander in Chief would be \n``much inferior'' to the British King, amounting to ``nothing more than \nthe supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces,'' \nwhile that of the British King ``extends to declaring of war and to the \nraising and regulating of fleets and armies--all which, by [the U.S.] \nConstitution, would appertain to the legislature.''\n  It is frequently contended by those who favor vast Presidential \npowers that Congress was granted only the ceremonial power to declare \nwar. But the Framers had little interest, it seems, in the ceremonial \naspects of war. The real issue was congressional authorization of war. \nAs Hamilton noted in Federalist twenty-five, the ``ceremony of a formal \ndenunciation of war has of late fallen into disuse.''\n  The conclusion that Congress was given the power to initiate all \nwars, except to repel attacks on the United States, is also \nstrengthened in view of the second part of the war clause: the power to \n``grant letters of marque and reprisal.''\n\n  An anachronism today, letters of marque and reprisal were licenses \nissued by governments empowering agents to seize enemy ships or take \naction on land short of all-out war. In essence, it was an eighteenth \ncentury version of what we now regarded as ``limited war'' or ``police \nactions.''\n  The framers undoubtedly knew that reprisals, or ``imperfect war,'' \ncould lead to an all-out war. England, for example, had fought five \nwars between 1652 and 1756 which were preceded by public naval \nreprisals.\n  Surely, those who met at Philadelphia--all learned men--knew and \nunderstood this history. Given this, the only logical conclusion is \nthat the framers intended to grant to Congress the power to initiate \nall hostilities, even limited wars.\n  In sum, to accept the proposition that the war power is merely \nceremonial, or applies only to ``big wars,'' is to read much of the war \nclause out of the Constitution. Such a reading is supported neither by \nthe plain language of the text, or the original intent of the framers.\n  Any doubt about the wisdom of relying on this interpretation of the \nintent of the framers is dispelled in view of the actions of early \nPresidents, early Congresses, and early Supreme Court decisions.\n  Our earliest Presidents were extremely cautious about encroaching on \nCongress' power under the war clause.\n  For example, in 1793, the first President, George Washington, stated \nthat offensive operations against an indian tribe, the Creek Nation, \ndepended on congressional action: ``The Constitution vests the power of \ndeclaring war with Congress; therefore no offensive expedition of \nimportance can be undertaken until after they have deliberated upon the \nsubject, and authorized such a measure.''\n  During the Presidency of John Adams, the United States engaged in an \nundeclared naval war with France. But it bears emphasis that these \nmilitary engagements were clearly authorized by Congress by a series of \nincremental statutes.\n  The naval war with France also yielded three important Supreme Court \ndecisions regarding the scope of the war power.\n  In 1799, Congress authorized the President to intercept any U.S. \nvessels headed to France. President Adams subsequently ordered the Navy \nto seize any ships traveling to or from France.\n  The Supreme Court declared the seizure of a U.S. vessel traveling \nfrom France to be illegal--thus ruling that Congress had the power not \nonly to authorize limited war, and but also to limit Presidential power \nto take military action.\n  The court ruled in two other cases bearing on the question of limited \nwar. Wars, the Court said, even if ``imperfect,'' are nonetheless wars. \nIn still another case, Chief Justice Marshall opined that ``the whole \npowers of war [are] by the Constitution . . . vested in Congress . . . \n[which] may authorize general hostilities . . . or partial war.''\n  These precedents, and the historical record of actions taken by other \nearly Presidents, have significantly more bearing on the meaning of the \nwar clause than the modern era.\n  As Chief Justice Warren once wrote, ``The precedential value of \n[prior practice] tends to increase in proportion to the proximity'' to \nthe constitutional convention.\n  Unfortunately, this constitutional history seems largely forgotten, \nand the doctrine of Presidential power that arose during the cold war \nremains in vogue.\n  To accept the status quo requires us to believe that the \nconstitutional imbalance serves our nation well. But it can hardly be \nsaid that it does.\n  As matters now stand, Congress is denied its proper role in sharing \nin the decision to commit American troops, and the President is \ndeprived of the consensus to help carry this policy through.\n  I believe that only by establishing an effective war powers mechanism \ncan we ensure that both of these goals are met. The question then is \nthis: How to revise the war powers resolution in a manner that gains \nbipartisan support--and support of the executive?\n  In the past two decades, a premise has gained wide acceptance that \nthe war powers resolution is fatally flawed. Indeed, there are flaws in \nthe resolution but they need not have been fatal.\n  In 1988, determining that a review of the war powers resolution was \nin order, the Foreign Relations Committee established a special \nsubcommittee to assume the task.\n  As chairman of the subcommittee, I conducted extensive hearings. Over \nthe course of two months, the subcommittee heard from many \ndistinguished witnesses: former President Ford, former Secretaries of \nState and Defense, former Joint Chiefs of Staff, former Members of \nCongress who drafted the war powers resolution, and many constitutional \nscholars.\n  At the end of that process, I wrote a law review article describing \nhow the war powers resolution might be thoroughly rewritten to overcome \nits actual and perceived liabilities.\n  That effort provided the foundation for the legislation I introduced \nin the 104th Congress, and that I reintroduce today. The bill has many \nelements; I will briefly summarize it.\n  First, the bill replaces the war powers resolution with a new \nversion. But I should make clear that I retain its central element: a \ntime-clock mechanism that limits the President's power to use force \nabroad. That mechanism, it bears emphasis, was found to be \nunambiguously constitutional in a 1980 opinion issued by the Office of \nLegal Counsel at the Department of Justice.\n  It is often asserted that the time-clock provisions is \n``unworkable,'' or that it invites our adversaries to make a conflict \nso painful in the short run so as to induce timidity in the Congress.\n  But with or without a war powers law, American willingness to \nundertake sustained hostilities will always be subject to democratic \npressures. A statutory mechanism is simply a means of delineating \nprocedure.\n  And the procedure set forth in this legislation assures that if the \nPresident wants an early congressional vote on a use of force abroad, \nhis congressional supporters can produce it.\n  Recent history tells us, of course, that the American people, as well \nas Congress, rally around the flag--and the Commander-in-Chief--in the \nearly moments of a military deployment.\n  Second, my bill defuses the specter that a ``timid Congress'' can \nsimply sit on its hands and permit the authority for a deployment to \nexpire.\n  First, it establishes elaborate expedited procedures designed to \nensure that a vote will occur. And it explicitly defeats the ``timid \nCongress'' specter by granting to the President the authority he has \nsought if these procedures nonetheless fail to produce a vote.\n  Thus, if the President requests authority for a sustained use of \nforce--one outside the realm of emergency--and Congress fails to vote, \nthe President's authority is extended indefinitely.\n  Third, the legislation delineates what I call the ``going in'' \nauthorities for the President to use force. One fundamental weakness of \nthe war powers resolution is that it fails to acknowledge powers that \nmost scholars agree are inherent Presidential powers: to repel an\n\n[[Page S9446]]\n\narmed attack upon the United States or its Armed Forces, or to rescue \nAmericans abroad.\n  My legislation corrects this deficiency by enumerating five instances \nwhere the President may use force:\n  (1) To repel attack on U.S. territory or U.S. forces;\n  (2) To deal with urgent situations threatening supreme U.S. \ninterests;\n  (3) To extricate imperiled U.S. citizens;\n  (4) To forestall or retaliate against specific acts of terrorism;\n  (5) To defend against substantial threats to international sea lanes \nor airspace;\n  It may be that no such enumeration can be exhaustive. But the \ncircumstances set forth would have sanctioned virtually every use of \nforce by the United States since World War Two.\n  This concession of authority is circumscribed by the maintenance of \nthe time-clock provision.\n  After sixty days have passed, the President's authority would expire, \nunless one of three conditions had been met:\n  (1) Congress has declared war or enacted specific statutory \nauthorization;\n  (2) The President has requested authority for an extended use of \nforce but Congress has failed to act on that request, notwithstanding \nthe expedited procedures established by this act:\n  (3) The President has certified the existence of an emergency \nthreatening the supreme national interests of the United States.\n  The legislation also affirms the importance of consultation between \nthe President and Congress and establishes a new means to facilitate \nit.\n  To overcome the common complaint that Presidents must contend with \n``535 Secretaries of State,'' the bill establishes a congressional \nleadership group with whom the President is mandated to consult on the \nuse of force.\n  Another infirmity of the war powers resolution is that it fails to \ndefine ``hostilities.'' Thus, Presidents frequently engaged in a verbal \ngymnastics of insisting that ``hostilities'' were not ``imminent''--\neven when hundreds of thousands of troops were positioned in the \nArabian desert opposite Saddam's legions.\n  Therefore, the legislation includes a more precise definition of what \nconstitutes a ``use of force.''\n  Finally, to make the statutory mechanism complete, the use of force \nact provides a means for judicial review. Because I share the \nreluctance of many of my colleagues to inject the judiciary into \ndecisions that should be made by the political branches, this provision \nis extremely limited. It empowers a three-judge panel to decide only \nwhether the time-clock mechanism has been triggered.\n  The bill contains a provision granting standing to Members of \nCongress, a door that the Supreme Court appears to have largely closed \nin the case of Raines versus Byrd--the line-item veto challenge brought \nby the senior Senator from West Virginia. I believe, notwithstanding \nthe holding of that case, that a Member of Congress would suffer the \nconcrete injury necessary to satisfy the standing requirement under \narticle three of the Constitution.\n  The reason is this: The failure of the President to submit a use of \nforce report would harm the ability of a Member of Congress to exercise \na power clearly reposed in Congress under article one, section eight. \nThat injury, I believe, should suffice in clearing the high hurdle on \nstanding which the Court imposed in the Byrd case. No private \nindividual can bring such a suit; if a Member of Congress cannot, then \nno one can.\n  I have no illusions that enacting this legislation will be easy. But \nI am determined to try.\n  The status quo--with Presidents asserting broad executive power, and \nCongress often content to surrender its constitutional powers--does not \nserve the American people well.\n  More fundamentally, it does not serve the men and women who risk \ntheir lives to defend our interests. For that, ultimately, must be the \ntest of any war powers law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the section-by-section \nanalysis be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the section-by-section analysis was ordered \nto be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Section 1. Short Title. The title of the bill is the ``Use \n     of Force Act (UFA).''\n       Section 2. Table of Contents.\n       Section 3. Findings. This section sets forth three findings \n     regarding the need to provide a statutory framework to \n     facilitate joint decisionmaking between Congress and the \n     President regarding decisions to use force abroad.\n       Section 4. Statement of Purpose. The key phrase in this \n     section is ``confer and confirm Presidential authority.'' The \n     Use of Force Act is designed to bridge the long-standing--\n     and, for all practical purposes, unresolvable--dispute over \n     precisely what constitutes the President's ``inherent'' \n     authority to use force. Whereas the War Powers Resolution \n     purported to delineate the President's constitutional \n     authority and to grant no more, the Use of Force Act sets \n     forth a range of authorities that are practical for the \n     modern age and sufficiently broad to subsume all presidential \n     authorities deemed ``inherent'' by any reasonable \n     constitutional interpretation.\n       Section 5. Definitions. This section defines a number of \n     terms, including the term ``use of force abroad,'' thus \n     correcting a major flaw of the War Powers Resolution, which \n     left undefined the term ``hostilities.''\n       As defined in the Use of Force Act, a ``use of force \n     abroad'' comprises two prongs:\n       (1) a deployment of U.S. armed forces (either a new \n     introduction of forces, a significant expansion of the U.S. \n     military presence in a country, or a commitment to a new \n     mission or objective); and\n       (2) the deployment is aimed at deterring an identified \n     threat, or the forces deployed are incurring or inflicting \n     casualties (or are operating with a substantial possibility \n     of incurring or inflicting casualties).\n\n\n                      title i--general provisions\n\n       Section 101. Authority and Governing Principles. This \n     section sets forth the Presidential authorities being \n     ``conferred and confirmed.'' Based on the Constitution and \n     this Act, the President may use force--\n       (1) to repel an attack on U.S. territory or U.S. forces;\n       (2) to deal with urgent situations threatening supreme U.S. \n     interests;\n       (3) to extricate imperiled U.S. citizens;\n       (4) to forestall or retaliate against specific acts of \n     terrorism;\n       (5) to defend against substantial threats to international \n     sea lanes or airspace.\n       Against a complaint that this list is excessively \n     permissive, it should be emphasized that these are the \n     President's initial authorities to undertake a use of force--\n     so-called ``going in'' authorities--and that the ``staying \n     in'' conditions set forth in section 104 will, in most cases, \n     bear heavily on the President's original decision.\n       Section 102. Consultation. Section 102 affirms the \n     importance of consultation between the President and Congress \n     and establishes new means to facilitate it. To overcome the \n     common complaint that Presidents must contend with ``535 \n     secretaries of state,'' the UFA establishes a Congressional \n     Leadership Group with whom the President is mandated to \n     consult on the use of force.\n       A framework of regular consultations between specified \n     Executive branch officials and relevant congressional \n     committees is also mandated in order to establish a ``norm'' \n     of consultative interaction and in hope of overcoming what \n     many find to be the overly theatrical public-hearing process \n     that has superseded the more frank and informal consultations \n     of earlier years.\n       Note: An alternative to the Use of Force Act is to repeal \n     (or effectively repeal) the War Powers Resolution and leave \n     in its place only a Congressional Leadership Group. (This is \n     the essence of S.J. Res. 323, 100th Congress, legislation to \n     amend the War Powers Resolution introduced by Senators Byrd, \n     Warner, Nunn, and Mitchell in 1988.) This approach, which \n     relies on ``consultation and the Constitution,'' avoids the \n     complexities of enacting legislation such as the UFA but \n     fails to solve chronic problems of procedure or authority, \n     leaving matters of process and power to be debated anew as \n     each crisis arises. In contrast, the Use of Force Act would \n     perform one of the valuable functions of law, which is to \n     guide individual and institutional behavior.\n       Section 103. Reporting Requirements. Section 103 requires \n     that the President report in writing to the Congress \n     concerning any use of force, not later than 48 hours after \n     commencing a use of force abroad.\n       Section 104. Conditions for Extended Use of Force. Section \n     104 sets forth the ``staying in'' conditions: that is, the \n     conditions that must be met if the President is to sustain a \n     use of force he has begun under the authorities set forth in \n     section 101. A use of force may extend beyond 60 days only \n     if--\n       (1) Congress has declared war or enacted specific statutory \n     authorization;\n       (2) the President has requested authority for an extended \n     use of force but Congress has failed to act on that request \n     (notwithstanding the expedited procedures established by \n     Title II of this Act);\n       (3) the President has certified the existence of an \n     emergency threatening the supreme national interests of the \n     United States.\n       The second and third conditions are designed to provide \n     sound means other than a declaration of war or the enactment \n     of specific statutory authority by which the President may \n     engage in an extended use of force.\n\n[[Page S9447]]\n\n     Through these conditions, the Use of Force Act avoids two \n     principal criticisms of the War Powers Resolution: (1) that \n     Congress could irresponsibly require a force withdrawal \n     simply through inaction; and (2) that the law might, under \n     certain circumstances, unconstitutionally deny the President \n     the use of his ``inherent'' authority.\n       To defuse the specter of a President hamstrung by a \n     Congress too timid or inept to face its responsibilities, the \n     UFA uses two means: first, it establishes elaborate expedited \n     procedures designed to ensure that a vote will occur; second, \n     it explicitly defeats the ``timid Congress'' specter by \n     granting to the President the authority he has sought if \n     these procedures nonetheless fail to produce a vote. Thus, if \n     the President requests authority for a sustained use of \n     force--one outside the realm of emergency--and Congress fails \n     to vote, the President's authority is extended indefinitely.\n       The final condition should satisfy all but proponents of an \n     extreme ``monarchist'' interpretation under which the \n     President has the constitutional authority to use force as he \n     sees fit. Under all other interpretations, the concept of an \n     ``inherent'' authority depends upon the element of emergency: \n     the need for the President to act under urgent circumstances \n     to defend the nation's security and its citizens. If so, the \n     UFA protects any ``inherent'' presidential authority by \n     affirming his ability to act for up to 60 days under the \n     broad-ranging authorities in section 101 and, in the event he \n     is prepared to certify an extended national emergency, to \n     exercise the authority available to him through the final \n     condition of section 104.\n       Section 105. Measures Eligible for Congressional Priority \n     Procedures. This section establishes criteria by which joint \n     and concurrent resolutions become eligible for the expedited \n     procedures created by Title II of the UFA.\n       A joint resolution that declares war or provides specific \n     statutory authorization--or one that terminates, limits, or \n     prohibits a use of force--becomes eligible if it is \n     introduced: (1) pursuant to a written request by the \n     President to any one member of Congress; (2) if cosponsored \n     by a majority of the members of the Congressional Leadership \n     Group in the house where introduced; or (3) if cosponsored by \n     30 percent of the members of either house. Thus, there is \n     almost no conceivable instance in which a President can be \n     denied a prompt vote: he need only ask one member of Congress \n     to introduce a resolution on his behalf.\n       A concurrent resolution becomes eligible if it meets either \n     of the cosponsorship criteria cited above and contains a \n     finding that a use of force abroad began on a certain date, \n     or has exceeded the 60 day limitation, or has been undertaken \n     outside the authority provided by section 101, or is being \n     conducted in a manner inconsistent with the governing \n     principles set forth in section 101.\n       While having no direct legal effect, the passage of a \n     concurrent resolution under the UFA could have considerable \n     significance: politically, it would represent a clear, \n     prompt, and formal congressional repudiation of a \n     presidential action; within Congress, it would trigger \n     parliamentary rules blocking further consideration of \n     measures providing funds for the use of force in question (as \n     provided by section 106 of the UFA); and juridically, it \n     would become a consideration in any action brought by a \n     member of Congress for declaratory judgment and injunctive \n     relief (as envisaged by section 107 of the UFA).\n       Section 106. Funding Limitations. This section prohibits \n     the expenditure of funds for any use of force inconsistent \n     with the UFA. Further, this section exercises the power of \n     Congress to make its own rules by providing that a point of \n     order will lie against any measure containing funds to \n     perpetuate a use of force that Congress, by concurrent \n     resolution, has found to be illegitimate.\n       Section 107. Judicial Review. This section permits judicial \n     review of any action brought by a Member of Congress on the \n     grounds that the UFA has been violated. It does so by--\n       (1) granting standing to any Member of Congress who brings \n     suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia;\n       (2) providing that neither the District Court nor the \n     Supreme Court may refuse to make a determination on the \n     merits based on certain judicial doctrines, such as political \n     question or ripeness (doctrines invoked previously by courts \n     to avoid deciding cases regarding the war power);\n       (3) prescribing the judicial remedies available to the \n     District Court; and\n       (4) creating a right of direct appeal to the Supreme Court \n     and encouraging expeditious consideration of such appeal.\n       It bears emphasis that the remedy prescribed is modest, and \n     does not risk unwarranted interference of the judicial branch \n     in a decision better reposed in the political branches. It \n     provides that the matter must be heard by a three-judge \n     panel; one of these judges must a circuit judge. \n     Additionally, the power of the court is extremely limited: it \n     may only declare that the 60-day period set forth in Section \n     104 has begun.\n       In 1997, the Supreme Court held, in Raines v. Byrd, that \n     Members of Congress did not have standing to challenge an \n     alleged constitutional violation under the Line-Item Veto \n     Act. That case might be read to suggest that a Member of \n     Congress can never attain standing. But such a conclusion \n     would be unwarranted. First, the Court made clear in Raines \n     that an explicit grant of authority to bring a suit \n     eliminates any ``prudential'' limitations on standing. Raines \n     v. Byrd, 521 U.S. ____, ____, n.3 (1997) (slip op., at 8, \n     n.3) Second, a more recent decision of the Court suggests \n     that a Member of Congress could attain ``constitutional \n     standing'' (that is, meet the ``case or controversy'' \n     requirements of Article III) in just the sort of case \n     envisaged by the Use of Force Act. In Federal Election \n     Commission v. Akins, a case decided on June 1, 1998, the \n     Court permitted standing in a case where the plaintiffs \n     sought to require the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to \n     treat an organization as a ``political committee,'' which \n     then would have triggered public disclosure of certain \n     information about that organization. The Court held that \n     standing would be permitted where the plaintiff ``fails to \n     obtain information which must be publicly disclosed pursuant \n     to statute.'' A case under the Use of Force Act would be \n     analogous--in that the plaintiff Members of Congress would \n     seek information in a ``Use of Force Report'' required to be \n     submitted to Congress by Section 103(a). Such information, \n     quite obviously, would be essential to Members of Congress in \n     the exercise of their constitutional powers under the war \n     clause of the Constitution (Article I, Section 8, Clause 11), \n     a power they alone possess.\n       Section 108. Interpretation. This section clarifies several \n     points of interpretation, including these: that authority to \n     use force is not derived from other statutes or from treaties \n     (which create international obligations but not authority in \n     a domestic, constitutional context); and that the failure of \n     Congress to pass any joint or concurrent resolution \n     concerning a particular use of force may not be construed as \n     indicating congressional authorization or approval.\n       Section 109. Severability. This section stipulates that \n     certain sections of the UFA would be null and void, and \n     others not affected, if specified provisions of the UFA were \n     held by the Courts to be invalid.\n       Section 110. Repeal of War Powers Resolution. Section 110 \n     repeals the War Powers Resolution of 1973.\n\n\n                     title ii--expedited procedures\n\n       Section 201. Priority Procedures. Section 201 provides for \n     the expedited parliamentary procedures that are integral to \n     the functioning of the Act. (These procedures are drawn from \n     the war powers legislation cited earlier, introduced by \n     Senator Robert Byrd et al. in 1988.)\n       Section 202. Repeal of Obsolete Expedited Procedures. \n     Section 202 repeals other expedited procedures provided for \n     in existing law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN.\n  S. 2388. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nan exclusion for gain from the sale of farmland which is similar to the \nexclusion from gain on the sale of a principal residence; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n  legislation to provide exclusion for gain from the sale of farmland\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, a new and disastrous farm crisis is \nroaring through the Upper Midwest. Family farmers are under severe \nassault and many of them are simply not making it. It's not their \nfault. It's just that the combination of bad weather, crop disease, low \nyield, low prices and bad federal farm policy is too much to handle. \nUnder the current federal farm law there is no price safety net. \nFarmers are--as they were in the 1930's --at the mercy of forces much \nbigger than they are.\n  The exodus occurring from family farms in the Upper Midwest is heart-\nbreaking and demands the immediate attention of this Congress. We need \nto address this problem both within the farm program and in other \npolicy areas as well.\n  For example, Mr. President, there's a fundamental flaw in the tax \ncode that we need to fix. It adds insult to injury for many of these \nfarmers. You see, too often, these family farmers are not able to take \nfull advantage of the $500,000 capital gains tax break that city folks \nget when they sell their homes. Once family farmers have been beaten \ndown and forced to sell the farm they've farmed for generations, they \nget a rude awakening. Many of them discover, as they leave the farm, \nthat Uncle Sam is waiting for them at the end of the lane with a big \ntax bill.\n  One of the most popular provisions included in last year's major tax \nbill permits families to exclude from federal income tax up to $500,000 \nof gain from the sale of their principal residences. That's a good \ndeal, especially for most urban and suburban dwellers who have spent \nmany years paying for their houses, and who regard their houses as both \na home and a retirement account. For many middle income families, their \nhome is their major financial asset, an asset the family can draw on in \nretirement. House prices in major growth markets such as Washington, \nD.C., New York, or California may start at hundreds of thousands of \ndollars. As a result, the urban\n\n[[Page S9448]]\n\ndwellers who have owned their homes through many years of appreciation \ncan often benefit from a large portion of this new $500,000 capital \ngains tax exclusion. Unfortunately this provision, as currently \napplied, is virtually useless to family farmers.\n  For farm families, their farm is their major financial asset. \nUnfortunately, family farmers under current law receive little or no \nbenefit from the new $500,000 exclusion because the IRS separates the \nvalue of their homes from the value of the farmland the homes sit on. \nAs people from my state of North Dakota know, houses out on the \nfarmsteads of rural America are more commonly sold for $5,000 to \n$40,000. Most farmers plow any profits they make into the whole farm \nrather than into a house that will hold little or no value when the \nfarm is sold. It's not surprising that the IRS often judges that homes \nfar out in the country have very little value and thus farmers receive \nmuch less benefit from this $500,000 exclusion than do their urban and \nsuburban counterparts. As a result, the capital gain exclusion is \nlittle or no help to farmers who are being forced out of business. They \nmay immediately face a hefty capital gains tax bill from the IRS.\n  This is simply wrong, Mr. President. It is unfair. Federal farm \npolicy helped create the hole that many of these farmers find \nthemselves in. Federal tax policy shouldn't dig the hole deeper as they \nattempt to shovel their way out.\n  The legislation that I'm introducing today recognizes the unique \ncharacter and role of our family farmers and their important \ncontributions to our economy. It expands the $500,000 capital gains tax \nexclusion for sales of principal residences to cover family farmers who \nsell their farmhouses or surrounding farmland, so long as they are \nactively engaged in farming prior to the sales. In this way, farmers \nmay get some benefit from a tax break that would otherwise be \nunavailable to them.\n  I fully understand that this legislation is not a cure-all for \nfinancial hardships that are ailing our farm communities. This \nlegislation is just one of a number of policy initiatives we can use to \nease the pain for family farmers as we pursue other initiatives to help \nturn around the crippled farm economy.\n  Again, my legislation would expand the $500,000 tax exclusion for \nprinciple residences to cover the entire farm. Specifically, the \nprovision will allow a family or individual who has actively engaged in \nfarming prior to the farm sale to exclude the gain from the sale up to \nthe $500,000 maximum.\n  What does this relief mean to the thousands of farmers who are being \nforced to sell off the farm due to current economic conditions?\n  Take, for example, a farmer who is forced to leave today because of \ncrop disease and slumping grain prices and sells his farmstead that his \nfamily has operated for decades. If he must report a gain of $10,000 on \nthe sale of farm house, that is all he can exclude under current law. \nBut if, for example, he sold 1000 acres surrounding the farm house for \n$400,000, and the capital gain was $200,000, he would be subject to \n$40,000 tax on that gain. Again, my provision excludes from tax the \ngain on the farmhouse and land up to the $500,000 maximum that is \notherwise available to a family on the sale of its residence.\n  We must wage, on every federal and state policy front, the battle to \nstem the loss of family farmers. Tax provisions have grown increasingly \nimportant as our farm families deal with drought, floods, diseases and \nprice swings.\n  I believe that Congress should move quickly to pass this legislation \nand other meaningful measures to help get working capital into the \nhands of our family farmers in the Great Plains. Let's stop penalizing \nfarmers who are forced out of agriculture. Let's allow farmers to \nbenefit from the same kind of tax exclusion that most homeowners \nalready receive. This is the right thing to do. And it's the fair thing \nto do.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 2389. A bill to strengthen the rights of workers to associate, \norganize and strike, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources.\n\n\n                       fair labor organizing act\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill, the \nFair Labor Organizing Act, to strengthen the basic rights of workers \nfreely to associate, organize and to join a union. The bill would \naddress significant shortcomings in the National Labor Relations Act. \nThese shortcomings amount to impediments to one of the most fundamental \nways that working people can seek to improve their own and their \nfamilies' standard of living and quality of life, which is to join, \nbelong to and participate in a union.\n\n  Mr. President, in the past few years, working men and women across \nthe country have been fighting and organizing with a new energy. They \nare fighting for better health care, pensions, a living wage, better \neducation policy and fairer trade policy. They also are fighting and \norganizing to ensure that they have the opportunity to be represented \nby a union through which they can collectively bargain with their \nemployers. Much of this organizing is taking place among sectors of the \nworkforce, and among portions of our working population, that have not \npreviously been organized. I think these new efforts are part of what \nreally is a new civil rights and human rights struggle in our country. \nIt is an important and positive historical development. There is \nprobably no clearer indication that the impact of this development is \nbeing felt, and that many of these efforts are succeeding, than some of \nthe attacks in the current Congress on unions representing the \ncountry's working people.\n  Why have we seen so many bills with Orwellian titles such as the TEAM \nAct, which has little to do with employer-employee teamwork and a lot \nmore to do with company-dominated labor organizations? Such as the \n``Family Friendly Workplace Act,'' which really isn't family friendly, \nbut would reduce working families' pay and undercut the 40-hour \nworkweek? Such as the so-called SAFE Act, which doesn't promote safety \nbut actually would roll back well-established and necessary OSHA \nprotections?\n  Why does the majority in Congress seem so desperate to single out \nunions to suppress their political activities at the same time they \nmaneuver to kill genuine political campaign finance reform?\n  It is because unions are succeeding. That is a good thing because in \nmy view, when organized labor fights for job security, for dignity, \njustice and for a fair share of America's prosperity, it is not a \nstruggle merely for their own benefit. The gains of unionized workers \non basic bread and butter issues are key to the economic security of \nall working families.\n  How can it be that as many as 10,000 Americans lose their jobs each \nyear for supporting union organizing when the National Labor Relations \nAct already supposedly prohibits the firing of an employee to deny his \nor her right to freely organize or join a union? If more than four in \n10 workers who are not currently in a union say they would join one if \nthey had the opportunity, why aren't there more opportunities? Since we \nknow that union workers earn up to one-third more than non-union \nworkers and are more likely to have pensions and health benefits, why \naren't more workers unionized when the new labor movement is correctly \nfocused on organizing?\n  The answer to these basic questions is this: we need labor law \nreform. We need to improve the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).\n  The Fair Labor Organizing Act would achieve three basic goals. First, \nit would help employees make fully informed, free decisions about union \nrepresentation. Second, it would expand the remedies available to \nwrongfully discharged employees. Third, it would require mediation and \narbitration when employers and employees fail to reach a collective \nbargaining agreement on their own.\n  It is late in the current Congress. My bill may not receive full \nconsideration or be enacted into law this year. But I believe it is \nimportant to set a standard and place a marker. Workers across America \nare fighting for their rights, and many are finding that the playing \nfield is tilted against them. The NLRA does not fully allow them fair \nopportunity to speak freely, to associate, organize and join a union, \neven though that is its intended purpose. I have walked some picket \nlines during the\n\n[[Page S9449]]\n\npast two years. I have joined in solidarity with workers seeking to \norganize. I have called on employers to bargain in good faith with \ntheir employees during disputes. I intend to continue doing so, and I \nurge colleagues to do the same. At the same time, it is clear to nearly \nany organizer and to many workers who have sought to join a union that \nthe rules in crucial ways are stacked against them. My bill seeks to \naddress that fact.\n  First, it is a central tenet of U.S. labor policy that employees \nshould be free to make informed and free decisions about union \nrepresentation. Yet, union organizers have limited access to employees \nwhile employers have unfettered access. Employers have daily contact \nwith employees. They may distribute written materials about unions. \nThey may require employees to attend meetings where they present their \nviews on union representation. They may talk to employees one-on-one \nabout how they view union representation. On the other hand, union \norganizers are restricted from worksites and even public areas.\n  If we want people to make independent, informed decisions about \nwhether they should be represented by a union, then we have to give \nthem equal access to both sides of the story. This bill would amend the \nNational Labor Relations Act to provide equal time to labor \norganizations to provide information about union representation. Equal \ntime. That means that an employer would trigger the equal time \nprovision that this bill would insert into the NLRA by expressing \nopinions on union representation during work hours or at the worksite. \nThe provision would give a union equal time to use the same media used \nby the employer to distribute information, and would allow the union \naccess to the worksite to communicate with employees.\n  The second reform in the bill would toughen penalties for wrongful \ndischarge violations. It would require the National Labor Relations \nBoard to award back pay equal to 3 times the employee's wages when the \nBoard finds that an employee is discharged as a result of an unfair \nlabor practice. It also would allow employees to file civil actions to \nrecover punitive damages when they have been discharged as a result of \nan unfair labor practice.\n  Third, the bill would put in place mediation and arbitration \nprocedures to help employers and employees reach mutually agreeable \nfirst-contract collective bargaining agreements. It would require \nmediation if the parties cannot reach agreement on their own after 60 \ndays. Should the parties not reach agreement 30 days after a mediator \nis selected, then either party could call in the Federal Mediation and \nConciliation Service for binding arbitration. I believe that this \nproposal represents a balanced solution--one that would help both \nparties reach agreements they can live with. It gives both parties \nincentive to reach genuine agreement without allowing either side to \nindefinitely hold the other hostage to unrealistic proposals.\n  Mr. President, this bill would be a step toward fairness for working \nfamilies in America. The proposals are not new. I hope my colleagues \nwill support the bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            By Mr. DASCHLE:\n\n  S. 2391. A bill to authorize and direct the Secretary of Commerce to \ninitiate an investigation under section 702 of the Tariff Act of 1930 \nof methlyl tertiary butyl ether imported from Saudi Arabia; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                     Fair Trade in MTBE Act of 1998\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation designed to combat unfairly traded imports of methyl \ntertiary butyl ether (MTBE) from Saudi Arabia. MTBE is an oxygenated \nfuel additive derived from methanol.\n  Through the wintertime oxygenated fuels program to reduce carbon \nmonoxide pollution and through the reformulated gasoline program to \nreduce emissions of toxics and ozone-causing chemicals, we have created \nconsiderable demand in this nation for oxygenated fuels, such as MTBE, \nETBE and ethanol. It has been my hope that this demand could be met \nwith domestically-produced oxygenates, thereby reducing our dependence \non foreign imports and expanding economic opportunities at home. \nUnfortunately, this goal has not been achieved, in large part because \nof a substantial expansion of subsidized MTBE imports from Saudi \nArabia.\n  Mr. President, I am a supporter of free trade when it is also fair \ntrade. However, there has been a marked surge in MTBE imports from \nSaudi Arabia in recent years that does not reflect the natural outcome \nof market-based competition.\n  These imports appear to be driven by a pattern of government \nsubsidies. Not only is this increasing our dependence on foreign \nsuppliers, but it is unfairly harming domestic oxygenate producers and \nthose who provide the raw materials for these oxygenates, such as \nAmerica's farmers.\n  The Saudi government has made no secret of its desire to expand \ndomestic industrial capacity of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE). In \nparticular, several years ago, there were public reports that the Saudi \ngovernment promised investors a 30% discount relative to world prices \non the feedstock raw materials used in the production of MTBE. The \nfeedstock is the major cost component of MTBE production, and the Saudi \ngovernment decree has apparently translated into a nearly -30% \nartificial cost advantage to Saudi-based producers and exporters.\n  Moreover, it appears that this blatant subsidy is in large measure \nresponsible for the increase in Saudi MTBE exports to the United States \nin recent years. These exports have not only reduced the U.S. market \nshare of American producers of MTBE, ETBE, and ethanol, but also has \ndiscouraged new capital investment, thereby depriving American workers, \nfarmers, and investors of a significant share of the economic activity \nthat Congress contemplated when it drafted the oxygenated fuel \nrequirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is high time for the United States \ngovernment to respond to the Saudi government's subsidies. Saudi Arabia \nis a valued ally; however, our bond of friendship should not be a \njustification for turning a blind eye to an unfair element of our \notherwise mutually beneficial trading relationship.\n  Because it is not a member of the World Trade Organization nor a \nparty to its Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, the \nSaudi government may not feel constrained by the international trade \nrules by which we legally are required to abide. This does not mean, \nhowever, that we must stand idly by while foreign subsidies undermine \nan important sector of our economy.\n  For this reason, my bill would require the Secretary of Commerce to \nself-initiate an investigation under Section 702 of the Tariff Act of \n1930 to determine whether a countervailable subsidy has been provided \nwith respect to Saudi Arabian exports of methyl tertiary butyl ether \n(MTBE). If the Secretary finds that a subsidy has indeed been provided \nto Saudi producers, he would be required under the terms of our \nexisting law to impose an import duty in the amount necessary to offset \nthe subsidy. Because Saudi Arabia is not a member of the WTO, there \nwould be no requirement for a demonstration of injury to the domestic \nindustry as a result of the subsidy.\n  Let's talk for a moment about what is at stake here for American \nconsumers. Last year, I asked the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) \nto assess the impact on U.S. oil imports of the Reformulated Gasoline \n(RFG) program that was created by Congress in 1991. The GAO found that \nthe U.S. RFG program has already resulted in over 250,000 barrels per \nday less imported petroleum due to the addition of oxygenates like \nethanol, ETBE and MTBE. That means, at an average of $20 spent per \nbarrel of imported oil, we currently save nearly $2 billion per year \ndue to domestically produced oxygenates.\n  The GAO further found that, if all gasoline in the U.S. were \nreformulated (compared to the current 35%), the U.S. would import \n777,000 fewer barrels of oil per day. That is more than $5.5 billion \nper year that would not be flowing to foreign oil producers and could \nbe reinvested in the United States.\n  This is not ``pie-in-the-sky'' theory. Ethanol production and \ndomestically produced MTBE can reduce oil imports and strengthen our \neconomy. In rural America, for example, new ethanol and\n\n[[Page S9450]]\n\nETBE plants will be built, so long as we wise up and create a level \nplaying field against subsidized Saudi competition.\n  Phase II of the Clean Air Act's reformulated gasoline program (RFG) \nrequires transportation fuels to meet even tougher emissions standards \nstarting in the year 2000. That gasoline market is growing, with demand \nfor ethanol, ETBE and MTBE in 2005 estimated to be 300,000 barrels per \nday. Unless we act to ensure that American-made oxygenated fuels can \ncompete in American fuels markets, we stand to cede those markets to \nsubsidized Saudi Arabian MTBE.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful that my legislation will help level the \nplaying field for American producers of ethanol, ETBE and MTBE and add \nnew economic vitality to their associated communities of workers, \nfarmers, and business owners. I urge my colleagues to give it serious \nconsideration and to enact it as soon as possible so that we may begin \nthe process of bringing fairness back into the realm of international \ntrade in oxygenated fuels.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2391\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Trade in MTBE Act of \n     1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Section 814 of Public Law 101-549 (commonly referred to \n     as the ``Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990'') expressed the \n     sense of Congress that every effort should be made to \n     purchase and produce American-made reformulated gasoline and \n     other clean fuel products.\n       (2) Since the passage of the Clean Air Amendments Act of \n     1990, Saudi Arabia has added substantial industrial capacity \n     for the production of methyl tertiary butyl ether (in this \n     Act referred to as ``MTBE'').\n       (3) The expansion of Saudi Arabian production capacity has \n     been stimulated by government subsidies, notably in the form \n     of a governmental decree guaranteeing Saudi Arabian MTBE \n     producers a 30 percent discount relative to world prices on \n     feedstock.\n       (4) The expansion of subsidized Saudi Arabian production \n     has been accompanied by a major increase in Saudi Arabian \n     MTBE exported to the United States.\n       (5) The subsidized Saudi Arabian MTBE exports have reduced \n     the market share of American producers of MTBE, ETBE, and \n     ethanol, as well as discouraged capital investment by \n     American producers.\n       (6) Saudi Arabia is not a member of the World Trade \n     Organization and is not subject to the terms and conditions \n     of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures \n     negotiated as part of the Uruguay Round Agreements.\n\n     SEC. 3. INITIATION OF COUNTERVAILING DUTY INVESTIGATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the administering authority shall \n     initiate an investigation pursuant to title VII of the Tariff \n     Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1671 et seq.) to determine if the \n     necessary elements exist for the imposition of a duty under \n     section 701 of such Act with respect to the importation into \n     the United States of MTBE from Saudi Arabia.\n       (b) Administering Authority.--For purposes of this section, \n     the term ``administering authority'' has the meaning given \n     such term by section 771(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 \n     U.S.C. 1677(1)).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNETT (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Kohl, \n        and Mr. Robb) (by request):\n  S. 2392. A bill to encourage the disclosure and exchange of \ninformation about computer processing problems and related matters in \nconnection with the transition to the Year 2000; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n                  year 2000 information disclosure act\n\n Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, today I introduce, by request of \nPresident Bill Clinton, the Administration's ``Good Samaritan'' \nlegislation referred to as the ``Year 2000 Information Disclosure \nAct''.\n  I want to thank the White House for joining Vice Chairman Dodd and \nthe rest of the members of the Special Committee on the Year 2000 \nTechnology Problem in the debate on how to promote the flow of \ninformation on Year 2000 readiness throughout the private sector. The \nAdministration's recognition of this problem, the fear of law suits and \nits stifling effect on companies' willingness to disclose helpful Y2K \ninformation, is invaluable in helping all of us deal with this national \ncrisis.\n  The existing legal framework clearly discourages the sharing of \ncritical information between private sector companies. The President's \nbill attempts to limit the legal liability of corporations and other \norganizations who in good faith openly share information about computer \nand technology processing problems and related matters in connection \nwith the transition to the Year 2000. We welcome the thoughtful ideas \nof the White House and the hard work of the Office of Management and \nBudget, as well John Koskinen, the Chairman of the President's Council \non Year 2000 Conversion.\n  President Clinton's proposal represents a good starting point from \nwhich to begin the process of addressing the critical need for private \nsector information sharing announced in his speech before the National \nSciences Foundation on Tuesday, July 14.\n  The Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem, \nwhich I chair, has to date held hearings on Year 2000 problems in \nseveral industry sectors including energy utilities, financial \ninstitutions, and health care. This Friday, July 31, the Committee will \nhold its fourth hearing the subject of which will be the \ntelecommunications industry. In each of the prior hearings, it has \nbecome increasingly evident that the fear of legal liability has proven \nto be the single biggest deterrent to the open sharing of Year 2000 \ninformation. With just over 500 days remaining before the Year 2000 \nproblem manifests itself in full, we must do everything we can to \nencourage the sharing of vital Year 2000 information. Through this \nsharing, organizations can save valuable time and resources in \naddressing their Year 2000 problems.\n  But, we must be careful to pass meaningful legislation that will \nindeed encourage disclosure and sharing of Year 2000 information. For \nexample, small companies which cannot afford to do all of their own \ntesting and who, for the most part, are not as knowledgeable about \nwhere the dangers of the Y2K bug may appear are significant elements of \nour economy and their Y2K failures could have devastating impacts on \nthose who depend on their services.\n  We look forward to hearing the input of those companies and \nindividuals who are affected both as plaintiffs and defendants. To be \nof value, we must pass legislation this year. To that end, we will be \nworking closely with the administration, and with Senators Hatch and \nLeahy of the Judiciary Committee which has the primary jurisdiction for \nthis legislation.\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with \nSenators Robert F. Bennett (R-UT) and Christopher Dodd (D-CT) today as \noriginal cosponsors of President Clinton's ``Year 2000 (Y2K) \nInformation Disclosure Act.'' This legislation is intended to promote \nthe open sharing of information about Y2K solutions by protecting those \nwho share information in good faith from liability claims based on \nexchanges of information. As the President stated in his speech at the \nNational Academy of Sciences on July 14, 1998, the purpose of this \nlegislation is to ``guarantee that businesses which share information \nabout their readiness with the public or with each other, and do it \nhonestly and carefully, cannot be held liable for the exchange of that \ninformation if it turns out to be inaccurate.''\n  The open sharing of information on the Y2K problem will play a \nsignificant role in preparing the nation and the world for the \nmillennial malady. I urge the prompt and favorable consideration of \nthis legislation. There is no time to waste.\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I join with Senator Robert \nBennett, the chairman of the Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000 \nTechnology Problem, to introduce, at the request of the President of \nthe United States, ``The Year 2000 Information Disclosure Act.'' We are \njoined in this introduction by Senators Moynihan, Kohl, and Robb.\n  It should be clear to even the most disinterested observer that we \nare facing a serious economic challenge in\n\n[[Page S9451]]\n\nform of the Year 2000 computer problem. There is little doubt that the \nmillennium conversion will have a significant impact on the economy; \nthe outstanding question is how large that impact will be.\n  One of the most relevant factors in assessing the potential impact of \nthis problem is the expected readiness of small and medium sized \nbusinesses to deal with this issue. Many of the nation's largest \ncorporations are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to prepare \nfor Year 2000 conversion: Citibank is spending $600 million, Aetna is \nspending more than $125 million, and the list goes on and on. However, \nit is not so clear that small and medium sized businesses are \napproaching the problem with similar vigor.\n  As a result, it is my opinion that it will become increasingly \nnecessary for those companies that have successfully completed \nremediation and are now testing to able to share those results with \nother companies that might not be as far along. It will be an \nincreasing national economic priority to use all the tools available to \nhelp businesses and government entities meet the millennium deadline, \nand encouraging the sharing of information that can cut precious weeks \noff the time it takes to get ready will be essential.\n  I agree with the statements of President Clinton that companies that \nmake such voluntary disclosures should not be punished for those \ndisclosures with frivolous or abusive lawsuits. It is to address that \nconcern that the President has requested that Senator Bennett and I \nintroduce his legislation.\n  I also agree with the President's analysis that in order for this \ninformation-sharing to be effective, it must start to take place as \nsoon as possible. Sharing information about non-compliant systems six, \neight, or twelve months from now will be of limited value to all \nconcerned.\n  Some questions have emerged in the press as to the scope of this \nlegislation. The fact is that there are very few weeks left in this \nsession, and therefore the broader the bill, the more difficult it will \nbe to pass. Therefore, if we are intent on providing protection for \nvoluntary disclosures on Year 2000, it will be very hard to add to that \nprovisions dealing with other aspects of Year 2000 liability. While I \nbelieve that concerns on underlying liability are real and meaningful, \nthere is little question that dealing with any liability issues is \nalways a controversial and lengthy process. So as we move forward with \nthe concept of a safe harbor for voluntary disclosure, I hope that we \ncan do so without encumbering that legislation with these larger and \ncontentious issues regarding liability.\n  President Clinton has given us an excellent starting point for \ndiscussing these important issues. I look forward to working with all \nmy colleagues in the weeks remaining to craft final legislation that \naddresses these issues in a meaningful and constructive manner.\n\n

There has been a 60 percent increase \nin the number of children needing foster care in the last 10 years. \nMany children today face crises of grave proportions, especially as \nthey enter their adolescent years.\n  The establishment of a National Children's Day would help us focus on \nour children's needs and recognize their accomplishments. It would \nencourage families to spend more quality time together and highlight \nthe special importance of the child in the family unit.\n  It is important that we show our support for the youth of America. \nThis simple resolution will foster family togetherness and ensure that \nour children receive the attention they deserve.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in establishing National Children's \nDay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9453-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 261--TO PRIVATIZE THE SENATE BARBER AND BEAUTY SHOPS \n                       AND THE SENATE RESTAURANTS\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                              S.

Res. 262\n\n       Whereas, advances in science and technology will continue \n     to underlie the prosperity and security of the United States \n     and the international community into the next century;\n       Whereas, the United States and Japan are global leaders in \n     science and technology;\n       Whereas, the rapid pace of innovation creates growing \n     linkages between science and technology and bilateral \n     relations in security and trade;\n       Whereas, the Government of Japan, through its 1996 Basic \n     Plan for Science and Technology, made science and technology \n     a higher priority area of investment for the Government of \n     Japan;\n       Whereas, the Supplemental Budget of the Government of Japan \n     for 1998 will result in more than a 21 percent increase in \n     the Government of Japan's support for science and technology \n     this year;\n       Whereas, advances in Japanese science and technology are \n     increasingly at the global frontier;\n       Whereas, cooperation between the United States and Japan in \n     science and technology holds the promise of better assuring \n     human health and nutrition, enhancing the quality of the \n     environment, lessening the impact of natural and man-made \n     disasters, providing for more productive agriculture, \n     stimulating discoveries in the basic processes of life and \n     matter, expanding supplies of energy, furthering advances in \n     space exploration, improving manufacturing processes, and \n     strengthening communications through electronic language \n     translation;\n       Whereas, productive collaboration with Japan has increased \n     due to negotiated frameworks such as the bilateral Agreement \n     for Cooperation in Science and Technology and efforts by the \n     Government of Japan to invite larger numbers of U.S. \n     scientists to participate in university, government and \n     industrial research in Japan;\n       Whereas, the flow of science and technology from the United \n     States to Japan is nonetheless still larger than the reverse \n     due partly to barriers Japan has erected to the outward flow \n     of scientific and technological information and data, as well \n     as barriers to the inward flow of foreign investment and \n     foreign participation in industrial organizations such as \n     consortia and associations;\n       Whereas, the application of rigorous scientific methods to \n     the development of standards and regulations can help \n     mitigate certain market access and trade problems;\n       Whereas, Japan's treatment of scientific and technological \n     advances continues to handicap U.S. innovators in Japan due \n     to inadequate intellectual property protection;\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that:\n       (1) The Government of the United States should place \n     priority on formulating a comprehensive and strategic policy \n     of engaging and cooperating with Japan in advancing science \n     and technology for the benefit of both nations as well as the \n     rest of the world;\n       (2) Among other goals, that policy should aim to promote \n     strategic cooperation on areas that further U.S. policy \n     interests in science and technology; more balanced flows of \n     scientific and technological information and personnel \n     between the United States and Japan; more rigorous \n     application of scientific methods in the development of \n     standards and regulations to promote efficient technological \n     progress and mitigate trade problems; and more equitable \n     intellectual property protection; and\n       (3) The Government of the United States should integrate \n     this strategic policy into current and future science and \n     technology agreements with the Government of Japan.\n\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nMr. Bingaman to submit a resolution to state the sense of the Senate \nthat the Governments of the United States and Japan should place \npriority on formulating a comprehensive and strategic policy of \nadvancing science and technology for the benefit of both nations as \nwell as the rest of the world.\n  As this body is well aware, Japan is facing a number of economic and \nfinancial challenges that are of vital importance to the bilateral \nrelationship. I have spoken about these challenges at length in other \nfora including through a hearing recently held by the Finance \nCommittee. While our priority in bilateral relations should remain \nJapan's rapid economic recovery, we must not lose sight of other \naspects of the relationship that are important to our shared future.\n\n[[Page S9454]]\n\n  For example, Japan is a major source of leading-edge science and \ntechnology. Two years ago, the Government of Japan released its Basic \nPlan for Science and Technology. That plan called for substantial \nfunding increases and important policy reforms to further innovation in \nthe country's science and technology programs and processes.\n  This year, the Government of Japan will increase its investment in \nscience and technology by more than 21 percent. With these new \nresources, Japan--already at the forefront in many areas of science and \ntechnology--will be poised to make further important advances.\n  For decades, the U.S. has shared the fruit of its own basic research \nwith Japan and the rest of the world in an effort to enhance global \nprosperity and the lives of average people around the world. With its \nincreased resources devoted to science and technology, Japan has a more \nimportant opportunity to join the United States in taking a similar \napproach toward sharing advances in science and technology. The \npotential for greater benefits for both countries and for the rest of \nthe world are enormous.\n  For example, opportunities are emerging to improve human health by \njointly addressing the problems posed by infectious diseases; \nsustaining the quality of the environment through research on global \nclimate change; reducing the risks posed by earthquakes and hurricanes; \nfurthering the fundamental understanding of matter so important for \nadvances in new materials, telecommunications, and new medical \ntreatments; and better ensuring mutual security.\n  Partly because Japan was engaged in catching up with other leaders in \nscience and technology for much of the postwar period, Tokyo tended to \nemphasize the accumulation--rather than the sharing--of information. \nNow that Japan is a global leader in science and technology, however, I \nbelieve Tokyo should move toward greater emphasis on cooperation. \nSimilarly, I believe it important that Japan pay more attention to \nbasic research that advances general knowledge as opposed to Tokyo's \ntraditional emphasis on applied research.\n  The potential for a greater bilateral partnership in science and \ntechnology is growing, and both the U.S. and Japanese governments \nshould work toward turning that potential into reality. That is the \npurpose of this resolution and I urge my colleagues to support its \nearly passage.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in enthusiastic support of \nthe statement made by Senator Roth concerning the U.S.-Japan \nrelationship and, furthermore, to ask our colleagues to support this \nresolution.\n  As you are aware, I have been integrally involved over the years with \nmany of my colleagues in ascertaining the obstacles and opportunities \nthat exist between the United States and Japan. I have offered ongoing \nsupport for a cooperative, forward-looking bilateral relationship that \nis defined by transparency, access, equity and reciprocity. Given the \ncurrent environment in East Asia and the potential for political \neconomic instability, I believe the U.S.-Japan relationship to be one \nof our country's most important in that region, and worthy of constant \nand precise attention.\n  In the future, much as in the past, Japan will be both partner and \ncompetitor, and we must ensure that we maintain our support for this \nrelationship while we recognize both its possibilities and its \nlimitations.\n  The resolution submitted by Senator Roth and I identifies the level \nof science and technology interaction that has developed between the \nUnited States and Japan over the last decade, and gives a number of \nsuggestions as to where we should go in the future. Specific reference \nis made to the U.S.-Japan Science and Technology Agreement, which is \nnow being re-negotiated by our two governments. Let me describe in \nconcise terms what I see as important in this regard.\n  Significantly, the United States and Japan are, at present, \ncooperating in a range of projects as diverse as Global Change, \nEarthquake Disaster Mitigation, Emerging Infectious Diseases, Global \nInformation Infrastructure, Space Cooperation, Thermonuclear \nExperimentation, Deep Sea Drilling, and Sustainable Development. \nIndividually, these projects include the participation of nearly every \ndepartment and agency in the U.S. government, and all have been \ninitiated and have prospered as a result of the U.S.-Japan Science and \nTechnology Agreement. All of these projects will grow even more \nsubstantially with the renewal of the agreement. Clearly this is \nsomething to be encouraged.\n  Significantly, all of these projects mentioned above will benefit not \nonly the United States and Japan, but also the developed and developing \ncountries in the world--many of which are eager for the knowledge and \ntechnology that derive from our two countries' cooperative activities. \nThis interaction has already provided innumerable advantages to the \ninternational community, and can only provide even more in the future. \nWith certain conditions, it deserves our wholehearted support.\n  The current resolution outlines some, but not all of these \nconditions. As specific examples, we need to ensure that the \ncooperative interaction between the United States and Japan results in \nbalanced and easily accessible flows of information between the United \nStates and Japan, and that all data from this interaction be easily \navailable to other scientists and engineers in the international \ncommunity. International access to private sector laboratories in Japan \nneeds to be improved. Divisions that exist between ministries in \nJapan--fragmentation that creates serious obstacles for research \nprojects that include national universities and government research \nlaboratories--must be made less evident. Effective mechanisms that \nallow the U.S. and other countries to participate in Japanese research \nprojects need to be identified and obstacles that preclude this \ninteraction eliminated. A more complete development of common \nregulations and standards should be pursued, and dual use and export \ncontrol policies clarified. Questions relating to intellectual property \nrights have existed far too long and should be rectified. Finally, the \nobvious relationship that exists between science, technology and trade \nrelations should be recognized, and understandings reached between the \ntwo governments on important, cross-cutting issues.\n  While these aforementioned problems should not prevent the U.S.-Japan \nScience and Technology Agreement from being renewed, our concerns \nshould be made apparent during negotiations.\n  I would argue that any new agreement must satisfy three criteria:\n  First, it must recognize that serious structural and \nprocedural assymetries still exist between the two countries and that \nthey must be resolved;\n\n  Second, it must provide freedom for scientists and engineers to \ninteract and complete their research as free as possible from \ngovernment interference;\n  Finally, it must recognize that the results that derive from U.S.-\nJapan science and technology cooperation has the potential to alleviate \nmany of the problems we face in the world today and, as such, should be \neasily diffused into the international community.\n  Much of our current science and technology cooperation with Japan \nrests on a single but extremely important premise: the U.S. economic \nand national security interest depends upon its ability to complete \nfundamental research in critical areas, and then encourage innovation \nthat will result in competitive advantage. Where this research might \nonce have been done in isolation and without data input from other \ncountries, it now requires the capacity to access information and \ntechnologies being developed elsewhere. While the United States has \nbeen inattentive to the importance of increased expenditures on science \nand technology, Japan has not. While we still lead in many \ntechnologies, we will not do so in perpetuity.\n  Science and engineering are the archetypical endeavors of the current \ninternational society: individuals and ideas come together in an effort \nto improve the collective welfare of the global community at large. We \nmust recognize this dynamic, and encourage it every way we can.\n  Let me emphasize that the results of research in laboratories across \nthe world are not abstractions. As America's productivity, \ncompetitiveness, and economic performance--indeed, its very economic \nsecurity--depends upon\n\n[[Page S9455]]\n\ncooperative research and development with Japan and other countries, \nthese results provide tangible advantages for families in New Mexico \nand every other state in the union. The car you drive, the home you \nlive in, the appliances you use, the food you eat, the air you \nbreathe--all of these derive from research and development programs \nthat were undertaken yesterday. These programs should be a national \npriority.\n  To this end, it is essential that we further solidify the cooperative \nlinkages that exist between our two countries, to find ways to leverage \nincreasingly scarce funds, to combine diverse and complementary streams \nof ideas and technologies, and to provide mutual advantages to our \nrespective societies and the international community as a whole.\n  Although some would deny the obvious synergies that exist between the \nUnited States and Japan at this time, it is not in our national \ninterest to do so. The question is no longer whether these synergies \nwill exist, but under what conditions they will exist. Interaction \nbetween our two countries exists on a scale far beyond what many once \nconsidered possible, and it will only grow as scientific and \ntechnological interaction between the two countries increases. We \nshould take real pride in this development, just as we must, at the \nsame time, carefully consider the path we will follow in the future.\n  While the current resolution is non-binding, it does reflect our \ndesire to engage Japan in an ongoing, cooperative, and reciprocal \nrelationship. Senator Roth and I consider the U.S.-Japan Science and \nTechnology Agreement to be an interactive arrangements of the highest \nimportance, and we hope other colleagues will join us in our support \nfor its renewal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9453-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 263--TO AUTHORIZE PAYMENT OF THE EXPENSES OF \n    REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SENATE ATTENDING THE FUNERAL OF A SENATOR\n\n  Mr. WARNER submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S.

SHUTTLE PRIVATIZATION.\n\n       (a) Policy and Preparation.--The Administrator shall \n     prepare for an orderly transition from the Federal operation, \n     or Federal management of contracted operation, of space \n     transportation systems to the Federal purchase of commercial \n     space transportation services for all nonemergency launch \n     requirements, including human, cargo, and mixed payloads. In \n     those preparations, the Administrator shall take into account \n     the need for short-term economies, as well as the goal of \n     restoring the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's \n     research focus and its mandate to promote the fullest \n     possible commercial use of space. As part of those \n     preparations, the Administrator shall plan for the potential \n     privatization of the Space Shuttle program. That plan shall \n     keep safety and cost effectiveness as high priorities. \n     Nothing in this section shall prohibit the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration from studying, \n     designing, developing, or funding upgrades or modifications \n     essential to the safe and economical operation of the Space \n     Shuttle fleet.\n       (b) Feasibility Study.--The Administrator shall conduct a \n     study of the feasibility of implementing the recommendation \n     of the Independent Shuttle Management Review Team that the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration transition \n     toward the privatization of the Space Shuttle. The study \n     shall identify, discuss, and, where possible, present options \n     for resolving, the major policy and legal issues that must be \n     addressed before the Space Shuttle is privatized, including--\n       (1) whether the Federal Government or the Space Shuttle \n     contractor should own the Space Shuttle orbiters and ground \n     facilities;\n       (2) whether the Federal Government should indemnify the \n     contractor for any third party liability arising from Space \n     Shuttle operations, and, if so, under what terms and \n     conditions;\n       (3) whether payloads other than National Aeronautics and \n     Space Administration payloads should be allowed to be \n     launched on the Space Shuttle, how missions will be \n     prioritized, and who will decide which mission flies and \n     when;\n       (4) whether commercial payloads should be allowed to be \n     launched on the Space Shuttle and whether any classes of \n     payloads should be made ineligible for launch consideration;\n       (5) whether National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     and other Federal Government payloads should have priority \n     over non-Federal payloads in the Space Shuttle launch \n     assignments, and what policies should be developed to \n     prioritize among payloads generally;\n       (6) whether the public interest requires that certain Space \n     Shuttle functions continue to be performed by the Federal \n     Government; and\n       (7) how much cost savings, if any, will be generated by \n     privatization of the Space Shuttle.\n       (c) Report to Congress.--Within 60 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration shall complete the study required under \n     subsection (b) and shall submit a report on the study to the \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the \n     Senate and the Committee on Science of the House of \n     Representatives.\n\n     SEC. 914. USE OF EXCESS INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILES.\n\n       (a) In general.--The Federal Government shall not--\n       (1) convert any missile described in subsection (c) to a \n     space transportation vehicle configuration or otherwise use \n     any such missile to place a payload in space; or\n       (2) transfer ownership of any such missile to another \n     person, except as provided in subsection (b).\n       (b) Authorized Federal Uses.--\n       (1) A missile described in subsection (c) may be converted \n     for use as a space transportation vehicle by the Federal \n     Government if except as provided in paragraph (2), at least \n     30 days before that conversion the agency seeking to use the \n     missile as a space transportation vehicle transmits to the \n     Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee \n     on National Security and the Committee Science of the House \n     of Representatives, shall ensure in writing that the use of \n     that missile--\n       (A) would result in cost savings to the Federal Government \n     when compared to the cost of acquiring space transportation \n     services from United States commercial providers;\n       (B) meets all mission requirements of the agency, including \n     performance, schedule, and risk requirements;\n       (C) is consistent with international obligations of the \n     United States; and\n       (D) is approved by the Secretary of Defense or his \n     designee.\n       (2) The requirement under paragraph (1) that the assurance \n     described in that paragraph must be transmitted at least 30 \n     days before conversion of the missile shall not apply if the \n     Secretary of Defense determines that compliance with that \n     requirement would be inconsistent with meeting immediate \n     national security requirements.\n       (c) Missiles Referred to.-- The missiles referred to in \n     this section are missiles owned by the United States that--\n       (1) were formerly used by the Department of Defense for \n     national defense purposes as intercontinental ballistic \n     missiles; and\n       (2) have been declared excess to United States national \n     defense needs and are in compliance with international \n     obligations of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 915.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the \n     unprecedented explosion of technological advances that could \n     fundamentally redefine military threats and military \n     capabilities in the future have generated a need to assess \n     the defense policy, strategy, and force structure necessary \n     to meet future defense requirements of the United States.\n       (2) The assessment conducted by the administration of \n     President Bush (known as the ``Base Force'' assessment) and \n     the assessment conducted by the administration of President \n     Clinton (known as the ``Bottom-Up Review'') were important \n     attempts to redefine the defense strategy of the United \n     States and the force structure of the Armed Forces necessary \n     to execute that strategy.\n       (3) Those assessments have become inadequate as a result of \n     the pace of global geopolitical change and the speed of \n     technological change, which have been greater than expected.\n       (4) The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff reacted to \n     the changing environment by developing and publishing in May \n     1996 a vision statement, known as ``Joint Vision 2010'', to \n     be a basis for the transformation of United States military \n     capabilities. The vision statement embodies the improved \n     intelligence and command and control that is available in the \n     information age and sets forth the operational concepts of \n     dominant maneuver, precision engagement, full-dimensional \n     protection, and focused logistics to achieve the objective of \n     full spectrum dominance.\n       (5) In 1996 Congress, concerned about the shortcomings in \n     defense policies and programs derived from the Base-Force \n     Review and the Bottom Up Review, determined that there was a \n     need for a new, comprehensive assessment of the defense \n     strategy of the United States and the force structure of the \n     Armed Forces necessary for meeting the threats to the United \n     States in the 21st century.\n       (6) As a result of that determination, Congress passed the \n     Military Force Structure Review Act of 1996 (subtitle B of \n     title IX of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 1997), which required the Secretary of Defense to \n     complete in 1997 a quadrennial defense review of the \n     defense program of the United States. The review was \n     required to include a comprehensive examination of the \n     defense strategy, force structure, force modernization \n     plans, infrastructure, and other elements of the defense \n     program and policies with a view toward determining and \n     expressing the defense strategy of the United States and \n     establishing a revised defense program through 2005. The \n     Act also established a National Defense Panel to assess \n     the Quadrennial Defense Review and to conduct an \n     independent, nonpartisan review of the strategy, force \n     structure, and funding required to meet anticipated \n     threats to the national security of the United States \n     through 2010 and beyond.\n       (7) The Quadrennial Defense Review, completed by the \n     Secretary of Defense in May 1997, defined the defense \n     strategy in terms of ``Shape, Respond, and Prepare Now''. The \n     Quadrennial Defense Review placed greater emphasis on the \n     need to prepare now for an uncertain future by exploiting the \n     revolution in technology and transforming the force toward \n     Joint Vision 2010. It concluded that our future force will be \n     different in character than our current force.\n       (8) The National Defense Panel Report, published in \n     December 1997, concluded that ``the Department of Defense \n     should accord the highest priority to executing a \n     transformation strategy for the United States military, \n     starting now.'' The panel recommended the establishment of a \n     Joint Forces Command with the responsibility to be the joint \n     force integrator and provider and the responsibility for \n     driving the process for transforming United States forces, \n     including the conduct of joint experimentation, and to have \n     the budget for carrying out those responsibilities.\n       (9) The assessments of both the Quadrennial Defense Review \n     and the National Defense Panel provide the Senate with a \n     compelling argument that the future security environment and \n     the military challenges to be faced by the United States in \n     the future will be fundamentally different than the current \n     environment and challenges. The assessments also reinforce \n     the foundational premise of the Goldwater-Nichols Department \n     of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 that warfare, in all of \n     its varieties, will be joint warfare requiring the execution \n     of developed joint operational concepts.\n       (10) A process of joint experimentation is necessary for--\n       (A) integrating advances in technology with changes in the \n     organizational structure of the Armed Forces and the \n     development of joint operational concepts that will be \n     effective against national security threats anticipated for \n     the future; and\n       (B) identifying and assessing the interdependent aspects of \n     joint warfare that are key for transforming the conduct of \n     military operations by the United States to meet those \n     anticipated threats successfully.\n       (11) It is critical for future readiness that the Armed \n     Forces of the Untied States innovatively investigate and test \n     technologies, forces, and joint operational concepts in \n     simulations, wargames, and virtual settings, as well as in \n     field environments under realistic conditions against the \n     full range of future challenges. It is essential that an \n     energetic and innovative organization be established\n\n[[Page S9463]]\n\n     and empowered to design and implement a process of joint \n     experimentation to develop and validate new joint warfighting \n     concepts, along with experimentation by the Armed Forces, \n     that is directed at transforming the Armed Forces to meet the \n     threats to the national security that are anticipated for the \n     early 21st century. That process will drive changes in \n     doctrine, organization, training and education, materiel, \n     leadership, and personnel.\n       (12) The Department of Defense is committed to conducting \n     aggressive experimentation as a key component of its \n     transformation strategy. The competition of ideas is critical \n     for achieving effective transformation. Experimentation by \n     each of the Armed Forces has been, and will continue to be, a \n     vital aspect of the pursuit of effective transformation. \n     Joint experimentation leverages the effectiveness of each of \n     the Armed Forces and the Defense Agencies.\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF SENATE.\n\n       (a) Designation of Commander To Have Joint Warfighting \n     Experimentation Mission.--It is the sense of Senate that \n     Congress supports the initiative of the Secretary of Defense \n     and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to designate a \n     commander of a combatant command to have the mission for \n     joint warefighting experimentation, consistent with the \n     understanding of the Senate that the Chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff will assign the designated commander the \n     tasks to develop and validate new joint warfighting \n     concepts and capabilities, and to determine the \n     implications, for doctrine, organization, training and \n     education, materiel, leadership, and personnel, of the \n     Department of Defense strategy for transforming the Armed \n     Forces to meet the national security threats of the \n     future.\n       (b) Resources of Commander.--It is, further, the sense of \n     Senate that the commander designated to have the joint \n     warfighting experimentation mission should--\n       (1) have sufficient freedom of action and authority over \n     the necessary forces to successfully establish and conduct \n     the process of joint warfighting experimentation;\n       (2) be provided resources adequate for the joint \n     warfighting experimentation process; and\n       (3) have authority over the use of the resources for the \n     planning, preparation, conduct, and assessment of joint \n     warfighting experimentation.\n       (c) Authority and Responsibilities of Commander.--It is, \n     further, the sense of Senate that, for the conduct of joint \n     warfighting experimentation to be effective, it is necessary \n     that the commander designated to have the joint warfighting \n     experimentation mission also have the authority and \n     responsibility for the following:\n       (1) Developing and implementing a process of joint \n     experimentation to formulate and validate concepts critical \n     for joint warfighting in the future, including (in such \n     process) analyses, simulations, wargames, information \n     superiority and other experiments, advanced concept \n     technology demonstrations, and joint exercises conducted in \n     virtual and actual field environments.\n       (2) Planning, preparing, and conducting the program of \n     joint warfighting experimentation.\n       (3) Assessing the effectiveness of organizational \n     structures, operational concepts, and technologies employed \n     in joint experimentation, investigating opportunities for \n     coordinating the evolution of the organizational structure of \n     the Armed Forces compatibly with the concurrent evolution of \n     advanced technologies, and investigating new concepts for \n     transforming joint warfighting capabilities to meet the \n     operational challenges expected to be encountered by the \n     Armed Forces in the early 21st century.\n       (4) Coordinating with each of the Armed Forces and the \n     Defense Agencies regarding the development of the equipment \n     (including surrogate or real technologies, platforms, and \n     systems) necessary for the conduct of joint \n     experimentation, or, if necessary, developing such \n     equipment directly.\n       (5) Coordinating with each of the Armed Forces and the \n     Defense Agencies regarding the acquisition of the materiel, \n     supplies, services, and surrogate or real technology \n     resources necessary for the conduct of joint experimentation, \n     or, if necessary, acquiring such items and services directly.\n       (6) Developing scenarios and measures of effectiveness for \n     joint experimentation.\n       (7) conducting so-called ``red team'' vulnerability \n     assessments as part of joint experimentation.\n       (8) Assessing the interoperability of equipment and forces.\n       (9) Providing the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff with the commander's \n     recommendations (developed on the basis of joint \n     experimentation) for reducing unnecessary redundancy of \n     equipment and forces.\n       (10) Providing the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff with the commander's \n     recommendations (developed on the basis of joint \n     experimentation) regarding synchronization of the fielding of \n     advanced technologies among the Armed Forces to enable the \n     development and execution of joint operational concepts.\n       (11) Submitting, reviewing, and making recommendations (in \n     conjunction with the joint experimentation and evaluation \n     process) to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on \n     mission needs statements and operational requirements \n     documents.\n       (12) Exploring new operational concepts (including those \n     developed within the Office of the Secretary of Defense and \n     Defense Agencies, other unified commands, the Armed Forces, \n     and the Joint Staff), and integrating and testing in joint \n     experimentation the systems and concepts that result from \n     warfighting experimentation by the Armed Forces and the \n     Defense Agencies.\n       (13) Developing, planning, refining, assessing, and \n     recommending to the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff the most promising joint concepts \n     and capabilities for experimentation and assessment.\n       (14) Assisting the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff to prioritize joint requirements \n     and acquisition programs on the basis of joint warfighting \n     experimentation.\n       (d) Continued Experimentation by Other Defense \n     Organizations.--It is, further, the sense of Senate that--\n       (1) the Armed Forces are expected to continue to develop \n     concepts and conduct intraservice and multiservice \n     warfighting experimentation within their core competencies; \n     and\n       (2) the commander of United States Special Operations \n     Command is expected to continue to develop concepts and \n     conduct joint experimentation associated with special \n     operations forces.\n       (e) Congressional Review.--It is, further, the sense of \n     Senate that--\n       (1) The Senate will carefully review the initial report and \n     annual reports on joint warfighting experimentation required \n     under section 1203 to determine the adequacy of the scope and \n     pace of the transformation of the Armed Forces to meet future \n     challenges to the national security; and\n       (2) if the progress is inadequate, the Senate will consider \n     legislation to establish a unified combatant command with the \n     mission, forces, budget, responsibilities, and authority \n     described in the preceding provisions of this section.\n\n     SEC.     .

(a) The Secretary of Defense, in coordination \n     with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall carry \n     out a program to distribute surplus dental equipment of the \n     Department of Defense, at no cost to the recipients, to \n     Federally-qualified health centers (within the meaning of \n     section 1905(l)(2)(B) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1396d(l)(2)(B))) that serve special medically underserved \n     populations including migratory and seasonal agricultural \n     workers, the homeless, and residents of public housing.\n       (b) Not later than March 15, 1999, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall submit to Congress a report on the program, including \n     the actions taken under the program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               HUTCHISON (AND ABRAHAM) AMENDMENT NO. 3409\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself and Mr. Abraham) proposed an amendment to \nthe bill, S 2132, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       SEC. (a): Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since 1989,\n       (A) The national defense budget has been cut in half as a \n     percentage of the gross domestic product;\n       (B) The national defense budget has been cut by over $120 \n     billion in real terms;\n       (C) The U.S. military force structure has been reduced by \n     more than 30 percent;\n       (D) The Department of Defense's operations and maintenance \n     accounts have been reduced by 40 percent;\n       (E) The Department of Defense's procurement funding has \n     declined by more than 50 percent;\n       (F) U.S. military operational commitments have increased \n     fourfold;\n       (G) The Army has reduced its ranks by over 630,000 soldiers \n     and civilians, closed over 700 installations at home and \n     overseas, and cut 10 divisions from its force structure;\n       (H) The Army has reduced its presence in Europe from \n     215,000 to 65,000 personnel;\n       (I) The Army has averaged 14 deployments every four years, \n     increased significantly from the Cold War trend of one \n     deployment every four years;\n       (J) The Air Force has downsized by nearly 40 percent, while \n     experiencing a four-fold increase in operational commitments.\n       (2) In 1992, 37 percent of the Navy's fleet was deployed at \n     any given time. Today that number is 57 percent; at its \n     present rate, it will climb to 62 percent by 2005.\n       (3) The Navy Surface Warfare Officer community will fall \n     short of its needs a 40 percent increase in retention to meet \n     requirements;\n       (4) The Air Force is 18 percent short of its retention goal \n     for second-term airmen;\n       (5) The Air Force is more than 800 pilots short, and more \n     than 70 percent eligible for retention bonuses have turned \n     them down in favor of separation;\n       (6) The Army faces critical personnel shortages in combat \n     units, forcing unit commanders to borrow troops from other \n     units just to participate in training exercises.\n       (7) An Air Force F-16 squadron commander testified before \n     the House National Security Committee that his unit was \n     forced to borrow three aircraft and use cannibalized parts \n     from four other F-16s in order to deploy to Southwest Asia;\n       (8) In 1997, the Army averaged 31,000 soldiers deployed \n     away from their home station in support of military \n     operations in 70 countries with the average deployment \n     lasting 125 days;\n       (9) Critical shortfalls in meeting recruiting and retention \n     goals is seriously affecting the ability of the Army to train \n     and deploy. The Army reduced its recruiting goals for 1998 by \n     12,000 personnel;\n       (10) In fiscal year 1997, the Army fell short of its \n     recruiting goal for critical infantry soldiers by almost \n     5,000. As of February 15, 1998, Army-wide shortages existed \n     for 28 Army specialities. Many positions in squads and crews \n     are left unfilled or minimally filled because personnel are \n     diverted to work in key positions elsewhere;\n       (11) The Navy reports it will fall short of enlisted sailor \n     recruitment for 1998 by 10,000\n       (12) One in ten Air Force front-line units are not combat \n     ready;\n       (13) Ten Air Force technical specialties, representing \n     thousands of airmen, deployed away from their home station \n     for longer than the Air Force standard 120-day mark in 1997;\n       (14) The Air Force fell short of its reenlistment rate for \n     mid-career enlisted personnel by an average of six percent, \n     with key war fighting career fields experiencing even larger \n     drops in reenlistments;\n       (15) In 1997, U.S. Marines in the operating forces have \n     deployed on more than 200 exercises, rotational deployments, \n     or actual contingencies.\n       (16) U.S. Marine Corps maintenance forces are only able to \n     maintain 92 percent ground equipment and 77 percent aviation \n     equipment readiness rates due to excessive deployments of \n     troops and equipment;\n       (17) The National Security Strategy of the United States \n     assumes the ability of the U.S. Armed Forces to prevail in \n     two major regional conflicts nearly simultaneously.\n       (18) To execute the National Security of the United States, \n     the U.S. Army's five later-deploying divisions, which \n     constitute almost half of the Army's active combat forces, \n     are critical to the success of specific war plans;\n       (19) According to commanders in these divisions, the \n     practice of under staffing squads and crews that are \n     responsible for training, and assigning personnel to other \n     units as fillers for exercises and operations, has become \n     common and is degrading unit capability and readiness.\n       (20) In the aggregate, the Army's later-deploying divisions \n     were assigned 93 percent of their authorized personnel at the \n     beginning of fiscal year 1998. In one specific case, the 1st \n     Armored Division was staffed at 94 percent in the aggregate; \n     however, its combat support and service support specialties \n     were filled at below 85 percent, and captains and majors were \n     filled at 73 percent.\n       (21) At the 10th Infantry Division, only 138 of 162 \n     infantry squads were fully or minimally filled, and 36 of the \n     filled squads were unqualified. At the 1st Brigade of the 1st \n     Infantry Division, only 56 percent of the authorized infantry \n     soldiers for its Bradley Fighting Vehicles were assigned, and \n     in the 2nd Brigade, 21 of 48 infantry squads had no personnel \n     assigned. At the 3rd Brigade of the 1st Armored Division, \n     only 16 of 116 M1A1 tanks had full crews and were qualified, \n     and in one of the Brigade's two armor battalions, 14 of 58 \n     tanks had no crewmembers assigned because the personnel were \n     deployed to Bosnia.\n       (23) At the beginning of fiscal year 1998, the five later-\n     deploying divisions critical to the execution of the U.S. \n     National Security Strategy were short nearly 1,900 of the \n     total 25,357 Non-Commissioned Officers authorized, and as of \n     February 15, 1998, this shortage had grown to almost 2,200.\n       (24) Rotation of units to Bosnia is having a direct and \n     negative impact on the ability of later-deploying divisions \n     to maintain the training and readiness levels needed to \n     execute their mission in a major regional conflict. \n     Indications of this include:\n       (A) The reassignment by the Commander of the 3rd Brigade \n     Combat Team of 63 soldiers within the brigade to serve in \n     infantry\n\n[[Page S9465]]\n\n     squads of a deploying unit of 800 troops, stripping non-\n     deploying infantry and armor units of maintenance personel, \n     and reassigning Non-Commissioned Officers and support \n     personnel to the task force from throughout the brigade;\n       (B) Cancellation of gunnery exercises for at least two \n     armor battalions in later-deploying divisions, causing 43 of \n     116 tank crews to lose their qualifications on the weapon \n     system;\n       (C) Hiring of outside contract personnel by 1st Armored and \n     1st Infantry later-deploying divisions to perform routine \n     maintenance.\n       (25) National Guard budget shortfalls compromise the \n     Guard's readiness levels, capabilities, force structure, and \n     end strength, putting the Guard's personel, schools, \n     training, full-time support, retention and recruitment, and \n     morale at risk.\n       (26) The President's budget requests for the National Guard \n     have been insufficient, notwithstanding the frequent calls on \n     the Guard to handle wide-ranging tasks, including deployments \n     in Bosnia, Iraq, Haiti, and Somalia.\n       (b) Sense of Congress:\n       (1) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (A) The readiness of U.S. military forces to execute the \n     National Security Strategy of the United States is being \n     eroded from a combination of declining defense budgets and \n     expanded missions;\n       (B) The ongoing, open-ended commitment of U.S. forces to \n     the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia is causing assigned and \n     supporting units to compromise their principle wartime \n     assignments;\n       (C) Defense appropriations are not keeping pace with the \n     expanding needs of the armed forces.\n       (c) Report Requirement.\n       (1) Not later than June 1, 1999, the President shall submit \n     to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the \n     Committee on National Security of the House of \n     Representatives, and to the Committees on Appropriations in \n     both Houses, a report on the military readiness of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States. The President shall include in \n     the report a detailed discussion of the competition for \n     resources service-by-service caused by the ongoing commitment \n     to the peacekeeping operation in Bosnia, including in those \n     units that are supporting but not directly deployed to \n     Bosnia.

(a) The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) United States Armed Forces in the Republic of Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina have accomplished the military mission \n     assigned to them as a component of the Implementation and \n     Stabilization Forces.\n       (2) The continuing and open-ended commitment of U.S. ground \n     forces in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is subject \n     to the oversight authority of the Congress.\n       (3) Congress may limit the use of appropriated funds to \n     create the conditions for an orderly and honorable withdrawal \n     of U.S. troops from the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       (4) On November 27, 1995, the President affirmed that \n     United States participation in the multinational military \n     Implementation Force in the Republic of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina would terminate in about one year.\n       (5) The President declared the expiration date of the \n     mandate for the Implementation Force to be December 20, 1996.\n       (6) The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff expressed confidence that the Implementation \n     Force would complete its mission in about one year.\n       (7) the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff expressed the critical importance of \n     establishing a firm deadline, in the absence of which there \n     is a potential for expansion of the mission of U.S. forces.\n       (8) On October 3, 1996, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff announced the intention of the United States \n     Administration to delay the removal of United States Armed \n     Forces personnel from the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina \n     until March 1997.\n       (9) In November 1996 the President announced his intention \n     to further extend the deployment of United States Armed \n     Forces in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina until June \n     1998.\n       (10) The President did not request authorization by the \n     Congress of a policy that would result in the further \n     deployment of United States Armed Forces in the Republic of \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina until June 1998.\n       (11) Notwithstanding the passage of two previously \n     established deadlines, the reaffirmation of those deadlines \n     by senior national security officials, and the endorsement by \n     those same national security officials of the importance of \n     having a deadline as a hedge against an expanded mission, the \n     President announced on December 17, 1997 that establishing \n     a deadline had been a mistake and that U.S. ground combat \n     forces were committed to the NATO-led mission in Bosnia \n     for the indefinite future.\n       (12) NATO military forces have increased their \n     participation in law enforcement, particularly police \n     activities.\n       (13) U.S. Commanders of NATO have stated on several \n     occasions that, in accordance with the Dayton Peace Accords, \n     the principal responsibility for such law enforcement and \n     police activities lies with the Bosnian parties themselves.\n\n     SEC. 2.

This subtitle may be cited as the ``Forced \n     Abortion Condemnation Act''.\n       Sec. 9002. Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Forced abortion was rightly denounced as a crime \n     against humanity by the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal.\n       (2) For over 15 years there have been frequent and credible \n     reports of forced abortion and forced sterilization in \n     connection with the population control policies of the \n     People's Republic of China. These reports indicate the \n     following:\n       (A) Although it is the stated position of the politburo of \n     the Chinese Communist Party that forced abortion and forced \n     sterilization have no role in the population control program, \n     in fact the Communist Chinese Government encourages both \n     forced abortion and forced sterilization through a \n     combination of strictly enforced birth quotas and immunity \n     for local population control officials who engage in \n     coercion. Officials acknowledge that there have been \n     instances of forced abortions and sterilization, and no \n     evidence has been made available to suggest that the \n     perpetrators have been punished.\n       (B) People's Republic of China population control \n     officials, in cooperation with employers and works unit \n     officials, routinely monitor women's menstrual cycles and \n     subject women who conceive without government authorization \n     to extreme psychological pressure, to harsh economic \n     sanctions, including unpayable fines and loss of employment, \n     and often to physical force.\n       (C) Official sanctions for giving birth to unauthorized \n     children include fines in amounts several times larger than \n     the per capita annual incomes of residents of the People's \n     Republic of China. In Fujian, for example, the average fine \n     is estimated to be\n\n[[Page S9468]]\n\n     twice a family's gross annual income. Families which cannot \n     pay the fine may be subject to confiscation and destruction \n     of their homes and personal property.\n       (D) Especially harsh punishments have been inflicted on \n     those whose resistance is motivated by religion. For example, \n     according to a 1995 Amnesty International report, the \n     Catholic inhabitants of 2 villages in Hebei Province were \n     subjected to population control under the slogan ``better to \n     have more graves than one more child''. Enforcement measures \n     included torture, sexual abuse, and the detention of \n     resisters' relatives as hostages.\n       (E) Forced abortions in Communist China often have taken \n     place in the very late stages of pregnancy.\n       (F) Since 1994 forced abortion and sterilization have been \n     used in Communist China not only to regulate the number of \n     children, but also to eliminate those who are regarded as \n     defective in accordance with the official eugenic policy \n     known as the ``Natal and Health Care Law''.\n       Sec. 9003. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     the Secretary of State may not utilize any funds appropriated \n     or otherwise available for the Department of State for fiscal \n     year 1999 to issue any visa to any official of any country \n     (except the head of state, the head of government, and \n     cabinet level ministers) who the Secretary finds, based on \n     credible and specific information, has been directly involved \n     in the establishment or enforcement of population control \n     policies forcing a woman to undergo an abortion against her \n     free choice, or forcing a man or woman to undergo \n     sterilization against his or her free choice or policies \n     condoning the practice of genital mutilation.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Attorney General may not utilize any funds appropriated or \n     otherwise available for the Department of Justice for fiscal \n     year 1999 to admit to the United States any national covered \n     by subsection (a).\n       (c) The President may waive the prohibition in subsection \n     (a) or (b) if the President--\n       (1) determines that it is in the national interest of the \n     United States to do so; and\n       (2) provides written notification to Congress containing a \n     justification for the waiver.\n\n                Subtitle B--Freedom on Religion in China\n\n       Sec. 9011. (a) It is the sense of Congress that the \n     President should make freedom of religion one of the major \n     objectives of United States foreign policy with respect to \n     China.\n       (b) As part of this policy, the Department of State should \n     raise in every relevant bilateral and multilateral forum the \n     issue of individuals imprisoned, detained, confined, or \n     otherwise harassed by the Chinese Government on religious \n     grounds.\n       (c) In its communications with the Chinese Government, the \n     Department of State should provide specific names of \n     individuals of concern and request a complete and timely \n     response from the Chinese Government regarding the \n     individuals' whereabouts and condition, the charges against \n     them, and sentence imposed.\n       (d) The goal of these official communications should be the \n     expeditious release of all religious prisoners in China and \n     Tibet and the end of the Chinese Government's policy and \n     practice of harassing and repressing religious believers.\n       Sec. 9012. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     the Secretary of State may not utilize any funds appropriated \n     or otherwise available for the Department of State for fiscal \n     year 1999 to issue a visa to any official or any country \n     (except the head of state, the head of government, and \n     cabinet level ministers) who the Secretary of State finds, \n     based on credible and specific information, has been directly \n     involved in the establishment or enforcement of policies or \n     practices designed to restrict religious freedom.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Attorney General may not utilize any funds appropriated or \n     otherwise available for the Department of Justice for fiscal \n     year 1999 to admit to the United States any national covered \n     by subsection (a).\n       (c) The President may waive the prohibition in subsection \n     (a) or (b) with respect to an individual described in such \n     subsection if the President--\n       (1) determines that it is vital to the national interest to \n     do so; and\n       (2) provides written notification to the appropriate \n     congressional committees containing a justification for the \n     waiver.\n       Sec. 9014.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING PAYROLL TAX RELIEF.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The payroll tax under the Federal Insurance \n     Contributions Act (FICA) is the biggest, most regressive tax \n     paid by working families.\n       (2) The payroll tax constitutes a 15.3 percent tax burden \n     on the wages and self-employment income of each American, \n     with 12.4 percent of the payroll tax used to pay social \n     security benefits to current beneficiaries and 2.9 percent \n     used to pay the medicare benefits of current beneficiaries.\n       (3) The amount of wages and self-employment income subject \n     to the social security portion of the payroll tax is capped \n     at $68,400. Therefore, the lower a family's income, the more \n     they pay in payroll tax as a percentage of income. The \n     Congressional Budget Office has estimated that for those \n     families who pay payroll taxes, 80 percent pay more in \n     payroll taxes than in income taxes.\n       (4) In 1996, the median household income was $35,492, and a \n     family earning that amount and taking standard deductions and \n     exemptions paid $2,719 in Federal income tax, but lost $5,430 \n     in income to the payroll tax.\n       (5) Ownership of wealth is essential for everyone to have a \n     shot at the American dream, but the payroll tax is the \n     principal burden to savings and wealth creation for working \n     families.\n       (6) Since 1983, the payroll tax has been higher than \n     necessary to pay current benefits.\n       (7) Since most of the payroll tax receipts are deposited in \n     the social security trust funds, which masks the real amount \n     of Government borrowing, those whom the payroll tax hits \n     hardest, working families, have shouldered a disproportionate \n     share of the Federal budget deficit reduction and, therefore, \n     a disproportionate share of the creation of the Federal \n     budget surplus.\n       (8) Over the next 10 years, the Federal Government will \n     generate a budget surplus of $1,550,000,000,000, and all but \n     $32,000,000,000 of that surplus will be generated by excess \n     payroll taxes.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) if Congress decides to provide tax relief, reducing the \n     burden of payroll taxes should be a top priority; and\n       (2) Congress and the President should work to reduce this \n     payroll tax burden on American families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9455-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9475-S9476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CURT FLOOD ACT OF 1998\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        HATCH AMENDMENT NO. 3479\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS (for Mr. Hatch) proposed an amendment to the bill (S. \n53) to require the general application of the antitrust laws to major \nleague baseball, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert in lieu \n     thereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I submit an article to be printed \nin the Record. I thought it would be beneficial for my colleagues to \nlearn about the success that the AmeriCorps program has had among my \nconstituents in Illinois. These are only a few stories about the \npositive impact that this program has had on people who live in often \nunder served communities in the Chicago area.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Chicago Sun-Times, July 3, 1998]\n\n                       Harnessing American Ideals\n\n                          [By Michael Gillis]\n\n       In Uptown, they teach Asian immigrants English and help \n     them adjust to life in the United States.\n       In Ford Heights, they help low-income parents become better \n     teachers of their own children.\n       In neighborhoods throughout the Chicago area, they teach \n     adults how to read, tutor students after school, counsel \n     battered women, teach first aid and help communities right \n     themselves.\n       Four years after President Clinton's Americorps project was \n     launched amid a flurry of publicity, its workers are toiling \n     away in relative obscurity. While some still criticize the \n     program for its cost, supporters say it is changing the city \n     in small, but important, ways.\n       ``We never say we're going to change a community in a \n     year,'' said Craig Huffman, executive director of City Year \n     Chicago, which employed about 50 Americorps workers last year \n     and this week received funding to hire about 55 workers \n     starting in the fall.\n       ``But far too many people use the excuse that problems are \n     insurmountable. . . . You have to think about solving a \n     problem, even when everyone else is saying it can't be \n     solved.''\n       Americorps workers say they're more than worth the money \n     they're paid.\n       ``I realized the impact that one person can have in a lot \n     of lives,'' said Lisa Novak, 23, of Flossmoor, who taught CPR \n     and first aid to thousands of Chicago public school students \n     in the last year as one of the 13 Americorps workers for the \n     American Red Cross of Greater Chicago.\n       That's the kind of idealism Clinton sought to harness when \n     he proposed the Americorps program during his 1992 \n     presidential campaign. Lawmakers passed Clinton's pet project \n     in 1993, and Clinton signed the bill using the pens Franklin \n     D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy used to create the Civilian \n     Conservation Corps and the Peace Corps.\n       Under the program, which is run by a public-private \n     partnership called the Corporation for Public Service, \n     students earn $4,725 to apply toward college tuition or \n     student loans by completing a year of community\n\n[[Page S9481]]\n\n     service work. They also earn living allowances of about \n     $7,400 a year and health care and child day care benefits.\n       About 90,000 people have served in the program since it \n     started in 1993. More than $1.7 billion has been spent on or \n     committed to the program so far, including $400 million set \n     aside for education awards.\n       This year, Illinois has about 500 Americorps workers. About \n     450 are expected next year.\n       According to the Corporation for National Service, \n     Americorps workers last year tutored more than 500,000 youth, \n     mentored 95,000 more, created 3,100 safety patrols, built or \n     rehabilitated 5,600 homes, placed 32,000 homeless people in \n     permanent housing and recruited more than 300,000 volunteers.\n       Many Republicans, including House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-\n     Ga.), oppose the national service program. Gingrich told \n     Newsweek magazine in 1995 that he was ``totally, \n     unequivocally opposed to national service. . . . It is \n     coerced volunteerism. It's a gimmick.''\n       Critics also question whether the program is worth the \n     expense, but officials at the corporation say they try to \n     fund programs that get the most bang for the buck. The \n     program uses strict standards to ensure funded programs \n     produce results that can be measured--say, the number of \n     children tutored or the number of homes rehabilitated.\n       And they argue that the program represents a way for \n     Washington to help communities help themselves--an argument \n     tailor-made for Republicans who advocate decentralizing \n     government.\n       ``Right now there is a consensus in Washington that \n     Washington cannot solve every problem and that we have to \n     look at ways to strengthen local communities so they can take \n     on the needs that are specific to their communities,'' said \n     Tara Murphy, the director of public affairs for the \n     corporation. ``That's exactly what this program does.'' Two-\n     thirds of the funds go straight to state commissions, made up \n     of members appointed by the governors, she said. Those \n     commissions decide which agencies get the money, and the \n     agencies recruit and deploy the workers, she said.\n       Agencies that were awarded grants this week to hire \n     Americorps workers don't question whether the program is \n     worth the expense.\n       ``It's definitely worth it,'' said Pat Clay, the director \n     of the program at the Aunt Martha's Youth Services Center of \n     Park Forest, where 10 Americorps workers teach low-income \n     parents how to instruct their preschool children.\n       ``To see the smile on a child's face, to hear a parent say, \n     `My child tested very well in a preschool screening test'--\n     that makes it worthwhile. You are investing in a child's \n     future for life.\n       Aunt Martha's hires its Americorps workers from the \n     communities the program serves--in this case, Ford Heights \n     and Chicago Heights.\n       The Uptown-based Asian Human Services agency, which will \n     hire about 14 workers to aid Asian refugees and immigrants \n     this year, does the same.\n       Ralph Hardy, the director of programs at Asian Human \n     Services, said he believes the program is inspiring \n     Americorps workers to a career in public service.\n       ``The outcome of the program will be best seen down the \n     road, say 10 or 15 years from now, after a whole generation \n     has gone through it,'' he said, ``We've seen it here--we have \n     workers who will go into some sort of community-based \n     career.''\n       That's what Trina Poole, 25, plans to do. Poole, one of six \n     Americorps workers at Family Rescue, a community service \n     agency in South Shore for victims of domestic violence, \n     answers the agency's crisis line and helps arrange services \n     for callers.\n       A victim of domestic violence herself, Poole said she hopes \n     to be hired for a permanent position to continue providing to \n     women and children the services she never received.\n       ``It's a healing process for me to help as many women as \n     possible,'' she said. ``I'm not doing this for the money. I'm \n     doing it to help the community.''\n       Becky Nieves, 21, of Hanover Park, an Americorps worker for \n     City Year who helped run an after-school program on gardening \n     and environment, said she learned how much she meant to her \n     students at the end of the year.\n       ``When it's over and you say your goodbyes, and the kids \n     tell you what they learned, that's when you know you've made \n     a difference,'' she said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9480-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CBO COST ESTIMATE ON S. 1283\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs reported S. 1283, the ``Little Rock Nine \nCongressional Gold Medal Act'' on Friday, June 26, 1998. The Committee \nreport, S. 105-245, was filed on Friday, July 10, 1998.\n  The Congressional Budget Office cost estimate required by Senate Rule \nXXVI, section 11(b) of the Standing Rules of the Senate and section 403 \nof the Congressional Budget Impoundment and Control Act, was not \navailable at the time of filing and, therefore, was not included in the \nCommittee Report. Instead, the Committee indicated the Congressional \nBudget Office cost estimate would be published in the Congressional \nRecord when it became available.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the full statement and cover letter from \nthe Congressional Budget Office regarding S. 1283 be printed in the \nRecord. \n  The material follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 1998.\n     Hon. Alfonse M. D'Amato,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 1283, an act to \n     award congressional gold medals to the ``Little Rock Nine'' \n     on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the integration of \n     the Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is John R. \n     Righter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        June E. O'Neill, Director.\n       Enclosure.\n\n               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate\n\n     S. 1283--An act to award congressional gold medals to the \n         ``Little Rock Nine'' on the occasion of the 40th \n         anniversary of the integration of the Central High School \n         in Little Rock, Arkansas\n       S. 1283 would authorize the President to present gold \n     medals to Jean Brown Trickey, Carlotta Walls LaNier, Melba \n     Patillo Beals, Terrence Roberts, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Thelma \n     Mothershed Wair, Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, and \n     Jefferson Thomas, referred to as the ``Little Rock Nine,'' on \n     behalf of the Congress. To help recover the costs of the gold \n     medals, the legislation would authorize the U.S. Mint to \n     strike and sell bronze duplicates of the medals at a price \n     that covers production costs for both the medals and the \n     duplicates.\n       Based on the costs of recent medals produced by the Mint, \n     CBO estimates that authorizing the gold medals would increase \n     direct spending from the U.S. Mint Public Enterprise Fund by \n     about $65,000 in fiscal year 1999, largely to cover the cost \n     of the gold for each medal. The Mint could recoup some of \n     those costs by selling bronze duplicates to the public; \n     however, based on the sales of duplicates in previous cases, \n     we expect that the proceeds from the duplicates would not \n     cover the cost of the medals.\n       In addition to authorizing the gold medals, the legislation \n     would allow the Mint to continue selling coins commemorating \n     Jackie Robinson through the end of this calendar year. CBO \n     estimates that extending the time by which the Mint can sell \n     these coins would increase collections to the Mint by about \n     $1 million over fiscal years 1998 and 1999. (The Mint's \n     authority to sell the coins expired on July 1.) According to \n     the Mint, it has close to 80,000 coins in its inventory. If \n     the Mint were to sell all of its remaining inventory, it \n     would generate between $3 million and $5 million in \n     additional collections, net of surcharges that must be paid \n     to the Jackie Robinson Foundation, a nonprofit organization. \n     That range depends on whether the Mint would sell some or all \n     of the coins in bulk at a discounted price. Based on the \n     sales of previous commemorative coin programs and because the \n     coins were available already for purchase by the public, CBO \n     expects that the Mint would sell far less than the amount of \n     its remaining inventory. In any event, because the Mint can \n     retain and spend the additional collections on other \n     commercial activities, CBO estimates that the provision would \n     have no net budgetary impact over time.\n       S. 1283 would affect direct spending, so pay-as-you-go \n     procedures would apply. S. 1283 contains no intergovernmental \n     or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded \n     Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of \n     state, local, or tribal governments.\n       The CBO staff contact is John R. Righter. This estimate was \n     approved by Paul N. Van de Water, Assistant Director for \n     Budget Analysis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9481-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9481-S9482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CHEYENNE RIVER SIOUX TRIBE EQUITABLE COMPENSATION ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

I am committed to seeing that \nthe bill receive strong Senate support, and look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to ensure that the bill moves forward for approval \nby the full Senate.\n\n[[Page S9482]]\n\n  The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act would \nestablish a trust fund within the Department of the Treasury for the \ndevelopment of certain tribal infrastructure projects for the Cheyenne \nRiver Tribe as compensation for lands lost to federal public works \nprojects. The trust fund would be capitalized from a small percentage \nof hydropower revenues and would be capped at $290 million. Independent \nresearch has concluded that the economic loss to the tribe justifies \nsuch a compensation fund. The tribe would then receive the interest \nfrom the fund to be used according to a development plan based on \nlegislation previously passed by Congress, and prepared in conjunction \nwith the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service.\n  This type of funding mechanism has seen unanimous support in the \nCongress though recent passage of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe \nInfrastructure Development Trust Fund Act as well as the Crow Creek \nlegislation passed last Congress. Precedent for these infrastructure \ndevelopment trust funds capitalized through hydro-power revenue was \nestablished with the Three Affiliated Tribes and Standing Rock Sioux \nTribe Equitable Compensation Act of 1992, which set up a recovery fund \nfinanced entirely from a percentage of Pick-Sloan power revenues to \ncompensate the tribes for lands lost to Pick-Sloan.\n  I believe it is important for the Senate to understand the historic \ncontext of this proposed compensation. As you may know, the Flood \nControl Act of 1944 created five massive earthen dams along the \nMissouri River. Known as the Pick-Sloan Plan, this public works project \nhas since provided much-needed flood control, irrigation, and \nhydropower for communities along the Missouri. Four of the Pick-Sloan \ndams are located in South Dakota and the benefits of the project have \nproven indispensable to the people of my State.\n  Unfortunately, construction of the Big Bend and Fort Randall dams was \nseverely detrimental to economic and agricultural development for \nseveral of South Dakota's tribes, including Cheyenne River. Over \n100,000 acres of the tribe's most fertile and productive land, the \nbasis for the tribal economy, were inundated, forcing the relocation of \nroughly 30 percent of the tribe's population, including four entire \ncommunities.\n  The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act of 1998 \nwill enable the Cheyenne River Tribe to address and improve their \ninfrastructure and will provide the needed resources for further \neconomic development within the Cheyenne River reservation community. \nHowever, the damage caused by the Pick-Sloan projects touched every \naspect of life in South Dakota, on and off reservation. The economic \ndevelopment goal targeted in this approach is a pressing issue for \nsurrounding communities off reservation as well, because every effort \ntoward healthy local economies in rural South Dakota resonates \nthroughout the State.\n  Language included in this bill would prohibit any increase in power \nrates in connection with the trust fund. This legislation has broad \nsupport in South Dakota. South Dakota Governor Bill Janklow has \nendorsed this type of funding mechanism for the compensation of South \nDakota tribes, and fully supports S. 1905.\n  Mr. President, the tribes in my State experience some of the most \nextreme poverty and unemployment in this country. Under the current \nChairman, Gregg Bourland, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe has been a \nleader in economic development initiatives within the reservation \ncommunity and I believe this bill will reinforce and further the \neconomic development successes of the tribe. I look forward to \neducating my colleagues about the importance of this bill to the \nCheyenne River Sioux Tribe and I encourage swift Senate action on this \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9481-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9482-S9483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE'S LEASE PROCUREMENT\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to set the record \nstraight about the Patent and Trademark Office's lease procurement for \na new or remodeled facility. There is a continuing misinformation \ncampaign being waged to delay the Patent and Trademark Office's lease \nprocurement or put it back to square one.\n  Allegations are being made that, to the taxpayer's detriment, the new \nfacility is vastly overpriced and that a new federal construction \noption has not been considered.\n  The fact is that the procurement has been conducted by the book and \nhas undergone several, impartial reviews, all of which conclude that \nthe project is on the right track, competitively sound and should \ncontinue.\n  Mr. President, we all know that funding is not available to support \nthe federal construction of a new headquarters for PTO because of the \nlimitations of the Balanced Budget Act. We also know that the new \nlease, authorized by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee \nin Fall of 1995, will result in cost savings of $72 million over the \nlife of the lease. That cost savings will accrue in spite of moving \ncosts, an upgraded work environment, new furniture and other \nimprovements designed to enable the PTO to more effectively do its job.\n  The PTO is fully fee funded and does not receive any taxpayer \nsupport. All lease and moving costs will be borne by PTO's customers in \nthe normal course of business.\n  The Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure intends to have \na hearing on this matter in September. In the meantime, I am submitting \na number of points regarding the procurement, in addition to a letter \nsent to me by Bruce A. Lehman, Assistant Secretary of Commerce and \nCommissioner of Patents and Trademarks.\n  I urge you to take time to hear the real story of the PTO project. \nThe clear facts are that failure to take action to consolidate PTO \nspace will result in wasteful use of funds and prevents PTO from \nmodernizing services for its customers.\n  The material follows:\n\n\n        the facts on the patent and trademark office procurement\n\n       No taxpayer funds are being spent on the project. PTO is \n     fully user fee funded.\n       PTO's largest user groups support the project. The American \n     Intellectual Property Law Association, the Intellectual \n     Property Owner's Association and the Intellectual Property \n     Section of the ABA have all expressed strong support in \n     numerous Congressional letters for continuation of the \n     ongoing procurement.\n       Federal construction is not a viable option. The \n     Administration and PTO's Appropriations Committees agree that \n     a competitive lease is the only viable option since neither \n     user fees nor taxpayer funding are available to construct or \n     purchase a facility for PTO.\n       Consolidated project will save the PTO at least $72 \n     million. Whether the project proceeds or the PTO remains at \n     its current leased, unconsolidated locations, the PTO will \n     spend approximately $1.3 billion in lease costs over the next \n     20 years to house the agency. Delaying consolidation will \n     prevent PTO from passing this $72 million in savings on to \n     its fee-paying customers.\n       Senate Bill already caps build-out costs. The Senate \n     Appropriations Bill (S. 2260), as passed, would cap interior \n     office build-out at $36.69 per square foot, the Government-\n     wide standard rate. Moreover, these costs are included in the \n     new rent amount.\n       PTO's projected moving costs are reasonable. All moving \n     costs were taken into account in computing the $72 million in \n     savings. PTO's projected costs are comparable to those spent \n     by other recently consolidated agencies.\n       PTO will not purchase $250 shower curtains, etc. Estimates \n     for $250 shower curtains for the fitness facility, $750 cribs \n     for the child care center, $309 ash cans for smoking rooms, \n     and $1,000 coat racks for training facilities were \n     intentionally ``worst case'' estimates used for the purpose \n     of calculating the cost savings that would result from \n     consolidation. Standardization, mass buys and competitive \n     furniture purchases will generate lower actual costs. PTO has \n     not yet made any requested appropriations of user fees for \n     furniture purchases. Proceeding with the procurement and \n     applying a sharp pencil to PTO's future appropriations \n     requests for furniture can only enhance the $72 million in \n     savings.\n       Any environmental costs will be totally funded by the \n     developer. All three sites competing for PTO's lease already \n     house Federal employees. The Government just constructed a \n     federal courthouse on the Carlyle site, the Defense \n     Department has occupied the Eisenhower site for over 20 \n     years, and the PTO has occupied the Crystal City site for \n     over 25 years. There is no evidence that developers cannot \n     accomplish any environmental work that may be required to \n     further develop these sites.\n       DOC's IG concluded that the project should proceed. The \n     IG's key conclusion was that PTO will benefit from the \n     project and will realize long-term cost savings. Both the IG \n     and an independent consultant to the DOC Secretary (Jefferson \n     Solutions) found that\n\n[[Page S9483]]\n\n     enhanced building capability, which is the goal of planned \n     interior upgrades, is not unreasonable in terms of cost and \n     purpose. And S. 2260, as passed, would place the ceiling on \n     build-out that the IG recommends.\n       Two of the PTO's three unions fully support the project. \n     National Treasury Employees Union locals 243 (representing \n     clerical and administrative staff) and 245 (representing \n     trademark examining attorneys) have already signed a \n     partnership agreement supporting PTO's plans for the project. \n     The PTO is continuing talks with the third union.\n                                      U.S. Department of Commerce,\n\n\n                                  Patent and Trademark Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 29, 1998.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: In light of recent reports on the U.S. \n     Patent and Trademark Office's (PTO) on-going procurement \n     process to competitively acquire new, consolidated space for \n     the PTO, I want to assure you that this procurement is based \n     on sound principles.\n       These reports are focused on estimates of furniture costs \n     mentioned in our Deva and Associates business case study. \n     This study was undertaken to compare our present, \n     unconsolidated space with a worst-case scenario of moving to \n     a new, consolidated facility under the GSA prospectus.\n       Many of the dollar amounts cited in the Deva report are \n     being touted as what the PTO is spending for furniture at a \n     new facility. Nothing is farther from the truth. I personally \n     assure you, we have never contemplated nor will we spend $250 \n     for a shower curtain, $750 for a crib, or $1,000 for a coat \n     rack. I agree that some of these furniture estimates are too \n     high even for a worst-case scenario. However, it must be kept \n     in mind that even with these extremely high estimates, this \n     procurement project still shows savings of at least $72 \n     million. No one is disputing this fact.\n       I look forward to working with you and our appropriators to \n     ensure that any expenditures for furniture are prudent and \n     responsible. Delaying or stopping this procurement will only \n     increase space costs for our fee-paying customers.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Bruce A.

Mr. President, for eight years Nobel Peace Prize \nwinner Aung San Suu Kyi has battled the military junta in an \nindomitable, peaceful way which deserves the admiration of us all. For \nfive of these years she was held under house arrest. This is no longer \nthe case, though events of the last week show that her freedom \ncontinues to be limited, as is the freedom of all Burmese citizens.\n  Last Friday, Aung San Suu Kyi began a journey to meet with members of \nher National League for Democracy in Nyaungdon township, outside of the \ncapital. She never made it. The thugs who run the military junta \nblocked her passage. She spent six days in her car surrounded by \nsoldiers who prevented her from crossing a bridge about 30 miles \noutside of the capital.\n  These actions were rightly criticized by many of the foreign \nministers attending the annual meeting of the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN), including our own Secretary of State, Madeleine \nAlbright. As Keith B. Richburg reported in the Washington Post \nyesterday, ``the foreign ministers of six nations and the European \nUnion confronted a top Burmese official today with a blunt message: No \nharm must come to the Nobel Peace Prize winner.'' I think it is clear \nthat we in the Senate share this sentiment. We hold the leaders of the \nmilitary junta in Burma responsible for the safety of Aung San Suu Kyi. \nPeriod.\n  She has demonstrated uncommon restraint and valor in her often tense \nencounters with the junta. This last week has been no exception. She \nsat in her car for days, yet when she spoke, she did so firmly and \nwithout rancor. She called for dialogue between the NLD and the junta \nand consistently speaks of upholding the rule of law. She has recently \ncalled for the true parliament of Burma--the one elected in 1990--to be \nconvened by August 21. Perhaps this will be an opportunity for the \njunta to step aside.\n  The junta has failed miserably. Burma is a country rich in resources \nwhich has been run into the ground by an irresponsible junta. Its \nelected leaders have been censored, jailed, and worse. The junta has no \nlegitimacy and should step aside and let the rightful and elected \ngovernment of Burma take control. The people of Burma made clear their \npreference. Eight years is long enough to wait.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9483-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9483-S9484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           I-90 LAND EXCHANGE\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on July 23, the Subcommittee on \nForests and Public Land Management held a hearing on legislation I have \nintroduced to complete an important land exchange in my state. The \nbill, S. 2136, would authorize and direct the Forest Service to \nconclude an exchange with Plum Creek Timber Company which has been \nunder formal discussion for several years.\n  The exchange is in an area of Washington surrounding the Interstate \n90 corridor through the central Cascades. This area is characterized by \na ``checkerboard'' ownership pattern of intermingled ownership between \nPlum Creek and the Forest Service. These lands are among the most \nstudied not only in my state but the Nation.\n  The problems of checkerboard ownership are well recognized and \nunderstood in the west and northwest. This exchange, trading 60,000 of \nPlum Creek land for 40,000 acres of Forest Service land, would help \nresolve many management issues for both owners. It would make \nmanagement more efficient, especially on an ecosystem basis.\n  I introduced my bill to provide impetus to complete this exchange by \nyear's end because of the need for a speedy resolution. If the exchange \nis not completed by the end of this year, Plum Creek will have no \nchoice but to resume logging their land in 1999. The company has \ndeferred harvests on 90 percent of the exchange lands for the past 2 \nyears and they have firmly stated they cannot continue to do so.\n  There is broad public support for the exchange and for completing it \nin a timely fashion. Our governor, Gary Locke, and the Lands \nCommissioner, Jennifer Belcher, have endorsed the exchange--urging it's \ncompletion by the end of 1998. The State Legislature unanimously \napproved a resolution in support of the I-90 exchange. Major newspapers \nin Seattle and other cities have recognized the need to finish this \nexchange. Many environmental groups support a land exchange.\n  Mr. President, our subcommittee hearing pointed out the difficult \nproblems we face in Washington when we try to resolve issues. There \nalways seems to be a controversy, no matter how worthy the purpose. My \nlegislation and the I-90 exchange are no different.\n  Representatives from the environmental community, Plum Creek and the \nForest Service testified on July 23. While mainstream environmental \ngroups heartily support an exchange, they would prefer to see changes \nin the lands package identified in a draft Environmental Impact \nStatement released earlier this spring. Environmental groups are \nconcerned about legislation circumventing appeals and litigation.\n  The Forest Service wants to complete the exchange, but opposes \nlegislation. I am disappointed that the Administration, having worked \non this proposal for so long, would oppose a bill designed to enact a \nland exchange it has negotiated. Each party has spent over $1 million \ngetting to this point. Must we spend more, only to run the risk of \nseeing the entire exchange fall apart as a result of the heavy weight \nof appeals and litigation?\n  The I-90 exchange has been proposed in various shapes and sizes for \nmore than a decade. Since it was first considered, the Northern Spotted \nOwl has been listed under the Endangered Species Act and the President \nhas put his Northwest Forest Plan in effect. Plum Creek has even \ncompleted a massive Habitat Conservation Plan on 170,000 acres of its \nlands--including those in this exchange. This Plan, now two years old, \nwas negotiated with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. With this \nbackground and the resulting studies, I am confident we can complete an \nexchange on these lands that represents a consensus.\n  Mr. President, I recognize and support the idea of getting it right. \nWe have been at this exchange too long not to do just that. When I \nintroduced S. 2136, I indicated it was simply a place holder. The final \nEnvironmental Impact Statement will be completed later this summer. It \nhas been my intention to amend the legislation to incorporate necessary \nchanges based on the final EIS.\n  After hearing the testimony of all parties, I have urged them to work \ntogether to identify a lands package that\n\n[[Page S9484]]\n\ncan be incorporated in the final EIS. Further I am asking the Forest \nService to move up the deadline for completing a final EIS to September \n10 and forwarding it to the Subcommittee on Forests and Public Lands \nManagement. Such a document--presented to Congress in a timely manner--\nwill leave all options open this year. I continue to believe \nlegislating this exchange is the right thing to do.\n  Mr. President, there are many who question why Congress should \nlegislate this or any land exchange. This is common practice. Congress \nhas not shied away from passing land trades in the past and we should \nnot in this instance when a consensus may be eminent.\n  In an editorial on the exchange The Seattle Times stated, ``The \nperfect as enemy of the good is a common phrase these days, but it \nremains appropriate to this situation. A transfer of 100,000 acres with \na net gain of 20,000 to the public has a long-term ring to it that \nfuture generations may see as prescient. Those are powerful reasons to \nwalk toward this agreement with eyes open, but keep walking.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9483-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO THE PROCTOR FIRE DEPARTMENT/SUTHERLAND FALLS HOSE COMPANY ON \n                          THEIR 100TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS.

CLYDE RAYMOND BARROW\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, it is with great sadness \nthat I rise today to pay tribute to the passing of Clyde Raymond \nBarrow. He was a dear friend, a devoted family man, and a committed \ncommunity member. His life enriched the lives of countless people. I \nwould like to take a few moments to reflect on this special person.\n  Clyde Barrow was born on March 3, 1923 in Belize, British Honduras. \nHe passed just a few weeks ago at the age of 75 on July 9, 1998 in \nChicago. He is survived by his wife of 54 years, the Reverend Willie \nTaplin Barrow; his adopted children, Dr. Patricia Carey and John Kirby, \nJr.; his two sisters, Avis Barrow McKay and Peggy Barrow Foster; ninety \neight Godchildren; many nieces and nephews; as well as friends and \nrelatives too numerous to count. The Barrows are also the parents of \nKeith Errol Barrow, who preceded his father in death in 1983.\n  To Reverend Barrow, and Clyde's surviving family and friends, I wish \nthere was some way that I could lift this burden of loss from your \nshoulders. We must take comfort in the fact that Clyde lived his life \nwith tremendous courage, dignity, and kindness. Clyde Barrow's life is \nan example of righteousness for us all to follow.\n  Although Clyde Barrow is no longer with us, he has left scores of \nmemories and a legacy of kindness and compassion that will live on \nforever. He was the strong, silent partner of the little warrior, \nReverend Barrow, supporting her in her many civil rights battles and \nher stewardship of Operation Push.\n  A welder by trade, Clyde also labored countless hours to build and \nstrengthen his community by volunteering his considerable time and \ntalents. Clyde's involvement with organizations such as the Doctors \nHospital of Hyde Park and the Vernon Park Church of God's MAST (Men \nAchieving Success and Training) Homeless Ministry represent his well \nearned reputation as a good Samaritan. As one who cherished children, \nClyde Barrow went out of his way to know the name of each child in his \nchurch and neighborhood. Without a doubt, Clyde Barrow was the \nembodiment of the neighbor we all want living next door to us: a rock \nand a conscious within the community.\n  In times such as these, it is comforting to remember the words of our \nLord: ``Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes with the dawn.'' \nClyde Raymond Barrow was a fine man, dedicated to his family, his \ncommunity, and his God. The Barrows are in my thoughts and prayers \nduring this time of sorrow, and I trust that they are in the prayers of \nthe Senate as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9484-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9484-S9485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION IN IRAN\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, on December 10, 1948--nearly 50 \nyears ago--the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted and \nproclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and called on \nmember nations ``to cause it to be disseminated, displayed, read and \nexpounded . . . `` Since that time, the Universal Declaration has \nbecome the bedrock document for human rights standards and aspirations \nfor signatory governments.\n  One government, however, the government of Iran, is distinguished as \nan egregious violator of a central principle this document expounds--\nnamely, that of religious freedom. Article 18 of the Universal \nDeclaration explicitly states: ``Everyone has the right to freedom of \nthought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change \nhis religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with \nothers and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in \nteaching, practice, worship and observance.''\n  On Tuesday, July 21st, the Iranian government summarily executed an \nIranian Baha'i for the single alleged act of converting a Muslim to the \nBaha'i faith. The Baha'is are Iran's largest religious minority with \nabout 300,000 adherents and suffer continuous persecution for their \nfaith.\n  The executed, Mr. Ruhollah Rowhani, a medical equipment salesman with \nfour children, had been picked-up near the northern Iranian city of \nMashad by the Iranian authorities in September 1997. He was held in \nsolitary confinement during that extended period until final execution.\n  The facts are stark in their cruelty. His family was allowed to visit \nhim briefly the day before his execution but, amazingly and cynically, \nthey were not notified that his execution was set for the next day. \nThey finally discovered the death only after they were given one hour \nto arrange for his burial. With brutal disregard, the Iranian \ngovernment refused to divulge any information to this grieving family \nwho were forced to conclude from the rope marks that their beloved \nrelative had been executed by hanging.\n  It is safe to say that Mr. Rowhani was accorded no due process nor \nafforded a lawyer prior to his execution. He died alone at the end of a \nrope for the alleged sin of sharing his sincerely held faith. I will \nstate this very clearly--Mr. Rowhani was the victim of the most extreme \nform of religious persecution. Mr. Rowhani died for his faith and this \nis an outrage which must be denounced.\n  Mr. President, this barbarous act flies in the face of the Universal \nDeclaration to which Iran is party. Mr. Rowhani had a fundamental right \nto practice his religion. Iran denied him that right. Mr. Rowhani had a \nfundamental right to a public trial. Iran denied him that right. Mr. \nRowhani had a fundamental right to counsel. Iran denied him that right. \nMr. Rowhani had a fundamental right to NOT be hung at the end of a rope \nfor holding minority religious beliefs.\n  My deepest concern now rests with the fifteen other Baha'is now being \nheld by the government of Iran for essentially the same charges that \nresulted in Mr. Rowhani's execution. As I speak now, at least three \nBaha'i men in the city of Mashad presently sit on death row, facing \nimminent execution\n\n[[Page S9485]]\n\nbecause they dared to quietly celebrate their faith. I speak as much \nfor them today as I do in protest to the brutal killing of their \nfellow-believer.\n  This hour, I call on the Government of Iran to ensure the safety of \nthese individuals. Better yet, I call for the release of these \nindividuals whose only crime was the sincere expression of their faith, \nwhich happens to be a minority religion. Most importantly, I call upon \nthe government of Iran to provide freedom of religion to its people, \nincluding the famously peaceful yet brutalized Baha'is community.\n  I want to take this opportunity to commend the international \ncommunity for its swift response to Mr. Rowhani's execution and urge \nother governments and organizations to vigilantly monitor the fate of \nthe 15 jailed Baha'is, particularly the 3 jailed in Mashad presently \nfacing the death penalty.\n  Religious persecution demands a tireless counter response; it demands \na vigilant defense. If we hold the principle of religious freedom to be \na precious and fundamental right, something worth protecting, then we \nmust always defend those who are wrongfully and brutally crushed for \ntheir faith by hostile national governments.\n  We cannot bring Mr. Rowhani back or right the wrong that was done to \nhim and his family, but we can advocate against this happening again. \nIran must abide by global human rights principles. Accordingly, Iran \nmust release the fifteen Bahai who have been incarcerated for their \nfaith. Iran must preserve the lives of those facing execution for their \nfaith. Iran must honor its commitment to the religious freedom \nprinciples of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and set these \nprisoners free.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9484-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9485-S9487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            NURSING SCHOOL ADMINISTERED PRIMARY CARE CLINICS\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an health \nissue of great importance now and in future years. As our population \ncontinues to increase, our elderly live longer, and healthcare \ntechnology advances, the need for access to care will undoubtedly also \nincrease.\n  Because of these monumental increases in the need for healthcare \naccess for many Americans, I wish to take a few minutes to discuss the \nneed for support of nursing school administered primary care centers.\n  Nursing centers are university or nonprofit entity primary care \ncenters developed (primarily) in collaboration with university schools \nof nursing and the communities they serve. These centers are staffed by \nfaculty and staff who are public health nurses and nurse practitioners. \nStudents supplement patient care while receiving preceptorships \nprovided by colleges of nursing faculty and primary care physicians, \noften associated with academic institutions, who serve as collaborators \nwith nurse practitioners.\n  Nurse practitioners, and public health nurses, in particular, are \neducated through programs which offer advanced academic and clinical \nexperiences, with a strong emphasis on primary and preventive health \ncare. In fact, schools of nursing that have established these primary \nhealth care centers blend service and education goals, resulting in \nconsiderable benefit to the community at large.\n  Nursing centers are rooted in health care models established in the \nearly part of the 20th century. Lillian Wald in the Henry Street \nSettlement and Margaret Sanger, who opened the first birth control \nclinic, provided the earliest models of service.\n  Since the late 1970's, in conjunction with the development of \neducational programs for nurse practitioners, college of nursing \nfaculties have established nursing centers. There are currently 250 \ncenters nationwide, affiliated with universities and colleges of \nnursing in Arizona, Utah, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, \nTexas, Hawaii, Virginia, and New York. The Regional Nursing Centers \nConsortium, an association of eighteen nursing centers in New Jersey, \nPennsylvania and Delaware, was established in 1996 to foster greater \nrecognition of, and support for, nursing centers in their pursuit of \nproviding quality care to underserved populations.\n  Nursing centers tend to be located in or near areas with a shortage \nof health professionals or areas that are medically underserved. The \nbeneficiaries of their services have traditionally been the underserved \nand those least likely to engage in ongoing health care services for \nthemselves or their family members. In the 1970's, I sponsored \nlegislation that would give nurses the right to reimbursement for \nindependent nursing services, under various federal healthcare \nprograms. At the same time, one of the first academic nursing centers \nwas delivering primary care services in Arizona.\n  As the Vice Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, I am pleased \nto note that the University of South Carolina College of Nursing has \nestablished a Primary Care Tribal Practice Clinic, under contract with \nthe Catawba Indian nation, which provides primary and preventive \nservices to those populations. The University also has a Women's Health \nClinic and Student Health Clinic, which are both managed by nurse \npractitioners.\n  Another prime example of services provided by nurse practitioners is \nthe Utah Wendover Clinic. This clinic, in existence since 1994, \nprovides interdisciplinary rural primary health services to more than \n10,000 patients annually. The clinic now has telehealth capabilities \nthat provide interactive links from the clinic to the university \nhospital, 120 miles away. This technology allows practitioners direct \naccess to medical support for primary care, pediatrics, mental health, \npotential abuse, and emergency trauma treatment.\n  To date, nursing centers have demonstrated quality outcomes which, \nwhen compared to conventional primary health care, indicate that their \ncomprehensive models of care have resulted in significantly fewer \nemergency room visits, fewer hospital inpatient days, and less use of \nspecialists. The Lasalle Neighborhood Nursing Center, for example, \nreported for 1997 that fewer than 0.02 percent of their primary care \nclients reported hospitalization for asthma; fewer than 4 percent of \nexpectant mothers who enrolled delivered low birth rate infants; 90 \npercent of infants and young children were immunized on time; 50 \npercent fewer emergency room visits; and the clinic achieved a 97 \npercent patient satisfaction rate.\n  What makes the concept of nurse managed practices exciting and \npromising for the 21st century is their ability to provide care in a \n``spirit of serving'' to underserved people in desperate need of health \ncare services. Interestingly, nurse practitioners have consistently \nprovided Medicaid sponsored primary care in urban and rural communities \nfor a number of years, and have consistently demonstrated their \ncommitment to these underserved areas.\n  The 1997 Balanced Budget Act (P.L. 105-33) included a provision that \nfor the first time ever allowed for direct Medicare reimbursement of \nall nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists, regardless of \nthe setting in which services were performed. This provision built upon \nprevious legislation that allowed direct reimbursement to individual \nnurse practitioners for services provided in rural health clinics \nthroughout America. The law effectively paved the way for an array of \nclinical practice arrangements for these providers; however, per visit \npayments to nurse run centers, as opposed to individual practitioners, \nwas not formally included in the law.\n  Federal law now also mandates independent reimbursement for nurse \npractitioners under the Civilian Health and Medical Programs of \nUniformed Services (CHAMPUS), the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan \n(FEHBP) and in Department of Defense Medical Treatment Facilities.\n  As the Ranking Member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, my \ndistinguished colleagues and I have listened to the testimonies of the \nthree Service Chief Nurses each year, during the Defense Medical \nhearings. I am proud to report that the military services have taken \nthe lead in ensuring the advancement of the profession of nursing. \nMilitary advanced practice nurses provide care to service members and \ntheir families at all of the treatment facilities. The Graduate School \nof Nursing at the Uniformed University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), \nwhich has a very successful nurse practitioner program, was recently \nrecognized in the top 100 graduate schools in the United States. The \nCommanding General at Tripler Army Medical Center, a two star position, \nis a nurse. This\n\n[[Page S9486]]\n\nis a first ever accomplishment for nurses in the military. I hope to \nsee more nurse officers in these leadership roles, even at the three \nstar level.\n  At the beginning of this session of Congress, I proposed legislation \nto amend Title XIX of the Social Security Act to expressly provide for \ncoverage of services by nursing school administered centers under state \nMedicaid programs, similiar to payments provided to rural health \nclinics. Today, as we debate a number of health care issues, I urge us \nto consider creative avenues for expanding health care access for all \nAmericans, particularly the poor and underserved. Nursing centers, as \nnew models of health care providers, offer quality services for lower \npayments.\n  In closing, I would like to reiterate that nurse practitioners \nprovide cost effective, preventive care in underserved areas across \nAmerica. Their educational programs emphasize the provision of care to \npatients with limited resources, financial and otherwise. A recent \narticle in U.S. News and World Report showcased the successful Columbia \nAdvanced Practice Nurse Associates (CAPNA), a nurse run primary care \nclinic in New York City. Dr. Mary Mundinger, the Dean of the Columbia \nSchool of Nursing and a Robert Wood Johnson Health Policy Fellow in \n1984, was the catalyst for the center, which she envisions as a \n``prototype of a new branch of primary care.''\n  Nurse practitioners have proven themselves to be well trained \nproviders of high quality, cost effective care.\n  Nursing school administered centers offer viable alternatives to \nhealth care access for the poor and underserved, and allow Americans \nmore choices in their selection of cost effective, quality care \nservices. The issues surrounding quality, access and the provision of \npatient care services are, Mr. President, at the crux of our current \ndebates over health care reform. We owe it to each and every American \nto provide the very best options for quality health care available.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to address my \ncolleagues on this most important topic. I ask that an article on this \nsubject be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n           [From the U.S. News & World Report, July 27, 1998]\n\n  For nurses, a barrier broken--It's a test insurers are backing: Can \n                   primary care work without doctors?\n\n                           (By James Lardner)\n\n       Seems like everybody's been trying to take a bite out of \n     doctors' paychecks lately--the federal government, employers, \n     insurers, and now, of all people, nurses. In New York City, \n     Medicare and eight private health plans have given their \n     enrollees permission to get primary care from a group of \n     nurse practitioners or NPs, who diagnose, treat, prescribe, \n     refer, and bill very much as if they were M.D.'s.\n       About 250 New Yorkers have signed up with the 10-month-old \n     practice, known as CAPNA (for Columbia Advanced Practice \n     Nurse Associates), and though it's still a tiny operation--\n     just four NPs--business is growing by six or seven new \n     patients a week. Supporters think the idea of a nurse-run \n     form of primary care has a lot of potential. Many doctors are \n     dubious.\n       The New York State Medical Society's chief lobbyist, \n     Anthony Santomauro, sees a threat to the well-being of \n     physicians as well as of patients. ``Your action,'' \n     Santomauro warned his colleagues recently, ``could decide \n     whether nurse practitioners . . . continue to serve under \n     your direction and supervision or . . . become independent \n     practitioners in direct competition.'' To Robert Graham, \n     executive vice president of the American Academy of Family \n     Physicians, what the nurses are doing ``comes very close to \n     practicing medicine, which of course, requires a medical \n     degree and a license.''\n       The law aside, critics argue that primary care entails \n     subtle diagnostic decisions that physicians are uniquely \n     qualified to make. ``The four years in medical school and \n     three years in residency training and many hours of \n     continuing education that physicians receive are very \n     different from the 500 to 700 hours of training that most \n     nurse-practitioner programs call for,'' says Nancy Dickey, a \n     Texas physician who recently became president of the American \n     Medical Association. (There are roughly 140,000 nurses with \n     advanced degrees in the United States; as a rule, NPs have \n     master's degrees that entail two years of classroom and \n     clinical training.)\n       While physicians stress the possibility of confusion about \n     who is or isn't an M.D., they may be up against a bigger \n     problem: a widespread longing for a slower-paced, more \n     personal form of health care than many people feel they can \n     get from physicians these days. ``If you spend 10 minutes \n     with a doctor in New York City, you're doing well,'' says \n     Doris Ward, a 77-year-old former nonprofit executive. Ward \n     came to CAPNA's offices on East 60th Street seeking treatment \n     for high cholesterol and anxious to find ``someone who would \n     sit down and talk to me for a little while.'' Her NP, Marlene \n     McHugh, devoted an hour to the initial appointment and \n     recommended a dietary rather than a medical approach to her \n     problem.\n       Thomas Becker, a 36-year-old marketing manager, was \n     confused about whom he was seeing. He didn't know that \n     Edwidge Thomas was not a doctor when he picked her from a \n     list supplied by his health plan; in fact, he didn't realize \n     his mistake until his first visit. But Thomas asked such \n     insightful questions that ``it didn't really matter to \n     me,'' Becker says. After three appointments, two for \n     sports-related injuries and one for flu, he rates CAPNA \n     ``absolutely excellent.''\n       Bedside manner. Mary O'Neil Mundinger, dean of the Columbia \n     University School of Nursing and the driving force behind \n     CAPNA, sees it as the prototype of a new branch of primary \n     care. She spent 17 years as a bedside nurse before getting a \n     doctorate in public health, and she dismisses the suggestion \n     that nurses are likely to overlook symptoms or botch \n     diagnoses (``We don't miss things,'' she says crisply). But \n     physicians, she argues, overemphasize diagnosing and \n     prescribing, and tend to consider their work over once they \n     have recommended a program of treatment; nurses, she says, \n     are better at getting patients to follow the program.\n       Two studies seem to bolster her case. Nurse practitioners \n     have long provided primary care to those who might otherwise \n     have gone unserved, such as residents of rural areas, and a \n     1986 study by the Office of Technology Assessment concluded \n     that the care they provided was equivalent to that offered by \n     physicians. When it came to communication and prevention, the \n     OTA found NPs more adept.\n       In addition, a 1993 analysis of studies comparing care \n     offered by physicians with that provided by NPs found that \n     nurses spent about 25 minutes with a patient; doctors spent \n     17. The two groups were about equal in their rates of \n     prescribing drugs, but the nurses provided more patient \n     education and stressed exercise more often than the doctors.\n       While the debate may seem to pit nurses against doctors, \n     the more important division exposed by CAPNA may be between \n     two types of physician, primary-care providers and \n     specialists. Critics of the CAPNA model fear that NPs, \n     because they have less training than physicians, will rely \n     too much on specialists. Many specialists respond that in the \n     age of managed care, overreferral by nurses is far less of a \n     danger than underreferral by doctors, who are torn between \n     the interests of patients and, as Eric Rose, the chief of \n     surgery at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, puts it, \n     ``the care of their bankbooks and the HMOs' bankbooks.'' \n     (CAPNA has been referring surgery cases to Columbia-\n     Presbyterian.)\n       CAPNA's acceptance by insurers as a legitimate primary-care \n     alternative to a practice run by physicians is clearly a \n     breakthrough for nurses, who were long defined as hospital \n     workers who existed to do the bidding of physicians. As \n     recently as the 1970s, nursing-school curricula included \n     elaborate protocols of respect (surrendering one's chair, for \n     example) that a nurse was supposed to follow when a physician \n     entered a room.\n       The power of physicians is also under attack from market-\n     oriented critics, who see them as attempting to carve out a \n     monopoly at the consumer's expense. In the past, physicians' \n     organizations have used their clout to beat back proposals to \n     give quasi-medical powers to nonphysicians. But CAPNA was \n     created with no change in the law; Mundinger reasoned that \n     the kind of health care she hoped to offer affluent patients \n     in midtown Manhattan was already the norm in much of rural \n     and inner-city America. New York itself allowed NPs to write \n     prescriptions--otherwise, health care in many areas of the \n     state would have ground to a halt. ``As long as it was just \n     poor folks, nobody was paying any attention,'' Mundinger \n     says.\n       The groundwork was laid in 1993, when Columbia-Presbyterian \n     sought the nursing school's help in expanding health care \n     services in two poor, upper-Manhattan neighborhoods. Spotting \n     an opportunity, Mundinger asked in return for something that \n     earlier partnerships of nurse practitioners had lacked: \n     hospital admitting privileges--the ability to get patients \n     into Columbia-Presbyterian and supervise their care there. \n     Two new primary-care practices were created, one with doctors \n     and nurse practitioners working as equals, the other run \n     entirely by NPs.\n       Mundinger's next brainstorm was to see if the concept would \n     work in an affluent neighborhood. This time, in a move with \n     widespread implications for health care, she went after \n     managed-care plans for the right of reimbursement.\n       Equal treatment. For the HMOs--under constant pressure from \n     employers to cut costs--a nurse-run practice had obvious \n     appeal if it meant lower payments for the same services. But \n     Mundinger rejected support that was conditioned on reduced \n     reimbursement, insisting that would open the HMOs to the \n     charge of chiseling and cast her practice as a cheap \n     substitute for real medicine. After months of discussions, \n     Oxford Health Plans agreed to go along. Seven more health \n     plans followed suit, all giving the nurses the same fee-for-\n     service rates as doctors.\n       Mundinger's admirers say she has not only created a \n     significant new model of health\n\n[[Page S9487]]\n\n     care but, in doing so, has called the medical profession's \n     bluff. Say Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist who teaches at \n     Princeton University, ``Doctors always say the are rugged \n     individualists, for free enterprise and such, and now at the \n     first sight of a nurse they run to the government and say, \n     `Please use your coercive powers to protect us!' ''\n       Even some supporters, however, fear that Mundinger's model, \n     for all its noble objectives, will appeal to the basest \n     motives of insurers and employers, leaving patients, in the \n     end, with less-trained people who are in just as much of a \n     hurry. There is some reason for doubting this: A study in the \n     April Nurse Practitioner, for example, found NPs more \n     consistent than gynecologists in adhering to medical \n     standards in evaluating cervical dysplasia, a precursor to \n     cervical cancer. And as Robert Brook, a Rand analyst who is \n     conducting an internal assessment for CAPNA, puts it: ``It's \n     not like we started out with a perfect system.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9485-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL KEVIN ``SPANKY\" KIRSCH, USAF\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Lieutenant \nColonel Kevin ``Spanky'' Kirsch, United States Air Force, on the \noccasion of his retirement after over twenty years of exemplary service \nto our nation. Colonel Kirsch's strong commitment to excellence will \nleave a lasting impact on the vitality of our nation's military \nprocurement and information technology capabilities. His expertise in \nthese areas will be sorely missed by his colleagues both in the \nPentagon and on Capitol Hill.\n  Before embarking on his Air Force career, Colonel Kirsch worked as an \nestimator/engineer for Penfield Electric Co. in upstate New York, where \nhe designed and built electrical and mechanical systems for commercial \nconstruction. In 1978, Colonel Kirsch received his commission through \nthe Officer Training School at Lackland AFB in San Antonio, TX. Eagerly \ntraveling to Williams AFB in Arizona for flight training, Colonel \nKirsch earned his pilot wings after successful training in T-37 and T-\n38 aircraft.\n  In 1980, Colonel Kirsch was assigned to Carswell AFB, in Fort Worth, \nTX, as a co-pilot in the B-52D aircraft. While serving in this capacity \non nuclear alert for the next five years, he earned his Masters degree, \ncompleted Squadron Officer School and Marine Corps Command and Staff \nSchool by correspondence, and earned an engineering specialty code with \nthe Civil Engineering Squadron.\n  An experienced bomber pilot serving with the 7th Bomb Wing, Colonel \nKirsch, then a First Lieutenant, served as the Resource Manager for the \nDirector of Operations--a position normally filled by an officer much \nmore senior in rank. He was selected to the Standardization Evaluation \n(Stan-Eval) Division and became dual-qualified in the B-52H. \nSubsequently, he was selected ahead of his peers to be an aircraft \ncommander in the B-52H.\n  Colonel Kirsch was selected in 1985 as one of the top 1% of the Air \nForce's captains to participate in the Air Staff Training (ASTRA) \nprogram at the Pentagon. His experience during that tour, working in \nAir Force contracting and legislative affairs, would serve him well in \nlater assignments.\n  In 1986, Colonel Kirsch returned to flying in the FB-111 aircraft at \nPlattsburgh AFB, NY. He joined the 529th Bomb Squadron as an aircraft \ncommander and was designated a flight commander shortly thereafter. He \nemployed his computer skills to help automate the scheduling functions \nat the 380th Bomb Wing and was soon designated chief of bomber \nscheduling.\n  Following his tour with the 529th, Colonel Kirsch was assigned to \nStrategic Air Command (SAC) Headquarters at Offutt AFB, NE. As Chief of \nthe Advanced Weapons Concepts Branch, he served as a liaison with the \nDepartment of Energy on nuclear weapons programs and worked on \ndevelopment of new strategic systems--including the B-2 bomber. Colonel \nKirsch was one of four officers chosen to be part of the commander-in-\nchief's (CINC's) staff group to facilitate the transition of SAC to \nStrategic Command (STRATCOM). Originally picked as a technical advisor \nfor weapon systems, he soon became the legislative liaison for \nSTRATCOM. In this capacity, Colonel Kirsch organized congressional \ndelegations to visit STRATCOM, and managed CINC STRATCOM's interaction \nwith Capitol Hill.\n  In 1994, Col Kirsch traveled here, to Washington, to begin his final \nassighment on active duty. Initially serving as a military assistant to \nthe Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs, Colonel \nKirsch once again quickly distinguished himself and was designated the \nspecial assistant for acquisition and C3 policy. Representing the \nSecretary of Defense, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition \nand Technology and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for C3I, Colonel \nKirsch managed a myriad of critical initiatives including acquisition \nreform and information assurance. He also served as the principal \narchitect for the organization's web page, computer network, and many \nof the custom applications used to automate the office's administrative \nfunctions.\n  Colonel Kirsch's numerous military awards include the Defense \nSuperior Service Medal, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal with Oak \nLeaf Cluster, the Air Force Meritorious Service Medal, the Air Force \nCommendation Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, and the Air Force Achievement \nAward.\n  Following his retirement, Colonel Kirsch and his wife Carol will \ncontinue to reside in Springfield, VA with their children Alicia and \nBenjamin.\n  Mr President, our nation, the Department of Defense, the United \nStates Air Force, and Lieutenant Colonel Kirsch's family can truly be \nproud of this outstanding officer's many accomplishments. His honorable \nservice will be genuinely missed in the Department of Defense and on \nCapitol Hill. I wish Lieutenant Colonel Spanky Kirsch the very best in \nall his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9487-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               D.A.R.E.

Mr. President, I would like to say a few words \nabout Georgia and the recent events which have taken place in this \nimpressive country. Several days ago, Georgia reaffirmed its commitment \nto full participatory democracy when the Minister of State requested \nthe resignation of all cabinet ministers, and then resigned himself. \nHis resignation was accepted, and President Eduard Shevardnadze has \nvowed to reconstitute a new government by the middle of August. This \ntransition, so reminiscent of the ebb and flow of governments in great \nparliamentary democracies, has been accomplished without violence or \nbloodshed, without chaos or confusion, and with the support of the \nGeorgian people. Truly Georgia is an inspiration to peoples everywhere \nwho long for democracy and who struggle against the freedom-stifling \nlegacy of the communist experiment.\n  Georgia is impressive in other ways as well. Its economy continues to \ngrow in a positive direction, unlike the economies of some of its \nneighbors; Georgia is not perfect, and it is not pristine. But it is \nprogressive. With a growth rate of nearly 8 percent in 1997 and \nprojected growth of 11-13 percent in 1998, Georgia is on track to a \nsignificant economic turn-around.\n  This turn-around and the prosperity that will inevitably flow from \nit, still involve many hurdles. Georgians have bravely faced these \nchallenges, and they face more still. Probably none is so painful as \nthe ongoing conflict in Abkhazia, Georgia's most northwestern province \nbordering Russia. This brutal\n\n[[Page S9488]]\n\nbrushfire war has now claimed lives unnecessarily on both sides, and it \nmust be ended. Mr. President, the CIS peacekeepers are a major part of \nthe problem and the reason the war continues.\n  As the Times of London noted on July 27th, Georgia accepted the CIS \npeacekeepers only under duress, because the UN blinked. These CIS \npeacekeepers, the Times points out, have not exactly distinguished \nthemselves by their impartiality. They are ``entirely drawn from the \nRussian Army, and commanded from Russian, not CIS, headquarters. Of its \nfour battalions, one fought the Georgians in the 1992-93 war, while \nanother two are recruited from anti-Georgia nationalities.'' It is hard \nto imagine that this formula can create anything but conflict, and \nindeed, there have been constant complaints from Georgia that these so-\ncalled peacekeepers are merely part of a Russian strategy to \ndestabilize Georgia, a strategy that includes several assassination \nattempts on President Shevardnadze.\n  From the beginning, the Abkhaz conflict has been widely acknowledged \nto be Russia's doing. The separatists who want to break off Abkhazia \nfrom Georgia are provoked, fueled and encouraged by the Russians. \nGeorgia has offered Abkhazia full autonomy, an offer that has been \nanswered by Russian guns.\n  As early as 1992 Russia provided the Abkhazians with weapons to \nconduct the war, and the Russian government today supports the Abkhaz \nleadership in its unwillingness to bring the conflict to a close \nthrough negotiation. One member of the Abkhaz leadership wrote in the \nRussian nationalist press in 1992 that ``Abkhazia is Russia.'' Since \nthen, Russia has managed to scuttle all budding negotiations, even \nwhile serving as the putative ``mediator'' at the recent Geneva talks \nbetween the Georgians and Abkhazians, and it has unfailingly sided with \nthe Abkhaz against Georgia at the infrequent bargaining tables and on \nthe battlefield.\n  Let us be frank: These Russian peacekeepers do not want peace. \nRather, they seek to extend the hostilities so that Georgia will find \nit difficult to consolidate its hold over this breakaway region. These \nso-called peacekeepers have helped to create thousands of dead on both \nsides; they have created massive flows of Georgian refugees by turning \na blind eye toward some of the most blatant ethnic cleansing anywhere \nin the world; and they have allowed the devastation of what is arguably \none of the richest and most beautiful parts of the Georgian state.\n  Abkhaz leaders, with Russia's help, have perpetrated one of the \nworld's most egregious examples of ethnic cleansing. Tens of thousands \nof Georgians have been forced out of their homes in Abkhazia and turned \ninto homeless, hungry refugees. Georgia's many requests in recent years \nto the United Nations to condemn this blatant genocide have fallen on \ndeaf ears, and most Georgians now attribute the Abkhazians' continued \nuse of ethnic cleansing to UN inaction. Georgia has once again asked \nthe UN to intervene in Abkhazia, but its willingness to do so, \nespecially with Russia holding a seat on the Security Council, is in \ndoubt.\n  How is it possible that ethnic cleansing can high behind a \ntransparent veil of ``peacekeeping''? Why has the UN shirked its duty \nto protect these vulnerable Georgians, when it seems willing, even \neager, to condemn genocide elsewhere in the world? Where is the \nindignation and outrage from our statesmen? Where are the legions of \nhuman rights advocates that usually visit the corridors of our \ndepartments and ministries?\n  The Abkhazians (who constitute less than 20 percent of the population \nof the region they claim as their own) and their Russian supporters, \nshould harbor no illusions about the ultimate outcome of this struggle: \nAbkhazia will remain part of Georgia. The Georgian government will \nnever acquiesce in territorial claims on its historic territory, and \nthe US government will never support such claims. Meanwhile, Abkhazians \nare poised to miss what could be one of the most exciting periods in \nthe development of the South Caucasus. The opening of energy pipelines \nfrom the Caspian will create unprecedented opportunities for growth and \ndevelopment, and the forging of the Eurasian Transport Corridor, the \nNew Silk Road, which originates in Georgia, foretells a future in which \nall Georgians, including Abkhazians, should prosper.\n  Those of my colleagues who have traveled to Georgia know of the \nimmense beauty of the country, and the kindness and generosity of its \npeople. They know of the Georgians' will in the face of numerous \nobstacles and barriers. And, increasingly, they understand why and \nwhere Georgia's interests intersect with America's interests.\n  Put simply, Georgia is a key strategic ally for America in a region \nin which America has few strategic anchors. America has a strong \nnational interest in encouraging a close and multifaceted relationship \nwith Georgia. Though small, poor and weak, Georgia has the potential to \nbe small, yet rich and strong. It is in our best interest to promote \nthis transition with American aid, American power and American \nprayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9487-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9488-S9489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING THE HUMAN RIGHTS AND \n    HUMANITARIAN SITUATION FACING THE WOMEN AND GIRLS OF AFGHANISTAN\n\n  (The text of the concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 97), with its \npreamble, as agreed to by the Senate on July 29, 1998, is as follows:)\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 97\n\n       Whereas the legacy of the war in Afghanistan has had a \n     devastating impact on the civilian population, and a \n     particularly negative impact on the rights and security of \n     women and girls;\n       Whereas the current environment is one in which the rights \n     of women and girls are routinely violated, leading the \n     Department of State in its 1997 Country Report on Human \n     Rights, released January 30, 1998, to conclude that women are \n     beaten for violating increasingly restrictive Taliban dress \n     codes, which require women to be covered from head to toe, \n     women are strictly prohibited from working outside the home, \n     women and girls are denied the right to an education, women \n     are forbidden from appearing outside the home unless \n     accompanied by a male family member, and beatings and death \n     result from a failure to observe these restrictions;\n       Whereas the Secretary of State stated, in November 1997 at \n     the Nasir Bagh Refugee Camp in Pakistan, that if a society is \n     to move forward, women and girls must have access to schools \n     and health care, be able to participate in the economy, and \n     be protected from physical exploitation and abuse;\n       Whereas Afghanistan recognizes international human rights \n     conventions such as the Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the International \n     Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Covenant on the \n     Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination of All \n     Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and the International \n     Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, which \n     espouses respect for basic human rights of all individuals \n     without regard to race, religion, ethnicity, or gender;\n       Whereas the use of rape as an instrument of war is \n     considered a grave breach of the Geneva Convention and a \n     crime against humanity;\n       Whereas people who commit grave breaches of the Geneva \n     Convention are to be apprehended and subject to trial;\n       Whereas there is significant credible evidence that warring \n     parties, factions, and powers in Afghanistan are responsible \n     for numerous human rights violations, including the \n     systematic rape of women and girls;\n       Whereas in recent years Afghan maternal mortality rates \n     have increased dramatically, and the level of women's health \n     care has declined significantly;\n       Whereas there has been a marked upswing in human rights \n     violations against women and girls since the Taliban \n     coalition seized Kabul in 1996, including Taliban edicts \n     denying women and girls the right to an education, \n     employment, access to adequate health care, and direct access \n     to humanitarian aid; and\n       Whereas peace and security in Afghanistan are conducive to \n     the full restoration of all human rights and fundamental \n     freedom, the voluntary repatriation of refugees to their \n     homeland in safety and dignity, the clearance of mine fields, \n     and the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Afghanistan: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) deplores the continued human rights violations by all \n     parties, factions, and powers in Afghanistan;\n       (2) condemns targeted discrimination against women and \n     girls and expresses deep concern regarding the prohibitions \n     on employment and education;\n       (3) strongly condemns the use of rape or other forms of \n     systematic gender discrimination by any party, faction, or \n     power in Afghanistan as an instrument of war;\n       (4) calls on all parties, factions, and powers in \n     Afghanistan to respect international norms and standards of \n     human rights;\n       (5) calls on all Afghan parties to bring an end without \n     delay to--\n\n[[Page S9489]]\n\n       (A) discrimination on the basis of gender; and\n       (B) deprivation of human rights of women;\n       (6) calls on all Afghan parties in particular to take \n     measures to ensure--\n       (A) the effective participation of women in civil, \n     economic, political, and social life throughout the country;\n       (B) respect for the right of women to work;\n       (C) the right of women and girls to an education without \n     discrimination, reopening schools to women and girls at all \n     levels of education;\n       (D) respect for the right of women to physical security;\n       (E) those responsible for physical attacks on women are \n     brought to justice;\n       (F) respect for freedom of movement of women and their \n     effective access to health care;

\n     and\n       (10) calls on all warring parties, factions, and powers to \n     participate with Ambassador Brahimi in an intra-Afghan \n     dialogue regarding the peace process.\n\n     SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL ACTION BY PRESIDENT.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the President and \n     Secretary of State should--\n       (1) work with the United Nations High Commissioner for \n     Refugees and the international community to--\n       (A) guarantee the safety of, and provide international \n     development assistance for, Afghan women's groups in Pakistan \n     and Afghanistan;\n       (B) increase support for refugee programs in Pakistan \n     providing assistance to Afghan women and children with an \n     emphasis on health, education, and income-generating \n     programs; and\n       (C) explore options for the resettlement of those Afghan \n     women, particularly war widows and their families, who are \n     under threat or who fear for their safety or the safety of \n     their families;\n       (2) establish an Afghanistan Women's Initiative, based on \n     the successful model of the Bosnian Women's Initiative and \n     the Rwandan Women's Initiative, that is targeted at Afghan \n     women's groups, in order to--\n       (A) facilitate organization among Afghan women's groups in \n     Pakistan and Afghanistan;\n       (B) provide humanitarian and development services to the \n     women and the families most in need; and\n       (C) promote women's economic security;\n       (3) make a policy determination that--\n       (A) recognition of any government in Afghanistan by the \n     United States should depend, among other things, on the human \n     rights policies towards women adopted by that government;\n       (B) the United States should not recognize any government \n     which systematically maltreats women; and\n       (C) any nonemergency economic or development assistance \n     will be based on respect for human rights; and\n       (4) call for the creation of--\n       (A) an international commission to establish a record of \n     the criminal culpability of any individual or party in \n     Afghanistan employing rape or other crimes against humanity \n     considered a grave breach of the Geneva Convention as an \n     instrument of war; and\n       (B) an ad hoc international criminal tribunal by the United \n     Nations for the purposes of indicting, prosecuting, and \n     imprisoning any individual responsible for crimes against \n     humanity in Afghanistan.\n\n     SEC. 3. REPORT.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of State \n     should submit a report to Congress not later than 6 months \n     after the date of the adoption of this resolution regarding \n     actions that have been taken to implement this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9488-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9489-S9493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          WORKFORCE INVESTMENT ACT OF 1998--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now turn to the \nconsideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 1385 to \nconsolidate, coordinate, and improve employment, training, literacy, \nand vocational rehabilitation programs in the United States, and for \nother purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The report will be stated.\n  The Legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     1385), have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their \n     respective Houses this report, signed by a majority of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of July 29, 1998.)\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent that the conference report be \nadopted, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and other \nstatements relating to this conference report be printed in the Record.\n  Before you proceed, Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Ohio \nwould like to make some comments, and I invite him to do so.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank the chairman of \nthe committee, Senator Jeffords, for yielding to me and thank him also \nfor the tremendous work he has done on this bill. He has been working \non this for a number of years. This is the culmination of a great deal \nof work.\n  We are about to pass the conference report. Once the bill is sent on \nto the President and signed by the President, it will represent a major \naccomplishment of this Congress. This bill consolidates over 70 \nfederally funded job training related programs--over 70 of them \nconsolidated. This bill will make job training, federally funded job \ntraining, in this country much more accountable. It will also involve \nthe business community much more in the development and design of job \ntraining.\n  The one thing Chairman Jeffords and I have learned as we have held \nhearings on this matter over the years is that if you want job training \nto work, it has to be run locally and it has to have great input from \nthe local business community. This bill will make sure that we have \nthat local input. We have to remember who the consumers are. When you \nare talking about job training, there are two consumers. One is the \nperson who wants the job and wants to be trained for the job. But the \nother, equally as important, is the company or the individual who wants \nto hire that person, and so you have to involve them both in the design \nof job training.\n  That is what this bill does. This bill also dramatically reforms Job \nCorps. Job Corps is a Great Society-era job training program, \nresidential, that is run by the Federal Government. It costs over $1 \nbillion a year. It is targeted at our most at-risk young people in this \ncountry, people who desperately need our help, desperately need our \nassistance. What this bill does is make sure that $1 billion will be \ncorrectly spent. And again, we do that by measuring the results.\n  One of the things that Chairman Jeffords and I, I think, and the rest \nof the committee, were so shocked about when we held hearings several \nyears ago on this--actually former Senator Kassebaum was chairman--was \nthat Job Corps did not really measure success or failure of the young \npeople. It didn't measure the success or failure of a particular job \ntraining program. They looked at it and saw whether or not a person had \na job for 2 weeks. If they kept a job for 2 weeks after graduating from \nthe program--and it didn't matter what the job was--the program was \nconsidered a success. The contractor who was in charge of getting that \nperson a job got paid, and then no one ever looked back.\n  What we do with this bill is say we are going to measure success or \nfailure after 6 months. We are going to measure success or failure \nafter 12 months. And then we are going to be able to tell which \nprograms work and which do not work in regard to Job Fair.\n  Another change we are making in Job Corps is to involve the local \nbusiness community. Too often Job Corps has herded young people from \n500, 600, 700 miles a way. They go to the Job Corps. They stay there \nfor awhile, they complete their program, and then they go back home, \nand it is very difficult to involve the local business community when \nthey know that person is not going to be there to work for them. And so \nwe change those priorities in regard to Job Corps as well.\n  We also in this bill make a major step forward to link the regular \njob training programs of this country with\n\n[[Page S9490]]\n\nvocational rehabilitation. We do that by closing the gap. We do that by \npreserving the dedicated flow of money that will go for this targeted \npopulation, targeted population that is in need of our assistance, who \nwants to help themselves. We preserve that dedicated fund, those \ndedicated funds. But we give that recipient, that client, more \nresources. We empower that client to go to the vocational \nrehabilitation site or, if the services are not there, to make sure \nthat the client has the legal right to go across the street or across \nthe county, wherever that is, to get help and assistance from the \nregular system as well. It integrates the two.\n  In conclusion, let me say this bill is a bill for workers. It is a \nbill for people who want to be workers. It is a bill for young people. \nIt is a bill that literally empowers the person who is seeking the job \ntraining. It gives them a lot more, many more rights. It gives them a \nlot more flexibility. It puts them into the ball game as far as \nchoosing what is the job training that is best for them. So it makes a \nsignificant difference.\n  This bill also has a very significant component aimed directly at \nchildren. We set aside a significant sum of money for those young \npeople between the ages of 14 and 21. We do it; we target it; we say it \nis important. There is nothing, I think, more important in this country \nthan what we do with our young people and the assistance we try to \nprovide for them. We have many young people in this country who we call \nat-risk youth. This bill will go a long way to give them direct \nassistance. However, even though we target it in this bill and say \nthese funds are dedicated for these young people, we also at the same \ntime give all the flexibility to the local community, States and local \ncommunities to allow them to design the specific program that will \nactually work for their young people in their local communities.\n\n  This is a revolutionary bill. It is a bill that dramatically changes \nthe status quo. It is a bipartisan bill. It is a bill that Senator \nWellstone worked on with me in the subcommittee. It is a bill on which \nSenator Kennedy worked with Senator Jeffords. It is a bill that \nSecretary Alexis Herman has been very, very much involved in. She has \nbeen involved in it up until the last 10 minutes, as we have negotiated \nthe final portions of this bill.\n\n  So, it is a bipartisan bill. It is a bill we can all be very proud \nof. It is a bill that will truly make a difference for our young people \nand for those who need to be trained in this country.\n  Again, I thank my chairman for the tremendous work that he has done; \nfor his persistence. One of the qualities I think you have to have in \nthe U.S. Senate is perseverance and persistence, as well as patience. \nHe has demonstrated all three very well. The culmination is what we see \ntonight, which is a bill we are about to send to the President of the \nUnited States for his signature.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague from Ohio \nfor his very eloquent description of the legislation, which makes it \nentirely unnecessary for me to go further. I appreciate the kind \ncomments he made.\n  As he pointed out, this is an example of bipartisanship as well. \nSenator Wellstone and Senator Kennedy, on the other side of the aisle, \nparticipated always in a constructive way and allowed us to come up \nwith an excellent piece of legislation.\n  On the House side, Congressman Goodling, my good friend and colleague \nfor many years, as chairman of the committee, and Congressman Clay, \nwhom I also worked with in the past and to the present, Congressman \nMcKeon of California, and Congressman Kildee of Michigan--all \nparticipated in this conference report.\n  It could not have been done without the fantastic help of our staff. \nThe committee personnel, CRS, and legislative counsel, and DOL, \nDepartment of Education, the White House--all participated in bringing \nto fruition a piece of legislation which has been struggling for 4 \nyears to be able to get there.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, final passage of the Workforce Investment \nAct is a landmark achievement in which we can all take pride. For \nyears, Congress has struggled to design an employment training system \nthat would provide America's workers with the skills they need to \nsucceed in the 21st century workplace. I believe this legislation will \naccomplish that enormous task. Few bills which we consider will have a \ngreater impact on more Americans than the Workforce Investment Act we \npass today.\n  An educated workforce has become the most valuable resource in the \nmodern economy. Our nation's long term economic vitality depends on the \ncreation of an effective, accessible, and accountable system of job \ntraining and career development which is open to all our citizens. \nSchools must assume more responsibility for preparing their students to \nmeet the challenges of the 21st century workplace. Disadvantaged adults \nand out of school youth need the opportunity to develop job skills \nwhich will make them productive members of the community. Dislocated \nworkers who have been displaced by the rapid pace of technological \nchange deserve the chance to pursue new careers. Individuals with \ndisabilities need the opportunity to fully develop their career \npotential. The way in which we respond to these challenges today will \ndetermine how prosperous a nation we are in the next century.\n  The importance of highly developed employment skills has never been \ngreater. The gap in earnings between skilled and unskilled workers is \nsteadily widening. For those who enter the workforce with good academic \ntraining and well-developed career skills, this new economy offers \nalmost unlimited potential. However, for those who lack basic \nproficiency in language, math and science and who have no career \nskills, the new economy presents an increasingly hostile environment.\n  Over three million young men and women between the ages of 16 and 24 \nin this country did not complete high school and are not enrolled in \nschool. Many more graduate from high school without the level of \nknowledge and skill that a high school diploma should represent. They \nwill require more education and job training in order to obtain stable, \nwell-paying employment. Without it, they are in danger of becoming a \nlost workforce generation.\n  Effective job training is also essential to the success of welfare \nreform. More than 40 percent of those in the JTPA program for \ndisadvantaged adults have come from the welfare rolls. Under the \nwelfare reform legislation, an additional 1.7 million people will be \nentering the job market. Most of these individuals have little or no \nwork background and very limited employment skills. In many cases, they \nare also the sole support of young children. They are making urgent new \ndemands on a job training system that is already burdened beyond its \ncapacity.\n  In addition, the combination of rapidly changing technology and the \nshift of manufacturing jobs overseas is creating an alarming number of \ndislocated workers. These individuals have extensive work experience, \nbut their skills are no longer in demand. We must give them the \nopportunity for retraining, and for the development of new skills to \nenable them to compete in the 21st century workplace.\n  The accelerating pace of technological change has made much of the \nexisting job training system obsolete. Broad reforms are clearly needed \nto meet the demands of the modern workplace.\n  The Workforce Investment Act will provide employment training \nopportunities for millions of Americans. It responds to the challenge \nof the changing workplace by enabling men and women to acquire the \nskills required to enter the workforce and to upgrade their skills \nthroughout their careers. It will provide them with access to the \neducational tools that will enable them not only to keep up, but to get \nahead.\n  The legislation is the product of a true bipartisan collaboration. I \nwant to publicly commend Senators Jeffords and DeWine for the genuine \nspirit of bipartisanship which has made this effort possible. Senator \nWellstone and I appreciate it. This spirit of collaboration was also \nshared by the House conferees. The resulting legislation will, I \nbelieve, truly expand career options, encourage greater program \ninnovation, and facilitate cooperative efforts amongst business, labor, \neducation and state and local government.\n  I also want to recognize the important role President Clinton has \nplayed in bringing about this dramatic reform\n\n[[Page S9491]]\n\nof our current job training system. He has consistently emphasized the \nneed for greater individual choice in the selection of career paths and \ntraining providers. The philosophy behind his skill grant proposal is \nreflected in our legislation.\n  The Workforce Investment Act is designed to provide easy access to \nstate of the art employment training programs which are geared to real \njob opportunities in the community through a single, customer-friendly \nsystem of One Stop Career Centers. Over 700 such Centers are already \noperating successfully across the country. This legislation will ensure \nthat every individual in need of employment services will have access \nto such a facility. The cornerstones of this new system are individual \nchoice and quality labor market information. In the past, men and women \nseeking new careers often did not know what job skills were most in \ndemand and which training programs had the best performance record. All \ntoo often, they were forced to make one of the most important decisions \nof their lives based on anecdotes and late-night advertisements.\n  No training system can function effectively without accurate and \ntimely information. The frequent unavailability of quality labor market \ninformation is one of the most serious flaws in the current system. \nThis legislation places a strong emphasis on providing accurate and \ntimely information about what area industries are growing, what skills \nthose jobs require, and what earning potential they have. Extensive \nbusiness community and organized labor participation are encouraged in \ndeveloping a regional plan based on this information. Once a career \nchoice is made, the individual must still select a training provider. \nAt present, many applicants make that choice with a little or no \nreliable information. Under this bill, each training provider will have \nto publicly report graduation rates, job placement and retention rates, \nand average earnings of graduates.\n  Because of the extensive information which will be available to each \napplicant, real consumer choice in the selection of a career and of a \ntraining provider will be possible. The legislation establishes \nindividual training accounts for financially eligible participants, \nwhich they can use to access career education and skill training \nprograms. Men and women seeking training assistance will no longer be \nlimited to a few predetermined options. As long as there are real job \nopportunities in the field selected and the training provider meets \nestablished performance standards, the individual will be free to \nchoose which option best suits his or her needs.\n\n  An essential element of the new system we have designed is \naccountability. As I noted earlier, each training provider will have to \nmonitor and report the job placement and retention achieved by its \ngraduates and their average earnings. Only those training programs that \nmeet an acceptable performance standard will remain eligible for \nreceipt of public funds. The same principle of accountability is \napplied to those agencies administering state and local programs. They \nare being given wide latitude to innovate under this legislation. But \nthey too will be held accountable if their programs fail to meet \nchallenging performance targets.\n  The rapid pace of technological change in the workplace has produced \nan alarming number of workers who have become dislocated in mid-career. \nThe dislocation has been compounded by the increasing number of labor \nintensive production employers relocating their businesses abroad. This \ntrend has been particularly acute in the manufacturing sector. We have \na special obligation to these dislocated workers who have long and \ndedicated work histories and now are unemployed through no fault of \ntheir own. The Workforce Investment Act makes a commitment to them by \nmaintaining a special dislocated worker program, supported by a \nseparate funding stream, which is geared to their retraining needs. The \ncurrent dislocated worker program served approximately 540,000 \ndislocated workers nationwide in the most recent year. Of those who \ncompleted the program during that year, 71 percent were employed when \nthey left the program, earning on average 93 percent of their previous \nwages. America's dislocated workers have earned the right to assistance \nin developing new skills which will allow them to be full participants \nin the 21st century economy.\n  There is no challenge facing America today which is tougher or more \nimportant than providing at-risk, often out-of-school, youth with \nmeaningful education and employment opportunities. Far too many of our \nteenagers are being left behind without the skills needed to survive in \nthe 21st century economy. I am particularly pleased with the commitment \nwhich the Workforce Investment Partnership Act makes to these young men \nand women. This legislation authorizes a new initiative focused on \nteenagers living in poverty in communities offering them few \nconstructive employment opportunities. Each year, the Secretary of \nLabor will award grants from a $250 million fund to innovative programs \ndesigned to provide opportunities to youth living in these areas. The \nprograms will emphasize mentoring, strong links between academic and \nworksite learning, and job placement and retention. It will encourage \nbroad based community participation from local service agencies and \narea employers. These model programs will, we believe, identify the \ntechniques which are most effective in reaching those youth at greatest \nrisk.\n  Another important program for young people who face the highest \nbarriers to employment is Job Corps. Most of the participants grow up \nin extreme poverty. Their educational opportunities are limited. Job \nCorps, at its best, moves them from deprivation to opportunity. But, \nfor many of them, it is an extremely difficult transition. As a result, \ncritics of the program are always able to point to failures. But for \neach story of failure, there are many stories of success. Job Corps is \na program worth preserving and worth expanding too. Our legislation \ndecisively rejects the view that Job Corps should be dismantled. \nInstead, it strengthens the program in several ways. It establishes \ncloser ties between individual Job Corps Centers and the communities \nthey serve. It ensures that training programs correspond with the \narea's labor market needs. It extends follow-up counseling for \nparticipants up to 12 months and established detailed performance \nstandards to hold programs accountable.\n  The legislation also provides for the continuation of summer jobs as \nan essential element of the youth grant. For many youth, summer jobs \nare their first opportunity to work and their first critical step in \nlearning the work ethic. The summer jobs program also provides many \nyouth with quality learning experiences and follow up during the school \nyear. Studies by the Department of Labor's Office of the Inspector \nGeneral and research by Westat, Inc. have reported positive findings \nregarding the program, concluding that work sites are well-supervised \nand disciplined, that jobs provide useful work, that the education \ncomponent teaches students new skills that they apply in school, and \nthat students learn the value of work.\n  I believe that the summer jobs program needs to continue to be \navailable on a significant scale with sufficient funding. This bill \nrecognizes the critical importance of the summer youth program by \nrequiring that it be a part of each local area's youth program and \nallowing local communities to determine the number of summer jobs to be \ncreated.\n  The Workforce Investment Act includes titles reauthorizing major \nvocation rehabilitation and adult literacy programs. Both programs will \ncontinue to be separately funded and independently administered. We \nhave incorporated them in the Workforce Act because they must be \nintegral components of any comprehensive strategy to prepare people to \nmeet the demands of the 21st century workplace.\n  Vocational rehabilitation offers new hope to individuals with \ndisabilities, allowing them to reach their full potential and actively \nparticipate in their communities. The Rehabilitation Title of the Act \nwill ensure that all working-aged individuals with disabilities, even \nthose with the most significant disabilities, have realistic \nopportunities to obtain the resources and support they need to reach \ntheir employment goals.\n  Adult literacy programs are essential for the 27% of the adult \npopulation who\n\n[[Page S9492]]\n\nhave not earned a high school diploma or its equivalent. Learning to \nread and communicate effectively are the first steps to career \nadvancement. This legislation will increase access to educational \nopportunities for those people most in need of assistance and enhance \nthe quality of services provided.\n  The Workforce Investment Partnership Act will make it possible for \nmillions of Americans to gain the skills needed to compete in a global \neconomy. In doing so, we are also enabling them to realize their \npersonal American dreams.\n  I would like to recognize the substantial contributions made by \nseveral individuals to this enormous legislative effort. On my staff, \nJeffrey Teitz has worked on the development of the workforce and \neducation titles of this bill for nearly eighteen months and done an \noutstanding job. Connie Garner has devoted a comparable effort to the \nvocational rehabilitation title. Jane Oates' assistance throughout the \nconference process has also been invaluable. I am proud of their work.\n  I also want to call the Senate's attention to the role of my longtime \nfriend, William Spring of Boston. Bill is a leader on training and \neducation issues in Massachusetts and his creative recommendations are \nincorporated throughout this legislation. There is one further person \nwho deserves special mention. Steven Spinner worked for me during the \n104th Congress until his tragic and untimely death. His invaluable \nefforts helped to lay the groundwork for our success in reforming the \nworkforce system.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues in \nsupport of the Workforce Investment Act Conference Report. This is a \ntruly bipartisan bill. As a conferee, I would like to commend Senators \nJeffords, Kennedy, DeWine, and Wellstone, as well as the House \nconferees, for shepherding this bill through the conference.\n  Few issues that we vote on in Congress are as important to the future \nof this country as the lifelong education and training of our \nworkforce. We live in an era of a global economy, emerging industries \nand company downsizing. It is imperative that our delivery of services \nmeets the employment and educational needs of the 21st century.\n  The current maze of more than 160 programs which are administered by \n15 separate federal agencies has failed. The Workforce Investment Act \nstreamlines these programs by giving more authority to state and local \nrepresentatives of government, business, labor, education, and youth \nactivities. The bill establishes a true collaborative process between \nthe state and local representatives to ensure that training and \neducational services will be held to high standards. This bill also \ngives more flexibility to individuals seeking training assistance. \nIndividuals will no longer be limited to a predetermined set of \nservices.\n  I am especially pleased that the cornerstone of the Workforce \nInvestment Act is streamlined service delivery through one-stop career \ncenters. My state of Connecticut is nearing completion of \nimplementation of its one-stop system, called Conneticut Works. This \nnetwork has reformed the delivery of job training services in the \nstate. I have had the privilege of visiting many of these centers and \ncan attest to their success.\n  While I applaud the new system of providing training assistance \nincorporated in ths bill, I am pleased that the bill retains some \ndirect federal involvement in order to ensure that disadvantaged youth, \nveterans and displaced workers receive the training assistance and \nsupport they need.\n  For many years, the Connecticut economy was dependent on defense-\noriented industries. The Workforce Investment Act ensures that \nemployees who are adversely affected by base closures and military \ndownsizing will have access to job training and supportive services in \norder to acquire the skills needed for employment in the technology-\ndriven economy of the 21st century.\n  This legislation also provides for the coordination of adult \neducation systems, allowing adult education to play a crucial role in a \nparticipant's professional training program. In the area of adult \neducation and literacy, this legislation specifically targets those \ncommunities that demonstrate significant illiteracy rates to receive \nadult education programs as a first priority. I am pleased that this \nlegislation also includes a provision that will direct funds designated \nto support English as a Second Language (ESL) programs to those ESL \nprograms in communities with designated need. This means that ESL \nprograms with waiting lists--those in communities with the greatest \nneed for the valuable services these programs provide--will receive \nfunds on a prioritized basis.\n\n  Mr. President, in order to better assist nonnative English speakers \nand fully assimilate them into our society, we must help them become \nmore fluent in English. I can think of few more important factors in \ndetermining whether or not someone new to this society will \nsuccessfully make this difficult transition than their ability to speak \nEnglish.\n  A clear and effective grasp of the English language is still the best \nindicator of success for nonnative English speakers. The ability to \nspeak English for anyone in today's marketplace represents an ``open \ndoor,'' Mr. President. This ``open door'' can lead to greater \nemployment and advancement opportunities for those whose first language \nis not English.\n  Additionally, Mr. President, this legislation reauthorizes the \nRehabilitation Act. This critically important legislation provides \ncomprehensive vocational rehabilitation services designed to help \nindividuals with disabilities become more employable and achieve \ngreater independence and integration into society.\n  Under the Rehabilitation Act, states, with assistance provided by the \nfederal government in the manner of formula-derived grants, provide a \nbroad array of services to individuals with disabilities that includes \nassessment, counseling, vocational and other educational services, work \nrelated placement services, and rehabilitation technology services. \nMore than 1.25 million Americans with disabilities were served by \nvocational rehabilitation programs in 1995 alone, Mr. President.\n  I am particularly pleased that a provision dealing with assistive \ntechnology was included in this legislation. This provision, Section \n508, will require the federal government to provide assistive \ntechnology to Federal employees with disabilities. This provision will \nput into place for the first time regulations requiring the federal \ngovernment to provide its employees with disabilities access to \nappropriate technology suited to their individual needs.\n  This legislation would allow the federal government to take the lead \nin providing critical access to information technology to all federal \nemployees with disabilities in this country. It strengthens the federal \nrequirement that electronic and information technology purchased by \nfederal agencies be accessible to their employees with disabilities.\n  Electronic and information technology accessibility is essential for \nfederal employees to maintain a meaningful employment experience, as \nwell as to meet their full potential. We live in a world where \ninformation and technology are synonymous with professional \nadvancement. Increasingly, essential job functions have come to involve \nthe use of technology, and where it is inaccessible, job opportunities \nthat others take for granted are foreclosed to people with \ndisabilities.\n  Presently, there are approximately 145,000 individuals with \ndisabilities in the federal workforce. Roughly 61 percent of these \nemployees hold permanent positions in professional, administrative, or \ntechnical occupations. Nationally, there are 49 million Americans who \nhave disabilities, nearly half of them have a severe disability. Yet \nmost mass market information technology is designed without \nconsideration for their needs.\n  Section 508, Mr. President, is the first step in an effort to ensure \nthat all individuals with disabilities have access to the assistive \ntechnology providing them the ability to reach their full capability. \nThough Section 508 will presently only affect federal employees, it is \nmy hope that one day all individuals with disabilities will have the \nsame access to assistive technology now afforded federal employees \nbecause of this important legislation. The federal government must \ntruly be an equal opportunity employer, and this equal opportunity must \napply fully to individuals with special needs.\n\n[[Page S9493]]\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would again like to commend Senators \nJeffords, DeWine, Kennedy, and Wellstone, as well as Chairman Goodling, \nCongressmen Clay, Kildee, and Martinez for the important role they each \nplayed in making this conference agreement a reality. They all worked \nclosely with myself and my staff to address numerous concerns and for \nthat I would like to thank them.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased we are about to \npass this important conference report. I look forward to its enactment \nupon signature by the President, which I hope can occur very soon. It \nis my understanding that the House is prepared to act on the conference \nbill during the coming days.\n  I have spoken on numerous occasions regarding the subject. As the \nRanking Democrat on the Senate Labor Subcommittee on Employment and \nTraining, I have worked hard with my colleagues Senator DeWine, Senator \nJeffords and Senator Kennedy to help bring us to where we are this \nevening. I thank them and the many Minnesotans who have worked directly \nwith me and my staff during the months of hearings, preparations, \ndebate and drafting.\n  The conference bill preserves important policy principles contained \nin the Senate bill. It will help coordinate, streamline and \ndecentralize our federal job training system. At the same time, it will \nmake that system more accountable to real performance measures. It \ngives private sector employers--the people who have jobs to offer and \nwho need workers with the right skills--a greater role in directing \npolicy at the state and local level, which is where most decision-\nmaking power resides in this bill. The bill retains crucial federal \npriorities, then allows state and local authorities to decide how best \nto address their needs.\n  And it will move the country to where Minnesota and a number of other \nstates have already moved decisively: to a system of One-Stop service \ncenters where people can get all the information they need in one \nlocation. It will replace currently over-bureaucratized systems in many \nstates and localities with systems driven more by the needs of those \nwho utilize them. Adults seeking training will receive Individual \nTraining Accounts to give them direct control over their own careers. \nHigh quality labor market information will be accessible through the \nOne-Stops, and training providers will be required to report publicly \non their performance. Men and women will have the ability to make their \nown choices based on the best information about which profession they \nshould pursue, about the skills and training they'll need, and about \nthe best place to get those skills and that training.\n  This week in Minneapolis, concluding today, the U.S. Department of \nLabor and Minnesota's Department of Economic Security hosted a national \nconference on One-Stop Workforce centers. It is with some pride that I \nnote that my state has been a real leader in innovation with respect to \nOne-Stops. Minnesota has also been a national leader when it comes to \nworkforce system performance.\n  The conference bill ensures that states such as Minnesota, and the \nlocalities within them, can continue to innovate within the new system \ncreated. Good-performing service delivery areas will be allowed to \ncontinue to perform successfully. The same is true of current \ncollaborative one-stop structures and local workforce boards which \ncurrently successfully undertake a range of activities, such as what \nthe bill calls core services and training services. We have \nintentionally built flexibility into the bill.\n  Veterans will be served both in State-administered training programs \nand the national veterans workforce investment programs. Veterans also \nwill have a strong role in the policy processes established in the \nbill. Community-based organizations are assured an appropriate role in \nsetting policy. Labor organizations, too, retain a prominent role. \nCrucial provisions regarding the federal employment service are \nprotected.\n  Mr. President, it has been a very busy week. I have given longer \nspeeches on this topic in the past and may yet again. For now, I am \nextremely satisfied with our accomplishment in this bill. I hope we \nwill soon be able to celebrate its enactment.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Conference Report \non H.R. 1385, the Workforce Investment Act of 1998.\n  In a world where economic activity knows no national boundaries, it \nis crucial we ensure that we have the most knowledgeable and best \ntrained workers in the world.\n  As a member of the Conference Committee on H.R. 1385, I am pleased \nthat the Conference Agreement before us today will help us reach this \ngoal by streamlining and reforming job training, adult education, and \nvocational rehabilitation programs, while enhancing federal support and \ninvestment in these critical areas.\n  The Conference Agreement will help states implement a more coherent, \nperformance-driven system to ensure that Americans receive the training \nand education they need throughout their lives.\n  The Conference Agreement will streamline services by establishing a \none-stop delivery system; enhance accountability by requiring states, \nlocal boards, and training providers to meet higher performance \nmeasures; provide more reliable information on local career \nopportunities and training programs and providers; empower individuals \nto use individual training accounts to choose their own training \nprograms and providers; and increase flexibility to allow states and \nlocal areas to implement innovative job training programs.\n  I am also particularly pleased that this Conference Agreement \nincludes provisions which will benefit my home state of Rhode Island, \nsuch as preserving the state's successful service delivery area \nstructure.\n  In addition to job training reform, the Conference Agreement also \nimproves the accessibility and quality of adult literacy and education \nprograms. Indeed, more aggressive adult literacy programs are essential \nif we are to ensure that everyone in the workforce has an ability to \nread.\n  Lastly, the Conference Agreement reauthorizes the Rehabilitation Act \nof 1973. In doing so, it links vocational rehabilitation to the new \nworkforce system, while maintaining a separate funding stream for \nvocational rehabilitation. This will provide improved training and \nemployment services to individuals with disabilities.\n  I want to thank Chairman Jeffords, Senator Kennedy, Senator DeWine, \nand Senator Wellstone, and their staffs, for their efforts on this \nimportant legislation and for working with me to address issues \naffecting Rhode Island.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I now renew my unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PURPOSE.\n\n       It is the purpose of this legislation to clarify that major \n     league baseball players are covered under the antitrust laws \n     (i.e., that major league players will have the same rights \n     under the antitrust laws as do other professional athletes, \n     e.g., football and basketball players), along with a \n     provision that makes it clear that the passage of this Act \n     does not change the application of the antitrust laws in any \n     other context or with respect to any other person or entity.\n\n     SEC. 3.

(a) The conduct, acts, practices, or agreements \n     of persons in the business of organized professional major \n     league baseball relating to or affecting employment to play \n     baseball at the major league level are subject to the \n     antitrust laws to the same extent such conduct, acts, \n     practices, or agreements would be subject to the antitrust \n     laws if engaged in by persons in any other professional \n     sports business affecting interstate commerce: Provided, \n     however, That nothing in this subsection shall be construed \n     as providing the basis for any negative inference regarding \n     the caselaw concerning the applicability of the antitrust \n     laws to minor league baseball.\n       ``(b) Nothing contained in subsection (a) of this section \n     shall be deemed to change the application of the antitrust \n     laws to the conduct, acts, practices, or agreements by, \n     between, or among persons engaging in, conducting, or \n     participating in the business of organized professional \n     baseball, except the conduct, acts, practices, or agreements \n     to which subsection (a) of this section shall apply.

Mr. President, today I offer on behalf of myself and \nSenator Leahy, the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, an \namendment in the nature of a substitute to S. 53, the Curt Flood Act of \n1997. This bill, which was reported out of the Judiciary Committee on \nJuly 31, 1998, by a vote of 12-6, clarifies that the antitrust laws \napply to labor relations at the major league level, but does not have \nany affect on any other persons or circumstances. Given our limited \ntime, I will only make a few brief comments, and would ask unanimous \nconsent that my full statement be entered into the Record.\n  In a baseball season that is likely to set records in a number of \ndifferent categories, I am extremely pleased to be able to report that \na truly historic milestone in the history of professional baseball has \nbeen reached. People said it would never happen, but today I can tell \nyou that major league baseball players, along with both major and minor \nleague club owners, have reached an agreement on a bill clarifying that \nthe antitrust laws apply to major league professional baseball labor \nrelations. This agreed upon language is reflected in the substitute we \nare offering today.\n  With this historic agreement, I am confident that Congress will, once \nand for all, make clear that professional baseball players have the \nsame rights as other professional athletes, and will help assure \nbaseball fans across the United States that our national pastime will \nnot again be interrupted by strikes. With the home run battles and \nexciting pennant races, baseball is enjoying a resurgence. And, as fans \nare returning to the ballparks, they deserve to know that players will \nbe on the field, not mired in labor disputes. I am pleased that \nCongress will, it now appears, be able to help guarantee that this is \nthe case.\n  Due to an aberrant Supreme Court decision in 1922, labor relations in \nmajor league baseball have not been subject to antitrust laws, unlike \nany other industry in America. In every other professional sport, \nantitrust laws serve to stabilize relations between the team owners and \nplayers unions. That is one of the principal reasons why, in recent \nyears, baseball has experienced more work stoppages, including the \ndisastrous strike of 1994-95, than professional basketball, hockey and \nfootball combined.\n  In the 103d Congress, the House Judiciary Committee took the first \nimportant step by approving legislation which would have ensured that \nthe antitrust laws apply to major league baseball labor relations, \nwithout impacting the minor leagues or team relocation issues. During \nthe 104th Congress, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved and \nreported S. 627, The Major League Baseball Antitrust Reform Act, to \napply federal antitrust laws to major league baseball labor relations. \nNone of these bills were passed, however, as many Members of Congress \nwere reluctant to take final action while there was an ongoing labor \ndispute.\n  With the settling of the labor dispute and with the signing of a long \nterm agreement between the major league baseball team owners and the \nplayers union, the time was right this Congress finally to address this \nmatter. In fact, in the new collective bargaining agreement, the owners \npledged to work with the players to pass legislation that makes clear \nthat major league baseball is subject to the federal antitrust laws \nwith regard to owner-player relations.\n  At the beginning of this Congress, we introduced S. 53, a bill which \nwas specifically supported by both the players and owners and which was \nreported out of the Judiciary Committee almost exactly one year ago. At \nthe Committee markup, however, several Members indicated a concern that \nthe bill might\n\n[[Page S9496]]\n\ninadvertently have a negative impact on the Minor Leagues. Although \nboth Senator Leahy and myself were firmly of the view that the bill as \nreported adequately protected the minor leagues against such a \nconsequence, we pledged to work with the minor leagues' \nrepresentatives, in conjunction with the major league owners and \nplayers, to make certain that their concerns were fully addressed.\n  Although this process took much longer, and much more work, than I \nhad anticipated, I am pleased to report that it has been completed. I \nhave in my hand a letter from the minor leagues, and a letter co-signed \nby Don Fehr and Bud Selig, indicating that the major league players, \nand major and minor league owners, all support a new, slightly amended \nversion of S. 53. I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                          Professional Baseball Leagues, Inc.,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 1998.\n     Re baseball legislation.\n\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, Senate \n         Dirksen Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you know, the National Association of \n     Professional Baseball Leagues, Inc. (``NAPBL'') objected to \n     S. 53 as it was reported out of the Judiciary Committee last \n     year. Since that time, we have been consulted about proposals \n     to amend the bill to assure the continued survival of minor \n     league baseball. We understand that a draft of an amended \n     bill has been put forth by the major leagues and the Players' \n     Association (copy attached) that I believe addresses the \n     concerns of the NAPBL which we support in its final form.\n           Respectfully yours,\n     Stanley M. Brand.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 21, 1998.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch, Chairman,\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy: As requested by the \n     Committee, the parties represented below have met and agreed \n     to the attached substitute language for S. 53. In particular, \n     we believe the substitute language adequately addresses the \n     concerns expressed by some members of the Judiciary Committee \n     that S. 53, as reported, did not sufficiently protect the \n     interests of the minor leagues. We understand that the minor \n     leagues will advise you that they agree with our assessment \n     by a separate letter.\n       We thank you for your leadership and patience. Although, \n     obviously, you are under no obligation to use this language \n     in your legislative activities regarding S. 53, we hope that \n     you will look favorably upon it in light of the agreement of \n     the parties and our joint commitment to work together to \n     ensure its passage.\n       If you have any questions or comments, please do not \n     hesitate to contact us.\n           Sincerely,\n     Donald M. Fehr,\n       Executive Director, Major League Baseball Players \n     Association.\n     Allan H. ``Bud'' Selig,\n       Commissioner, Major League Baseball.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Office of the Commissioner,\n\n\n                                        Major League Baseball,\n\n                                                    July 21, 1998.\n     Donald M. Fehr, Esquire,\n     Executive Director and General Counsel, Major League Baseball \n         Players Association, New York, NY.\n       Dear Don: As you know, in our efforts to address the \n     concerns of the minor leagues with S. 53, as reported by the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee, several changes in the bill were \n     agreed to by the parties, i.e., the Major League Clubs, the \n     Major League Baseball Players Association and the National \n     Association of Professional Baseball Leagues (minor leagues). \n     Among those changes was the addition of the word ``directly'' \n     immediately before ``relating to'' in new subsection (a) of \n     the bill.\n       This letter is to confirm our mutual understanding that the \n     addition of that word was something sought by the Minor \n     leagues and is intended to indicate that this legislation is \n     not meant to allow claims by non major league players. By \n     using ``directly'' we are not limiting the application of new \n     subsection (a) to matters which would be considered mandatory \n     subjects of bargaining in the collective bargaining context. \n     Indeed, that is the reason we agreed to add paragraph (d)(3). \n     There is no question that, under this Act, major league \n     baseball players may pursue the same actions as could be \n     brought by athletes in professional football and basketball \n     with respect to their employment at the major league level.\n       I trust you concur with this intent and interpretation.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                   Allan H. Selig,\n                                         Commissioner of Baseball.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. This new bill specifically precludes courts from relying \non the bill to change the application of the antitrust laws in areas \nother than player-owner relations; clarifies who has standing under the \nnew law; and adds several provisions which ensure that the bill will \nnot harm the minor leagues.\n  Senator Leahy and I have incorporate these changes into our \nsubstitute, which, given its support across the board, we hope and \nexpect to be passed today without objection. I urge my colleagues to \nadopt this substitute.\n  This amendment, while providing major league players with the \nantitrust protections of their colleagues in the other professional \nsports, such as basketball and football, is absolutely neutral with \nrespect to the state of the antitrust laws between all entities and in \nall circumstances other than in the area of employment as between major \nleague owners and players. Whatever the law was the day before this \nbill passes in those other areas it will continue to be after the bill \npasses. Let me emphasize that the bill affects no pending or decided \ncases except to the extent a court would consider exempting major \nleague clubs from the antitrust laws in their dealings with major \nleague players.\n  But because of the complex relationship between the major leagues and \ntheir affiliated minor leagues, it was necessary to write the bill in a \nway to direct a court's attention to only those practices, or aspects \nof practices, that affect major league players. It is for that reason, \nthat a bill that ought to be rather simple to write goes to such \nlengths to emphasize its neutrality. And, although much of the Report \nfiled by the Committee with respect to S. 53 is still applicable to \nthis substitute, there have been some changes.\n  Section 2 states the bill's purpose. As originally contained in S. \n53, the purpose section used the word ``clarify\" instead of the word \n``state'' as used in this substitute. That language had been taken \nverbatim from the collective bargaining agreement signed in 1997 \nbetween major league owners and major league players. When the minor \nleagues entered the discussions, they objected to the use of the word \n``clarify'' on the grounds that using this term created an inference \nregarding the current applicability of the antitrust laws to \nprofessional baseball. The parties therefore agreed to insert in lieu \nthereof the word ``state.'' Both the parties and the Committee agree \nthat Congress is taking no position on the current state of the law one \nway or the other. It is also for that reason that subsection (b) was \ninserted, as will be discussed.\n  Section 3 amends the Clayton Act to add a new section 27. As was the \ncase with S.53, as reported, new subsection 27(a) states that the \nantitrust laws apply to actions relating to professional baseball \nplayers' employment to play baseball at the major league level and as \nin S.53 is intended to incorporate the entire jurisprudence of the \nantitrust laws, as it now exists and as it may develop.\n  In order to accommodate the concerns of the minor leagues however, \nnew subsection (a) has been changed by adding the word ``directly'' \nimmediately before the phrase ``relating to or affecting employment'' \nand the phrase ``major league players'' has been added before the \nphrase ``to play baseball.'' These two changes were also made at the \nbehest of the minor leagues in order to ensure that minor league \nplayers, particularly those who had spent some time in the major \nleagues, did not use new subsection (a) as a bootstrap by which to \nattack conduct, acts, practices or agreements designed to apply to \nminor league employment. This is in keeping with the neutrality sought \nby the Committee with respect to parties and circumstances not between \nmajor league owners and major league players.\n  Additionally, the new draft adds a new paragraph (d)(3) that states \nthat the term directly is not to be governed by interpretations of the \nlabor laws. This paragraph was added to ensure that no court would use \nthe word ``directly'' in too narrow a fashion and limit matters covered \nin subsection (a) to those that would otherwise be known as mandatory \nsubjects of bargaining in the labor law context. The use of directly is \nrelated to the relationship between the major leagues and\n\n[[Page S9497]]\n\nthe minor leagues, not the relationship between major league owners and \nplayers. Mr. President, I have a letter from the Commissioner of \nBaseball, Mr. Allan H. ``Bud'' Selig, to the Executive Director of the \nMajor League Baseball Players Association, confirming this \ninterpretation of the use of the word ``directly'' and I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be inserted in the Record at this time.\n  As in S. 53, as reported, new subsection (b) is the subsection which \nimplements the portion of the purpose section stating that the \n``passage of the Act does not change the application of the antitrust \nlaws in any other context or with respect to any other person or \nentity.'' In other words, with respect to areas set forth in subsection \n(b), whatever the law was before the enactment of this legislation, it \nis unchanged by the passage of the legislation. With the exception of \nthe express statutory exemption in the area of television rights \nrecognized in paragraph (d)(4), each of the areas set forth depend upon \njudicial interpretation of the law. But Congress at this time seeks \nonly to address the specific question of the application of the \nantitrust laws in the context of the employment of major league players \nat the major league level.\n  Thus, as to any matter set forth in subsection (b), a plaintiff will \nnot be able to allege an antitrust violation by virtue of the enactment \nof this Act. Nor can the courts use the enactment of this Act to glean \ncongressional intent as to the validity or lack thereof of such \nactions.\n  New subsection ``c'' deals specifically with the issue of standing. \nAlthough normally standing under such an act would be governed by the \nstanding provision of the antitrust laws, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 15, the minor \nleagues again expressed concern that without a more limited standing \nprovision, minor league players or amateurs would be able to attack \nwhat are in reality minor league issues by bootstrapping under this Act \nthrough subsection (a). The subsection sets forth the zone of persons \nto be protected from alleged antitrust violations by major league \nowners under this Act.\n  New paragraph (d)(1) defines ``person'' for the purposes of the Act, \nbut includes a provision expressly recognizing that minor league clubs \nand leagues are not in the business of major league baseball. This \naddition was requested by the minor leagues to ensure that they would \nnot be named as party defendants in every action brought against the \nmajor leagues pursuant to subsection (a).\n  New paragraph (d)(2) was added to give the courts direction in cases \ninvolving matters that relate to both matters covered by subsection (a) \nand to those matters as to which the Act is neutral as set forth in \nsubsection (b). In such a case, the acts, conducts or agreements may be \nchallenged under this Act as they directly relates to the employment of \nmajor league players at the major league level, but to the extent the \npractice is challenged as to its effect on any issue set forth in \nsubsection (b), it must be challenged under current law, which may or \nmay not provide relief.\n  New paragraph (d)(5) merely reflects the Committee's intention that a \ncourt's determination of which fact situations fall within subsection \n(b) should follow ordinary rules of statutory construction, and should \nnot be subject to any exceptions or departures from these rules.\n  As stated in the Committee Report, nothing in this bill is intended \nto affect the scope or applicability of the ``nonstatutory'' labor \nexemption from the antitrust laws. See, e.g., Brown v. Pro Football, \n116 S.Ct. 2116 (1996).\n  Before yielding to my good friend from Vermont, I would like to thank \nhim for his hard work on this bill. His bipartisan efforts have been \nvital to the process. I would also like to thank our original \ncosponsors, Senators Thurmond and Moynihan. I urge the quick adoption \nof this bill, which will help restore stability to major league \nbaseball labor relations.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this summer we are being treated to an \nexceptional season of baseball, from the record breaking pace of the \nNew York Yankees and the resurgence of the Boston Red Sox, to a number \nof inspiring individual achievements, including the perfect game of \nDavid Wells and the home run displays of McGwire, Griffey and Sosa. \nSuch are the exploits that childhood memories are made of--and which we \nall thought could be counted on, that is until the summer of 1994.\n  Now finally, after years of turmoil, major league baseball is just \nbeginning to emerge from the slump it inflicted upon itself, by \nreturning to that which makes the game great--the game and the players \non the field. And, last weekend, Larry Doby and others at long last \nwere inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. These are steps in the \nright direction.\n  Today, the Senate will give baseball another nudge in the right \ndirection by passing S. 53, the ``Curt Flood Act of 1998.'' Murray \nChass, a gifted reporter writing for The New York Times noted that on \nthis issue we have finally ``moved into scoring position with a bill \nthat would alter the antitrust exemption Major League Baseball has \nenjoyed since 1922.''\n  I am gratified that 76 years after an aberrant Supreme Court \ndecision, we are finally making it clear that with respect to the \nantitrust laws, major league baseball teams are no different than teams \nin any other professional sport. For years, baseball was the only \nbusiness or sport, of which I am aware, that claimed an exemption from \nantitrust laws, without any regulation in lieu of those laws. The \nSupreme Court refused to undue its mistake with respect to major league \nbaseball made in the 1922 case of Federal Baseball. Finally, in the \nmost well-known case on the issue, Flood v. Kuhn, the Court reaffirmed \nthe Federal Baseball case on the basis of the legal principle of stare \ndecisis while specifically finding that professional baseball is indeed \nan activity of interstate commerce, and thereby rejecting the legal \nbasis for the Federal Baseball case.\n  Mr. President, as a result of that and subsequent decisions, and with \nthe end of the major league reserve clause as the result of an \narbitrator's ruling in 1976, there has been a growing debate as to the \ncontinued vitality, if any, of any antitrust exemption for baseball. It \nis for precisely this reason that this bill is limited in its scope to \nemployment relations between major league owners and major league \nplayers. That is what is at the heart of turmoil in baseball and what \nis at the heart of the breach of trust with the fans that marked the \ncancellation of the 1994 World Series. At least we can take this small \nstep toward ensuring the continuity of the game and restoring public \nconfidence in it.\n  When David Cone testified at our hearing three years ago, he posed a \nmost perceptive question. He asked: If baseball were coming to Congress \nto ask us to provide a statutory antitrust exemption, would such a bill \nbe passed? The answer to that question is a resounding no. Nor should \nthe owners, sitting at the negotiating table in a labor dispute, think \nthat their anticompetitive behavior cannot be challenged. That is an \nadvantage enjoyed by no other group of employers.\n  The certainty provided by this bill will level the playing field, \nmaking labor disruptions less likely in the future. The real \nbeneficiaries will be the fans. They deserve it.\n  Mr. President, I just wanted to comment briefly on a couple of \nchanges made in the substitute from the bill as reported by the \nCommittee. First, the changes in the language in subsection (a) are not \nintended to limit in any way the rights of players at the major league \nlevel as they would be construed under the language of the bill as \nreported by the Judiciary Committee last July. The additional language \nwas added to ensure that a minor league player, or someone who had \nplayed at the major league level and returned to the minor leagues, \ncannot use subsection (a), concerned with play at the major league \nlevel, to attack what is really a minor league employment issue only. \nAlternatively, neither can the major leagues use the wording of \nsubsection (a) and that of subsection (d) to subvert the purpose of \nsubsection (a) merely by linking a major league practice with a minor \nleague practice. That linkage itself may be an antitrust violation and \nbe actionable under this Act. It cannot be used as a subterfuge by \nwhich to subject players at the major league level to acts, practices \nor agreements that teams or owners in other sports could not subject \nathletes to.\n\n[[Page S9498]]\n\n  Finally, the practices set forth in subsection (b) are not intended \nto be affected by this Act. While this is true, it should be remembered \nthat although the pure entrepreneurial decisions in this area are \nunaffected by the Act, if those decisions are made in such a way as to \nimplicate employment of major league players at the major league level, \nonce again, those actions may be actionable under subsection (a). More \nimportantly, we are making no findings as to how, under labor laws, \nthose issues are to be treated.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would like to thank all those involved \nin this undertaking: Chairman Hatch, of course, without whose unfailing \nefforts this result would not be possible; our fellow cosponsors, \nSenators Thurmond and Moynihan, and other members of our Committee; and \nJohn Conyers, the Ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, \nfor making this bill a priority. And I want to commend the interested \nparties for working to find a solution they can all support. Not only \nhave they done a service to the fans, but they may find, on reflection, \nthat they have done a service to themselves by working together for the \ngood of the game.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would be remiss if I did not comment on the \nman for whom this legislation is named, Curt Flood. He was a superb \nathlete and a courageous man who sacrificed his career for perhaps a \nmore lasting baseball legacy. When others refused, he stood up and said \nno to a system that he thought un-American as it bound one man to \nanother for his professional career without choice and without a voice \nin his future.\n  I am sad that he did not live long enough to see this day. In \ndeference to his memory and in the interests of every fan of this great \ngame, I hope that Congress will act quickly on this bill. I am \ndelighted that we are moving forward today and that we are finally able \nto enjoy the game once again.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, I understand that earlier today, Senator \nMurkowski introduced S. 2393. I now ask for its first reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill for the first \ntime.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2393) to protect the sovereign right of the \n     State of Alaska and prevent the Secretary of Agriculture and \n     the Secretary of the Interior from assuming management of \n     Alaska's fish and game resources.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask for its second reading and object \nto my own request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The bill will remain at \nthe desk.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. The bill will be read a second time on the next \nlegislative day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this is legislation regarding the State \nof Alaska's sovereign right to manage its fish and game resources.\n  The legislation will extend a current moratorium on the federal \ngovernment from assuming control of Alaska's fisheries for two years \nuntil December 1, 2000.\n  The language is similar to past moratoriums on this issue and is \nsimilar to language Congressman young added to the Interior \nAppropriations bill in the House, except that it is not conditioned \nupon action by the Alaska State Legislature.\n  To every one of my colleagues their respective state's right to \nmanage fish and game is absolute--every other state manages its own \nfish and game.\n  In Alaska, this is not the case, and therefore, action must be taken \nto maintain the sovereign right of our state.\n  Mr. President, Title VIII of the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act (ANILCA) requires the State of Alaska to provide a \nrural subsistence hunting and fishing preference on federal ``public \nlands'' or run the risk of losing its management authority over fish \nand game resources.\n  If the State fails to provide the required preference by state \nstatute, the federal government can step in to manage federal lands.\n  The Alaska State Legislature passed such a subsistence preference law \nin 1978 which was upheld by referendum in 1982.\n  The law was slightly revised in 1986, and remained on the books until \nit was struck down by the Alaska Supreme Court in 1989 as \nunconstitutional because of the Alaska Constitution's common use of \nfish and game clause.\n  At that time, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of \nAgriculture took over management of fish and game resources on federal \npublic lands in Alaska.\n  In 1995 a decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Katie \nJohn v. United States extended the law far beyond its original scope to \napply not just to ``federal lands,'' but to navigable waters owned by \nthe State of Alaska. Hence State and private lands were impacted too.\n  The theory espoused by the Court was that the ``public lands'' \nincludes navigable waters in which the United States has reserved water \nrights.\n  If implemented, the court's decision would mean all fisheries in \nAlaska would effectively be managed by the federal government.\n  Indeed in April of 1996, the Departments of the Interior and \nAgriculture published an ``advance notice of proposed rulemaking'' \nwhich identified about half of the state as subject to federal \nauthority to regulate fishing activities.\n  These regulations were so broad they could have affected not only \nfishing activities, but virtually all activities on state and federal \nlands that may have an impact on subsistence uses.\n  There is no precedent in any other state in the union for this kind \nof overreaching into state management prerogatives.\n  For that reason Congress acted in 1996 to place a moratorium on the \nfederal government from assuming control of Alaska fisheries.\n  That moratorium has twice been extended and is set to expire December \n1, 1998.\n  The State's elected leaders have worked courageously to try and \nresolve this issue by placing an amendment to the state constitution \nthat would allow them to come into compliance with the federal law and \nprovide a subsistence priority.\n  Unfortunately, the State of Alaska's constitution is not easily \namended and these efforts have fallen short of the necessary votes \nneeded to be placed before the Alaska voters.\n  In fact, the legislature--the elected representatives of the people--\nin the most recent special session indicated that they were not \nsupportive of amending the State Constitution and putting the issue to \na vote of the people.\n  Therefore we once again are in a position where we have no other \nalternative than to extend the moratorium prohibiting a federal \ntakeover of Alaska's fisheries.\n  The bill I am introducing today will accomplish this. It extends the \ncurrent moratorium through December 1, 2000.\n  I believe this will provide the State's elected leaders the needed \ntime to work through this dilemma as they cannot finally resolve the \nmatter of amending the State Constitution until November 2000.\n  Mr. President, I do not take this moratorium lightly.\n  I, along with most Alaskans, believe that subsistence uses of fish \nand game should have a priority over other uses in the state.\n  We have provided for such uses in the past, I hunted and fished under \nthose regulations and I respected and supported them and continue to do \nso now. I believe the State can again provide for such uses without \nsignificant interruption to the sport or commercial fisherman.\n  I also believe that Alaska's rural residents should play a greater \nrole in the management and enforcement of fish and game laws in Alaska.\n  They understand and live with the resources in rural Alaska. They see \nand experience the fish and game resources day in and day out. And, \nthey are most directly impacted by the decisions made about use of \nthose resources.\n  They should bear their share of the responsibility for formulating \nfish and game laws as well enforcing fish and game laws.\n  It is my hope that the State will soon provide for Alaska's rural \nresidents to have this greater role while at the same time resolving \nthe subsistence dilemma once and for all.\n  But until that happens, I cannot stand by and watch the federal \ngovernment move into the State and assume control of the Alaska fish \nand game resources.\n  I have lived under territorial status and it does not work. In 1959 \nAlaskan's\n\n[[Page S9500]]\n\ncaught just 25.1 million salmon. Under State management we caught 218 \nmillion salmon in 1995.\n  Federal control would again be a disaster for the resources and those \nthat depend on it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9499-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--CONFERENCE REPORT TO ACCOMPANY H.R. 4059\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 872) to establish rules governing product \n     liability actions against raw materials and bulk component \n     suppliers to medical device manufacturers, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the effort to pass legislation dealing \nwith biomaterials has been a long fight. I want to thank Senator \nLieberman, and Congressman Gekas for their extraordinary leadership and \nhard work on the issue. It has been a great privilege and honor working \nwith them over the past several years to gain passage of this vital \nlegislation.\n  I want to stress to my colleagues the importance of passing the \nBiomaterial Access Assurance Act. Over seven million lives depend upon \nan ample and reliable supply of medical devices and implants, such as \npace makers and brain shunts.\n  Unfortunately, the supply of these life-saving products is in serious \ndanger. Those who provide the raw materials from which medical implants \nare fashioned have been dragged into costly litigation over claims of \ndamage from the finished product. This is the case even though such \nsuppliers are not involved in the design, manufacture or sale of the \nimplant. Many suppliers are unwilling to expose themselves to this \nenormous and undue risk. This bill will extend appropriate protection \nto raw material suppliers, while assuring that medical implant \nmanufacturers will remain liable for damages caused by their products. \nIt would permit suppliers of biomaterials to be quickly dismissed from \na lawsuit if they did not manufacture or sell the implant and if they \nmet the contract specifications for the biomaterial.\n  Mr. President, as my colleagues are aware, the bill's provisions do \nnot extend to suppliers of silicone gel and silicone envelopes used in \nsilicone gel breast implants.\n  I want to be quite clear this ``carve-out'' as it's been called, is \nintended to have no effect on tort cases related to breast implants. \nThe question of whether and to what degree silicone breast implants are \nhazardous is a determination that must be made by scientific experts. \nThe question of whether and to what degree raw material suppliers are \nor are not liable is a determination that the courts must render.\n  Determining the safety or efficacy of a medical device is not the \nfunction of the Senate nor the United States Congress. This is not our \nrole and nothing in this legislation should be construed otherwise. So, \nthe exemption should not be interpreted as a judgement about silicone \nbreast implants.\n  Our goal in this regard remains simply to ensure that this \nlegislation draws no conclusion about and has no impact upon pending \nsuits.\n  Finally, I would like to mention that this exemption should not be \nconsidered an invitation for additional carve-outs or exemptions for \nother raw material or component part suppliers.\n  I do not wish to see suppliers, who trusting in the protections of \nthis act, return to the medical device manufacturing marketplace only \nto find themselves again targeted as deep pockets in tort actions, and \nthereby threaten the supply of life saving products. I appreciate the \nopportunity to make this very important point about a bill vital to \npublic health.\n  This is an important piece of legislation and it will make a great \ndifference to millions of Americans.\n  Mr. President, I would now like to enter into a colloquy with the \ndistinguished Senator from Wisconsin regarding several aspects of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to express my concern regarding \nthree provisions of the Biomaterials Access Assurance Act of 1998. \nAlthough I have broader concerns with the bill including federalism \nissues, consumer protection issues, and evidentiary issues, I would \nlike clarification from one of the sponsors of the bill, Senator \nMcCain, on three specific points.\n  First, Section 7(a) the language reads that only ``after entry of a \nfinal judgment in an action by the claimant against a manufacturer'' \ncan a claimant attempt to implead a biomaterials supplier. I am \nconcerned that this could be interpreted to mean that the manufacturer \nmust lose the underlying suit before the claimant may implead the \nsupplier. Is this correct?\n  Mr. McCAIN. No. Although I do not believe that the situation you pose \ncould happen very often--specifically that a supplier could be liable \nwhen the manufacturer is not--the language should be interpreted to \nmean that the claimant could bring a motion to implead the supplier \nwhether or not the manufacturer is found liable in the underlying case, \nas long as the judgment is final.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Second, I am concerned that there would not be a \nsufficient introduction of evidence demonstrating the liability of the \nsupplier in the underlying suit against the manufacturer for the court \nto make an independent determination that the supplier was an actual \nand proximate cause of the harm for purposes of the impleader motion as \nrequired in Sections 7(1)(A) and 7(2)(A) of the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Under current FDA regulations and under current tort law, \nthe manufacturer is responsible for the entire product they produce, \nincluding defects in the raw materials. Therefore, the claimant may \nenter evidence in the underlying action against the manufacturer \nregarding defect in the biomaterials used.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Finally, I am concerned that in a case where the \nmanufacturer has gone bankrupt, the claimant will be unable to recover \nfrom the liable party. Does your bill address this issue?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes it does. Section 7(a)(2)(B) provides that in a case \nwhere the claimant is unlikely to recover the full amount of its \ndamages from the manufacturer, if the other requirements of Section 7 \nare satisfied, the claimant can bring an action against the supplier. \nThis covers bankruptcy and other scenarios where the manufacturer \ncannot satisfy an adverse judgment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Senator McCain, I thank the Senator for addressing my \nconcerns.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the bill we \nare about to take up and vote upon, the Biomaterials Access Assurance \nAct. I am proud to have co-sponsored the Senate version of this bill \nwith Senator McCain. We have worked together on this bill for a number \nof years now, and it is quite gratifying to see it now about to move \ntoward enactment.\n  Mr. President, the Biomaterials bill is the response to a crisis \naffecting more than 7 million Americans annually who rely on \nimplantable life-saving or life-enhancing medical devices--things like \npacemakers, heart valves, artificial blood vessels, hydrocephalic \nshunts, and hip and knee joints. They are at risk of losing access to \nthe devices because many companies that supply the raw materials and \ncomponent parts that go into the devices are\n\n[[Page S9501]]\n\nrefusing to sell them to device manufacturers. Why? Because suppliers \nno longer want to risk having to pay enormous legal fees to defend \nagainst product liability suits when those legal fees far exceed any \nprofit they make from supplying the raw materials for use in \nimplantable devices.\n  Let me emphasize that I am speaking here about--and the bill \naddresses--the suppliers of raw materials and component parts--not \nabout the companies that make the medical devices themselves. The \nmaterials these suppliers sell--things like resins and yarns--are \nbasically generic materials that they sell for a variety of uses in \nmany, many different products. Their sales to device manufacturers \nusually make up only a very small part of their markets--often less \nthan one percent. As a result--and because of the small amount of the \nmaterials that go into the implants--many of these suppliers make very \nlittle money from supplying implant manufacturers. Just as importantly, \nthese suppliers generally have nothing to do with the design, \nmanufacture or sale of the product.\n  But despite the fact that they generally have nothing to do with \nmaking the product, because of the common practice of suing everyone \ninvolved in any way with a product when something goes wrong, these \nsuppliers sometimes get brought into lawsuits claiming problems with \nthe implants. One company, for example, was hauled into to 651 lawsuits \ninvolving 1,605 implant recipients based on a total of 5 cents worth of \nthat company's product in each implant. In other words, in exchange for \nselling less than $100 of its product, this supplier received a bill \nfor perhaps millions of dollars of legal fees it spent in its \nultimately successful effort to defend against these lawsuits.\n  The results from such experiences should not surprise anyone. Even \nthough not a single biomaterials supplier has ultimately been held \nliable so far--let me say that again: Not a single biomaterials \nsupplier has ultimately been held liable so far--the message \nnevertheless is clear for any rational business. Why would any business \nstay in a market that yields them little profit, but exposes them to \nhuge legal costs? An April 1997 study of this issue found that 75 \npercent of suppliers surveyed were not willing to sell their raw \nmaterials to implant manufacturers under current conditions. That study \npredicts that unless this trend is reversed, patients whose lives \ndepend on implantable devices may no longer have access to them.\n  What is at stake here, let me be clear, is not protecting suppliers \nfrom liability and not even just making raw materials available to the \nmanufacturers of medical devices. Those things in and of themselves \nmight not be enough to bring me here. What is at stake is the health \nand lives of millions of Americans who depend on medical devices for \ntheir every day survival. What is at stake are the lives of children \nwith hydrocephalus who rely on brain shunts to keep fluid from \naccumulating around their brains. What is at stake are the lives of \nadults whose hearts would stop beating without implanted automatic \ndefibrillators. What is at stake are the lives of seniors who need \npacemakers because their hearts no longer generate enough of an \nelectrical pulse to get their heart to beat. Without implants, none of \nthese individuals could survive.\n  We must do something soon to deal with this problem. We simply cannot \nallow the current situation to continue to put at risk the millions of \nAmericans who owe their health to medical devices.\n  Senator McCain, and I and the bill's sponsors in the House have \ncrafted what we think is a reasonable response to this problem. Our \nbill would do two things. First, with an important exception I'll talk \nabout in a minute, the bill would immunize suppliers of raw materials \nand component parts from product liability suits, unless the supplier \nfalls into one of three categories: (1) the supplier also manufactured \nthe implant alleged to have caused harm; (2) the supplier sold the \nimplant alleged to have caused harm; or (3) the supplier furnished raw \nmaterials or component parts that failed to meet applicable contractual \nrequirements or specifications.\n  Second, the bill would provide suppliers with a mechanism for making \nthat immunity meaningful by obtaining early dismissal from lawsuits. By \nguaranteeing suppliers in advance that they will not face needless \nlitigation costs, this bill should spur suppliers to remain in or come \nback to the biomaterials market, and so ensure that people who need \nimplantable medical devices will still have access to them.\n  Now, it is important to emphasize that in granting suppliers \nimmunity, we would not be depriving anyone injured by a defective \nimplantable medical device of the right to compensation for their \ninjuries. Injured parties still will have their full rights against \nanyone involved in the design, manufacture or sale of an implant, and \nthey can sue implant manufacturers, or any other allegedly responsible \nparty, and collect for their injuries from them if that party is at \nfault.\n  We also have added a new provision to this version of the bill, one \nthat resulted from lengthy negotiations with representatives of the \nimplant manufacturers, the American Trial Lawyers Association--ATLA--\nthe White House and others. This provision responds to concerns that \nthe previous version of the bill would have left injured implant \nrecipients without a means of seeking compensation if the manufacturer \nor other responsible party is bankrupt or otherwise judgment-proof. As \nnow drafted, the bill provides that in such cases, a plaintiff may \nbring the raw materials supplier back into a lawsuit after judgment if \na court concludes that evidence exists to warrant holding the supplier \nliable.\n  Finally, let me add that the bill does not cover lawsuits involving \nsilicone gel breast implants.\n  In short, Mr. President, the Biomaterials bill is--and I am not \nengaging in hyperbole when I say this--potentially a matter of life and \ndeath for the millions of Americans who rely on implantable medical \ndevices to survive. This bill would make sure that implant \nmanufacturers still have access to the raw materials they need for \ntheir products, while at the same time ensuring that those injured by \nimplants are able to get compensation for injuries caused by defective \nimplants. This is a good bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read a third time and passed; that the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table; and that any statements relating to the bill be \nplaced at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 872) was considered read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9500-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9501-S9504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          IDENTITY THEFT AND ASSUMPTION DETERRENCE ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, Senator Kyl has a substitute amendment \nat the desk, and I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords], for Mr. Kyl, for \n     himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. DeWine, \n     Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. \n     Harkin, Mr. Warner, Mr. Murkowski and Mr. Robb, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3480.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the purpose of this bill, ``The Identity \nTheft and Assumption Deterrence Act'', is to address one of the fastest \ngrowing crimes in America, identity theft. Losses related to identity \ntheft have nearly doubled in the last two years. Today, 95% of \nfinancial crimes arrests involve identity theft. Trans Union, one of \nthe country's three major credit bureaus, says calls to its fraud \ndivision have risen from 3,000 a month in 1992 to nearly 43,000 a month \nthis year. This is more than a troubling trend. Indeed, with increasing \nfrequency, criminals--sometimes part of an international criminal \nsyndicate--are misappropriating law-abiding citizens' identifying \ninformation such as names, birth dates, and social security numbers. \nAnd while the results of the theft of identification information can be \ndevastating for the victims, often costing a citizen thousands of \ndollars to clear his credit or good name, today the law recognizes \nneither the victim nor the crime.\n  The bill, as reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee, does \nboth. It recognizes the crime by making it unlawful to steal personal \ninformation and enhancing penalties against identity thiefs. It \nrecognizes victims by giving them the ability to seek restitution for \nall costs involved in restoring lost credit and reputation. In \naddition, my bill provides real time relief to victims by directing the \nFederal Trade Commission to set up a centralized complaint center to \nprovide information to consumers, refer cases to law enforcement, \nofficially acknowledge complaints, and relay that acknowledgment to \ncredit bureaus.\n  And while section 1028 of title 18 currently prohibits the production \nand possession of false identification documents, it does not make it \nillegal to steal or possess another person's personal information. By \namending section 1028, this bill will help current law keep pace with \ncriminals' exploitation of information technology.\n  The substitute I am offering today with Senators Leahy, Hatch, \nFeinstein along with Senators DeWine, D'Amato, Grassley, Abraham, \nFaircloth, Harkin, Warner, Murkowski, and Robb reflects two small but \nimportant improvements over the bill reported out of committee. Both \nchanges were recommended by the Department of Justice. First, the \nsubstitute further refines the scope of the offense and applicable \npunishments by deleting the term ``possession'' from the offense and \npenalty sections of the reported bill. As explained by the Department, \nthe term ``possession'' is overbroad as applied to identity theft \noffense added to the criminal code by this legislation. The second \nchange simply adds standard forfeiture procedure to the existing \ncriminal forfeiture penalty in the reported bill. Without a procedure \nattending the forfeiture penalty, the Department considers this penalty \nunenforceable.\n  There are numerous private entities and federal law enforcement \nagencies that supported and contributed to this bill through its \nredraftings to its present form that I would like to thank.\n  On the private side, thank yous go to the American Bankers \nAssociation, the Associated Credit Bureaus, Visa and Mastercard, the \nAmerican Society of Industrial Services, and the United States Public \nInterest Research Group.\n  Public agencies which lent important support to this legislative \neffort are the: Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Trade \nCommission, and the U.S. Postal Inspectors. Special thanks goes to the \nSecret Service and the Department of Justice for the great deal of time \nand effort they have expended to help make this bill the well drafted \npiece of legislation it is today.\n  In conclusion, I also thank Senators Leahy, Hatch and Feinstein for \nlending their valuable support and input to this bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today is \nadopting the Kyl-Leahy substitute amendment to S. 512, the ``Identity \nTheft and Assumption Deterrence Act.''\n  Protecting the privacy of our personal information is a challenge, \nespecially in this information age. Every time we obtain or use a \ncredit card, place a toll-free phone call, surf the Internet, get a \ndriver's license or are featured in Who's Who, we are leaving virtual \npieces of ourselves in the form of personal information, which can be \nused without our consent or even our knowledge. Too frequently, \ncriminals are getting hold of this information and using the personal \ninformation of innocent individuals to carry out other crimes. Indeed, \nU.S. News & World Report has called identity theft ``a crime of the \n90's''.\n  The consequences for the victims of identity theft can be severe. \nThey can have their credit ratings ruined and be unable to get credit \ncards, student loans, or mortgages. They can be hounded by creditors or \ncollection agencies to repay debts they never incurred, but were \nobtained in their name, at their address, with their social security \nnumber or driver's license number. It can take months or even years, \nand agonizing effort, to clear their good names and correct their \ncredit histories. I understand that, in some instances, victims of \nidentity theft have even been arrested for crimes they never committed \nwhen the actual perpetrators provided law enforcement officials with \nassumed names.\n  The new legislation provides important remedies for victims of \nidentity theft. Specifically, it makes clear that these victims are \nentitled to restitution, including payment for any costs and attorney's \nfees in clearing up their credit histories and having to engage in any \ncivil or administrative proceedings to satisfy debts, liens or other \nobligations resulting from a defendant's theft of their identity. In \naddition, the bill directs the Federal Trade Commission to keep track \nof consumer complaints of identity theft and provide information to \nvictims of this crime on how to deal with its aftermath.\n  This is an important bill on an issue that has caused harm to many \nAmericans. It has come a long way from its original formulation, which \nwould have made it an offense, subject to 15 years' imprisonment, to \npossess ``with intent to deceive'' identity information issued to \nanother person. I was concerned that the scope of the proposed offense \nin the bill as introduced would have resulted in the federalization of \ninnumerable state and local offenses, such as the status offenses of \nunderage teenagers using fake ID cards to gain entrance to bars or to \nbuy cigarettes, or even the use of a borrowed ID card without any \nillegal purpose. This problem, and others, were addressed in the Kyl-\nLeahy substitute that was reported out of the Committee and further \nrefined in the substitute amendment the Senate considers today.\n  Since Committee consideration of this bill, we have continued to \nconsult with the Department of Justice to improve the bill in several \nways. Most significantly, the Kyl-Leahy substitute amendment \nappropriately limits the scope of the new offense governing the illegal \ntransfer or use of another person's ``means of identification'' to \nexclude ``possession.'' This change ensures that the bill does not \ninadvertently subject innocuous conduct to the risk of serious federal \ncriminal liability. For example, with this change, the bill would no \nlonger raise the possibility of criminalizing the mere possession of \nanother person's name in an address book or Rolodex, when coupled with \nsome sort of bad intent.\n  At the same time, the substitute restores the nuanced penalty \nstructure of section 1028, so that it continues to treat most other \npossessory offenses involving identification documents and document-\nmaking implements as misdemeanors. Thus, in the substitute, the use or \ntransfer of 1 or more means of\n\n[[Page S9504]]\n\nidentification that results in the perpetrator receiving anything of \nvalue aggregating $1,000 or more over a 1-year period, would carry a \npenalty of a fine or up to 15 years' imprisonment, or both. The use or \ntransfer of another person's means of identification that does not \nsatisfy those monetary and time period requirements, would carry a \npenalty of a fine and up to three years' imprisonment, or both.\n  Finally, again with the support of the Department of Justice, we \nspecified the forfeiture procedure to be used in connection with \noffenses under section 1028. The bill as reported created a forfeiture \npenalty for these offenses; the addition of a procedure simply \nclarifies how that penalty is to be enforced.\n  I am glad that Senator Kyl and I were able to join forces to craft \nlegislation that both punishes the perpetrators of identity theft and \nhelps the victims of this crime.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is with pleasure that I rise today in \nsupport of S. 512, the ``Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act \nof 1998.'' This measure has bipartisan support, and I am pleased to be \nan original co-sponsor along with Senators Leahy, Feinstein, DeWine, \nD'Amato, Grassley, Abraham, Faircloth, Harkin, Warner, Murkowski and \nRobb.\n  Identity information theft is a crime that destroys the lives of \nthousands of innocent people each year. It occurs when an imposter, who \nhas falsified or stolen personal information from another individual, \nuses the information to make financial transactions or conduct personal \nbusiness in the name of another. This heinous crime often leaves \nvictims with mountains of debt, ruins their credit history, and makes \nit difficult for the individuals to obtain employment. In short, it \nvirtually takes over the lives of innocent citizens who find themselves \ntrying to untangle an endless trail of obligations they did not make or \nactions they did not commit.\n  Many of you know individuals who have been victims of this crime. \nThese are people whose lives have been destroyed because a con-artist \ngained access to and used their personal data, such as their address, \ndate of birth, mother's maiden name, or social security number. This is \ninformation that you and I are asked to verify every day in our \nsociety. Once that information is obtained, these con-artists use it to \nopen bank and credit card accounts and to obtain bank and mortgage \nloans. These fake business and personal commitments and obligations can \nruin a lifetime of hard work.\n  Currently, the applicable federal statute, Title 18 United States \nCode Section 1028, only criminalizes the possession, transfer, or \nproduction of identity documents. In other words, you have to catch the \nculprit with the actual documents in order to bring a prosecution for \nfraud. Obviously, such criminals are not always going to keep these \ndocuments once they have acquired the information they need. Many times \ncriminals simply misappropriate the information itself to facilitate \ntheir criminal activity.\n  As there is no specific statute criminalizing the theft of the \ninformation, when and if these criminals are prosecuted, law \nenforcement must pursue more indirect charges such as check fraud, \ncredit card fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, or money laundering. \nUnfortunately, these statutes do little to compensate the victim or \naddress the horror suffered by the individual whose life has been \ninvaded. Often these general criminal statutes treat only affected \nbanks, credit bureaus, and other financial institutions as the victim, \nleaving the primary victim, the innocent person, without recourse to \nreclaim his or her life and identity.\n  S. 512 recognizes not only that it is a crime to steal personal \ninformation, and enhances penalties for such crimes, but it also \nrecognizes the person, whose information has been stolen, as the real \nvictim. Moreover, it gives the victim the ability to seek restitution \nand relief.\n  I believe this bill to be an important piece of legislation. It is \nsupported by federal law enforcement agencies, credit bureaus, banking \nassociations, and other private entities. I urge all of my colleagues \nto join us and support the passage of this bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor \nof the substitute version of S. 512, The Identity Theft and Assumption \nDeterrence Act of 1998, which the Senate is considering today.\n  On May 20, the Senate Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on \nTechnology, Terrorism, and Government Information, on which I serve as \nRanking Member, heard from victims of identity theft from both \nSubcommittee Chairman Kyl's and my home states. The victims told \ncautionary tales of lives suddenly, and without warning, turned upside \ndown by the crime of identity theft.\n  Theirs are not isolated stories. The Secret Service last year made \nnearly 9,500 identity theft-related arrests, totaling three-quarters of \na billion dollars in losses to individual victims and financial \ninstitutions. Such losses have nearly doubled in the last two years, \nand no end to the trend is in sight. In one out of every ten of these \ncases, identity theft is used to violate immigration laws, to illegally \nenter the country or to flee across international borders.\n  It used to be that identity theft required wading through dumpsters \nfor discarded credit card receipts. Today, with a few keystrokes, a \ncomputer-savvy criminal can hack into databases and lift credit card \nnumbers, social security numbers, and a myriad of personal information.\n  The Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act does two critical \nthings in the war on identity theft: it gives prosecutors the tools \nthey need, and it recognizes that identity theft victimizes \nindividuals.\n  Prosecutors tell us that they lack effective tools to prosecute \nidentity theft and to make victims whole. S. 512 has been drafted in \nconsultation with prosecutors to give them the tools they need. S. 512 \ndoes so in a number of important ways:\n  It updates pre-computer age laws to criminalize electronic identity \ntheft;\n  It stiffens penalties and adds sentencing enhancements that \nprosecutors tell us they need to effectively prosecute crimes; and\n  It allows law enforcement agents to seize equipment used to \nfacilitate identity theft crimes.\n  Earlier this month, the Senate Judiciary Committee passed the \nVictim's Rights Amendment to the Constitution, of which I was also \nproud to be an original cosponsor. Similarly, S. 512 for the first time \nrecognizes that individuals, and not just credit card companies, are \nvictims of identity theft, and it provides them with proper \nrestitution. It protects victims rights, fully recognizing individuals \nas victims of identity theft, establishing remedies and procedures for \nsuch victims, and requiring restitution for the individual victim.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation, and I \nurge my Senate colleagues to pass it.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3480) was agreed to.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall take effect on October 1, 1998.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, S. 314, originally sponsored by Senators \nThomas, among others, and Congressman Duncan in the House, was ordered \nreported by the Governmental Affairs Committee on July 15, 1998. The \noriginal S. 314 has had long and contentious past. The bill reported by \nour Committee represents months of drafting and redrafting to create \nlanguage which truly represents a consensus.\n  I commend the original sponsors of this bill for their dedication to \nthis issue and their willingness to accommodate the Governmental \nAffairs Committee's changes in order to develop legislation which could \nbe supported by all sides. Interested industry groups\n\n[[Page S9506]]\n\nhave expressed their support of this legislation. And the \nAdministration and the Federal employee unions, although opposed to the \noriginal S. 314, all have indicated they will not object to this \nlegislation.\n  S. 314 would require Federal agencies prepare a list of activities \nthat are not inherently governmental functions that are being performed \nby Federal employees, submit that list to OMB for review, and make the \nlist publicly available. It also would establish an ``appeals'' process \nwithin each agency to challenge what is on the list or what is not \nincluded on the list. S. 314 also would create a statutory definition--\nidentical to current regulation--for what is an ``inherently \ngovernmental function'' that must be performed by the government and \nnot the private sector.\n  S. 314 adheres to the seven principles the Administration outlined in \nits testimony to this Committee. It reflects recommendations made by \nthe General Accounting Office in testimony to this and other \ncommittees. And it provides a statutory basis for longstanding \nadministrative policy.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read a third time and passed, as amended; that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; that the title amendment be agreed \nto; and that any statements relating to the bill appear at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 314) was considered read the third time and passed.\n  The title was amended so as to read:\n\n       ``A bill to provide a process for identifying the functions \n     of the Federal Government that are not inherently \n     governmental functions, and for other purposes.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9504-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9506-S9510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BORDER IMPROVEMENT AND IMMIGRATION ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING AUTHORIZATION OF \n                   APPROPRIATIONS FOR BORDER CONTROL AND \n                   ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES OF THE UNITED STATES \n                   CUSTOMS SERVICE.\n\n       Given that the Customs Service is cross-designated to \n     enforce immigration laws and given the important border \n     control role played by the Customs Service, it is the sense \n     of the Senate that authorization for appropriations should be \n     granted to the Customs Service similar to those granted to \n     the Immigration and Naturalization Service under section 6.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3481\n\n              (Purpose: To provide a complete substitute)\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Senator Abraham has a substitute amendment at the desk, \nand I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] for Mr. Abraham, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3481.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3481) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to remark on final passage \nof an important piece of legislation, the Border Improvement and \nImmigration Act of 1998. I am very pleased that we have been able to \nwork together to produce a bill that the Senate can pass by unanimous \nconsent.\n  The substitute amendment makes a number of improvements on the \ncommittee-reported version. I have worked particularly closely with \nSenators Gramm and Kyl to include provisions that would provide \nauthorization for significant additional resources for the inspections \nand drug enforcement operations of the United States Customs Service at \nthe land borders. These resources would help ease traffic and trade \nback-ups and would detect and deter drug trafficking. It is my hope \nthat they be deployed on a fair basis among the northern and the \nsouthern border ports.\n  Senator Kyl and I have also worked closely with the State Department \nand with the Immigration and Naturalization Service to make sure that \nmodifications were made in the implementation of border crossing \nimprovements so that local communities, particularly in Arizona, would \nnot be unduly harmed by laws and regulations that could not be \nimplemented without keeping travelers from visiting, shopping, and \ndoing business in the United States.\n  I spoke at length on this legislation in the Judiciary Committee, and \nthat Committee produced a full report on the difficulties that would be \nfaced if Section 110 of the Illegal Immigration and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996 were not modified. I do not want to repeat \nmyself here, but would like to comment briefly on some of the key \nissues.\n  The legislation first addresses the so-called Section 110 problem. \nSection 110 of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act requires the INS to develop, by September 30, 1998, \nan automated entry and exit control system to document the entry and \ndeparture of ``every alien'' arriving in and leaving the United States. \nThe problem is that the term ``every alien'' could be interpreted to \ncover all aliens entering at land borders and seaports, which are \npoints of entry where entry-exit control has not been in place. My \nlegislation exempts land borders and seaports from coverage of the \nsystem, and instead requires the Attorney General to submit a detailed \nfeasibility report to Congress on what full entry-exit control would \ninvolve, what it would cost, and what burdens it would impose on our \nStates and our constituents. This is simply a sensible and responsible \napproach.\n  The other provisions in the bill include reporting requirements on \ndata obtained from the entry-exit control system that would be in \noperation at\n\n[[Page S9508]]\n\nairports, provisions to fix some serious problems that are being \nexperienced on the Southern border with the issuance of the new \nbiometric ``laser visas''--which I know is of great concern to Senator \nKyl and others on the Southern border--and authorization for additional \nCustoms and INS resources for border inspections and enforcement.\n  I will say a bit more about the Section 110 problem because that is \nthe provision that is most important to me. Implementing Section 110 at \nthe land borders is essentially impossible at the moment. No one--not \nINS, not the State Department, and not anyone in Congress--has come up \nwith a feasible way of implementing such a system at the land borders.\n  At a hearing before the House Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims \njust last week, testimony was heard from a private sector technology \ncompany that developing feasible technology to implement Section 110 \nwould require ``substantial'' time, ``ultimately long lead times'', and \n``significant resources,'' none of which the company could specify with \nany precision given the absolutely monumental nature of the task. \nCommenting on the sheer size of the database that would be needed to \ncontain the number of visitor entry and exit records that would in \ntheory be collected and entered into the system by the INS, Ann Cohen, \nVice President of the EDS Corporation, testified, ``to put some \nperspective on the magnitude of this number, the information in this \nsystem at the end of one year would be equal to the amount of data \nstored in the U.S. Library of Congress.''\n  In the Senate, we heard testimony at an earlier subcommittee hearing \nthat if this system were implemented with just a 30-second inspection \nrequired for every border crosser, backups at the Ambassador Bridge in \nDetroit would immediately exceed 24 hours. That would be unbearable, \nand the border would effectively be closed. The impact would be \nimmediate and would be staggering. The U.S. automobile industry alone \nconducts $300 million in trade with Canada everyday. I learned in \nMichigan that there are 800 employees of the Detroit Medical Center who \ncommute from Canada every day and who would no longer be available to \nprovide medical care to Michiganians. Tourism would be seriously \nharmed, families with members on each side of the land borders would be \nharmed, and our international relations with Canada and Mexico would \nlikewise be seriously damaged.\n  To add to this, Congress did not have the chance to fully consider \nthe question of entry-exit control at the land borders, as opposed to \njust at airports, because the final language of Section 110 appeared \nfor the first time only in the Conference Report. Senator Simpson and \nChairman Smith acknowledged in letters to the Canadian Embassy \nfollowing passage of the 1996 Act that they did not intend Section 110 \nto impose additional documentary burdens on Canadian border crossers.\n  The outpouring against this provision has been enormous. I would like \nto just mention a few. The approach this legislation takes is supported \nby the National Governors Association, the Republican Governors \nAssociation, Americans for Better Borders, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, the American \nTrucking Association, Ford, Chrysler, and GM, the Travel Industry \nAssociation of America, and many, many businesses, State and local \ngovernments and other organizations.\n  It is not enough to delay implementation of this requirement. The \nGovernors and others have spoken loud and clear against delaying the \neffective date of this requirement on the grounds that the States, \nbusinesses, and families who would be affected by this would have no \nidea what would be imposed on them when. This is not a case of \npressuring the INS or anyone else to come up with a plan that will \nwork. The fact is that the only ones who will be pressured are my \nconstituents--and many of my colleagues' constituents--and that is \nunacceptable.\n  Once we get the report from the Attorney General, we can consider all \nthe options and make a collective decision of where and how we would \nlike entry-exit control to be implemented. But it would simply be \npreposterous and irresponsible for us to keep a requirement in the law \nwhen we cannot say how it could possibly be met in any way and at what \ncost.\n  Finally, as the Judiciary Committee noted in its report on the \nlegislation, Section 110 has ``nothing to do with stopping terrorists \nor drug traffickers.'' I appreciate very much my colleagues' \nunderstanding of this issue, and their support of a rational approach \nthat comprehends the important distinctions between hindering \nbeneficial trade, travel, and tourism and taking affirmative steps to \nconquer illegal drug trafficking or other activities at the land \nborders. I am also pleased that this legislation includes additional \nlaw enforcement resources so that these important law enforcement \nissues can be addressed in the right way. This truly is a border \nimprovement bill in all senses.\n  I owe a particular gratitude to all of my colleagues who cosponsored \nthe legislation, particularly those who worked with me from the outset, \nincluding Senators Kennedy, D'Amato, Leahy, Grams, Dorgan, Collins, \nMurray, and Snowe. I very much appreciate their efforts and support.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President. I am pleased that after many months of \ndebate, the Senate has finally passed S. 1360 today. This bill, ``The \nBorder Improvement and Immigration Act of 1998,'' will ensure that free \ntrade and tourism continue to flourish along our nation's borders. It \nwill preserve the status quo for our friendly neighbors to the north \nand will provide us with the necessary time to study and develop an \nappropriate way to monitor our nation's borders and sea ports.\n  I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of S. 1360 and have spoken \nrepeatedly about the need for this remedy. Without this type of \nlegislation, the Immigration and Naturalization Service might be \nobligated to begin implementing an enormously expensive automated \nentry-exit monitoring system at all of our nation's borders this fall \nwithout having the opportunity to study the situation and develop a \nworkable system. The passage of this legislation means the Attorney \nGeneral will now have one year to study and report to Congress on the \nfeasibility of various means of tracking the entry and exit of \nimmigrants crossing our country's land borders.\n  Over the past year, I have worked hard to ensure that this \nlegislation does not negatively impact the thousands of people and the \nmillions of dollars of trade which cross our borders each day. This \nbill preserves the integrity of our open border with Canada and ensures \nthat no additional burden is placed upon Canadians who plan to shop or \ntravel in the United States. Mexican nationals will also have \nadditional time under this bill to acquire new border crossing cards \nand will be able to obtain border crossing cards for their children \nunder age 15 at a reduced cost. Vermonters and others who cross our \nnation's land borders on a daily basis to work or visit with family or \nfriends in Canada and Mexico should be able to continue to do so \nwithout additional border delays.\n  The Border Improvement Act also takes a more thoughtful approach to \nmodifying U.S. immigration policies than that contained in section 110 \nof the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act \n(``IIRIRA''). By requiring an automated system for monitoring the entry \nand exit of ``all aliens'', section 110 would subject Canadians, and \nothers who are not currently required to show documentation, to \nunprecedented border checks at U.S. points of entry. This sort of \ntracking system would be enormously costly to implement along the \nborders, especially since there is no current infrastructure in place \nto track the departure of individuals leaving the United States at our \nland borders or sea ports. Section 110, as currently worded, would also \nlead to excessive and costly traffic delays for those living and \nworking near the borders. That is why I am so pleased that we were able \nto pass this legislation today to remedy this situation.\n  Instead of requiring the INS to implement such a costly and \nburdensome border tracking system with little forethought, S. 1360 \nmandates that the Attorney General conduct a study over the next year \nof the feasibility of various automated monitoring systems. This study \nwill include an assessment of the potential costs and impact of any new \nautomated monitoring system\n\n[[Page S9509]]\n\non trade and travelers along the country's land borders and seaports. \nAn entry-exit monitoring system at our nation's airports will still be \nimplemented within the next two years.\n  The Border Improvement Act also authorizes additional funds to ensure \nthat adequate staffing and the newest equipment is available for INS \nand Customs agents along both borders. S. 1360 authorizes nearly $120 \nmillion in fiscal year 1999 for INS enforcement and inspection \nequipment and personnel, and an additional $160 million for the U.S. \nCustoms Service to acquire similar equipment and hire additional \nagents. The Customs Service is authorized to hire 535 inspectors and 60 \nspecial agents along the Southwest border and 375 inspectors along the \nNorthern border. The INS is authorized to hire 535 and 375 inspectors \nfor the Southwest and Northern border, respectively, under this bill. \nThese additional resources will help these agencies in their \ninvestigations of drug and alien smuggling and should reduce traffic \nwaiting times along the borders.\n  Overall, the Border Improvement and Immigration Act of 1998 is a \nsensible means of correcting the problematic language in section 110 of \nthe IIRIRA while ensuring better tracking of aliens who overstay their \nvisas.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, tonight the United States Senate has \nprevented a disaster on the Northern border of the United States by \npassing S. 1360, the Border Improvement and Immigration Act of 1997. I \nam proud to be a co-sponsor.\n  On September 28, 1996, the Senate passed the Omnibus Consolidated \nAppropriations Act, a 749-page bill with twenty-four separate titles. \nOne small section of that bill, buried deep in the text, has been the \nsubject of much consternation in northern New York. The provision, \nknown as Section 110, requires the Immigration and Naturalization \nService to develop a system to document the entry and departure of \nevery alien entering and leaving the United States. Contrary to \nCongressional intent, the legislative language does not recognize the \ncurrent practice of allowing most Canadian and American nationals to \ncross the border without registering any documents. Such an oversight \nis not uncommon in this type of omnibus bill that is hurried to passage \nin the final days of a legislative session.\n  If implemented, an automated entry-exit control system along the \nnorthern border would likely result in long delays at the border, \nhampering tourism and trade. This is not an inconsequential matter. The \nUnited States-Canadian trade relationship is the world's largest, \ntotaling $272 billion in 1995. Compare this to $256 billion in trade \nwith the entire European Union and $188 billion in trade with Japan \nduring that same period.\n  The unnecessary border crossing delays which would surely result from \nthe implementation of Section 110 would negatively affect our dynamic \ntrading relationship with our Northern neighbor and would wreak havoc \nwith the flow of traffic at the border. Each year, more than eight \nmillion trucks cross the eastern United States-Canada border carrying a \nvariety of goods to market. Additionally, the Eastern Border \nTransportation Coalition has estimated that 57 million cars crossed \nthat region in 1995. Sixty percent of these were day trips--people \ncrossing the border to go to school or work, attend cultural events, \nshop, visit friends, and the like. The remaining forty percent of auto \nborder crossings were by vacationers making significant contributions \nto both nations' economies. Might I note that visitors from the U.S. \ncomprise the largest single group of vacationers in Canada and \nCanadians are the largest single non-U.S. group of vacationers in \nFlorida.\n  It was not the intent of Congress to interfere with the vibrant \ntrading relationship that we enjoy with our Canadian friends. On \nDecember 18, 1996, Representative Lamar S. Smith and then-Senator Alan \nK. Simpson sent a letter to Canadian Ambassador Raymond Chretien to \nassure him of this fact, writing that ``we did not intend to impose a \nnew requirement for border crossing cards or I-94's on Canadians who \nare not presently required to possess such documents.'' Thankfully, \ntonight this ambiguity has been resolved by this body.\n  By passing this bill and exempting land border crossings from the \nautomated entry-exit control system created under Section 110, we have \nprevented what could have been a catastrophe at the Canadian border.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, S. 1360, the ``Border Improvement and \nImmigration Act of 1998'' sponsored by Senator Abraham requires an \nentry-exit system at air ports by the year 2000 and requires a \nfeasibility study of an entry-exit system for land and sea ports within \na year. However, it does not address all the problems for which Section \n110 of the 1996 Act was intended. I hope that during conference, we can \nimprove the bill by mandating a workable deadline for creating an \nentry-exit system at all land and sea ports.\n  Section 110 of the 1996 Immigration Act requires an automated entry-\nexit system by October 1, 1998. It also requires the Attorney General \nto identify visa overstays, making the system an integrated part of \ndata collection by the INS.\n  The purpose of Section 110 in current law is to fix the problem which \nexists now. INS says that in FY96, over 24 million non-immigrants came \ninto the U.S. INS also says that they are ``unable to calculate \noverstay rates on nonimmigrants in general or for particular \nnationalities.'' INS also told my staff that they ``do not have an \nestimate'' of the average length of overstay for nonimmigrants or know \nthe ``destinations of nonimmigrants''.\n  The purpose of Section 110 is to make sure INS has the ability, by \nbuilding an integrated data system at all ports of entry--including \nair, sea and land ports of entry, in order to know who is coming into \nthe country and who is leaving and more importantly, who is breaking \nthe law by overstaying.\n  INS estimates that there are over 5 million illegal aliens in this \ncountry and 41% of the illegal alien population is due to visa \noverstays--that these aliens failed to depart. (source: 1996 \nStatistical Yearbook of INS).\n  In the 1997 report, the INS Inspector General concluded that \ncurrently, INS has no real ability to identify the characteristics of \nthe visa overstays which could be used in developing an enforcement \nstrategy that effectively targets visa overstays. It also found that \ncapturing entry-exit information only at airports reveals information \nabout 10% of the nonimmigrants in this country who come through \nairports. The other 90% come and leave through sea and land ports and \ntherefore, are unknown if there is no entry-exist system at those \nports.\n  INS' inability to identify visa overstays has greater significance \nwhen we add the fact that there are over 4- 5-million border crossing \ncards which have been issued since 1940's.\n  Having an integrated entry-exit system at the land borders is \ncritical in keeping track of all nonimmigrants, those with visas and \nborder crossing cards, providing valuable information for law \nenforcements, not only to deport visa overstays but in prosecuting \nthose drug runners who provide a critical link into the heartland of \nAmerica.\n  Time has come to fully implement the 1996 Immigration Act. I hope \nthat during conference, we can find a workable deadline for INS to \ncreate an entry-exit system at both sea and land ports. Doing a \nfeasibility study is helpful in planning the implementation but without \ntough mandates to install entry-exit systems--while drug runners go \nback and forth freely at the Southwest border without law enforcement's \nknowledge, and while potential terrorists slip in easily through the \nCanadian border--is not the intent of Section 110 when Congress passed \nthe 1996 Immigration Act last year.\n  Thank you Mr. President and I ask unanimous consent that this \nstatement be printed in the Record after the text of S. 1360.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 3731, which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3731) to designate the auditorium located \n     within the Sandia Technology Transfer Center in Albuquerque, \n     New Mexico, as the ``Steve Schiff Auditorium.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is a real honor today to support \nlegislation, H.R. 3731, honoring Representative Steve Schiff. This \nlegislation designates a special auditorium at the Sandia National \nLaboratories as the ``Steve Schiff Auditorium.'' Steve spoke in this \nAuditorium on several occasions, as part of his long service to the \npeople of New Mexico.\n  Steve Schiff exemplified all that was good about public service: \nintegrity of the highest order, deep and fundamental decency, and an \nacute and open mind. He went about his business quietly, but with \nwonderful efficiency. He was great at telling stories, usually about \nhimself. He was a model for all politicians to admire.\n  Steve came to New Mexico from Chicago, where he was born and raised. \nHe served the people of New Mexico in different capacities since 1972, \nwhen he graduated from the Law School at the University of New Mexico. \nBefore election to Congress in 1988, he served as District Attorney for \neight years.\n  One of Steve's favorite local programs was his Tree Give-Away \nProgram. For eight years, Steve held a Saturday tree give-away day at \nthe Indian Pueblo Cultural Center. He gave away more than 115,000 \ntrees. Through those trees, he shared his own hope, faith, and love. \nThose trees now flourish throughout the Albuquerque area in New Mexico \nas lasting symbols of this man. In a similar way, his legislative \nachievements continue to serve the American people as another reminder \nof this great American.\n  Along with those trees and his legislation, the Steve Schiff \nAuditorium will serve as a lasting memorial. I'm happy and honored to \nhave been a part of his life.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read a third time, and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any Statements relating to the bill be \nplaced at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3731) was considered read the third time and passed.\n\n\n                      COMMERCIAL SPACE ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

To date, very few states have the ability \n     to do so without engaging the academic institutions within \n     their boundaries. In order to develop a market for the \n     commercial sector, the states must have the capacity to fully \n     utilize the technology.\n       (b) Amendments.--The Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992 \n     is amended--\n       (1) in section 2 (15 U.S.C. 5601)--\n       (A) by amending paragraph (5) to read as follows:\n       ``(5) Commercialization of land remote sensing is a near-\n     term goal, and should remain a long-term goal, of United \n     States policy.'';\n       (B) by striking paragraph (6) and redesignating paragraphs \n     (7) through (16) as paragraphs (6) through (15), \n     respectively;\n       (C) in paragraph (11), as so redesignated by subparagraph \n     (B) of this paragraph, by striking ``determining the design'' \n     and all that follows through ``international consortium'' and \n     inserting in lieu thereof ``ensuring the continuity of \n     Landsat quality data''; and\n       (D) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:\n       ``(16) The United States should encourage remote sensing \n     systems to promote access to land remote sensing data by \n     scientific researchers and educators.\n       ``(17) It is in the best interest of the United States to \n     encourage remote sensing systems whether privately-funded or \n     publicly-funded, to promote widespread affordable access to \n     unenhanced land remote sensing data by scientific researchers \n     and educators and to allow such users appropriate rights for \n     redistribution for scientific and educational noncommercial \n     purposes.'';\n       (2) in section 101 (15 U.S.C. 5611)--\n       (A) in subsection (c)--\n       (i) by inserting ``and'' at the end of paragraph (6);\n       (ii) by striking paragraph (7); and\n       (iii) by redesignating paragraph (8) as paragraph (7); and\n       (B) in subsection (e)(1)--\n       (i) by inserting ``and'' at the end of subparagraph (A);\n       (ii) by striking ``, and'' at the end of subparagraph (B) \n     and inserting in lieu thereof a period; and\n       (iii) by striking subparagraph (C);\n       (3) in section 201 (15 U.S.C. 5621)--\n       (A) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``National Security.--'' in \n     subsection (b);\n       (B) in subsection (b)(1), as so redesignated by \n     subparagraph (A) of this paragraph--\n       (i) by striking ``No license shall be granted by the \n     Secretary unless the Secretary determines in writing that the \n     applicant will comply'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``The \n     Secretary shall grant a license if the Secretary determines \n     that the activities proposed in the application are \n     consistent'';\n       (ii) by inserting ``, and that the applicant has provided \n     assurances adequate to indicate, in combination with other \n     information available to the Secretary that is relevant to \n     activities proposed in the application, that the applicant \n     will comply with all terms of the license'' after ``concerns \n     of the United States''; and\n       (iii) by inserting ``and policies'' after ``international \n     obligations'';\n       (C) by adding at the end of subsection (b) the following \n     new paragraph:\n       ``(2) The Secretary, within 6 months after the date of the \n     enactment of the Commercial Space Act of 1997, shall publish \n     in the Federal Register a complete and specific list of all \n     information required to comprise a complete application for a \n     license under this title.

Mr. President, the federal government should be encouraging \nprivate industry's involvement and investment in space, not competing \nwith it and in some cases, stifling it. I am afraid that if we do not \nact on and pass this amendment, we will continue to encourage American \ncompanies to move their operations overseas. Companies need consistent \ngovernment policy that encourages the development of new technology \nthrough private investment. We should enable private companies to \nlocate and conduct their business here at home.\n  This growing sector of the economy provides jobs to many highly-\nskilled and technically-trained workers. To put it into perspective, \nindustry revenues have exceeded $7.5 billion. Commercial space \nbusinesses have grown faster than the economy and have been relatively \nrecession proof.\n  Senator Graham and I have proposed a number of balanced changes to \ncurrent law. Among them, our amendment requires a study by NASA to \nidentify commercial opportunities and interest in servicing the \nInternational Space Station. Second, we authorize the Office of \nCommercial Space Transportation to license commercial providers to re-\nenter Earth's atmosphere and return payloads to Earth. Currently, only \nthe Federal Government is permitted to do so.\n  Third, we encourage the President to enter into regional agreements \nwith foreign governments to secure the U.S. Global Positioning System \nas the world's standard. Finally, we require the federal government to \nprocure commercial space transportation services.\n  Space is a frontier for research and exploration. The Federal \nGovernment's investments in space technology have provided the private \nsector with impressive capabilities that can benefit both our citizens \nand the economy. It is now the private sector's challenge to make \ncommercial space activities earn a profit. The role of the Federal \nGovernment should be to provide stable and supportive policies for \nthese activities.\n  Mr. President, we are moving into the 21st century. However, the laws \nregulating this industry are decades old. It is critical that we update \nthem. The Senate Commerce Committee reported this bill favorably on \nJune 2, 1998, and the House passed a similar version on November 4, \n1997. I hope it will receive broad, bipartisan support.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to, the committee substitute be agreed to, as \namended, the bill be considered read a third time and passed, as \namended, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill appear at the appropriate place in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3482) was agreed to.\n  The committee amendment, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 1702), as amended, was considered read the third time \nand passed.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity to address \nthe Senate on the passage of the ``Commercial Space Act,'' introduced \nby Senator Mack and myself in November 1997.\n\n[[Page S9516]]\n\n  I am pleased this bill has passed today because it is critical in \nallowing United States launch companies to compete effectively in the \ngrowing commercial space race.\n  Having already passed the House by a large margin, the Commercial \nSpace Act needed to be considered by the Senate. I was pleased to work \nwith my colleagues to ensure the future of our nation's high-tech \neconomic frontier: commercial space.\n  I speak to you today as a Senator concerned about both our national \nsecurity and our nation's economic position. The United States cannot \nafford to descend into another ``launch gap.'' Our recent discussions \nover why U.S. satellites are being launched from China demands that the \nU.S. Senate act quickly to make the commercial launch environment in \nthis country as progressive and productive as possible.\n  When the space race began with the launch of Sputnik in October 1957, \nAmerican citizens listened in indignation and fear as the first man-\nmade satellite--a Soviet satellite--beeped its way around the earth. In \nthe two decades that followed, an aggressive U.S. space program, both \ncivil and military, brought our country back to its rightful lead in \ntechnology by putting a man on the moon and securing many other \nachievements in space.\n  But there is no denying that today, the United States preeminence in \ncommercial space is threatened. If you were to step back in time 30 \nyears to the nation's premier launch facility, Cape Canaveral, you \nwould have seen a forest of launch vehicles ready on the pads. Visit \nour launch facilities today and you will see under-utilized launch \nfacilities while at the same time U.S. commercial companies struggle to \ndevelop new space vehicles under constraints of outdated laws and \npolicies.\n  A recent aerospace survey predicts over 2,000 satellites will be \nlaunched into earth orbit over the next decade. The good news is that \nthe U.S. government and American companies may launch up to 65 percent \nof those payloads if the Commercial Space Act is implemented. The bad \nnews is that many commercial satellite companies are already looking to \nforeign countries for launch services due to the restrictive \nenvironment in which they must operate in the United States and the \nlack of available launch vehicles.\n  In other words, Mr. President, while our space industry is rapidly \npreparing for the 21st Century, federal policy in dealing with this \nimportant source of economic activity is stuck on the launch pad.\n  The single most important provision of the Commercial Space Act is an \namendment to the Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984 that gives the \nfederal government the authority to license commercial space re-entry \nactivities. In short: what goes up, must come down.\n  Can you imagine the Wright Brothers flight at Kitty Hawk ever being \nmade if the government told them, ``Sure you can fly it, just don't \nland.'' The way the law presently exists, commercial companies can \nlaunch but cannot land any vehicle returning from space. Only the U.S. \ngovernment is allowed this privilege.\n  This provision must be changed to allow the development of future \ngenerations of spacecraft, such as the Reusable Launch Vehicle. This is \nthe business of space: providing services, repeat services, to \nentrepreneurs. We must regulate in an efficient and expeditious manner \nto support this growing market.\n  That brings me to my next point: this bill, to borrow from Neil \nArmstrong, will take a giant leap in clarifying complex and sometimes \ndivergent commercial space licensing requirements in federal agencies. \nBy streamlining the regulations and licensing, we will allow commercial \ncompanies to raise capital, develop business plans, and create job \nopportunities that might otherwise go overseas.\n  Mr. President, U.S. commercial space industry faces a number of \ncompetitors from abroad. The most serious are the Russian Proton, the \nChinese Long March, and the European Space Agency Ariane rockets \nlaunched from French Guiana in South America. But this is not a \ncomprehensive list. There are numerous competitors who would be more \nthan happy to see the U.S. commercial launch industry locked in a web \nof regulations and limitations.\n  I am proud to report that one thing our bill does not do is spend any \nnew taxpayer dollars. As a policy bill, we are seeking to level the \nplaying field without creating any new government programs. Our bill \ndoes require studies, but those studies will be accomplished using the \nexisting resources of agencies involved and data that has already been \ncollected.\n  For instance, our legislation would require the Department of Defense \nto conduct an inventory of its range assets and determine what, if any, \ndeficiencies exist. Much of this information is already available \nthrough existing Defense Department reports. Armed with this \ninformation, we can convert our nation's launch ranges back to the \nbusiest space facilities in the world.\n  But this legislation does more than just refrain from new spending. \nIt actually saves money by allowing the conversion of excess ballistic \nmissiles into space transportation vehicles. Due to the START treaty, \nthese missiles can no longer be used for their original intended \npurpose. Furthermore, they are extremely expensive to store or destroy.\n  By using these missiles as launch vehicles, the government will be \nable to launch small scientific and educational payloads that cannot \nafford the larger and more expensive rocket systems. This is a legal \nand efficient way to dispose of an expensive asset. Our Russian \ncounterparts have been firing their missiles as opposed to spending \nmoney to destroy them. We will implement one more practical step by \nfiring them with a payload.\n  In closing, let me remind you of remarks that President John F. \nKennedy made in the midst of the hotly contested space race. During one \nof his visits to Cape Canaveral, President Kennedy declared, ``We \nchoose to go the moon in this decade and do the other things, not \nbecause they are easy, but because they are hard.''\n  As we consider this bill, we should all ponder that quote. It is not \neasy for the federal government to change the way it has done business \nfor many years. It is hard; it is a challenge, for forward-thinking \npeople both in and out of the government. But it is what we must do to \nprotect our investment in the nation's economic future and our national \npride. It is vital that we ensure our nation's position in the \ncommercial space race of the 21st century.\n  I thank the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate \nCommerce Committee Senator McCain and Senator Hollings, and the \nChairman of the Science, Technology, and Space Subcommittee Senator \nFrist for supporting this legislation and guiding it through the Senate \nprocess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/30/senate-section/article/S9510-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9516-S9519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nRay Bramucci for the position of Assistant Secretary of Employment and \nTraining in the Department of Labor.\n  Mr. President, I have known Ray for many years. He is a man of \nenormous integrity, deep commitment to public service, and is ready and \nanxious to take up his responsibilities at the Department of Labor. Ray \nhas a passion for making things better, and believes strongly in \nlifelong education and job training for our youth, especially our \ndisadvantaged youth. He will give this job his full measure. I urge the \nSenate to move rapidly to confirm him.\n  A leading figure in New Jersey politics and public affairs, Ray's \nexpertise in labor-management relations, job training initiatives, \nemployment services, and policy development provides a solid foundation \nfor overseeing the administration of agency programs as Assistant \nSecretary. From 1990 to 1994, Mr. Bramucci served as Commissioner of \nthe New Jersey Department of Labor. In this position, he was a key \ncabinet member and principal advisor to the Governor on matters of both \nstatewide and national impact, particularly in regard to economic \ndevelopment, education and training, and labor relations.\n\n[[Page S9519]]\n\n  Mr. Bramucci also served as Chief Executive Officer of the New Jersey \nDepartment of Labor, an agency charged with workforce training and \npreparation, protecting workers from exploitation, and providing income \nsecurity through benefit programs for injured, ill, and unemployed \nworkers. While in office, he successfully created and implemented a \nnumber of ground breaking initiatives, including the Workforce \nDevelopment Partnership, a program which has helped to train and \nupgrade worker skills since July 1992 and is training over 15,000 \nworkers today. He helped to establish the nation's first state-funded \nprogram to provide extended unemployment benefits to workers who had \nexhausted their regular claims, as well as the New Jersey State \nEmployment and Training Commission and the Employment Security Council, \ntwo national leaders in reforming and revitalizing the worker security \nsystem.\n  To the position of Assistant Secretary, he would also bring the \nskills he acquired in his 22 years of service as part of the \nInternational Ladies' Garment Workers' Union. During this time, he rose \nfrom shop floor worker to eventually become the senior executive and \nkey negotiator for the Union, in which he played a central role in \nnegotiating hundreds of individual and industry-wide contracts.\n  From 1979 to 1990, he was Director of New Jersey Operations for our \nformer colleague, Bill Bradley. Ray was the eyes and ears for Senator \nBradley in New Jersey, and a key adviser to him on political and policy \nmatters. It was during this period that I got to know Ray well, and \nthen when he served as Labor Commissioner. In recognition of his many \naccomplishments, he has been named to the Executive Board of CDS \nInternational, Inc., the Commission Board of the New Jersey Black \nAchievers Program of Business and Education, and President of the New \nJersey Caucus Education Corporation.\n  Mr. President, the Assistant Secretary for Employment and Training is \ncharged with directing Department programs and ensuring that programs \nfunded through the agency are free from unlawful discrimination, fraud, \nand abuse. Ray Bramucci has the experience and commitment to assume \nthese responsibilities with sensitivity and skill. He will make an \nexceptional Assistant Secretary. I thank my colleagues for confirming \nRay Bramucci so he can get on with the job.\n\n\n nomination of patrick T. henry to be assistant secretary of the army \n                    for manpower and reserve affairs\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am delighted to support the nomination of \nPatrick T. Henry to be the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower \nand Reserve Affairs.\n  P.T. Henry has served on the staff of the Armed Services Committee \nfor the last five years. Before that, he had a distinguished career on \nactive duty in the Marine Corps and in the Office of the Secretary of \nDefense, as well as serving as the Chief of Staff of the American Red \nCross here in Washington.\n  Mr. President, I can't think of a better person to serve in this \nimportant position. P.T. Henry has played a key role in virtually every \nDefense manpower and personnel issue in the last two decades. Whether \nthe issue is quality of life issues, military pay and benefits \nquestions, recruiting and retention, or military health care, the \nUnited States Senate and the men and women of our armed forces have \nbenefitted tremendously from the advice and counsel of P.T. Henry.\n  I know that every member of the Armed Services Committee agrees with \nme that P.T.'s expertise in the area of Defense manpower and personnel \nissues is exceeded only by his commitment to the welfare of the men and \nwomen of the armed forces and their families. I am disappointed that \nP.T. will be leaving the Armed Services Committee staff, but I am \ndelighted and proud that he will be moving to such an important \nposition in the Defense Department.
