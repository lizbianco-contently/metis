Mr. President, in November 1994, the American voters sent \na clear message to Washington that resulted in a watershed election and \nthe first Republican Congress in 40 years. That message was to enact a \ntaxpayers' agenda of balancing the budget, limiting the size and scope \nof Government, and returning tax dollars and power to the taxpayers.\n  Two years ago today, the House of Representatives was marking day 76 \nof its unprecedented 100-day effort to carry out the taxpayers' agenda \nreflected in the Contract With America. They kept their promise to the \nAmerican people by bringing all 10 provisions of the contract up for a \nvote and passing almost all of them.\n  In 1996, despite an unprecedented assault by the media, hostile \nspecial interest groups, and the big tax and spenders in Washington, \nthe Republican majorities in Congress were preserved, indeed, even \nincreased here in the Senate. The voters once again sent the message \nthat they wanted the taxpayers' agenda enacted, but they wanted \nCongress and the President to come together in completing the work \nstarted in the 104th Congress.\n  Yet somehow this message has been misinterpreted by a number of my \nRepublican colleagues, who seem to have come away from the 1996 \nelections with the mistaken notion that the effort to pass the \ntaxpayers' agenda should be stalled or delayed. What concerns me most \nis that some of the loudest calls for retreating from that agenda are \ncoming from within our own party leadership. This is not the same \nRepublican majority that arrived in Washington in January 1995, ready \nto create fundamental change in a government that had enslaved so many \nworking families for so many years. It is like the ancient Vikings who \nsometimes burned their boats after arriving in a new land. We stepped \nonto the shore\n\n[[Page S2576]]\n\nand claimed there was no turning back to the era of big Government and \nhigher taxes. We were determined that Washington would never be the \nsame once we passed the taxpayers' agenda into law.\n\n  Today, it appears some of my colleagues are wishing they had their \nboats back.\n  Mr. President, I have tremendous respect and admiration for my friend \nand colleague from Georgia, the Speaker of the House. As a freshman \nMember of the House in the 103d Congress, I worked with Newt Gingrich, \nTim Hutchinson, and others in making the $500-per-child tax credit the \ncenterpiece of the Republican budget alternative in 1994. I was honored \nthat Mr. Gingrich included our tax cut in the Contract With America, \ncreating a platform on which I ran and won election to the Senate.\n  That said, you can imagine how disappointed, and even a little \nsaddened, I was to read his comments in the newspapers this week, when \nhe was quoted as endorsing the suggestion that plans for a major tax \ncut be temporarily shelved.\n  With all due respect to the Speaker, such a retreat would be a \nhorrible mistake.\n  Mr. President, it was 2 years ago this week that the Speaker wrote a \ncommentary for the Wall Street Journal he titled ``The Contract's Crown \nJewel.'' The crown jewel in this case was our package of tax cuts \naround which our balanced budget legislation was crafted, and the \nSpeaker was its most vocal supporter.\n  ``The bill proposes fundamental change in the relationship between \nthe American government and the American citizenry,'' wrote the \nSpeaker, ``and is the plainest assertion we have yet made of the key \nprinciple underlying the Contract With America.\n  ``Simply put,'' he went on to say, ``the bill says this: `The \nAmerican government's money does not belong to the American government. \nThat money belongs to Americans, and it's time to give Americans some \nof their own money back.'''\n  Mr. President, I realize those words were written before the \nGovernment shutdowns, before the thrashing the Republicans took in the \npress, before the special interests waged a guerilla war of lies and \ndistortions against us. Even so, those words were true in March 1995 \nand are no less true in March 1997. The only thing that has changed \nduring these past 2 years is that courage has been supplanted by \ntimidity and lions have turned into lambs.\n  It was disheartening to read in the Washington Times on Tuesday that \npopular radio host Michael Reagan, son of the former President, was \ndenouncing his ties to the Republican Party. The Times quoted him as \nsaying:\n\n       The Republican Party has forgotten grassroots America, they \n     are not talking to grassroots America, not paying attention \n     to grassroots America. Until the Republican Party remembers \n     it won the election and acts like a winner and not a loser, I \n     find myself as an independent.\n\n  I wonder how many other Americans are feeling equally abandoned?\n  The Washington Post this week carried the comments of a senior \nRepublican aide in the House who suggested we were, quote, ```just \ndrifting' on budget and tax issues because many Republican leaders were \nunwilling to stick their necks out.'' Well, that is how it feels here \nsome days. Imagine how it must feel to the millions of American \ntaxpayers who are outside the insulation of the Washington Beltway.\n  Two years ago, we promised them tax relief. Congress delivered, but \nour hard work fell victim to a Presidential veto. So the American \npeople were denied the tax relief that we promised in 1995--enacted and \npassed in our legislation; vetoed by the President. They were again \ndenied tax relief in 1996. And now, the leaders of our party--our \nmajority party, the party of the taxpayers, of families, the working \nclass--are suggesting that the American people will not get tax cuts \nthis year, either. And I say to them, you ought to be ashamed.\n  Believe it or not, Mr. President, when I am back home in Minnesota, \npeople do not stop me on the street to tell me how grateful they are we \nfailed to enact the $500-per-child tax credit, or how grateful they are \nwe cut the capital gains tax, or that we were unable to enact estate \ntax relief. No, the Minnesotans who stop me are angry and they are \ndisappointed, because when they ask, ``Where are the tax cuts you \npromised?'' They are really asking ``when are you going to do what you \nwere elected to do?''\n  The folks here in Washington seem to have forgotten there are two \nparts to every promise: the making, and the keeping. The politicians \nhave never had a problem with the making, but they have a great deal to \nlearn about the keeping. And Mr. President, this is one issue that all \ncomes down to keeping promises.\n  To go back on our promises now would deprive average American \ntaxpayers of the leadership they voted for in 1994 and 1996, and say we \nwere wrong in staking our claim on the side of the taxpayers and \nagainst big government. More importantly, it will deprive us of our \nbiggest and most important constituency--and that is the hardworking, \nmiddle-class voters who cannot pay for the high-priced lobbyists, who \ncannot afford to take time off from work or take a break from caring \nfor their kids to fly out to Washington to lobby us on a moment's \nnotice for more money from taxpayers.\n  Let us not forget the people we represent. Our constituents are not \nthe Washington talking heads who chant and babble as if they can read \nthe minds of the family farmers in Winona, MN, or the senior citizen \nworking the counter at the Brainerd hardware store. And our \nconstituents are certainly not the big spenders who have used and \nabused the people's tax dollars for decades.\n  No, our constituents are the American taxpayers who sent us here to \nWashington to fight for them, because if we do not, who else will? If \nwe do not stand beside them today, what reason do the taxpayers have to \nstand beside us, if all they will get in return are empty promises \nwithout any action or leadership to back them up?\n  If we retreat from the taxpayers' agenda now, then who really won the \n1996 elections, despite our majority in Congress? If we do not carry \nout the taxpayers' agenda, we may as well pack up our bags and go home, \nbecause we will have failed. And the price of that failure will fall on \nthe backs of those we were elected to represent.\n  We should make a good-faith effort to work with the President, \npresent him with our plan to balance the budget and cut taxes this \nyear, and if he cannot accept it, let the voters decide who is right \nand who is wrong. Bipartisan action should not translate into inaction, \nand trying to cooperate should not involve being coopted.\n  If Congress and the President find the courage to move forward, the \nrewards can be immense. Let me tell you what has happened in my home \nState of Minnesota, where the headlines focus on a budget surplus, not \na deficit, and our taxpayers finally have something to smile about on \nthe State level in Minnesota. It is an example of what can be achieved \nwhen leaders make a promise and stick to it, even when it is not the \npolitically easy thing to do.\n  When Minnesota Gov. Arne Carlson was elected to office in 1990, he \ninherited a deficit greater than $1.8 billion and a government that was \nspending 15 percent faster than the rate of inflation. The Governor and \nthe State legislature cut spending by making the tough choices elected \nofficials are supposed to make, decisions that met the needs of our \nresidents and left no one behind. Thanks to that dedication, Minnesota \ntoday finds itself with a stronger economy, more jobs, an unemployment \nrate of just 3.5 percent, well below the national average, and a $2.3 \nbillion budget surplus.\n  So now the Governor has now presented a plan of tax relief that will \ncut income taxes in the State by an amazing 22 percent, offer $900 \nmillion in property tax relief, $150 million in education tax credits, \nand eliminate the sales tax on all capital equipment replacement. It \nhas been an amazing turnaround for Minnesotans.\n  Tax relief and fiscal discipline have worked in Minnesota. It is a \ncombination that can work for the rest of the country as well. We need \nto remember, however, that Rome was not built in 1 day and neither was \nbig government. The problem will not be fixed in 1 day, one year, or \neven 2 years. But every journey begins with one step--it is our\n\n[[Page S2577]]\n\njob to ensure it is one step forward, not backward.\n  In less than a month, Tax Day will arrive, and in preparation, the \nAmerican taxpayers will once again gather around their kitchen tables \nto take stock of their finances. One can almost hear the collective \ngroan. Unfortunately, it is too late for Congress to make any changes \nto lighten the tax load this year. It is not too late to enact the tax \nrelief that will fundamentally transform the next.\n  Mr. President, I did not come to the floor today to draw a line in \nthe sand--at least not at this time. I must admit that I will be hard \npressed to support any budget, any budget, that does not call for \nsignificant tax relief for the working families of Minnesota and each \nof the other 50 States. If we, as the majority, cannot deliver on this \none, fundamental promise we made to the voters, we will have abandoned \nthe taxpayers. And in doing so, we, the Republican majority, and this \nCongress as a whole, will have raised significant questions about our \ndesire, and ability, to lead this Nation. It will be hard for us or \nthis generation to explain to our children and to our grandchildren how \nwe failed to provide them with a future as bright as the future that \nour parents and 200 years of generations left to us.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous-consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2575-5", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2577-S2580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MEXICO CERTIFICATION ISSUE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have a series of unanimous consent \nrequests that may be necessary unless we get some agreement very \nquickly now from the minority leader.\n  I just came from a committee hearing, where I just finished \ntestifying so I could come to the floor at 10:30 and call up the \nagreement entered into last night after monumental efforts by Senators \non both sides of the aisle, working with the administration, with \nregard to the Mexico certification issue regarding drugs and how the \ndrug war is being fought with the United States Government being \ninvolved and, of course, with the Mexican Government being involved, \nbut in ways that are very troublesome.\n  I had hoped we could get started at 10:30, get a time agreement that \nwas reasonable, maybe 4 hours equally divided, so we could have a full \ndiscussion about what is happening with regard to law enforcement \nefforts and dealing with drugs coming from Mexico into the United \nStates, so we could talk about the President's difficult decision to go \nforward with certification, but also to make sure that the American \npeople understand that the Congress is not satisfied with the status \nquo. More must be done.\n  We have a right--in fact, we have an obligation--to get more from our \nGovernment's efforts in fighting the drug war and dealing with the \nflood of drugs that are killing America's children. They are flooding \ninto this country from Mexico. We have a right to expect hardened drug \ncriminals to be extradited into this country. Some of them have, some \nof them have not. We have a right to expect that our law enforcement \npeople dealing with the drug barons, the drug lords, are able to defend \nthemselves. We have a right to expect some thresholds to be met with \nregard to what Mexico must do and, frankly, what we must do in our \nGovernment. This is a very important issue, one that we cannot leave \ntoday or tomorrow without taking action on.\n  I want to say how much I appreciate the great effort by the Senators \nhere on the floor now--Senator Hutchison from Texas, Senator Coverdell \nfrom Georgia, Senator Feinstein from California, and other Senators \nthat have worked to try to do the responsible thing. I want to point \nout that these Senators, along with others, for a total of 40, wrote a \nletter to the President of the United States saying, ``Mr. President, \ndon't certify Mexico as doing what needs to be done in this drug battle \nthat we are engaged in.'' The President did that.\n  Now, the House took an action that will allow them to put down some \nmarkers and, after 90 days, look and see if progress is being made and \nthen, perhaps, act further. I believe that is the gist of their action. \nThat resolution is pending here at the desk.\n  But, again, in a full, good-faith effort, the Senators have worked \nwith the administration, which included a whole variety of people. I \nwas stunned by all the people that got involved. The Secretary of State \nwas involved; the head of our drug effort, General McCaffrey; the head \nof NSC, Sandy Berger; the Secretary of Treasury was there. It was a \nlong list of people, and a lot of work was done. I think these Senators \nhere gave a great deal. They wanted to say that these are some things \nthat must be done and be certified by the President; when they are, we \nshould have the right to have another vote on whether or not there \nshould be decertification with waivers, or certification, or whatever. \nThey agreed to not insist on that. But what they did do was reach an \nagreement that requires a report from the President, by September 1, on \nwhat is being done by our Government and by Mexico to do a better job.\n  Now, I finally decided last night that the administration really \ndidn't want any action by the Senate. They want us to just leave and \nnot do anything. We can't do that. The Senate should take action on \nsomething this important. So we will act on this. We will vote. We will \ndo it today, or we will do it tonight or tomorrow; it's OK with me. We \nare going to vote on this issue before we leave here.\n\n  There is a process where the Democratic leader cannot stop that--it \nis a privileged resolution, with 10 hours of debate and then a vote. I \ndon't want to do it that way. I want us to come to an agreement. The \nresolution that I thought we were going to call up at 10:30 requires \nspecific reporting on steps taken by Mexico and the United States to \ncombat illegal narcotics trafficking. It makes clear the Senate view \nthat Mexico has not done enough--and they have not. We have seen that \nmany times. We have seen it with the devastating story recently about \nthe top drug enforcer in Mexico who, as a matter of fact, had to be \nremoved from office because he was, in fact, being involved in what he \nis supposed to be trying to control. That is as gently as I can \npossibly put it. I fear there are going to be more devastating reports \nlike that.\n  The revision allowing for a vote, as I indicated, was dropped last \nnight, after direct involvement by the Secretary of State, head of the \nNSC, as well as Senators here, and Senator McCain was involved in that. \nBut it makes clear that the administration and the Government of Mexico \nshould provide real demonstrable progress by September. If they don't, \nunder this procedure, we would not have another vote, but we can have \nmore votes. There will be authorization bills, and there will be \nappropriations bills, like the State, Justice, Commerce bill. If we \ndon't get a response or action here, the Senate has a powerful weapon \ncalled the power of the purse. We can withhold funds. We can make our \nviews known.\n  Based on that, the fact that we can act in other ways with other \nvehicles, I thought this was a good agreement. I thought that the \nSenators here on the floor bent over backward to reach an agreement. \nNow, we have--get this picture--the Secretary of State, who is now in \nHelsinki, and the head of NSC, now in Helsinki, both directly involved, \nsaying, yes, we can go with this. General McCaffrey, head of the drug \nadministration, who was there and said, yes, we can go with this. \nDemocrat and Republican Senators said yes. The majority leader says \nthis is not perfect, but this is a responsible thing to do. And then \nwhat happens? There is a Democratic Caucus this morning. They meet and \ndecide that because they can't dictate the schedule on another issue, \nbecause they can't make the majority leader give them a date certain on \nanother unrelated issue, they want the United States Senate not to act \non the drug problem in Mexico.\n  Now, my friends, this is a big-time loser for those that are \nobjecting to this procedure. It cannot stand. We have to find a way to \nmove this forward.\n  So all these administration officials are for it, Senate Republicans \nand\n\n[[Page S2578]]\n\nDemocrats are for it, and now they are saying, ``If you don't give us a \nguarantee on another issue, that we will do it by a date certain, we \nare not going to let you bring this up.'' Look, I know we like to play \ngames just before we get to go home. But this is not the way to do \nserious business. We are not dealing with partisanship here. We are not \ndealing with some traditional authorization. We are dealing with drugs. \nHow can we not express ourselves on this? We must, and we will.\n\n  I am going to ask unanimous consent, when the minority leader \narrives, to bring up Calendar No. 29, House Joint Resolution 58, \nregarding the certification of the President with respect to Mexico, \nthat there be 4 hours total for debate on that resolution, to be \nequally divided in the usual form, and that one amendment--and only one \namendment--be in order to be offered by Senators Coverdell, Feinstein, \nHutchison, and others.\n  I will ask that no other amendments or motions be in order, and \nfollowing the conclusion or yielding back of the time, the Senate \nproceed to a vote.\n  We can take it up, and we can have a calm, cool, nonpartisan debate \non a very, very important issue.\n  I have here the resolution that was the subject of the negotiations \nand the one that was agreed to last night at about 7:30 or 8 o'clock. I \nwas around and in and out of those meetings. This was interesting, I \nthought, because I actually have the copy here, or a copy of what was \nagreed to. See that. These are circled paragraphs the administration \nhad problems with, and the compromise language that was worked out. I \ndon't like this compromise. But it was a responsible thing to do. The \nsame thing on the next page. The work was so intense and so committed \nright up to the last minute. Here is a paragraph. It circles this, and \nit is out.\n  I am going to ask for that. I hope that Senators on both sides of the \naisle will agree to that. If that effort fails--and I am going to make \nthis request not later than 11 o'clock--I hope to hear from the \nminority leader quickly so we can get started.\n  If I don't get that consent, then I am going to ask unanimous consent \nthat the Foreign Relations Committee be discharged from further \nconsideration of Senate Joint Resolution 21 regarding the \ndecertification--this is the decertification process, not \ncertification; this is decertification--with additional waiver \nlanguage, that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration, and \nthat there be a limited period of time--presumably maybe 4 hours--for \ndebate. After that, of course, we go to a vote.\n  If that is objected to, then I am going to go to the privileged \nresolution, which is not amendable, provides for 10 hours of debate, \nand a vote. I do not want to do this. It provides for 10 hours of \ndebate in the law. This is a privileged resolution that sets out very \ntightly how we would vote on this privileged resolution issue. This is \ndangerous. It is not good for the administration. I don't think it is \ngood for the country because the vote that is taken would be on \ndecertifying Mexico as being seriously involved in this drug-fighting \neffort with us.\n  It might pass. And if we are going to have games played here on other \nunrelated issues, it puts me under extraordinary pressure.\n  I have indicated that I do not want to vote for decertification. But \nI might.\n  Also, even if it does not pass, what if the vote is 60 to 40? What \ndoes it say about the administration's effort? What does it say about \nthe President's effort? What does it say to Mexico that 40 United \nStates Senators voted to decertify Mexico? Then that would have to go--\nunless the House just accepts that--to conference. And then here is \nwhat will be pending in conference: decertification, or 90 days of \ndelay and a vote. Neither one of those should look very tempting to \nthose that want to do the right thing.\n  So I do not want to go on at length. I want us to get started. We \nneed to get started. But I hope we can get an agreement to move forward \non the agreement that was entered into last night. It is the right \nthing to do. It is the right thing for the Senate. It is the right \nthing for the administration. And, on a close call, I guess it is the \nright thing in our efforts to control drugs coming out of Mexico.\n  But, Mr. President, I am in good spirits today. I understand we have \nto do this positioning around here. I understand you have to try to \ndrag the majority leader into doing something he might not want to do, \nor cannot do. But I think this is the wrong place and the wrong time to \nbe playing this game.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to, first of all, thank the \ndistinguished majority leader because last night he played a very key \nrole in assisting us in making what I thought was an extremely \ndifficult agreement.\n  I also want to thank the Democrat leader, Senator Daschle, who also \nwas in agreement that he would move forward on this issue, get it \nresolved, and have it done. I was prepared to come over here shortly \nbefore the vote in praise of really what was an outstanding bipartisan \neffort. The administration, the Democrats, and the Republicans worked \ntogether to come up with something which required significant \ncompromise on the part of all sides in order to come up with an \nagreement that we could move forward and get this issue behind us, \nwhich we know has extraordinary dimensions associated with it, given \nthe emotion associated with the issue of drugs and the explosiveness of \nour relations with Mexico.\n\n  Now, I understand that one of the Members of this body wants to tie \nthis hard-fought agreement, of which he was not a party, to the \nChemical Weapons Convention. I hope that the individual who wants to \nblock moving forward with this resolution understands that we are \nworking on a Chemical Weapons Convention and an agreement to move \nforward on it. There are active discussions and negotiations that are \ngoing on. But to tie that to this, in my view--and I say this with \ncareful consideration--is totally irresponsible.\n  The Senator from California, the Senator from Georgia, the Senator \nfrom Texas, the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, and the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, the President's National Security \nAdviser, the Secretary of State all joined together. I again applaud \nthe Senator from California who had a very tough position on this, and \na very principled one, I might say. And now we are being hung up on a \nThursday before going into a recess, which a lot of us would like to go \non, because one Member of this body who was not a part of the \nnegotiations, nor, by the way, is a part of the Chemical Weapons \nConvention negotiations, of which I am a part, is going against the \ndirect agreement of the majority leader, the Democratic leader, and all \nof us.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to get this thing done. And I \nhope that the majority leader will move this unanimous-consent \nagreement, and let whoever objects come to the floor and move forward \nin a parliamentary fashion with a live quorum call.\n  This is an important issue that we have to get done with today. The \nmajority leader has described this scenario of what happens if we went \nto conference, and what happens if we go ahead on a direct vote for \ndecertification. This flies directly in the face of a completely \nbipartisan agreement.\n  Mr. President, there is a lot of conversation about the rancor and \npartisanship. We just went through a very bitter situation on the point \nof the CIA Director. We proved that we can work together for the good \nof the country, and now it is about to be derailed. I strongly object \nto it.\n  I yield to the Senator from Texas for a question.\n  I apologize for taking time from the Senator from California. Again, \nI have the utmost praise for her, not only on agreement on the \ncompromise last night, but for her constant attention and concern over \nthis vitally important issue.\n  I don't know of anything right now that is more important than our \nrelations with Mexico and the war on drugs, which is destroying young \nAmericans as we speak.\n  I yield to her for a question.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona just touched \non an important point, and that is, all of us are trying to avoid a \nvote directly on decertification. No one wants that\n\n[[Page S2579]]\n\nto happen. But, in fact, if the Senator from Arizona is correct--what \nall of us worked so hard to put together was a positive, productive \nstatement that we could work from to make progress in the war on drugs \nbetween our countries--if what he is saying is true, then we are all \ngoing to be forced to make the worst of all votes because we just can't \nget our bill on the floor for debate.\n  Is that correct?\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is correct.\n  I appreciate the efforts of the Senator from Texas. All of us \nunderstand the importance of the war on drugs. Those of us from border \nStates perhaps--I emphasize perhaps--appreciate it a little bit more \nbecause of the direct involvement that we have.\n  I am not going to speak on this again in the Chamber and take time. I \nthink we are going to work this out. We have to. I want to especially \nexpress my appreciation to the Senator from California, the Senator \nfrom Texas, the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Coverdell, and the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, and others, \nand members of the administration who sat down with us and negotiated, \nI think, an important and positive agreement and a way around this \nissue.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from \nCalifornia, and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I really rise to lament the situation \nwe are in. I believe the people of this Nation sent us to the Senate to \nwork across the aisle, to work in a bipartisan way and particularly on \nissues of major concern. Whether Mexico is certified or not is an issue \nof major concern. It is of major concern certainly to Mexico; it is to \nAmerica; it is to the cities of America; it is to every Representative \nin the House and to every Member of this body as well.\n  I wish to pay tribute to the senior Senator from Georgia, with whom I \nhave worked, with the junior Senator from Texas, with whom I have \nworked, Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, to the administration team, and \nto many others. I believe we have demonstrated we can, in fact, work \nacross party lines.\n  We have developed a resolution which I think is a major achievement; \nit is law--it is not a sense-of-the-Senate resolution; it is a law--in \nwhich we state our concerns; we make findings; we ask the \nadministration to move forward; we ask the President to move forward in \nhis trips to Mexico and other Latin American nations to work in a \nmultilateral way to bring back a new agreement; we indicate 10 areas \nwhere we would like to see progress; and we ask the administration to \nreport to this Congress on September 1 on the progress made.\n  We did not start here. Senator D'Amato and I began this a year ago. \nNot many people listened. We said we do not really believe that Mexico \nhas fulfilled the test of a friend and neighbor and an ally who has \nbeen fully cooperative as the law calls for to be certified. At that \npoint he and I put forward certain tests that we felt had to be met \nprior to certification.\n  A year went by, and we saw very little progress, if any. And then the \nPresident made the decision to certify Mexico. In his mind, he had many \ngood reasons to do so. It was a decision that was spiritedly debated \nwithin the White House. It was debated within the Department of State. \nAnd that was the ultimate decision of the President.\n  There were those of us in this body, myself included, who had a \nprofound difference of opinion with this decision. We thought that the \nColombian model was the appropriate model and that Mexico should be \ndecertified but with a national interest waiver as was the procedure \nwith Colombia 2 years ago because we felt certification was not the \nappropriate vehicle. But it is the vehicle that we have, and therefore \nMexico should be treated in the same way Colombia was if the findings \nwere as we believe them to be.\n  We have had meeting after meeting after meeting. The senior Senator \nfrom Georgia and I find ourselves in real agreement. The Senator from \nTexas and the two of us have worked together. Democrats came in; \nRepublicans came in; the administration came in; and we forged an \nagreement which I believe, based on a conversation at least on my side \nwith the Democratic leader of the House of Representatives last night, \ncan be acceptable to the House and can be a clear statement which gives \nthe President certain--not directives--but I think certain clear \nrequests from this body to follow on his trip to Mexico which is \nupcoming and from which I believe our Nation, our big cities, our \nstreets can derive significant benefit.\n  I am profoundly disappointed to find ourselves in this situation and \nreally urge colleagues on my side who are rightly concerned with the \nChemical Weapons Convention treaty, rightly concerned, to please let \nthis resolution go, let us have the debate, because absent that debate \nand given no opportunity in law to express ourselves, you leave us with \nno choice but to move for decertification because that is the only \ndirect resolution that can come to the floor on an expedited procedure, \nas the majority leader has just said.\n  I cannot tell you how strongly I feel about the cooperation I and \nothers have had from the Republican side of the aisle. I have had an \nopportunity to work very closely with the senior Senator from Georgia, \nwith his excellent staff, certainly with my excellent staff, with the \nSenator from Texas, Senators McCain, Kerry, Dodd, Domenici, all of whom \ncame at a very critical time last night into these discussions and \nplayed a very helpful role. The administration has agreed in the areas \nof consensus. I think some things they did not want to be forced to put \nforward in law they have agreed to. We have agreed to take out \nsomething that the administration did not want, which was a September 1 \nexpedited procedure giving us the opportunity to comment again in law \non progress made between March 1 and September 1. We removed that. We \nhave consensus. The administration has said the President would sign \nthis; we believe the House will pass it; and we have a strong policy \ndocument with which to move forward.\n  It would just be tragic if we fragment, if we have to use the only \nthing we have, which is a decertification, a straight and outright \ndecertification, as the means to express ourselves. So I am very \nhopeful we would have an opportunity today, now, to bring this \nresolution to the floor. If we cannot achieve unanimous consent, as the \nmajority leader has just said, it leaves him with no alternative but to \ncall up the decertification resolution, and once that debate begins it \nwould take unanimous consent to stop it, and unanimous consent to bring \nthis resolution up during that 10-hour period, which I see really \nfraught with great difficulties.\n  Once again, I cannot tell you how many hours the Senator from \nGeorgia, the Senator from Texas, I and a number of other people have \nbeen involved in this effort. We have consulted the Democratic leader \nas we moved along. I believe he is pleased with this outcome.\n  So I plead with colleagues on my side not to hold this resolution \nhostage to an agreement on the Chemical Weapons Convention. It is too \nimportant. Please, do not do it.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Chair recognizes the \ndistinguished minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, let me begin by associating myself with \nthe remarks of the distinguished Senator from California. She speaks \nfor many on our side as well, who want very much to bring this issue to \nclosure today. It is because of her efforts and the efforts, as she has \nindicated, of the Senator from Texas and the Senator from Georgia and \nothers who have dedicated an extraordinary amount of time in the last \ncouple of weeks to working with the administration and others to bring \nus to a point where, on one of the most contentious issues we have had \nto confront in this Congress, we have actually come to a point where \nRepublicans and Democrats can reach agreement. That does not happen \nvery often in this Congress, and especially in this session of this \nCongress so far. I hope we can avail ourselves of the opportunity it \npresents and come to an agreement on procedure and allow this \nresolution to be taken up and voted upon sometime by early afternoon.\n\n[[Page S2580]]\n\n  I did not hear a lot of what the majority leader has indicated is his \nposition with regard to the chemical weapons treaty. He knows of the \ngreat concern on our side of the aisle about achieving a process that \nwill allow us consideration of that treaty no later than the 19th of \nApril so that, by the 29th of April, that treaty can be ratified and \nthat we can be full-fledged members of the Chemical Weapons Convention. \nIf we miss that small window, from April 7 to April 19, we will have \nlost the opportunity, that 125 other countries have already taken, that \nwe have sought for decades to have an international agreement on \nchemical weapons. Our failure to become part of the convention will put \nus in the company of Iraq, Iran, Libya, and countries that in every \nway, shape, and form and by any definition are rogue states today. Do \nwe want to be in that position?\n  I would think there would be an unequivocal, unanimous verdict that, \nno, we do not want to be in the company of Libya, Iraq, and Iran. But \nwe are in a position which, in a very short period of time, will force \nus into that company if we do nothing. That is why my Democratic \ncolleagues feel so strongly about this issue and believe that there are \nvery few other issues out there more important, and if we do not turn \nup the pressure and find ways in which to assert our determination to \nget this convention considered, we will have lost an opportunity, not \nonly for the Senate, for the country, but perhaps for the convention \nitself. This is why it is so critical.\n  Having said all of that, and I could say a lot more but in the \ninterests of time, let me say I believe the majority leader is doing as \nmuch as he can at this point to bring us to a set of circumstances that \nwill allow us consideration in due time. I believe there is a great \ndeal of difference within the Republican caucus on this issue. I \nunderstand that. There are many issues that divide the Democratic \ncaucus. So it is not out of the ordinary to be divided on an issue of \nthis importance and controversy. But I do believe that the majority \nleader has given me adequate reason to be confident that we will take \nthis treaty up in a time that will accommodate ratification on the \nSenate floor prior to the 19th of April.\n  So, given all of his cooperation and his willingness to work with us, \nI think the most important thing for us to do today is to pass this \ncompromise to allow us to work with Mexico to deal with the drug issue \nin a meaningful way without slapping them in the face. So I hope, as \nthe Senator from California has so articulately pointed out just a \nmoment ago, that we recognize how important this opportunity is for all \nof us, that we seize the moment, that we get an agreement, and we move \nforward.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2577-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2580-S2581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 58\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow turn to the consideration of Calendar No. 29, House Joint \nResolution 58, regarding the certification of the President with \nrespect to Mexico, that there be no time restraints for debate on the \nresolution and an amendment. Further, I ask unanimous consent that \nthere be only one amendment in order to be offered by Senators \nCoverdell and Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, without objecting, I would like to ask \na question of the majority leader before proceeding or determining \nwhether to object.\n  As the majority leader and the Democratic leader both know, I have \nbeen very concerned that we get some agreements or understanding about \nhow the Chemical Weapons Convention is to be handled in April. We have \na deadline coming at us. I think the convention, as I understand it, \ngoes into effect on the 29th of April. We have to, if the United States \nis to participate, if the judgment of the Senate is we should \nparticipate in that, we would have to make that judgment several days \nbefore that. At least that is what I have been informed.\n  I am just concerned that time is running out. We seem to be taking \none legislative or executive matter up after another here without \nreally having an understanding about how we are going to dispose of \nthis Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  I wondered if the majority leader could assure me about how this is \ngoing to be brought to the Senate and dealt with in the coming month?\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, if the Senator from New Mexico will yield. \nFirst, I would like to just briefly clarify what we have in this \nconsent request. It is to bring up this certification issue and to \nallow an amendment that would put in place the agreement that was \nentered into last night by a bipartisan group of Senators and the \nadministration.\n  So this just basically sets up a process to begin the debate and get \na vote on the agreement with regard to certification, with the \nunderstanding it does set out some markers as to what we think should \nbe done, and it does require the President to report by September 1 as \nto the progress that is being made there. But it does not have a \nsubsequent date where a vote could occur. This is going to be the vote \non certification, or decertification, depending on your point of view. \nSo I want to clarify what I was asking for there.\n  With regard to the inquiry of the Senator from New Mexico, first of \nall, let me assure him I understand there is concern about the April 29 \ndate and the need for some action before that date by a number of \nSenators.\n  There is disagreement on how essential it is we act before the 29th. \nAs a matter of fact, whenever the United States should ratify such a \ntreaty, certainly we would be sort of the big kid on the block and we \nwould be involved in the process. But there are arguments on the other \nside of it, and I certainly understand that.\n  I acknowledged to the Senator from Michigan, I believe it was \nyesterday or the day before, that I also understand that in order to \nget a treaty completed and the subsequent actions that go along with \nit, enacting or enabling legislation----\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reform.\n  Mr. LOTT. Reform legislation--it takes some time after the actual \nvote.\n  So it is my intent for this issue to come up when we come back after \nthe Easter recess.\n  There is a statute or bill that has been introduced that we hope to \nget up and get a vote on. Very serious. I think good efforts are \nunderway to deal with the parallel issues of U.N. reform. The \nadministration is working with a bipartisan group of House and Senate \nMembers. I think everybody is beginning to understand, themselves, and \nwe may be able to get some reforms and some process on how we deal with \nwhat is the number we may be indebted to the United Nations for and how \nthat ever would be addressed.\n  We are also working with the chairman of the committee, Senator \nHelms, and Senator Biden, the ranking member, on this reorganization of \nthe State Department issue. The new Secretary of State has indicated \nsome encouraging things there, and I believe there is going to be good \nfaith by all to try to address this issue.\n  There are some legitimate concerns about the treaty--the verification \nquestion, search and seizure questions, how it affects different things \nin America. On some of those, the administration this year came back \nand said, ``You're right. We have some concerns about this issue.''\n  So a number of them have been worked out. An equal number are within \nthe range of being worked out. Again, Senator Biden has been working \nwith Senator Helms to address some of those concerns.\n  There are some we just will not be able to get worked out. I mean, we \nwill have to have votes on amendments on the floor or there will \nprobably be a substitute. But my intention is to continue to work with \nall involved, including the chairman and ranking member, to get this \nissue to the floor in April. That is why I had our list of items. It is \nnot my intent to stonewall or delay this.\n\n[[Page S2581]]\n\n  I understand that every time we go out or every time a bill comes up, \nthe Senator from New Mexico will be up here raising questions and maybe \neven objections. We have other things we need to do that are equally or \nmore important. So it is not my intention at all to allow this thing to \ngo on indefinitely.\n  But you do understand, as the majority leader, you work with the \nchairman, you help the chairman, and the chairman helps you, and you \nwork with the ranking member. This is a place of great comity, and we \nwant to keep that. I am trying to honor that as a majority leader who \nis, you know, sort of learning as I go along, making a few mistakes \nhere and there, but getting some things done on the way, too. So I \nthink you know from what we have been able to do over the last 8 \nmonths, I work steadily at these things, and at some point we are going \nto get to vote on this. I do not mean to say in the great wild blue \nwonder. We are working very aggressively, and I believe we are going to \nget a process to get it dealt with in April.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, let me just respond by saying I \nappreciate the statements by the majority leader. I have observed the \nmajority leader here for several months, and I have great confidence \nthat when he expects and intends for a particular matter to come to the \nSenate floor and be dealt with, that that will actually occur, and I am \nencouraged by his statements to that affect. On that basis, I will not \nobject to this particular unanimous-consent request.\n  I will plan to renew my concern once we return from this recess if it \nis not clear at that time that we have all parties in agreement as to \nthe timing to bring that convention to the floor. I think timing is \nessential.\n  I have no problem with amendments and changes. I am not trying to \ndictate the end result on what the Senate does, but I think it is very \nimportant that we vote on it in a timely fashion. I take the statement \nby the majority leader to be a statement that he intends and expects \nthat we will work assiduously to bring that about. I thank the majority \nleader.\n  I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I thank the Democratic leader and the \nSenators on both sides for the work that has been done on this. I \nbelieve now we will have a good discussion about what is or is not \ngoing on with regard to the drug battle that we are fighting, with the \nAmerican Government and the Mexican Government being involved.\n  Madam President, I believe we are able now to get a time agreement, \nwhich I think would be very helpful to all Senators to know that we are \ngoing to proceed and there will be a time specified so we can have a \nvote by 4 o'clock, hopefully. I discussed this with the Democratic \nleader and other Senators. I believe we have a reasonable agreement \nhere.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now turn to the consideration \nof Calendar No. 29, House Joint Resolution 58, regarding the \ncertification of the President with respect to Mexico and there be 4 \nhours 45 minutes total for debate on the resolution and an amendment, \nto be divided as follows: Senator Coverdell in control of 1 hour, \nSenator Feinstein in control of 1 hour, 1 hour under the control of the \nmajority leader and 1 hour under the control of the Democratic leader, \nSenator Grassley in control of 30 minutes, and Senator Torricelli in \ncontrol of 15 minutes.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that there be one amendment in order \nto be offered by Senators Coverdell and Feinstein. I further ask \nunanimous consent that no other amendments or motions be in order, and \nfollowing the conclusion or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed \nto a vote on the amendment, to be followed by third reading and final \npassage of House Joint Resolution 58 without further action or debate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, I ask unanimous consent \nthat in addition to this request, which I fully support, that the \nrequest be amended to accommodate a need by the senior Senator from \nWest Virginia, Senator Byrd, to speak for 30 minutes on another matter. \nI ask unanimous consent that following the vote, the Senator from West \nVirginia be recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I amend my unanimous-consent request to \ninclude that additional 30 minutes for the Senator from West Virginia \nafter the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Again, Madam President, I thank Senator Daschle for his \ncooperation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2580-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PROVIDING FOR THE CONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT OR RECESS OF THE TWO HOUSES\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, first, let me thank the majority \nleader, the minority leader, and all of those Senators who have been \nengaged this morning in our efforts to move House Joint Resolution 58. \nNeedless to say, I am very pleased that we have been able to come to \nthis unanimous consent to consider this resolution of paramount \nimportance as it relates to the drug cartels and the impact they are \nhaving on our country, on Mexico, and in all countries within our \nhemisphere.\n  Madam President, I will read from a statement by Thomas A. \nConstantine, Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, \nwhich was given before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on March \n12, 1997. I am giving this statement as a prelude to my remarks to \nframe the scope of the issue to which this resolution confronts.\n\n       Many phrases have been used to describe the complex and \n     sophisticated international drug trafficking groups operating \n     out of Colombia and Mexico, and frankly, the somewhat \n     respectable titles of ``cartel'' or ``federation'' mask the \n     true identity of these vicious, destructive entities. The \n     Cali organization, and the four largest drug trafficking \n     organizations in Mexico--operating out of Juarez, Tijuana, \n     Sonora and the Gulf region--are simply organized crime groups \n     whose leaders are not in Brooklyn or Queens, but are safely \n     ensconced on foreign soil. They are not legitimate \n     businessmen as the\n\n[[Page S2582]]\n\n     word ``cartel'' implies, nor are they ``federated'' into a \n     legitimate conglomerate. These syndicate leaders--the \n     Rodriguez Orejuela brothers in Colombia to Amado Carrillo-\n     Fuentes, Juan Garcia-Abrego, Miguel Caro-Quintero, and the \n     Arellano-Felix Brothers--are simply the 1990's version of the \n     mob leaders U.S. law enforcement has fought since shortly \n     after the turn of the century.\n       But these organized crime leaders are far more dangerous, \n     far more influential, and have a great deal more impact on \n     our day to day lives than their domestic predecessors. While \n     organized crime in the United States during the 1950's \n     through the 1970's affected certain aspects of American life, \n     their influence pales in comparison to the violence, \n     corruption and power that today's drug syndicates wield. . . \n     . The drugs--and the attendant violence which accompanies the \n     drug trade--have reached into every American community and \n     have robbed many Americans of the dreams they once cherished.\n\n  And I add, even, in thousands of cases, their lives.\n  In the face of this massive drug problem and its effect on two \nfriendly countries, the United States and Mexico, the administration \ndecided to certify Mexico as being fully cooperative in our joint \nbattle. The message that sent, Madam President, to the people of both \nof our countries was that things are going along pretty well. They are \nnot. In fact, they are in crisis proportions.\n  We cannot accept a statement to the American people, a statement to \nthe people of Mexico, and a statement to the people of this hemisphere \nthat we are winning the struggle, because we are not. We are losing it \nin its current configuration.\n  That led, Madam President, a number of the Members of the Senate on \nboth sides of the aisle, in every region of our country, and of every \npolitical and philosophical persuasion, to say no. That is a \nratification of the status quo, and the status quo is unacceptable. It \nis unacceptable.\n\n  Now, some interpret that as an attack on Mexico. I do not see it that \nway. I see it as an honest appraisal of a situation that is \ndebilitating to both Republics. The President of Mexico himself has \nsaid that the greatest threat to the Mexican Republic are the drug \ncartels. We cannot accept the status quo.\n  Madam President, House Joint Resolution 58 is a rejection of the \nstatus quo and a victory for the people of both countries who want to \nrenew and reinvigorate this battle, to put it on a new course. \nThroughout the debate, I have argued that we need to find a new place \nto be other than just the debate over whether any country has met a \ncriteria established by the United States as to whether they are \nadequately fighting the battle or not. The point is, the battle, as it \nhas been fought, is being lost and we must find a new way to come to \nthe struggle. I am pleased to say that in House Joint Resolution 58 \nthere is language that is adopting my suggestion, along with that of \nSenator Dodd of Connecticut, that we reconstruct in the hemisphere the \nway we come to the battle. And it calls on the President, when he goes \nto Mexico and Latin America later this year, and to the Caribbean, to \nbring this subject up and to begin talking about how we can come \ntogether as equal partners to confront this stealth adversary that \ncares for no human being nor any sovereign nation. If we fought the \nbattle in the Persian Gulf, Madam President, like we are fighting this \nadversary--and I might add that it is virtually as dangerous--we would \nhave lost that struggle, as we are losing this one. We need to \nreinvigorate the struggle, and this proposal, which is endorsed by such \na wide array of people, does just that.\n  Madam President, I want to say a few words about this, because every \ntime somebody stands up and says the status quo is unacceptable, you \nare immediately pushed into a category of being insensitive to those in \nMexico, or other countries who were trying to help us, and, indeed, we \nknow they are there. And no one who is an author of that resolution has \nit in their mind that they want to make their job more difficult. But \nif the only answer we get is, ``Just keep this quiet, don't raise the \nissue,'' and every time it is raised you are categorized as somebody \nwho is offending another nation, that is inappropriate and \nunacceptable.\n  The work that we have been doing here is absolutely on target. This \ncountry and Mexico, and all the other countries in the hemisphere, have \nto go public about the scope of the enemy we are struggling with. That \nis what this resolution does. It takes us to a new place and a new day \nand a more open and honest discussion in the hemisphere about this \nadversary.\n  Technically, Madam President, this resolution will cause the \nadministration to come to the Congress and demonstrate to us that they \nhave renewed this battle not only in the hemisphere, but in the United \nStates. There is a mutuality about this resolution. It acknowledges \nthat our country is a key element in the problem. Not only are we a \nconsumer and the No. 1 consumer of these illicit drugs, but we are a \nproducer of the drugs themselves, and a grower of them. We have to get \nthis on the table. If you are going to eradicate marijuana in Mexico, \nlet's get it eradicated here. The technologists tell us we can find any \nof these products where they are growing. Well, let's find them and get \nrid of them.\n  A contention that made this resolution such a struggle to come to was \nthat the administration did not want us to come back and revisit this \nquestion later in the year. In the last hours, as the majority leader \ndescribed, late last evening, that provision was removed. I think the \nadministration needs to take note of the fact that this report will be \ndue at just the time this Senate and this Congress will be dealing with \nappropriations. And the appropriators and the authorizers who have been \nfollowing this for a long time are going to keep right on doing that, \nand they eagerly await the report. You will not be able to remove \nCongress from this issue, and everybody should take note of that. Every \nfriend of the hemisphere should take note of it.\n  Madam President, I hope that this is interpreted throughout the \nhemisphere as an instrument of assistance, good will, rededication, \ncompassion, and concern, because that is what was in the hearts and \nminds of all the Senators, and others, who worked to produce this \ndocument.\n  I want to particularly say thank you to Senator Feinstein, who has \nbeen at this job a lot longer than I, and I admire her work; Senator \nD'Amato of New York, who joined her last year; Senator Grassley, who is \nthe chairman of our drug task force, who has worked tirelessly to deal \nwith these problems; Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, who is a member of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee and worked in these final negotiations; \nSenator McCain of Arizona; Senator Domenici of New Mexico, and, of \ncourse, our coauthor, the junior Senator from Texas, Kay Bailey \nHutchison, who was in every step of the negotiations from the \nbeginning. The prints of her work are fashioned into this resolution as \nwell. I know I will have left somebody out and, for that, I apologize \nbecause it has been such a wide array of people who brought this \nresolution to the floor.\n\n  There are many, many issues that are very important in the U.S. \nCongress, but I believe when you look at the hemisphere and all the \nopportunity in this hemisphere of democracies--40 percent of all United \nStates exports occur in this hemisphere, which is much larger than \nEurope, and larger than the Pacific rim. We have a lot at stake, big \ntime. But there is one cloud that hangs over us throughout the \nhemisphere, and it's the drug cartels. We have to restructure the \nbattle. I hope this stands as a beginning to go to a new struggle and, \nultimately, a victory.\n  Madam President, parliamentary inquiry. Do you have the resolution? \nHas it been submitted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The resolution is pending. The amendment has \nnot been offered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 25\n\n                  (Purpose: To propose a substitute.)\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, under the previous consent agreement, \nI send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell], for himself, Mrs. \n     Feinstein, Mr. Helms, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. McCain, Mr. \n     Domenici, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Dodd, Ms. Moseley-Braun, and Ms. \n     Landrieu, proposes an amendment numbered 25.\n\n\n[[Page S2583]]\n\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the resolving clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. REPORT REQUIREMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The abuse of illicit drugs in the United States results \n     in 14,000 deaths per year, has inordinate social consequences \n     for the United States, and exacts economic costs in excess of \n     $67,000,000,000 per year to the American people.\n       (2) An estimated 12,800,000 Americans, representing all \n     ethnic and socioeconomic groups, use illegal drugs, including \n     1,500,000 users of cocaine. Further, 10.9 percent of \n     Americans between 12 and 17 years of age use illegal drugs, \n     and one in four American children claim to have been offered \n     illegal drugs in the past year. Americans spend approximately \n     $49,000,000,000 per year on illegal drugs.\n       (3) There is a need to continue and intensify anti-drug \n     education efforts in the United States, particularly \n     education directed at the young.\n       (4) Significant quantities of heroin, methamphetamines, and \n     marijuana used in the United States are produced in Mexico, \n     and a major portion of the cocaine used in the United States \n     is imported into the United States through Mexico.\n       (5) These drugs are moved illegally across the border \n     between Mexico and the United States by major criminal \n     organizations, which operate on both sides of that border and \n     maintain the illegal flow of drugs into Mexico and the United \n     States.\n       (6) There is evidence of significant corruption affecting \n     institutions of the Government of Mexico (including the \n     police and military), including the arrest in February 1997 \n     of General Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, the head of the drug law \n     enforcement agency of Mexico, for accepting bribes from \n     senior leaders of the Mexican drug cartels. In 1996, the \n     Attorney General of Mexico dismissed more than 1,200 Mexico \n     federal law enforcement officers in an effort to eliminate \n     corruption, although some were rehired and none has been \n     successfully prosecuted for corruption. In the United States, \n     some law enforcement officials may also be affected by \n     corruption.\n       (7) The success of efforts to control illicit drug \n     trafficking depends on improved coordination and cooperation \n     between Mexico and United States drug law enforcement \n     agencies and other institutions responsible for activities \n     against illicit production, traffic and abuse of drugs, \n     particularly in the common border region.\n       (8) The Government of Mexico recognizes that it must \n     further develop the institutional financial regulatory and \n     enforcement capabilities necessary to prevent money \n     laundering in the banking and financial sectors of Mexico and \n     has sought United States assistance in these areas.\n       (9) The Government of Mexico has recently approved, but has \n     yet to implement fully, new and more effective legislation \n     against organized crime and money laundering.\n       (10) The Government of the United States and the Government \n     of Mexico are engaged in bilateral consideration of the \n     problems of illicit drug production, trafficking, and abuse \n     through the High Level Contact Group on Drug Control \n     established in 1996.\n       (11) The President of Mexico has declared that drug \n     trafficking is the number one threat to the national security \n     of Mexico.\n       (12) In December 1996, the Government of the United States \n     and the Government of Mexico joined with the governments of \n     other countries in the Western Hemisphere to seek to \n     eliminate all production, trafficking, and abuse of drugs and \n     to prevent money laundering.\n       (13) Section 101 of division C of the Omnibus Consolidated \n     Appropriations Act, 1997 (Public Law 104-208) requires the \n     Attorney General to increase the number of positions for \n     full-time, active-duty patrol agents within the Immigration \n     and Naturalization Service by 1,000 per year through the year \n     2001.\n       (14) The proposed budget of the President for fiscal year \n     1998 includes a request for 500 such agents.\n       (15) Drug cartels continue to operate with impunity in \n     Mexico, and effective action needs to be taken against \n     Mexican drug trafficking organizations, particularly the \n     Juarez and Tijuana cartels.\n       (16) While Mexico has begun to extradite its citizens for \n     the first time and has cooperated by expelling or deporting \n     major international drug criminals, United States requests \n     for extradition of Mexican nationals indicted in United \n     States courts on drug-related charges have not been granted \n     by the Government of Mexico.\n       (17) Cocaine seizures and arrests of drug traffickers in \n     Mexico have dropped since 1992.\n       (18) United States law enforcement agents operating in \n     Mexico along the United States border with Mexico must be \n     allowed adequate protection.\n       (b) Sense of Congress on Cooperation on Drugs by Countries \n     in the Western Hemisphere.--It is the sense of Congress to \n     urge the President, in his official visits in the Western \n     Hemisphere, to examine with leaders of governments of other \n     countries in the Western Hemisphere the effectiveness of \n     efforts to improve counterdrug activities in order to curtail \n     the production, traffic, and abuse of illicit drugs, and to \n     define plans for specific actions to improve cooperation on \n     such activities, including consideration of a coordinated \n     multilateral alliance.\n       (c) Sense of Congress of Progress in Halting Production and \n     Traffic of Drugs in Mexico.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     there has been ineffective and insufficient progress in \n     halting the production in and transit through Mexico of \n     illegal drugs.\n       (d) Report to Congress.--Not later than September 1, 1997, \n     the President shall submit to Congress a report describing \n     the following:\n       (1) The extent of any significant and demonstrable progress \n     made by the Government of the United States and the \n     Government of Mexico, respectively, during the period \n     beginning on March 1, 1997, and ending on the date of the \n     report in achieving the following objectives relating to \n     counterdrug cooperation:\n       (A) The investigation and dismantlement of the principal \n     organizations responsible for drug trafficking and related \n     crimes in both Mexico and the United States, including the \n     prevention and elimination of their activities, the \n     prosecution or extradition and incarceration of their \n     leaders, and the seizure of their assets.\n       (B) The development and strengthening of permanent working \n     relationships between the United States and Mexico law \n     enforcement agencies, with particular reference to law \n     enforcement directed against drug trafficking and related \n     crimes, including full funding and deployment of the \n     Binational Border Task Forces as agreed upon by both \n     governments.\n       (C) The strengthening of bilateral border enforcement, \n     including more effective screening for and seizure of \n     contraband.\n       (D) The denial of safe havens to persons and organizations \n     responsible for drug trafficking and related crimes and the \n     improvement of cooperation on extradition matters between \n     both countries.\n       (E) The simplification of evidentiary requirements for \n     narcotics crimes and related crimes and for violence against \n     law enforcement officers.\n       (F) The full implementation of effective laws and \n     regulations for banks and other financial institutions to \n     combat money laundering, including the enforcement of \n     penalties for noncompliance by such institutions, and the \n     prosecution of money launderers and seizure of their assets.\n       (G) The eradication of crops destined for illicit drug use \n     in Mexico and in the United States in order to minimize and \n     eventually eliminate the production of such crops.\n       (H) The establishment and implementation of a comprehensive \n     screening process to assess the suitability and financial and \n     criminal background of all law enforcement and other \n     officials involved in the fight against organized crime, \n     including narcotics trafficking.\n       (I) The rendering of support to Mexico in its efforts to \n     identify, remove, and prosecute corrupt officials at all \n     levels of government, including law enforcement and military \n     officials.\n       (J) The augmentation and strengthening of bilateral \n     cooperation.\n       (2) The extent of any significant and demonstrable progress \n     made by the Government of the United States during the period \n     beginning on March 1, 1997, and ending on the date of the \n     report in--\n       (A) implementing a comprehensive anti-drug education effort \n     in the United States targeted at reversing the rise in drug \n     use by America's youth;\n       (B) implementing a comprehensive international drug \n     interdiction and enforcement strategy; and\n       (C) deploying 1,000 additional active-duty, full-time \n     patrol agents within the Immigration and Naturalization \n     Service in fiscal year 1997 as required by section 101 of \n     division C of the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, \n     1997 (Public Law 104-208).\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to add the \nname of Senator Landrieu of Louisiana as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I yield the floor at this time.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am genuinely grateful to the \ndistinguished Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell] and the \ndistinguished Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein] for their \nexcellent work on this issue. They deserve credit for keeping the \nSenate focused on the question of Mexico's counterdrug cooperation with \nthe United States.\n  Through this resolution, Senators Coverdell and Feinstein, in a very \nfair and very essential way, have made clear the Senate's \ndissatisfaction with the status quo.\n  Mr. President, I know of no Senator who was pleased with the \nPresident's decision to certify Mexico as cooperating fully with the \nUnited States; the evidence clearly supports a different conclusion. \nThis resolution gives both the President of Mexico and President \nClinton an opportunity for redemption.\n\n[[Page S2584]]\n\n  Mexico's President Zedillo has made numerous declarations against \ndrug trafficking--which we applaud. Moreover, we recognize that \nPresident Zedillo is no Ernesto Samper. But, as for the two countries, \nColombia and Mexico, the only difference between the two is that, in \nColombia, the Presidency was bought and paid for by drug lords, while, \nin Mexico, the Presidency may be the only level of government not \nbought and paid for by the drug lords.\n  Mr. President, U.S. law requires more than well-meaning statements \nfor a nation to be certified as cooperating fully. Our law requires \nperformance. In the case of Mexico, performance has fallen far short of \nthe rhetoric.\n  While the creation of bilateral commissions perhaps satisfies the \nbureaucratic need for meetings, meetings are meaningless unless they \nproduce tangible results--arrests, convictions, and seizures.\n  The same can be said of laws: The passage of new laws does not stop \ndrug trafficking; enforcement of laws does. We are still waiting for \nany implementation whatsoever of the laws against organized crime and \nmoney laundering. Indeed, the latter's effect may have already been \nnegated when Mexico expanded legalized gambling, a time-honored way for \ncriminals to launder money.\n  Corruption with impunity remains the modus operandi for the Federal \nJudicial Police, which more often resembles a criminal enterprise than \na law enforcement agency. At the January wedding of drug kingpin Amado \nCarrillo Fuentes' sister, for example, policemen were guarding \nCarrillo's family and friends. This is further evidence that Mexican \npolice are more likely to protect than arrest drug traffickers and \ntheir interests. Impunity is also the unwritten law for drug \ntraffickers and their allies in official positions, such as Gen. Jesus \nGutierrez Rebollo, Zedillo's drug czar.\n  Here was a case in which the senior Mexican counternaroctics official \nwas protecting the biggest Mexican drug kingpin, Amado Carrillo. The \nadministration argues that the arrest of General Gutierrez Rebollo is \nevidence of the Mexican Government's commitment to fight corruption. My \nquestions are: Why was he ever hired in the first place as Mexico's \nsenior counternarcotics official? Was this an intelligence failure? \nWhat damage has Gutierrez Rebollo done to compromise law enforcement \nand intelligence operations against the drug cartels? And are U.S. law \nenforcement agents now at greater risk because of this fiasco?\n  Mr. President, this is not an isolated incident. Just this past \nMonday, on March 17, another Mexican Army general was arrested for drug \ncorruption. It seems that on the day the administration certified the \nMexican Government's cooperation with United States counterdrug \nefforts, this general was offering a Mexican official $1 million in \nexchange for allowing cocaine shipments to pass through Tijuana.\n  In Mexico, corruption is not confined to the federal government. It \nis equally pervasive at the state and local levels. Just last week, a \njudge in Guadalajara dropped charges against a major drug trafficker. \nAlso, according to credible reports, a number of state governors, who \nare also prominent within the ruling PRI party, have been on the drug \ntraffickers' payroll. As long ago as 1989, I cited one of these \ngovernors, Manuel Bartlett, as one senior official compromised by drug \ntraffickers.\n  Mr. President, I won't cite all the statistics that show that, over \nthe past 6 years, arrests of drug traffickers and cocaine seizures have \ndecreased significantly in Mexico, while the volume of cocaine, heroin \nand methamphetamine going through or coming from Mexico increases. \nDespite this record, the United States has continuously pretended that \nthe Mexican Government has been a faithful partner in the fight against \nillegal drugs. The vast majority of the Mexican people are our allies; \nbut I have grave reservations about most of the Mexican Government.\n  The President and Barry McCaffrey, amongst others, have spoken \neloquently about the horrors of drug use on our streets, recognizing \nthat this scourge is destroying lives throughout this hemisphere. The \nAmerican and Mexican people deserve better. Silence is tacit consent to \nthis corruption which allows the drug trade to flourish. Only by \nexposing the corruption can we begin to make a genuine difference in \nattacking this evil.\n  In this light, Mr. President, the refusal to recognize the marriage \nbetween Mexican Government officials and drug traffickers is all the \nmore troubling. Congress must make known its disagreement with the \nconclusion that the Mexican Government is cooperating fully.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized for such time \nas I might consume within the hour allocated to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you, very much.\n  Mr. President, this country has always had a great debate about \ndrugs. Do you fight drugs on the supply side, or do you fight drugs on \nthe demand side? There is no question but that we have a demand \nproblem. But there is also no question that we have a supply problem. \nMy answer to that is that this country has never really done both \nreally well. We have never really engaged in an all-out fight against \ndrugs on both the supply side and the demand side.\n  What is before us today is somewhat limited in scope because it has \nto do with the certification action involving Mexico and whether that \naction should, in fact, take place; whether Mexico should be certified, \nas the President said.\n  The resolution now before this body, known as the Coverdell-Feinstein \namendment, I think is significant. Let me tell you the two ways that I \nlook at this.\n  This resolution is either the first step to a new and forceful \npartnership to fight drugs all out on both the supply side and the \ndemand side, and to join with Mexico in so doing, to accept President \nZedillo's statement that drugs are the No. 1 security problem of \nMexico, and to add to that the United States statement that drugs are, \nin fact, the No. 1 security problem for the United States of America, \nwhich I believe them to be, or this is the first step in a major battle \nnext year, if this resolution is ignored, to decertify Mexico as being \nnoncooperative in the supply side of the cooperation that goes into the \nretardation of drug flow into this country.\n  Mr. President, I want to begin by once again paying my respects to \nthe Senator from Georgia, the chairman of the Western Hemisphere \nSubcommittee, Senator Coverdell. He and I share a dedication to the \nidea that the status quo on United States-Mexican counterdrug \ncooperation is simply not acceptable, and his leadership on this issue \nhas helped us reach this point. It has been an honor and a privilege to \nbe his partner in this effort. And I look forward to continuing to work \nwith him and his outstanding staff in the fight against international \ndrug trafficking.\n  I also want to acknowledge the Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, \nwhose contribution to this effort was invaluable. Her State, like mine, \nshares a long border with Mexico. So this issue hits home to us in a \ndirect and a meaningful way. Other Senators too numerous to list, with \nnames like Dodd, Kerry, McCain, Domenici, as well as others, the \nmajority leader, the Democratic leader, have all weighed in to bring \nthis effort to fruition. And I have appreciated working with each and \nevery one of my colleagues to get to this outcome.\n  Just over a year ago, as has been said, Senator D'Amato and I started \ntalking about whether Mexico merited certification as a fully \ncooperative partner in the war against drugs. Our view was that Mexico \nhad simply not made enough progress in the war on drug trafficking to \njustify certification. At that time, despite the fact that we laid down \n10 specific criteria, no one paid us much attention.\n  Well, people have paid attention this year. On February 28 of this \nyear, the President made the decision to certify Mexico as fully \ncooperating with the United States in the fight against drug \ntrafficking. But it just didn't wash in the Congress. The evidence \nsimply does not support the claim that Mexico met the standard of full \ncooperation in 1996.\n  As all of my colleagues are well aware, Senate procedures made it \nimpossible for us to get a vote on what many of us believed was the \nbest option--to decertify Mexico but allow the\n\n[[Page S2585]]\n\nPresident to waive the sanctions based on what is termed a ``national \ninterest waiver.'' If decertification with a waiver had come up for a \nvote I believe it would have passed the Senate by a large and even \npossibly veto-proof margin. I do not say that lightly. In the House, it \nwould have passed overwhelmingly. Instead, the House passed with over \n250 votes a resolution that decertifies Mexico in 90 days unless \nspecific conditions are met.\n\n  So this resolution, which we will pass today, expresses Congress' \ndeep concern over the lack of progress in key areas of Mexico's \ncounterdrug effort.\n  Let me quote from subsection (c) of the amendment. ``It is the sense \nof the Congress that there has been ineffective and insufficient \nprogress in halting the production in, and transit through, Mexico of \nillegal drugs.''\n  This statement has never before been made by this body and the other \nbody in concert. And I believe it will be, and no one should \nunderestimate what that means.\n  In short, while we could not decertify Mexico, the Congress rejects \nthe administration's claim that Mexico has fully cooperated with the \nUnited States. The evidence I believe is overwhelming. Last week, I \ntried to lay this case out with some specificity, the case that Mexico \nhas not earned decertification. I will not repeat here all of the facts \nto prove that Mexico has not met the test of full cooperation. But let \nme just remind my colleagues of a few of those facts.\n  No. 1, cocaine seizures by Mexican authorities in 1996, 23.6 metric \ntons, were barely half of what they were in 1993 when there were 46.2 \nmetric tons. You see how they have dropped and how they have barely \npicked up this past year.\n  Drug related arrests in 1996 were 11,038, less than half of what they \nwere in 1992. In 1992, what I am saying is that the cooperative effort \non arrests was double what it has been this past year. And these are \nspecific measurements that can't be challenged. They are there. You \nhave to look at them.\n  Another way of measuring this, for those of us that are familiar with \nhow drugs reverberate on streets, is whether street prices are dropping \nor rising. If the street prices for cocaine and for heroin drop on the \nstreets, you know there is more supply.\n  If they rise on the streetcorners of New York and Los Angeles and \nChicago and Dallas and other cities in this Nation, then you know there \nis less supply. Let us for a moment take a major city, a huge city, \nover 6 million people in Los Angeles, and let us look at street prices. \nThe street prices of cocaine today, in Los Angeles, are 22 percent \nlower than they were in 1993. This is for a kilogram, $21,000 in 1993, \ndropping to $16,000 today.\n  Let us take a look at the street value of black tar heroin, almost \nentirely transferred to the United States from Mexico. Here is the \nstreet value of this black tar heroin in California.\n  In 1993, per ounce, it was $1,200. Look at it go straight down. \nToday, it is $400. Part of that is the fact that it is in competition \nwith the pure white cocaine that comes from other places, but still the \nblack tar heroin is heavily used by addicts, and you can see the drop \nin the street price, which clearly means more supply.\n  Then you take the major traffickers. What has happened is that as the \nCali cartels of Colombia become less potent in this area, the Mexican \ncartels have become more potent. Specifically, Senator Coverdell \nenumerated four of them--the Juarez, Tijuana, Sonora, and Gulf cartels. \nAnd our DEA has clearly stated to us in testimony, written and verbal, \nthat the Mexican major drug cartels today are operating with impunity, \nand even the State Department admits that ``the strongest groups such \nas the Juarez and Tijuana cartels have yet to be effectively \nconfronted.''\n  Mexican cartels have assassinated 12 high-level prosecutors and \nsenior law enforcement officers in just the last year. Here is the \nclincher. None of these murders has been solved. Twelve major Federal \nand statewide prosecutors, sometimes the head prosecutor, people who \nwant to do a good job, have been assassinated for doing that good job. \nIt has often been said that those they cannot buy, the cartels will \nkill.\n  Corruption is endemic in Mexico's Government, police, and military. \nThe Mexican drug czar was arrested for corruption as was another senior \narmy general just 2 days ago. DEA Administrator Constantine has said \n``there is not one single law enforcement institution in Mexico with \nwhom DEA has an entirely trusting relationship.''\n  Mexico has enacted money laundering legislation last year. So far the \nlegislation has not been implemented. Banking regulations were finally \nissued last week, 2 months late, but they do not take effect until May, \nand their effectiveness has not yet been evaluated.\n  Mexico has failed to adequately fund the Binational Border Task \nForces agreed to by the two sides in a much touted bilateral meeting, \nand as we all know, to this day Mexico has forbidden our DEA agents \ntaking part in these border task forces, if they cross the border from \nour country to Mexico, to carry sidearms to protect themselves on that \nside of the border.\n  Mexico has refused to allow United States Navy ships patrolling for \ndrug smugglers to put into Mexican ports to refuel without 30 days' \nnotice.\n  The reason this is so important is that if you are trailing a ship, \nwhether it is a fishing vessel or another maritime vessel, you may need \nto pursue it into Mexican waters. More drugs are now coming into our \ncountry via maritime channels. Fishing boats, commercial boats, ships, \nand other maritime transportation devices are today carrying increased \ntonnage of drugs. If we have a Coast Guard ship tracking one of these \nvessels, it may have to put into port--and the Mexican traffickers have \nbecome very sophisticated about moving out, taking the time so that \nthey know the ship following them needs to refuel. If our vessels have \nto put in, they cannot because our ships have to give 30-day notice \nbefore they refuel.\n  Well, of course, one of the biggest tonnages of cocaine transferred \nthrough maritime channels actually was a ship leaving Peru which our \nNavy was able to get to, but the cartels are very smart. They learn how \nto prevent this from happening. So this is an important area.\n\n  And then finally a battle that we have had back and forth--and I \nstill hold fast to this statement--Mexico has never extradited a single \nMexican national to the United States on drug charges despite 52 \nextradition requests, for at least 13 of which the paperwork has been \ncompleted. Now they have made advances, they have begun to extradite \nMexican nationals on other charges, and I think they should be \ncommended for that. But that is not yet full cooperation.\n  So I think the record is clear. It is not credible to make claim that \nMexico has fully cooperated with the United States in combating drug \ntrafficking, and that is the standard required by section 490 of the \nForeign Assistance Act.\n  Despite these facts, the claim has been made by the administration \nthat progress has been made, and I respect that. The administration has \nsaid that they believe some of the things I have just alluded to are in \nthe process of being corrected. That is why originally we felt it was \nso important to have this body be able to monitor progress, comment on \nprogress on September 1 in an expedited way, and make a finding if we \nfound the progress inadequate.\n  That has been removed from this resolution, but the administration \nwill still report on progress. You can be sure that I and others in \nthis body will come to the floor and make our comments on September 2 \nor 3 or 4 or 5 on whether we regard this progress as being adequate.\n  So as we engaged in negotiations with the administration over the \npast week on this resolution, it was extremely important to put into \nplace a mechanism by which we could hold the administration \naccountable. We have compromised here. But we also have 10 specifics. \nSubsection (d) requires the President to support on progress in 10 \nspecific areas--and I urge Members to begin to look at this. It begins \non page 6 of the resolution following this historic statement that ``it \nis the sense of Congress that there has been ineffective and \ninsufficient progress in halting the production and transit through \nMexico of illegal drugs.'' We say that not later than September 1 the \nPresident shall submit to the Congress a report and then we list 10 \nareas of concern to be addressed in the report. Let me outline those 10 \nareas.\n\n[[Page S2586]]\n\n  The first is effective action to dismantle the major drug cartels and \narrest and extradite their leaders. This goes specifically to the two \nmost powerful groups, the Juarez and Tijuana cartels, as well as others \nlike the Sonora and the Gulf cartels.\n  Second, better cooperation between the United States and Mexican law \nenforcement including the funding and deployment of the Binational \nBorder Task Forces and allowing United States agents in these forces to \narm themselves for self-defense. That is the implication. By September \n1 we will know whether it has been achieved or not. The answer then \nwill be yes or no.\n  Third, better enforcement at the border. This means increased \nscreening for and seizures of contraband. It also means, and Senator \nHutchison was very effective in incorporating this into our resolution, \nthat we call for the funding and the assignment of an additional 1,000 \nagents on the border this next year. The administration's budget has \nfunding for 500. Let me say to the administration, from this side of \nthe aisle, that is not adequate. We are asking for 1,000, by official \naction, incorporated in this legislation.\n  Improved cooperation on extraditions--that is the fourth. This goes \nspecifically to the need for Mexico to extradite Mexican nationals who \nare wanted in the United States on drug charges. A good start would be \nthe 13 such requests pending. There are several dozen more on the way. \nOn September 1, we will see how many extraditions there have been.\n  Fifth states easier rules of prosecution of drug traffickers. At the \npresent time, the evidentiary rules in Mexico--and Mexico is aware of \nthis--are such that, in their country it is very difficult to come by a \nconviction.\n  Sixth, full and ongoing implementation of effective money laundering \nlegislation and enforced regulations--for banks and other financial \ninstitutions--these are the money-changing houses outside of banks--\nwith penalties and sanctions for those who do not comply and immunity \nfor those who help, so people who turn in money launderers will not be \nassassinated. We are hopeful--and I commend Mexico for taking action in \nthis regard--we are hopeful that last week's progress in issuing these \nregulations will lead, now, to effective enforcement. We all know it is \none thing to have something on the books, it is another thing to see \nthat something is carried out and enforced. On September 1, Senator \nCoverdell and I and others will both be looking at these. Are they in \nplace? Have they been effected? Have they been enforced?\n  Seventh, increased eradication of drug crops, including marijuana and \nopium--this is the seventh. We hope and expect that eradication figures \nwill increase this year. I believe our Nation is prepared to play a \nrole in any binational cooperation that the Mexican Government would \nwish in that regard.\n  Eighth, implementation of a comprehensive screening program to \nidentify, weed out, and prosecute corrupt officials at all levels of \nthe Mexican Government, police, and military. This means vigorous \nscreening of candidates before they are hired, not rehiring corrupt \npolicemen after their dismissal, and prosecution of those found to be \ncorrupt. We commend Mexico for firing 1,250 law enforcement officers. \nThe problem is, none were prosecuted. That is the problem. And we are \nasking for cooperation.\n  I think it is worth noting that the Los Angeles Times reported \nyesterday that 3 percent of the Mexican police tested positive for drug \nuse in a recent survey. This was 3 percent of Federal personnel \nscreened. I think it added up to some 424 Federal law enforcement \nofficers who failed drug tests. We have that same problem in our \nNation. So we admit it and we try and screen. We are asking our partner \nin Mexico to do the same thing.\n  Ninth, we have a clause in there regarding support by the United \nStates of Mexico's efforts to combat corruption. I cannot conclude \nwithout saying that Mexico has made efforts. I believe Mexico has made \nefforts. I simply question the adequacy of those efforts. But, for \nthose efforts that have been made, we should provide support, and I \nbelieve every Member of this Congress, and certainly this Senate, wants \nto do so. So, this clause reads, ``the rendering of support to Mexico \nin its efforts to identify, remove and prosecute corrupt officials''--\nthey would ask us for that support, but we would certainly say that \nsupport would be forthcoming.\n  The 10th and final provision calls for ``the augmentation and \nstrengthening of bilateral cooperation.'' This is not specific in the \nlaw we are writing. It is nonspecific. At the administration's request, \nwe removed a direct reference to air and maritime cooperation. But I \nthink the record should show that Congress does expect this report to \ndiscuss progress made in areas such as aircraft overflight and \nrefueling rights, aircraft radar coverage, and maritime refueling \nrights.\n\n  I look forward to receiving this report on September 1. The record \nwill reflect that, and Senator Coverdell and I and Senator Hutchison \nand others, come September 1, as sure as the sun will come up, we will \nmake an inquiry to see what the progress has been. And if the Congress \nfinds the progress cited by the administration to be inadequate, it \nwill no doubt find ways to respond.\n  This report, in essence, in addition to the findings carried up front \nin this resolution and the two senses of the Senate, urging the \nPresident on his visit to put forward this new, multilateral \ncooperative, hemispheric drive, if you will, reflect a new strategy, a \nnew plan, new bilateral cooperation, and the specific sense of the \nSenate, and our conclusions as to why we would have to say there has \nnot been full cooperation up to this point.\n  I very much hope, in summary, that there will be a very strong vote \nin this Chamber for this resolution. If it passes, I have been assured \nby John Hilley of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs and \nGeneral McCaffrey, Director of the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy, that the administration will work hard to get this resolution \npassed by the House. If they do, I believe it will pass the House. John \nHilley and General McCaffrey also assured me that the President will \nsign this resolution as passed by the Senate.\n  We, for the first time in history, will have passed a law, not a \nsense of the Senate resolution, but a law which states a purpose, which \nstates a new effort, which states specifics, and which asks that on \nboth the supply side and the demand side there be a new effort by both \nthe United States of America and the sovereign, independent country of \nMexico, to address the drug problem together, both on the demand side \nhere with us and the supply side there with Mexico.\n  It is a very important, significant piece of legislation. I believe, \nI sincerely believe, it can have major, long-term impact. If it does \nnot, the alternative is very clear next year. It is very clear. And it \nwill not be just Senator D'Amato and I next year, or Senator Coverdell \nand I, and Senator Hutchison and others, and hopefully a majority this \nyear. It will be a full-blown effort to see that this progress is \ncarefully evaluated. And whatever action we must take, we will, in \nfact, take.\n  Mr. President, let me express my thanks to the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, for lifting his objection. I know he \nhas very deep and heartfelt feelings about the Chemical Weapons \nConvention. I have said to him informally, and I will say here, I will \ncertainly do everything I possibly can to provide him with any help I \ncan give, to see that it comes to the floor. But I am very pleased he \nhas withdrawn his objection and we will be able to bring this debate to \na conclusion with a vote on this resolution.\n  Mr. President, I ask how much time remains on my hour?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 31 minutes of \ntime remaining.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I yield the floor \nand reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, before the Senator from California \nleaves, I want to express my gratitude for her tireless work. I do want \nto mention, while she is here, a debt I believe we both owe to the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Senator Helms of North \nCarolina hovered over these efforts throughout, and as late as minutes \nbefore an accord was struck,\n\n[[Page S2587]]\n\npersonally heard out all the suggestions that had been made, \ncompromises, and I believe was a major contributor to the conclusion by \nhis attention, concurrence and coauthorship of this provision. I know \nthe Senator from California would acknowledge that as well.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much. I would like to acknowledge \nthat. The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee is, in fact, a \ncosponsor of this legislation. Like me, he had very strong feelings, \nand I know when you have very strong feelings, compromise is difficult. \nHe did do that. I am very thankful, because I think we have a very \nstrong piece of legislation as a result, and his support was certainly \nvital and, I think, crucial to getting this resolution on the floor and \ngetting the vote that, hopefully, we will get. So I thank the Senator \nfrom Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank Senator Feinstein. Mr. President, also thank \nDan Fisk and Elizabeth DeMoss from Senator Helms' Foreign Relation \nCommittee staff, Dan Shapiro with Senator Feinstein, Randy Scheunemann \non the majority leader's staff, and especially Terri Delgadillo and \nSteve Schrage of my staff.\n  I yield up to 10 minutes of my time to the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. President. I commend Senator \nCoverdell, in particular, for his leadership on this issue, his hard \nwork and, along with him, Senator Feinstein, Senator Helms, the \nchairman, Senator McCain, Senator Dodd, Senator Hutchison, and the \nleaders for the hard work they put in. Certainly they put in many, many \nhours working to resolve a very thorny and very difficult issue.\n  Having said that, it is with regret and some reservation that I say I \nbelieve the resolution before us today is totally insufficient. We have \nnow taken a very substantive and meaningful action against a poor \ndecision by the Clinton administration and turned it into a political \nfootball and, Mr. President, I believe we have fumbled the football on \nthe goal line.\n  While I realize the outcome of this vote is evident, it is clear I \ncannot, in good conscience, stay silent and not speak to the \ndeficiencies of the resolution on which we will be casting our votes.\n  As best I can tell, while the resolution says many good things, while \nit says some very meaningful things, when you boil it all down and when \nyou look at it, the essence of what we get from this resolution is a \nreport that we are asking the administration, we are telling the \nadministration to give us in a few months, and that, after all is said \nand done, is all there is to it.\n  I hold in my hand several newspaper accounts, recent newspaper \narticles which raise serious questions as to the efficacy of the \nMexican Government's counternarcotics efforts. Let me just give you \nsome of the headlines:\n  ``Another Mexican General is Arrested and Charged with Links to Drug \nCartel.''\n  ``2nd Mexican General Faces Drug Charges.''\n  ``424 Fail Drug Exams in Mexican Law Enforcement.''\n  The list goes on and on. I ask unanimous consent that these articles \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [The New York Times, Mar. 18, 1997]\n\n  Another Mexican General Is Arrested and Charged With Links to Drug \n                                 Cartel\n\n     (New proof that traffickers have corrupted high levels of \n     Mexico's military)\n\n                           (By Julia Preston)\n\n       Mexico City, March 17.--A Mexican Army brigadier general \n     was arrested today on charges that he offered a multimillion-\n     dollar bribe to a top Mexican law enforcement official on \n     behalf of a notorious cocaine cartel.\n       Brig. Gen. Alfredo Navarro Lara is the second high-ranking \n     military officer to be jailed on drug-related charges in a \n     month. His arrest is new proof that traffickers have \n     succeeded in corrupting the highest levels of the Mexican \n     armed forces.\n       Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, a division general who was the \n     head of the federal drug agency, was arrested on Feb. 18 and \n     accused of protecting and receiving benefits from Mexico's \n     most powerful drug lord, Amado Carrillo Fuentes.\n       Today's arrest also indicates that competing drug gangs \n     have divided the officer corps in their campaign to buy \n     protection. General Navarro Lara is accused of trying to buy \n     off the authorities in the border state of Baja California in \n     the service of the Arellano Felix brothers, a criminal cartel \n     that has waged a bloody war across northern Mexico against \n     the rival band of Mr. Carrillo Fuentes.\n       The only announcement of General Navarro Lara's arrest came \n     in a terse press release tonight by the office of Attorney \n     General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar. Neither Mr. Madrazo nor any \n     Defense Ministry official was available for further comment.\n       According to the release, General Navarro Lara invited the \n     top federal justice official in Baja California to a private \n     meeting in a ``luxurious suite'' in a Tijuana hotel early \n     this month. The general is said to have offered the official, \n     Jose Luis Chavez Garcia, who is also an army brigadier \n     general, payments amounting to $1 million a month in \n     return for cooperation in allowing cocaine and other \n     narcotics to pass through the state en route across the \n     border into the United States.\n       General Navarro Lara is said to have conveyed a threat from \n     the Arellano Felix brothers that they would kill General \n     Chavez Garcia and his family if he refused to agree to the \n     plan.\n       A justice official who formerly held the top post in Baja \n     California, Ernesto Ibarra Santes, was shot dead in Mexico \n     City in September 1996. Several gunmen arrested in that \n     killing were known to be hired members of the Arellano Felix \n     gang.\n       General Navarro Lara was formally charged today with drug \n     trafficking and racketeering and was confined to a maximum \n     security penitentiary on the outskirts of Mexico City. He was \n     described in news reports here as a commander in a military \n     region with headquarters in the central city of Guadalajara, \n     where General Gutierrez Rebollo also served.\n       In his first sworn statements taken at the prison, General \n     Navarro Lara admitted making the bribe offer but said he had \n     not taken any payments from the Arellano Felix brothers and \n     only cooperated with them after they threatened to kill one \n     of his children.\n       The arrest comes as President Ernesto Zedillo is struggling \n     to rebuild Mexico's anti-narcotics program after the \n     devastating arrest of General Gutierrez Rebollo, under \n     pressure from the United States Congress, which is moving to \n     reverse President Clinton's recent decision to certify Mexico \n     as a fully cooperating ally in the drug war.\n       Mr. Zedillo has said he is determined to detect and arrest \n     officials implicated in the drug trade no matter how high \n     their rank.\n       Last week Mr. Zedillo chose a civilian official with no \n     narcotics investigating experience, Mariano F. Herran, to \n     replace General Gutierrez Rebollo as head of the drug agency.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n            [L.A.

The senior officer was accused of \n     offering $1 million a month to Mexico's top counter-narcotics \n     official in Tijuana to protect one of the country's largest \n     drug cartels--and of threatening to kill him and his family \n     if he refused.\n       The attorney general's office announced late Monday that \n     Brig. Gen. Alfredo Navarro Lara had been charged with drug \n     corruption, bribery and criminal association and jailed \n     earlier in the day outside Mexico City in the Almoloya de \n     Juarez high-security federal prison.\n       On Feb. 18, Gen. Jose de Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, then \n     Mexico's anti-drug czar, was sent to Almoloya after he was \n     charged with taking bribes to protect the nation's most \n     powerful drug-trafficking cartel, allegedly headed by Amado \n     Carrillo Fuentes.\n       Gutierrez's arrest last month stunned a nation unaccustomed \n     to drug corruption within its army and sent shock waves as \n     far as Washington just two weeks before the Clinton \n     administration recertified Mexico as a U.S. ally in the drug \n     war. President Clinton cited the arrest as evidence that \n     Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo is committed to rooting out \n     drug corruption--even in the nation's powerful army.\n       But U.S. congressional concerns that widespread official \n     drug corruption here had compromised U.S. intelligence and \n     drug enforcement efforts helped drive the House to pass a \n     resolution decertifying Mexico last week.\n       As the Senate begins debate this week on that \n     decertification resolution--which Clinton has vowed to veto--\n     Navarro's arrest Monday further demonstrated both the depth \n     of drug corruption in Mexico and Zedillo's resolve to punish \n     it.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Mexico Let Suspected Drug Trafficker Move $168 Million Out of Several \n                                 Banks\n\n (By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Laurie Hays and Michael Allen \n              in New York and Craig Torres in Mexico City)\n\n       Mexican officials failed to stop a major suspected drug \n     trafficker from spiriting\n\n[[Page S2588]]\n\n     away $168 million despite a joint U.S.-Mexican effort to \n     freeze his bank accounts, U.S. officials allege.\n       The money transfers, which effectively crippled an \n     ambitious bilateral investigation into Mexican money \n     laundering, came just weeks before President Clinton \n     certified that Mexico was cooperating fully in the \n     international drug fight, U.S. officials say. The episode is \n     likely to fuel congressional criticism of the decision.\n       Clinton administration officials themselves have sharply \n     criticized Mexico's handling of the affair. Testifying before \n     a Senate panel earlier this month, Deputy Treasury Secretary \n     Lawrence Summers said he had registered ``our strong \n     protest'' at the failure to freeze the money.\n       A spokesman for the Justice Department said agency \n     officials, along with those from the State and Treasury \n     departments, had a ``face-to-face confrontation'' with \n     Mexican officials over the incident. He declined to \n     elaborate.\n       Mexican officials involved in the matter disputed the U.S. \n     version of events.\n       The case centers on the Gaxiola Medina family, a prominent \n     clan that runs a local lumber-distribution business in the \n     northern Mexican state of Sonora.\n\n\n                      indictment in united states\n\n       In May 1994, a federal grand jury in Detroit indicted \n     Rigoberto Gaxiola Medina on charges that he ran a trafficking \n     organization that distributed more than 2,200 pounds of \n     marijuana in the U.S. beginning in 1992. The indictment lists \n     25 other defendants.\n       According to the indictment, the operation loaded marijuana \n     on trucks in Tucson, Ariz., and delivered it throughout the \n     U.S. Sales proceeds were allegedly collected in Michigan and \n     wired to Mexican banks.\n\n\n                    banco mexicano and banca serfin\n\n       Mr. Gaxiola Medina didn't enter a plea in the case and \n     couldn't immediately be located for comment.\n       The U.S. Customs Service began a money-laundering \n     investigation into the money transfers in April 1996, \n     according to people familiar with the matter. U.S. agents \n     contacted Mexican Finance Ministry officials, who in turn \n     traced almost $184 million in deposits to 15 Mexican bank \n     accounts. The Finance Ministry put in an official request to \n     the Mexican attorney general's office on Jan. 8 to freeze the \n     accounts, these people add, but when the money was frozen on \n     Jan. 20, only $16 million remained.\n       Customs officials were notified by the Mexicans on Feb. 27 \n     that the money was gone, these people add--one day before the \n     White House's decision to certify Mexico was announced.\n       ``Let's just say we gave them the information and they \n     weren't as successful as everyone would have hoped in seizing \n     it,'' said Allan Doody, director of financial investigations \n     for U.S. Customs. ``I would say the Mexican government is \n     looking into exactly what happened. Right now nobody knows \n     where the money went.''\n       Three Mexican officials involved in the case said it isn't \n     clear when the money left the accounts. They say roughly $183 \n     million arrived from U.S. and Mexican banks into accounts \n     controlled by the Gaxiola Medina family. But the officials \n     deny that most of this money was transferred out of those \n     accounts in 1997. ``The most logical hypothesis is that the \n     money left over a period of time,'' said one official. \n     ``These are high turnover accounts.''\n\n\n                        role of finance ministry\n\n       U.S. officials said they believe the Mexican Finance \n     Ministry, which has authority over certain Mexican money-\n     laundering regulations, acted honorably. Suspicion of \n     wrongdoing centers on the Mexican attorney general's office, \n     which Mexican officials themselves acknowledge is rife with \n     corruption. The Mexican general running the attorney \n     general's antiarcotics program at the time of the incident \n     was later arrested on charges that he took bribes from a \n     powerful drug lord.\n       Reports of the money disappearance first appeared in the \n     Mexican newspaper El Universal.\n       Members of the Gaxiola Medina family couldn't be reached \n     for comment. Regoberto Gaxiola Medina is listed in corporate \n     records as the divisional administrator of the family wood \n     business, known as Grupo Industrial Gaxiola Hermanos SA, but \n     it wasn't immediately clear whether he was the same person \n     indicted in Detroit.\n       Pedro Garcia Palzzuelos, an attorney for the Gaxiola \n     Medinas, said the family businesses naturally deal in large \n     sums of money and foreign exchange. Mexican law-enforcement \n     officials ``didn't encounter any crime related to drug \n     trafficking and they aren't going to find one,'' said Mr. \n     Garcia Palazuelos, adding that there isn't ``proof of money \n     laundering.''\n       U.S. officials have long worried about Mexico's role in \n     laundering drug profits. ``Given the primary methods used to \n     move narcotics proceeds in the mid-90s, Mexico's financial \n     system has become the indispensable money-laundering center \n     for criminal organizations throughout the Americas,'' the \n     State Department wrote in its latest overview of narcotics \n     trends.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, the importance of Mexico's full \ncooperation with the United States antinarcotics efforts cannot, I \nbelieve, be overstated. Drug use among American teenagers has nearly \ndoubled in the last 5 years. More importantly, more than 70 percent of \nillegal narcotics coming into the United States flow through Mexico. I \nknow that many of those drugs originate in Colombia, incidentally, \nwhich we decertified, but 70 percent of those coming into the United \nStates now flow through the nation of Mexico.\n  Mr. President, as we all know, on February 28, the Clinton \nadministration certified that Mexico cooperated fully with United \nStates efforts to combat international narcotics trafficking during \n1996. However, on February 27, the day before, the administration \nreceived a bipartisan letter from 39 Senators--I signed it, Senator \nFeinstein signed it, and many of my colleagues signed it--urging our \nGovernment to deny certification to Mexico. The facts unequivocally \nshow us that Mexico has not--I say, has not--fully cooperated with us.\n  Not one Mexican national out of the 100 or more that the United \nStates wants for trial here on serious drug charges has been extradited \nto the United States, despite our Government's numerous requests. Not \none has been extradited.\n  Our own DEA Administrator, Tom Constantine, has recently said:\n\n       There has been little or no effective action taken against \n     the major Mexico-based cartels. . .\n\n  Then he said:\n\n       The Mexicans are now the single most powerful trafficking \n     group--worse than the Colombian cartels.\n\n  So while we are willing to decertify Colombia, our own DEA \nAdministrator says Mexico is now worse, and we are going to certify \nthem. You explain to me the logic in that, explain to me the \nconsistency in that, explain to me how we, in good conscience, can do \nthat.\n  Mexico's counternarcotics effort is plagued by corruption in the \ngovernment and the national police. Among the evidence are the eight \nprosecutors and law enforcement officials who have been murdered in \nTijuana in recent months. Furthermore, the revelation that General \nRebollo, Mexican's top narcotics official and a 42-year veteran of the \narmed forces, had accepted bribes from the Carrillo-Fuentes cartels \ncasts grave doubts on Mexico's ability to curb corruption at the \nhighest level of its government. Corruption is now, in fact, pervasive \nin the Mexican Government.\n  Mr. President, we in this body must all be well aware that Mexico \ncontinues to be a major transit point for cocaine illegally entering \nthe United States from South America, as well as a major source country \nfor heroin and marijuana.\n  The 1997 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, issued by \nthe United States State Department, explicitly notes that Mexico is the \ntransshipment point for 50 to 60 percent--50 to 60 percent--of the \nUnited States-bound cocaine shipments and up to 80 percent of the meth \nprecursors. This report notes that in 1996, Mexico supplied 20 to 30 \npercent of the heroin and up to 80 percent of the foreign-grown \nmarijuana entering the United States of America.\n  The fact is that four Mexican drug trafficking organizations dominate \nthe narcotics trade between the United States and Mexico. The DEA calls \nthese groups the ``Mexican federation'' and estimates that they gross \n$10 billion to $30 annually in drug sales. Mr. President, those drug \nsales are to our children, to our Nation and to our culture, and they \nthreaten the very future of our Nation.\n  On February 28, 7 hours after the President announced his \ncertification of Mexico, again with the full knowledge of congressional \ndisapproval, Mexico's Attorney General's office issued a statement that \nits own senior officials had released Humberto Garcia Abrego, a reputed \nmoney launderer and brother of convicted drug kingpin, Juan Garcia \nAbrego. We do not know whether he was released earlier--whether it \noccurred on the 28th or earlier--with the announcement being held until \nafter the President's certification decision was made public. But, \nagain, we see how this country has been treated over a decade of this \ncertification process.\n  Mr. President, I ask you, can we not do better? Tom Constantine said, \nin short, there is not one single law enforcement institution in Mexico \nwith whom DEA has an entirely trusting relationship. Can we not do \nbetter than\n\n[[Page S2589]]\n\nthat, certifying a country that cannot fully cooperate with our \ncounterdrug efforts? What message does this send to our children about \nthe seriousness of the drug war? Our children are the real victims of \nthis policy.\n  I have heard the repeated argument that if the narcotics market in \nthe United States was not so bloated, then there would be no reason for \na continual supply of drugs coming across our borders. Supply and \ndemand. Quite frankly, I agree with that assertion. However, let's \ntackle that issue in the crime bill, not on the certification of a \nforeign country not being cooperative with our efforts.\n  I am committed to winning the war on drugs, and we can only do that \nby championing the causes to reduce the amount of drugs in this \ncountry, appropriating funds for antinarcotics efforts, and assisting \nthe DEA in the fight. But Mexico has not been helpful, and that is the \nfact and that is the truth.\n  It is ironic, I think, that while we stand aside and certify Mexico's \nfull cooperation, we pass a resolution that asserts that in fact that \nhas not been the case.\n  I have the joint resolution before me. It says this:\n\n       There is evidence of significant corruption affecting \n     institutions of the Government of Mexico (including the \n     police and military). . . .\n\n  It says this:\n\n       In 1996, the Attorney General of Mexico dismissed more than \n     1,200 Mexico federal law enforcement officers . . . although \n     some were rehired and none [none] has been successfully \n     prosecuted for corruption.\n\n  We are going to say, through the certification of Mexico, that they \nhave been fully cooperative when that is not the reality of the \nresolution that we are passing.\n  We say in the resolution:\n\n       The Government of Mexico has recently approved, but has yet \n     to implement fully, new and more effective legislation \n     against organized crime and money laundering.\n\n  That is what we say in the resolution we are going to vote for, which \nflies absolutely in the face of the certification of Mexico.\n  The resolution says:\n\n       Drug cartels continue to operate with impunity in Mexico, \n     and effective action needs to be taken. . . .\n\n  And yet we are going to certify Mexico as being fully cooperative and \nmaking progress.\n  We have a resolution that we are going to vote on that says:\n\n       Cocaine seizures and arrests of drug traffickers in Mexico \n     have dropped since 1992.\n\n  So while we say that arrests and seizures are down, we are going to \nsay that we are going to certify them as making progress and being \nfully cooperative.\n  Then on page 6 of the resolution, the sense-of-Congress portion of \nthe resolution, we say:\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that there has been ineffective \n     and insufficient progress in halting the production in and \n     transit through Mexico of illegal drugs.\n\n  While we say that, we stand aside and allow certification to take \nplace.\n  I ask Mr. Coverdell, who controls this time, for 5 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield 5 additional minutes to the \nSenator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. So while we say in the resolution it is our sense \nthey have been ineffective and there has been insufficient progress, we \nallow certification to go forward, which says in fact they have been \nmaking progress and that they have been fully cooperative.\n  To my colleagues I simply say, I think that is inconsistent, I think \nthat is intellectually dishonest, and it is unfortunate, and it does a \ndisservice to the citizens and our constituents whom we serve.\n  We pass a resolution asserting that they have failed, that they have \nnot made progress, and then we allow certification to go forward.\n  How can we reconcile our treatment of the nation of Colombia a year \nago and decertify and with a straight face now certify Mexico through \nwhich 70 percent of the illegal drugs flow into this country? You do \nit. I cannot.\n  I believe that this certification process has become a sham. It is \nintellectually dishonest to move forward with that. The entire \nresolution upon which we will be voting contradicts that \ncertification--two standards--that they have been fully cooperative and \nthey have been making progress. We pass a resolution that says they \nhave not been fully cooperative and they have not been making adequate \nprogress. You reconcile that. I cannot. I yield the floor.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield up to 10 minutes of my time to the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask the Senator, how much time do you have?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Let me ask the Chair. I assume about 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 29 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, under those conditions, I ask that you \nnotify me when I have used 7 minutes. I do not think I should use 10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n7 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, about 4 years ago I came to the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate--I did not check for the exact date, but I came to the \nfloor to congratulate and praise Mexico. In particular, I was \npraiseworthy of their then-President Carlos Salinas.\n  I even said on the floor of this Senate that, man for man, I thought \nhe had the best Cabinet in the free world. In fact, I chose some of his \nCabinet members because of their tremendous intellectual capacity and \ngreat training and compared them with our then-Cabinet members and \nsaid, I am pleased to tell the Senate that for the first time in \nhistory they probably have a better Cabinet than the United States of \nAmerica.\n  For those people in Mexico who wonder how Senators like Senator \nDomenici have become more and more concerned about what is going on in \nMexico, let me suggest that it was a very serious letdown to this \nSenator. It was a serious letdown having made statements like that, to \nfind out what they were doing and what that pinnacle of free enterprise \nand privatization, a graduate of our best schools of economics, Carlos \nSalinas, was all about.\n  So it was that just a few weeks ago, as one Senator, I joined in \nsaying to the President that he should not certify Mexico as being in \ncompliance and cooperating fully.\n  But I would remind my good friend, the new Senator from Arkansas, \nthat we in the Congress do not certify. The President certifies. What \nhappened, even with many of us saying he should not, the President \ncertified that Mexico was in cooperation and compliance.\n  So now we are confronted with the situation where our own President \nand all of those who work for him, including a very able drug czar, \nGen. Barry McCaffrey, have told us that the best thing we can do is \nkeep the pressure on Mexico, but not to proceed with decertification \nfrom our end on the legislative side because in their opinion, instead \nof making matters better, it will make matters worse. Instead of \ncausing more cooperation, it will cause less. Instead of causing Mexico \nto work with us in many areas that they are working in that we are now \nall becoming familiar with, it will force them politically to sever \nthose kinds of relationships and to go their own way.\n  Might I remind fellow Senators, all of this is happening in the \ncontext of an election in Mexico which is going to take place in the \nnot-too-distant future.\n  Fellow Senators, I understand Mexico. My State borders Mexico. For \nthose who wonder whether I know about their culture, I would remind you \nthat 38 to 40 percent of the residents of my State speak the Spanish \nlanguage. While many of them are truly Hispanics from Spain, there are \nmany who are Mexicans. But in all respects, I understand the \nrelationship of Mexico and its populace, to the United States. I \nunderstand how they feel about us in terms of whether we really are \ntheir friends or are we the big giant to the north who is always trying \nto tell them what to do?\n  So I have come to the conclusion, absolutely and unqualifiedly, that \nit is\n\n[[Page S2590]]\n\nbetter for us not to override the President but to go ahead and state \nour case, state our case in a resolution and then say godspeed to the \nPresident and General McCaffrey and all the others. Let us see if we \ncan get better cooperation between these two great neighbors in the \nnext few years.\n  I remind everyone the best experts now say we are not going to fix \nthis drug problem with Mexico where all of these drugs come flowing \ninto our States.\n  I might say to my friend, Senator Coverdell, they are pouring into my \nState, you can be assured, and into the principal city, although it is \na couple hundred miles from the border, Albuquerque. We have never had \nso many murders and gang slayings and drug addictions as we have now \nbecause we are at the crossroads of the two interstate highways, both \nof them leading in some way to the south toward Mexico.\n  So I am aware of that. But I came to the floor to make sure that \nMexico understands that we have once again--and I hope it will be \nrather unanimous in the Senate--that we have come to the conclusion \nthat we want to urge our nations to cooperate and we are urging, if not \nbegging, Mexico to do what it can to be more cooperative and do more to \nalleviate this scourge on our people.\n  I want to also say that the current President of Mexico, Ernesto \nZedillo is a very competent man. Some say he is not a good enough \npolitician. But indeed he has a good enough brain and a good enough \ncommitment to that country. I believe--and here again I hope I am \nright--that he is absolutely honest, that he is truly dedicated to \nclean up what he can clean up in Mexico.\n  President Zedillo I hope you will do that. And I hope America is \nthere helping you rather than hindering you as you attempt to do that.\n  This resolution is a good resolution because it requires that \nsometime in September a full report will be sent to the Congress of the \nUnited States by our President, indicating whether there has been \nprogress made in the many areas cited in this resolution. We are \nclearly laying before the Mexican leaders what we hope is a \nconstructive resolution, by saying these are the kinds of things where \nwe must see some progress.\n  We will be around for another day. The Mexican Government knows that. \nThe President will be around next year and have to decide on \ncertification again. I think the President understands that we are not \nexpecting certification to come easy and to be a matter of course or \never just be a matter of whatever the State Department recommends. We \nare moving in the direction of saying we should be honest about it.\n  For now, most of us who urged that the President not certify, we have \nall come to the same conclusion. We want to lay before the American \npeople and the Mexican people and their government what we think is \ngoing wrong in Mexico and say we want to help with it. We want to say \nthat we are willing to stand back and do what we can in our \nappropriation process with the things we must do on the border for law \nenforcement, but we are also saying to Mexico, you can count on it. We \nare doing this because our President urges us to. Gen. Barry McCaffrey, \nthe drug czar, urges us to. The State Department urges us to. But we \nare going to hold all of them accountable, not just Mexico.\n  We are expecting our Government to say the Senate really is serious \nand we should do something about these areas. I must say to our \nGovernment, we really risk future action by the U.S. Senate--I do not \nspeak for the House--if we do not get some real performance and some \nhonest evaluation in this report that we are requesting here.\n  That is why I am here. I feel this will do more good in our efforts \nto work binationally with Mexico. We need to work with Mexico on myriad \nfronts--those affecting this drug scourge that is flowing into American \ncities and thus into our young people and Americans across the board.\n  I thank Senator Coverdell for his leadership, and the distinguished \nSenator from California.\n  It was a pleasure to help you get the letter signed. I think I got a \nfew Senators, and I am pleased to have been on that. I believe our \ncollective work will bring forth positive fruit both for us and for \nMexico.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Mexico for his generous \nremarks and his long work on this subject.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the hour of 4:45 p.m., \nthe Senate proceed to a vote on amendment No. 25, and immediately \nfollowing that vote, the joint resolution be read for a third time and \npassed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, all \nwithout intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, rule XII is waived and the \nagreement is entered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and \nI ask unanimous consent that the quorum time be applied proportionately \nto all who have time reserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I, too, would like to commend the \ndistinguished Senator from the State of California, Dianne Feinstein, \nas well as the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Coverdell, and those who I \nbelieve in good faith have come together with this agreement. I respect \ntheir work. I know their purpose and their intent.\n  I do not know whether other Senators will vote in opposition to this \nagreement on this day. I do not know if there are any, but I will not \nvote for it. I want, Mr. President, to make clear my reasons, because I \nlook at the same facts and I simply come to a different conclusion.\n  I remember, Mr. President, being told at the end of the cold war we \nwere going to be free of some of the compromises of our own interests \nwhich were necessary when we were defending ourselves in that great \ninternational struggle. We would be able to speak the truth again and \nto put our own interests of our own people first.\n  This is a test of that principle. It is argued that to tell the truth \nabout Mexico and to decertify Mexico as an ally in the war against \nnarcotics would involve offending Mexican sensibilities. Given the \nrealities of Mexican history or the Mexican political situation, it \nwould cause political complications.\n  Mr. President, the question is not whether or not Mexico would be \noffended by a truthful analysis. The issue raised is whether or not \nMexico is an ally in the war against narcotics. That is the only \nquestion that was asked. It is the only question that is relevant.\n  The truth is unmistakable. Mexico is not assisting, is not an ally in \nthe war against narcotics, and saying that it is or postponing the \njudgment, as would be done by this resolution, does not escape that \ntruth.\n  The truth, Mr. President, is that 14,000 Americans die every year \nfrom illegal narcotics. If this judgment is to be postponed until \nSeptember 1, and March, April, May, June, July, and August are to pass, \nthen another 7,000 Americans will be consumed in the spiral of death by \nillegal narcotics, and they will have died while we maintain a false \nconclusion.\n  What is it, Mr. President, we would say to the law enforcement \nofficers from New York to Los Angeles to Chicago, to small towns all \nacross America, to DEA agents around the world, who risk their lives \nevery day facing the truth, if we will not face the truth?\n  Mexico has had an opportunity in the last year to choose sides in the \nwar against narcotraffickers. They had a choice when the United States \nfiled 52 extradition requests with the Mexican Government and no one \nwas extradited. They had a choice when is 250 Mexican law endorsement \nofficers were dismissed from their positions because of corruption, and \nnone were prosecuted. They had a choice when the Mexican Congress \npassed money laundering statutes which were not enforced. Mr. \nPresident, Mexico has had a choice every day for the last year.\n  Now, it may be the will of this institution to give them another 6 \nmonths\n\n[[Page S2591]]\n\nto make that choice again. I believe, Mr. President, that given the \nextensive corruption in the Mexican Government, the compromising of \nMexican law enforcement officials, and their pervasive operation of \nnarcotrafficking criminal organizations in Mexico, Mexico may now not \nonly lack the will, but may no longer possess the ability to control \nthe flow of narcotics to the United States. We cannot construct a \npolicy of interdicting narcotics in Mexico by becoming part of a silent \nconspiracy, where Mexico pretends to be helping interdict narcotics and \nwe pretend to believe them.\n  This judgment gets no less painful after 6 more months pass than it \nwill be today. It was said, Mr. President, during the cold war that the \nUnited States and the Soviet Union went eye to eye and America never \nblinked. The United States and Mexico are now facing a war against \nnarcotics, and we have made an unfortunate decision to turn our face \naway from the truth. The proper action of this Senate, in my judgment, \nwould be to vote to decertify Mexico and place both Mexico and those \nwho influence her on notice that a price will be extracted for the \ndeaths of 14,000 Americans every year by illegal narcotics, a price \nwill be extracted for failing to choose sides in the war against \nnarcotics.\n  Mr. President, I know this is a difficult decision for every Member \nof the Senate. But we do not face the hardest choices. The real choices \nare made by our agents in the Drug Enforcement Administration, by those \non border control, by the families who wait up every night to see \nwhether their fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters in law \nenforcement in our cities and on our borders will come home alive. Our \nchoice is easy. Look at the facts, review the evidence, and tell the \ntruth. There is an open season on the American border for narcotics. \nCalling Mexico an ally in the war against drugs will not make them a \nfriend and not force them to choose sides. This is a painful choice \nthat must be made by the citizens of Mexico and her business and \npolitical leaders. If some are voting for this postponement of judgment \nuntil September 1 because they believe it would cause political \nproblems for the PRI, the current political leadership of Mexico, then \nlet it be so.\n  We serve no American or Mexican purpose by hiding from judgment the \ncurrent political leadership of Mexico. It is a moment of truth by our \nown people. If elements of the leadership are corrupted or compromised \nagainst the interests of not only other nations against fighting \nnarcotics, but against defending Mexico in the interests of our own \npeople, then let the Mexican people understand that truth and vote \naccordingly. That is the decision, Mr. President. I believe that we \npostpone not only recognizing the truth about Mexico's participation in \nthe war against drugs, but we postpone, by our silence, the Mexican \npeople realizing the truth about their own government, at a time of \npolitical judgment in the Mexican electoral system.\n  For Mexican interests and for American interests, I will vote against \nthis resolution.\n  A long time ago, we came to the decision that there would be a war \nagainst drugs. In wars, there are casualties. At the moment, the \nprincipal casualties are our own children and the police officers of \nour own country. It would be unfortunate if some in the Mexican \npolitical establishment have to face the wrath of their own people, or \nif the good name of Mexico is compromised. Perhaps, Mr. President, they \nwill be added to the list of victims in the war against drugs. No war \nis ever won without casualties. It's time to get serious in the war \nagainst drugs. I believe decertifying Mexico is an important step.\n  Mr. President, I will vote accordingly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall time be equally divided on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  In the last few weeks, the Congress has spent considerable time \nconsidering Mexico. A great deal has been said and a number of \nproposals are on the table about how to respond to the President's \ndecision to certify Mexico as fully cooperating.\n  These proposals include a resolution to simply decertify Mexico. And \na resolution that would put on record the Congress' concern about the \nlack of visible progress on drugs. We also have a House proposal that \nis critical of the administration. This proposal would create another \nminicertification process. That means we get to have this discussion on \nMexico all over again in September based on a report to follow the \nPresident's summit in Mexico next month.\n  In my view, these various proposals reflect a generalized concern \nabout Mexican cooperation and a lack of consensus on how best to \nrespond.\n  We need to ask ourselves where we began on this issue. The whole \nreason for this debate grows out of a simple fact. Congress did not \naccept the President's decision on Mexico. Many in Congress doubt the \nwillingness or ability of Mexico to fight drugs. In response, Congress \nsought to exercise its legal obligations under the Foreign Assistance \nAct to find a means to overturn his decision. The means available were \nnot satisfactory. Thinking in the Senate does not seem to favor a \nstraight up-or-down decertification of Mexico. In addition, any such \neffort, even if it should pass both Houses, will face a veto. Congress \ndoes not have the votes to override. Thus, our options on how to \nproceed have narrowed.\n  Many people have compared the decision to decertify Colombia with the \ndecision to certify Mexico. They have pronounced the process unfair \nsince both countries have corruption problems but they were judged \ndifferently. While that is true, the basic reason is that the \nsituations are not the same. The reason for decertifying Colombia was \nbased on reasonably convincing evidence of corruption at the highest \nlevels of Government. We do not have parallel information on Mexico. On \nthe other hand, when you look at the same categories of achievement or \ncooperation, Mexico scores at least as well as Colombia on most of \nthem. This is not to say that we should be content with what Mexico has \ndone. I do not believe that Mexican officials are content. Nor do I \nthink they take any pride in recent revelations about high-level \ncorruption. My point is that we should not be hasty in making decisions \nabout a country with whom we are so closely linked. We should not rush \nto decisions involving our third largest trading partner.\n  Instead, I offered an approach that I believe was both reasonable and \nresponsible. It would have maintained our concern for accountability \nbut it did not create yet more certification procedures for us to have \nto get through. And I doubt that circumstances will be any less \nambiguous 90 or 120 days from now. My proposal did establish clear \nguidelines whereby we all--Mexico, Congress, and the public--could \njudge the state of cooperation using the same terms of reference. This \nproposal would have kept the process that Congress created. We created \nthat process with clear intent and deliberation. I do not think it is \ntime to change that. It is not time for the proposed experiment in \nGovernment currently on the table. Given where we started, it does not \nachieve what we said we expected at the outset. Nevertheless, it is the \nonly proposal on the table. Thus we come to this vote.\n  I will vote for this joint resolution with reservations. I will look \nforward, however, to working with my collegaues in the future for a \nformula that ensures accountability within a\n\n[[Page S2592]]\n\nframework that permits informed decisionmaking.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will support the bi-partisan \ncompromise crafted by Senators Feinstein, Coverdell and the \nadministration because I believe the United States must signal the \nMexican Government that the status quo is no longer acceptable in \nregard to anti-narcotics cooperation. The massive and growing influx of \nillegal drugs into this country from Mexico is a significant threat to \nboth of our countries and it must be stopped.\n  Prior to the President's decision to certify Mexico, I joined 40 of \nmy Senate colleagues in writing to the President and urging him to \ndecertify Mexico because of its abysmal record --a record which \nincludes a complete failure to extradite nationals wanted for drug \ncrimes in this country, as well as rampant corruption at all levels of \nthe anti-drug effort. The arrest last month of Mexico's top anti-drug \nofficial on charges that he was on the payroll of one of Mexico's \nlargest drug cartels illustrates the nature and extent of this problem. \nFurther, I am deeply concerned about Mexico's decision to replace much \nof its national police force, which was removed due to widespread \ncorruption, with the Mexican military, an organization with a very poor \nrecord in regard to human rights offenses.\n  Mexico may well be a significant economic partner with the United \nStates, but the current level of illegal drugs entering this Nation \nunabated from the south is simply unacceptable. Our economic \npartnership with Mexico should not include the flourishing drug trade \nwhich currently uses Mexico as a primary transit point. While I believe \nthe President should not have certified Mexico, I support the Feinstein \ncompromise because, in light of the Administration's decision, it \nrepresents the only legitimate opportunity to hold the Mexican \nGovernment accountable. I will watch the actions of our southern \nneighbor very closely over the coming months in the sincere hope that \nthe Mexican Government will rededicate itself to join the United States \nin our effort to deal with illicit narcotics which infect both of our \nnations.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues on the \nForeign Relations Committee in bringing forward this compromise \nresolution with regard to Mexico and the narcotics issue.\n  At the outset, I want to compliment the Senators who have been deeply \ninvolved in the negotiations on this matter--the chairman of the \ncommittee, the Senator from Georgia, the Senator from California, and \nthe Senator from Texas.\n  They and many other Senators have a deep and abiding concern about \nthe serious threat that drug trafficking in Mexico posts to both that \ncountry and the United States.\n  Indeed, we all agree, I suspect, on several issues.\n  First, it is clear that we cannot overstate the role of Mexico as a \nsource for narcotics. Mexico is the primary transit route for cocaine \nentering the United States, a major source country for heroin, \nmethamphetamines, and marijuana, and a major money laundering center \nfor illicit profits from the narcotics trade.\n  Second, I believe we agree that the United States bears a significant \nresponsibility for combating the narcotics trade. Undeniably, the \ndemand for narcotics in this country spurs the narcotics trade. But we \nare not solely to blame for Mexico's ills.\n  As the Mexican Government continually reminds us, Mexico is a \nsovereign nations, and it has the responsibility to do all that it can \nto confront the threat of the powerful drug cartels--cartels which now \nhave considerable influence in Mexican society.\n  Third, we agree that corruption in Mexican law enforcement is \nendemic. That corruption is deeply rooted, as even Mexican President \nZedillo acknowledged in his State-of-the-Nation address last fall.\n  Fourth, we all agree that Mexico must do much, much more in the war \non drugs--as the White House acknowledged last month when the President \nmade his certification.\n  All this leads to the fundamental question now facing us: What can \nCongress do to help us achieve our objective of reducing the flow of \nnarcotics from Mexico to the United States?\n  I was disappointed that the President certified that Mexico had met \nthe standard of fully cooperating, or taking adequate steps on its own. \nThe systemic corruption in Mexico, combined with several failures to \nfollow through on commitments made, argued against granting Mexico a \nfull stamp of approval. Instead, I urged the President to invoke the \nnational waiver, because I believed that our interests would be better \nserved by not isolating ourselves from Mexico--which would surely occur \nwere we to fully decertify Mexico. For my part, I believe it could have \nlong-lasting, damaging repercussions that we cannot now predict. At a \nminimum, it would inhibit the political space that President Zedillo \nhas to press forward with his agenda of reform.\n  And if we destroy President Zedillo's political resolve to combat the \ndrug traffickers, we will have achieved nothing--and we may well lose \nthe gains we have recently made. In other words, decertification and \nexercising the full penalties possible under decertification offers a \ncure that appears to be worse than the disease.\n  I am pleased that we have come to a bipartisan agreement--reached \nlast night in negotiations with the administration--on the best way \nforward. The resolution recognizes the aspects of the issue that I have \nstated--specifically that both countries must take strong action to \ncombat the scourge of narcotics. In addition, the resolution lays out \nseveral benchmarks--a set of policies that we expect both the Mexican \nGovernment and the United States Government to undertake in the coming \nmonths.\n  For example, it makes clear that Mexico must implement its recently \nenacted anti-crime laws, including the new money laundering statute and \nthe organized crime law. In addition, Mexico must investigate and \nprosecute official corruption at all levels of government--and we must \ndo all we can to assist Mexico in that effort. And Mexico must deny \nsafe haven to persons and organizations responsible for drug \ntrafficking.\n  These and many other measures--if vigorously implemented--will be \ncritical to strengthening the effort against the drug trade.\n  Mr. President, we have a major problem in Mexico. It is, in part, the \nresult of our success in reducing the flow of narcotics through the \nCaribbean and Florida--and our success, in cooperation with the \nGovernment of Colombia, in dismantling the major cartels in that \ncountry. The emergence of powerful cartels in Mexico is a manifestation \nof the so-called balloon effect--if you pressure the drug traffickers \nin one area, they will move to another. Unfortunately, the traffickers \nare nothing if not resilient.\n  The result, for both Mexico and the United States, is the expansion \nof organized crime syndicates that have considerable power and \ninfluence over not only the drug trade, but also Mexican society \nitself. Combating this development will require a major commitment--of \nresources and political will--by both our Government and the Mexican \nGovernment.\n  The cooperation we have received from Mexico in the past year is far \nfrom perfect. We all acknowledge that. But we have made important \nprogress in the past few years, and this measure will be an important \ncontribution to spurring even greater cooperation between our two \nGovernments.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senators from \nGeorgia, California, and Texas were able to reach agreement with the \nadministration on a resolution addressing certification of Mexico's \ncooperation in fighting illegal drugs. I have been strongly opposed to \na straight or even qualified decertification, which I believe would \nhave undermined U.S. interests and been counterproductive in our \nefforts to address the scourge of illegal drug use in America.\n  I am not here to argue that the situation in Mexico today, with \nrespect to drug trafficking, is in any way acceptable or serves United \nStates interests. The Senators from California, Georgia, and many \nothers deserve commendation for speaking out strongly about the \ndeteriorating condition surrounding anti-drug efforts in Mexico, and \nthe critical imperative that Mexico take stronger action to stem the \nflow of illegal drugs across its border into the\n\n[[Page S2593]]\n\nUnited States. The statistics with which we have become familiar are \nalarming and worsening: 10.9 percent of children in the United States \nbetween 12 and 17 years of age use illegal drugs; Mexico is the source \nof 70 percent of the marijuana shipped into the United States, and is a \ntransit point for between 50 percent and 70 percent of the cocaine \nshipped into our Nation; drug arrests and drug seizures in Mexico are \nonly half of what they were just 4 to 5 years ago; there are 52 \noutstanding United States extradition requests for drug dealers in \nMexico, although few, if any, Mexican nationals have been extradited to \nthe United States on drug charges; drug-related corruption has reached \nthe highest levels of the Mexican Government, with the recent arrest of \nMexico's highest ranking antidrug official.\n  Mr. President, I could go on, but the fact is clear: the Mexican \nGovernment, in partnership with the United States, must do a better job \nof stopping illegal drug production and trafficking. The 10 billion \ndollars' worth of narcotics that is illegally smuggled from Mexico into \nthe United States each year must be sharply reduced, or even better, \neliminated.\n  But let's be clear about one thing: Solely addressing the situation \nin Mexico--the ``supply side'' of the drug problem--is incomplete and \ninsufficient. Precious little time in the debate on decertification has \nbeen devoted to addressing the demand side of this problem, that is, \nthe tragic, insatiable appetite for illegal drugs in the United States. \nIf there were no demand for illegal drugs here at home, the drug \nkingpins and cartel chiefs that have caused so much misery, would be \nunemployed. A Washington Post editorial earlier this month makes this \npoint clear, stating ``the demand equation remains the true frontline \nof the war on drugs.'' I am pleased that the language agreed to in \nthese negotiations at least in part addresses this critical aspect of \nour fight against drugs. We would be remiss in not putting today's \ndebate in its proper perspective.\n\n  Nevertheless, Congress is right to speak out in an appropriate manner \non the deterioration of antidrug efforts in Mexico, and the need to \ntake concrete measures to stem this tide. I would argue that much--not \nenough, but much--has already been done: the drug certification law \npassed in 1986, while imperfect, has produced a framework that can \nproduce real results. Nations that receive United States and \ninternational assistance are each year held to a very large measure of \naccountability for their cooperation with the United States in \ncombating drugs. The specter of losing most United States foreign aid \nand having IMF and World Bank loans vetoed is certainly a strong \nincentive for governments such as Mexico to cooperate with us and take \nneeded action.\n  Despite all of the problems in Mexico, there is evidence that the \ncertification law has compelled Mexico to do more than it would have \ndone were the law not in place. President Zedillo, in particular, has \ntaken a number of steps, including the arrest and firing of thousands \nof corrupt and criminal individuals in Mexico. His Government has also \neradicated an area the equivalent of 5\\1/2\\ times the island of \nManhattan. Finally, President Zedillo has declared the drug cartels and \nthe corruption associated with them to be Mexico's principal national \nsecurity threat. But more needs to be done, and the Clinton \nadministration has the appropriate tools available at its disposal to \nmake further progress on achieving some very important goals. The \namendment before us today not only maintains the administration's \nability to enhance its cooperation with Mexico, but provides for needed \naccountability to Congress and the American people.\n  On February 28, President Clinton certified to Congress that the \nGovernment of Mexico was fully cooperating with the United States in \nantidrug efforts. The question before the Senate during the past \nseveral weeks is should we overrule the President's decision and \ndecertify Mexico? I have argued that, despite the deteriorating \nsituation in Mexico, congressional decertification is the wrong \napproach, and would actually be counterproductive in solving these \nproblems. I am gratified that the authors of the original \ndecertification resolution have made significant compromises with the \nadministration so that such a vote has been avoided.\n  Decertification would have been a slap in the face to our diplomats, \nwho have labored, often painstakingly, to prod the Mexicans to help us \ncrack down on illicit drug trafficking. Not only would it upset these \ndelicate diplomatic efforts, a straight decertification would incite \nthe well-known nationalistic political forces in Mexico, making it even \nmore difficult for President Zedillo to further cooperate with us in \nachieving the goals all of us share. If it's difficult to work with \nMexico now, I shudder to think what would have happened if Congress had \noverruled the administration by passing a straight or even qualified \ndecertification.\n  I prefer instead to entrust our diplomats with the task of \nnegotiating expanded antidrug efforts with the Mexicans, rather than \nhoping that decertification, even if sanctions were waived, would \ncompel action on their part. As the March 3 Washington Post editorial \nstates, decertification is ``a blunt instrument poorly designed for the \ndelicate political work of drug enforcement. . . . A nationalistic \nreaction is the inevitable result.'' I ask unanimous consent that this \neditorial be printed in the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, March 3, 1997]\n\n                         A Fine Line for Mexico\n\n       President Clinton drew a fine line, but a sensible one, \n     between certifying Mexico and decertifying Columbia as a \n     reliable partner of the United States in fighting drug \n     trafficking. The record of both Latin countries in stemming \n     the dread trade is sad. But at least the Mexican government \n     is demonstrably trying--it had the political courage to \n     arrest its corrupted drug policy chief on the eve of the \n     certification proceedings--while the president of Colombia is \n     established as the creature of a drug cartel. Mr. Clinton \n     decided that President Ernesto Zedillo's capacity to do \n     better would be strengthened by certification and that \n     President Ernesto Samper was beyond redemption. It is an \n     arguable decision, but it fits the exigencies of the American \n     certification law, and it also fits the facts.\n       By now it is accepted in the White House and elsewhere in \n     the administration that the American certification law is a \n     blunt instrument poorly designed for the delicate political \n     work of drug enforcement. In a hemisphere where the premise \n     of effective diplomacy is to respect the sovereign equality \n     of member states, this law brings American power to bear on \n     supply and transit states without either consulting them or \n     providing them a reciprocal opportunity to pass judgment on \n     American policy. A nationalistic reaction is the inevitable \n     result. Still it is the law, and the president is bound to \n     enforce it. Secretary of State Madeline Albright, in \n     announcing the administration's decision on Friday, \n     acknowledge the obligation of the United States to press \n     ahead with its own strategy to reduce demand--a strategy it \n     had introduced, to something less than full public attention, \n     earlier in the week. The demand equation remains the true \n     front line of the war on drugs.\n       Mexico was unconditionally certified as an American drug-\n     fighting partner. So it is not exposed either to the \n     political rebuke or to the economic penalties that follow \n     from being de-certified. But Mexico is far from being in the \n     clear. Mrs. Albright publicly listed the particular policy \n     areas (capture and extradition of kingpins, money laundering \n     and so on) in which the United States expects to see Mexican \n     progress, and which she, the attorney general and the anti-\n     drug chief will monitor.\n       A considerable number of legislators have indicated that \n     they will attempt to reverse the administration's \n     certification of Mexico. They should ask themselves how such \n     a gesture, satisfying as it might be for the moment, actually \n     would serve their cause, and what effect it might have in \n     other areas of policy--trade, immigration, environment--where \n     good relations with Mexico are vital to American interests.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the amendment before us today represents a \nfar more prudent approach to this sensitive issue. It outlines in \ndetail the serious problems involved in Mexico today, and makes it \nclear that further progress is needed. However, instead of simply \nclubbing Mexico and walking away, this amendment sets very specific \nbenchmarks for improved antidrug efforts by Mexico, and requires a \nprogress report from the administration by September 1. Among other \nthings, this report must describe the extent to which our two nations \nhave made significant and demonstrable progress on dismantling drug \ncartels, improving law enforcement relationships, and increasing \ncooperation on\n\n[[Page S2594]]\n\nextradition of Mexican drug dealers wanted in the United States. The \namendment makes it entirely clear both to this administration and to \nMexico where the failings have been and what our priorities are. \nHowever, under this compromise, nationalist forces will not be incited \nin Mexico, and our diplomatic efforts can continue smoothly.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment. Thank you.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I think the process that has culminated in \nthis amendment has shown that however well-intentioned, the drug \ncertification process is poorly conceived. Mexico is clearly not \ncooperating in the counternarcotics effort as it should. How can it, \nwhen practically the highest ranking Mexican officials responsible for \ndealing with the problem are profiting from the drug trade themselves?\n  But decertifying Mexico would cause more problems than it would \nsolve, by creating resentment with the very people with whom we are \nseeking to build stronger relations.\n  I will vote for the amendment, but I want to stress that I am very \ndisappointed that the administration has not acted more forcefully and \nvisibly to encourage the Mexican Government to deal effectively with \nthe corruption and human rights abuses committed by Mexico's police and \narmed forces. We should send a strong signal to Mexico that this will \nno longer be ignored. I would have favored a stronger resolution than \nthis, as I know many others would have, including the resolution's \nsponsor, but I hope the Mexican Government appreciates the seriousness \nwith which we regard these concerns.\n  The reports of rampant corruption among Mexican military and law \nenforcement officials, and the human rights abuses they have been \ninvolved in, are alarming, as are reports of growing paramilitary \nactivity in Mexico. I am concerned that, with United States support, \nMexico is blurring the line between its police and armed forces. I am \nalso concerned that our ability to monitor the equipment we provide to \nMexico is inadequate. I have urged the administration to be very \nspecific in its agreements for the transfer of equipment to the Mexican \npolice or armed forces, so there is no ambiguity that it is to be used \nfor counternarcotics activities and not counterinsurgency activities. \nThose agreements should also specify that if members of police or \nmilitary units that receive our assistance are implicated in abuses, \nthey will be immediately removed and steps taken to bring them to \njustice. We have done this recently in agreements with Colombian \nofficials, and there is no reason why it could not be done in Mexico.\n  The United States and Mexico must work together to combat this \nproblem. But while I and others expect far more from the Mexican \nGovernment to deal with corruption and the violence perpetrated by \ntheir own agents, unless we curb the demand in our own country, drug \nabuse will remain a national crisis.\n  In the last 10 years, the United States has spent $103 billion on \nprograms here and abroad against drugs. Yet the DEA reports that the \namount of cocaine entering the country, as well as the rates of heroin \nand cocaine abuse among Americans, have remained steady. Again, the \nevidence is clear. We will not solve this problem until we aggressively \ndeal with the causes of drug use and addiction in our own country.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank Senators Dodd, Feinstein, Coverdell, \nKerry, McCain, and Hutchison who have worked very hard to reach a \ncompromise on this difficult issue.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Mexico \nresolution.\n  I think it offers a constructive solution to the bilateral problem we \nare facing. It gives the President of the United States an opportunity \nto discuss with President Zedillo of Mexico the various concerns many \nof us have about the progress our two countries are making in the drug \nwar. And it does so without provoking unnecessary and counterproductive \ntensions between our countries.\n  The problems in Mexico's drug enforcement are well known. You can \nhardly open a newspaper without learning about even more instances of \ncorruption and incompetence at all levels of government and law \nenforcement.\n  It's a sad chronicle that makes for truly depressing reading. It's \nunderstandable why so many concerned Members of Congress are raising \nserious questions about the effectiveness of Mexico's antidrug effort.\n  But it's important that we in Congress stay focused on doing what's \nin our own national interest--not on symbolic gestures that fail to \naccomplish that interest.\n  The problems we face are real.\n  There are 12.8 million Americans who use illegal drugs, including 1.5 \nmillion cocaine users and 600,000 heroin addicts.\n  More than 1 out of every 10 children between 12 and 17 years of age \nuse illegal drugs. One out of every four claims to have been offered \nillegal drugs in the past year.\n  The American people recognize that these are important problems--and \nthat we have to take serious action. But let me point out, Mr. \nPresident, that there are many, many people in Mexico who support our \ngoals. To succeed, we need that support.\n  Without their support, it would not have been possible for Mexico to \nmake even today's limited progress against the drug traffickers.\n  That progress is limited, but it is nonetheless real.\n  Over the last year, in spite of the well-known cases of corruption, \nthe Mexican Government has posted increases in drug seizures and crop \neradications. That includes a 15-percent increase in marijuana \nseizures, a 6.3-percent increase in cocaine seizures, and an almost 80-\npercent increase in heroin seizures.\n  In 1996, Mexican authorities reported an increase of nearly 14 \npercent in the number of people arrested on drug trafficking and \nrelated offenses, including 28 high-level members of drug trafficking \norganizations. This year, as has been widely reported, Mexican \nauthorities arrested General Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo--who had been in \ncharge of the National Institute to Combat Drugs--for supporting the \nactivities of the Juarez cartel.\n  We didn't catch him, Mr. President. The Mexicans themselves did.\n  Should we expect further improvements in law enforcement operations? \nAbsolutely. We need to monitor the full enforcement of the law--in \nother words, keep close watch on how many of these arrests lead to \nprosecution and jail time.\n  In 1996, the Mexican Congress passed tough laws to address the \nproblems of money laundering, chemical diversion, and organized crime. \nNow we should insist on full enforcement of those new laws.\n  This year, we have seen improved cooperation in the areas of money \nlaundering and extradition. Mexico and the United States established a \nhigh level contact group on narcotics control to explore joint \nsolutions to the shared drug threat and to coordinate bilateral \nefforts. We should now expect this increased cooperation to yield \nclear, positive results.\n  But one thing is clear: Both Governments need to dedicate greater \nresources to stop trafficking along our border. Senator Hutchison \ninformed the Foreign Relations Committee last week of the enormous \ndifficulties faced by her fellow Texans along the border. Specifically, \nranchers with property along the border are being bribed, coerced, or \nhaving their lives threatened by traffickers seeking to use private \nproperty as a back door into our Nation. These ranchers have been told \nby Federal officials that it would be years before enough new border \nagents could be assigned to better secure their property.\n  Listen to some of the stories these ranchers tell--stories about the \ngunfights they have fought with drug gangs, and having to carry guns \nwhenever they leave the house. It sounds like a John Ford movie about \nthe Old West.\n  That has got to change.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by making a broader point about \nMexico's future. In my view, with this resolution, we create the \nopportunity for a new round of cooperation between the United States \nand Mexico. Mexico is not only a neighbor with whom we share a 2,000-\nmile border, it is also this country's third largest trading partner. \nIf we are to be successful in our anti-drug efforts, Mexico must be our \nally.\n\n[[Page S2595]]\n\n  Yes, the Government of Mexico needs to do more within its borders, \nand with us, to combat drug trafficking. The real question before us is \nhow can we improve on that partnership.\n  We all know what the problems are. We all agree that they are very, \nvery serious. But we should also recognize that this is a crucial \nmoment in Mexico's history--and they need our support if they are going \nto continue in the right direction.\n  What the Mexican people are trying to do is make the transition from \na one-party state, in which corruption and excessive government \nmandates stifle the hope for widespread prosperity, to a multiparty \nstate that creates jobs and rewards job creators.\n  President Zedillo appears to be trying to free up Mexican society and \nreform the political process--changes that will make Mexico a more \nstable neighbor for the United States. He is opposed by powerful \nelements in his ruling party, and make no mistake, the outcome is still \nin doubt.\n  Now more than ever, the people of Mexico need to know that we want \nthem to be our partners. Our national interest is served by a \nprosperous and democratic Mexico--a Mexico that offers hope and \nopportunity for its citizens.\n  The drug war is one area where we must continue to work together. We \nshould redouble our efforts to look for constructive solutions--to \nreduce trafficking, to crack down on money laundering, and most \nimportant of all, to reduce the demand for drugs.\n  Our countries must be united in a very important partnership. In the \nanti-drug effort, as in so many other areas, we have a major common \nchallenge, and we can only prevail if we face it together.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, this month both Houses of Congress have \nbeen engaged in a difficult debate over whether to uphold or overturn \nthe President's certification of Mexico as fully cooperating with the \nUnited States to fight drug trafficking.\n  This debate has had a growing negative impact on U.S. relations with \nan important country and trading partner along our southern border. The \ndebate also has shown how the certification process under the Foreign \nAssistance Act of 1961 is not as effective as Congress originally \nintended it to be.\n  Under current law, notice provided to the target country is often too \nlate and not specific enough to fix the problems. Moreover, access to \nmore timely and specific information would assist Congress in \nexercising its legislative and oversight responsibilities.\n  Therefore, on Tuesday of this week, I introduced S. 457, a bill to \nprovide a new option to the President to place countries such as Mexico \non a probationary status of 7 months, during the period of March 1 \nthrough September 30. If by the end of this probationary period, the \ntarget country complies with the specific conditions stipulated by the \nPresident, full certification would be granted. However, if these \nconditions are not met, the United States would act firmly by cutting \noff aid beginning on October 1 of this year.\n  I am pleased that the compromise the Senate is considering today \nreflects to some extent the main components of my bill. The pending \nresolution recognizes that Mexico has taken insufficient steps to stop \ndrug trafficking and it stipulates a 6-month period of time in which \nthe President will review Mexico's progress in this area. The \nresolution also requires the President to submit a report to Congress \nby September 1 on Mexico's progress.\n  However, the resolution we consider today does not nearly go far \nenough. Its findings regarding Mexico are not specific; it does not \nprovide specific steps Mexico must take to continue receiving aid; and \nit does not amend the existing law to improve the certification process \nin the future, as my bill does.\n  I am voting in favor of the pending resolution today because it is \nthe only legislation the Senate will consider this week to address the \ncertification of Mexico. Nevertheless, I urge my colleagues to support \nS. 457 to improve the certification process for the future.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \njoint resolution that the majority leaders, my fellow Republican and \nDemocratic colleagues, and the administration has concluded with \nrelation to certification of Mexico. Even though I do not think that \nthis resolution goes far enough, I realize that this agreement is a \nbipartisan effort that should be enacted for the good of the Nation.\n  Frankly, I am disappointed that we consider a nation that supports \ndrug cartels and warlords worthy of programs funded by the hard earned \ndollars of American tapayers. However, this resolution will make \ncertain demands of Mexico and the administration to ensure that \nprogress is made in Mexico. This resolution does not entirely burden \nMexico with this responsibility; it will also create a partnership. \nThis partnership will try to strengthen bilateral border enforcement, \ncreate a permanent working relationship between law enforcement \nagencies of both nations and actually assist Mexico to identify, remove \nand prosecute corrupt officials at all levels of Government. By \ncreating this partnership, Mexico and the United States will closely \nstudy this situation and actually try to ensure that both of our \nefforts are being met. With such limited resources, our assistance to \nMexico should make a difference.\n  Mr. President, we must work toward ensuring that Mexico halts these \ndestructive practices for our most precious national asset, our \nchildren. Over the past few years, there has been a marked increase in \nthe levels of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamines, and marijuana flowing \ninto the United States through Mexico. This is hitting every urban and \nrural community in the United States. The protection of our most \nvulnerable possession, our children is the strongest argument for the \npassage of this legislation.\n  Finally, we should not be saying to the American people that this law \nis only good if we can also pass the chemical weapons convention \ntreaty. This is not to suggest my opposition or support for the treaty, \nbut I believe that each issue should be kept separate so as to ensure \nthat both are considered on their own merits.\n  Thus, the most important issue for this Congress today--the only \nissue for Congress today--is to move forward on this resolution.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today we will vote on one of the most \ndifficult issues facing our Nation: the illegal drug trade in Mexico \nand the United States. The resolution we will vote on requires the \nPresident to report by September 1, 1997, on the efforts of Mexico and \nthe United States to achieve results in combating the production of and \ntrafficking in illicit drugs. I support the resolution, and am hopeful \nthat the report will show significant progress by Mexico and the United \nStates in fighting the war on illegal drugs.\n  As my colleagues have discussed today, we cannot win the war on drugs \nunless Mexico achieves significant progress in the areas of drug \ntrafficking, extradition, corruption among Mexican law enforcement and \nother officials, interdiction networks, implementation of laws and \nregulations to combat money laundering, eradication of crops destined \nfor illegal drug use in the United States, and the strengthening of \nbilateral border control.\n  Border control must also be a top priority of the United States; and \nwhile my colleagues, including Senators Coverdell, Feinstein, and \nHutchison, have done an excellent job detailing what must be done to \nfurther our and Mexico's efforts to fight illegal drugs, I want to \nconcentrate for a moment on the need for additional United States \nBorder Patrol agents.\n  First, I am pleased that one of three things we are asking the \nPresident to do by September 1 is detail the progress made in the \ndeployment of 1,000 additional U.S. Border Patrol agents in 1997 as \nrequired by my amendment to the Immigration Act of 1996.\n  Without an effectively controlled border, the United States cannot \neven begin to win the war on drugs. I was disturbed that the \nPresident's fiscal year 1997 budget to Congress requested the addition \nof only 500 Border Patrol agents, instead of the 1,000 required in the \n1986 Act. Senators McCain, Gramm, Hutchison, and Domenici recently \njoined me in sending a letter to the President, urging him to comply \nwith the law, revise his budget request, and\n\n[[Page S2596]]\n\ndeploy 1,000 additional agents in 1997. Without an adequate contingent \nof customs and border agents, the problem of individuals smuggling \ndrugs and illegal immigrants across our border will only worsen.\n  Border Patrol agents are on the front lines every day, working hard \nto seal off our borders from increasing levels of illegal immigration \nand the drug trade. The agents that Congress has added over the past \nfew years have made a difference, but the need for additional agents \nkeeps growing. Drug and illegal alien smuggling continues to grow--\nillegal immigrants are expected to increase by 275,000 per year over \nthe next several years--and the effects of illegal drugs, particularly \nmethamphetamine, have been devastating for the citizens of Arizona and \nthe rest of the Nation.\n  Just a few weeks ago, a study on drug use in America showed a large \nincrease in youth drug use over the last 5 years. Arizona fared poorly, \nwith much higher drug use than the national average, including a \nstartling statistic that our sixth graders are twice as likely to have \ntried methamphetamine than high school seniors nationwide. While we \ncontinue to talk about the need to fight illegal drugs, the precursor \nchemicals that make methamphetamine are being smuggled into Arizona in \nincreasing volume. It must stop.\n  As the resolution we are voting on today says, the abuse of illicit \ndrugs results in at least 14,000 deaths per year in the United States, \nand ``exacts economic costs in excess of $67 billion per year to the \nAmerican people.''\n  Although many of us would like to see more specific actions that the \nMexican government should take to show serious improvement in the war \nagainst illicit drugs, it is my hope that Mexico will be able to show \nsignificant accomplishments in the areas outlined in the resolution. \nLikewise, the administration must be able to show specific, detailed \naction in the war against drugs by, among other things, deploying 1,000 \nadditional agents in 1997.\n  Mr. President, not rhetoric, but actions. That is what we must demand \nof Mexico and that is what we must demand of ourselves. We must work \ndiligently to eradicate the scourge of illegal drugs that has taken so \nmany of our citizens, young and old alike, hostage. This compromise \nresolution should be passed by the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues today in \nstrongly endorsing this bipartisan resolution, which represents an \nimportant step in the fight to curb the flow of drugs from Mexico.\n  This resolution strongly registers Congress' unhappiness with the \ncurrent situation in Mexico. It includes a clause stating that it is \nthe sense of Congress that ``there has been ineffective and \ninsufficient progress in halting the production in and transit through \nMexico of illegal drugs.''\n  There is ample evidence that Mexico is not doing enough to combat \nthis problem. Let me cite a few examples.\n  More than half the cocaine coming into the United States is smuggled \nacross the United States-Mexican border.\n  Major quantities of heroin, marijuana and methamphetamines used in \nthe United States are produced in Mexico.\n  Drugs are being moved illegally across the United States-Mexico \nborder by major criminal organizations operating on both sides of the \nborder.\n  And, of great concern to the United States, there is evidence of \nsignificant corruption affecting the Mexican Government and undermining \nits anti-drug commitments. The most dramatic recent evidence of this \nfact was Mexico's February 1997 arrest of its drug czar, General \nGutierrez.\n  This resolution helps us move beyond the annual certification debate \nin achieving concrete action in a constructive way. Passage of this \nresolution will strengthen the President's hand in his upcoming April \ntrip to Mexico. It puts the United States in a position to get the \ngreatest possible cooperation from the Mexicans in fighting the war on \ndrugs. And, most importantly, it puts the Mexicans on notice that we \nwill expect such cooperation.\n  This resolution clearly expresses Congress' view that the Mexican \nGovernment must do more and that the United States needs a plan to push \nthat effort. The resolution lays out the positive steps they must take \nby requiring the President to submit a report to Congress by September \n1 of this year laying out progress with Mexico in the following \nimportant areas: Investigation and dismantling of drug cartels, \ndevelopment and strengthening of the working relationship between the \nUnited States and Mexican law enforcement officials; strengthening of \nbilateral border enforcement; denial of safe havens for those \nresponsible for drug trafficking, including improvement of cooperation \non extradition matters between the United States and Mexico; \nsimplification of evidentiary requirements for narcotics and other \nrelated crimes; full implementation of effective laws and regulations \nto combat money laundering; eradication of crops intended for illicit \ndrug use; establishment of screening process to assess the suitability \nof all law enforcement personnel involved in the fight against \norganized crime; and the support given to Mexico in its efforts to \nidentify and remove corrupt officials throughout the government, \nincluding law enforcement and military officials.\n  The resolution also directs that the report include progress on \nimportant domestic goals, including the implementation of antidrug \neducation efforts in the United States focusing on reducing drug use \namong young people; the implementation of a comprehensive international \ndrug interdiction and enforcement strategy; and providing the \nadditional personnel needed to get the job done.\n  This resolution is not, and must not be, the end of this process. The \n1998 drug certification process will give Congress another chance to \nexpress its support or disapproval of the progress we have made with \nMexico.\n  The resolution is not perfect, but it takes us in the right \ndirection.\n  Let there be no mistake: the United States cannot tolerate anything \nless than an all-out effort to control illegal drugs. Mexico must \ndemonstrate a dramatic increase in its cooperation in the effort to \nstop the flow of drugs across the United States-Mexico border. The \nUnited States obligation is to insist on Mexico's cooperation and to \nmake it clear that we will do everything we can to support their \neffort. We will be closely monitoring progress in this area. Without \nit, we will face an intolerable threat to our children and a severe \ndegradation of our relationship with Mexico.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leader has 50 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes of leader's time, \nand I will try to use less than that time.\n  Let me begin these remarks by thanking the sponsors of this \nresolution that is pending before the Senate. I want to especially \nthank our colleague from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, with whom I have \nthe pleasure of serving with as ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nWestern Hemisphere, Peace Corps, Narcotics and Terrorism of the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations. He played a very major role in shaping \nthe compromise that is now before us. I would mention as well our \ncolleagues, Dianne Feinstein from California, Kay Bailey Hutchison from \nTexas, John McCain of Arizona, and others who worked tirelessly in \nhelping put this resolution together.\n  I commend them for their work in putting this resolution together. I \nam happy to have been a part of it. Even though I do not agree with \nevery word in it, on balance I believe it is a very constructive \napproach to a very difficult problem. I am sure that all of us who \nworked to forge this compromise would have liked to see things added or \nsubtracted depending upon our points of view. But, that is the nature \nof how a resolution like this is assembled.\n  I think the pending amendment captures the views of this body fairly \naccurately, and I suspect, the views of the American people whom we \nrepresent. Yes, there is a sense of outrage,\n\n[[Page S2597]]\n\nfear, worry, and frustration over the ongoing threat posed by the \nMexican drug cartels. We have paid a very heavy price for their \nrelentless efforts to ply their trade whereever they can get away with \nit. The human costs of drug use are real and mounting. This scourge \nthat still ravages this country called drugs has caused great damage to \nmillions of people in this country and elsewhere.\n  The pending amendment is an attempt to express to our neighbor and \nally to the south of us, Mexico, where more than 50 percent of all the \ndrugs that come to this country are produced or transit through, that \nwe would like to see more cooperation in our efforts to eliminate drugs \nfrom both our countries.\n  Mr. President, the economic costs to the American people from the \nillegal use of narcotics is in excess $67 billion annually. Estimates \nare that nearly 13 million Americans regularly use illegal substances. \nThe revenues generated by the drug kingpins totals more than $49 \nbillion annually--a rather remarkable statistic.\n  The Mexican drug cartels allocate more than $6 billion of ill gotten \ngains for the sale of drugs in order to bribe, or otherwise corrupt \nMexican law enforcement and judicial authorities involved in \ncounternarcotics programs.\n  We consume 50 percent of all the illegal drugs produced in the world. \nWe represent 5 percent of the world's population. So clearly the United \nStates is at the heart of the international drug problem. More and \nmore, this is not solely an American problem. Drug consumption is \nbeginning to ravage countries which in the past never had a problem \nwith illegal substances and drugs. But today that is changing, and even \nin producing countries--transit countries--nations where money \nlaundering goes on, consumption and the ravages of consumption are \nbeginning to wreak havoc in these nations as well.\n\n  I cite just of few statistics. There are clearly many more. I know my \ncolleague from California provided some other statistics in the course \nof her remarks concerning, for example, the amount of product coming \ninto this country.\n  Let me say that I think it is perfectly appropriate and proper that \nwe raise the issue of the effectiveness of our allies and neighbors' \ncounter-narcotics efforts. But we should admit as well that we could do \na better job here at home in helping to wage an all out effort against \nillegal drug use. We need to take a good hard look in the mirror as \nwell.\n  I would argue very strenuously that were it not for the consumption \nin this country, were it not for our consumption problems, that we \nwould have far less of a problem with nations like Mexico and others. I \ndon't say that is an excuse to let those nations off the hook who \nproduce, process, and tranship these illegal drugs that wind up on our \nstreets. But if we are going to have an intelligent and thoughtful \ndiscussion about drug abuse and illegal drug production, and the \nproblems these create, then we need to spend at least as much time in \nanalyzing what we in the United States are doing or are not doing in \nour own country that creates the market for these products as we do \npointing the accusing finger at those who are involved on the supply \nside.\n  Simply put, if we did not have a domestic consumption problem we \nwould not have the magnitude of the problem of the supply side that \nexists in Mexico today. With enough resources we can probably deal with \nMexico. Or we can deal with Peru, and Colombia. But what we have \nlearned historically is that as we begin to put pressure on \nnarcotraffickers in one country, they simply relocate to another. This \nwill continue to be the case so long as our domestic consumption rates \ncontinue to go up. The producing countries, the transit countries, the \nmoney laundering countries, are only temporary locations in the \ntransnational international drug trafficking business.\n  So the first line of defense has to be a far more aggressive effort \nhere at home to try to educate young people against the dangers and the \nproblems associated with illegal drug use. We also need better \ntreatment programs so that those who are hooked on drugs who want to \nchange will have someplace to go to for help in breaking these \nincredibly debilitating habits. Yet today, there is a long waiting list \nat our drug treatment centers--a list of addicts wanting treatment that \nis currently unavailable to many of them. The waiting period to get \ninto treatment can be as long as 4 years in some instances. Having to \nwait months and months for treatment certainly doesn't contribute to \nour efforts to reduce the problem of consumption.\n  I hope as we attempt to seriously come to grips with the \ninternational drug threat to the United States --and it is not going to \ndisappear overnight--that we focus a lot of our attention on reducing \ndomestic drug abuse.\n  Just as I believe we need to place more emphasis on the demand side, \nI think we need a serious rethinking of how we approach the supply side \nof the equation. The current approach as embodied in the annual \ncertification process is not working. In 1986 when Congress enacted the \ndrug certification law there was a great deal of frustration that \nneither the United States nor other countries were doing enough to \nfight the drug war. So Congress, on a bipartisan basis, set up a \ncertification process in order to bring attention to the issue and try \nto do something about it. I strongly suggest to my colleagues--and I \nrealize that I may be in the minority on this issue--that we ought to \nscrap this certification process and try to come up with some \nalternative idea that would allow us to develop a working partnership \nwith other governments, particularly those in our own hemisphere.\n  There are good people in Mexico who want to see this problem stopped \nas well.\n\n  In fact, I made note the other day--it is worth repeating here \ntoday--that when President Zedillo of Mexico came forward and took some \nsignificant steps in dealing with the people in his own country who had \nbeen corrupted by this process, his favorability rating rose more than \n10 percent in Mexican public opinion polls. It isn't just American \ncitizens who are deeply troubled by the rising cost of illegal \nsubstances and drugs. The people of Mexico, the average citizen in the \nstreet, is worried about this. The mother in Mexico City is just as \nworried about her child becoming hooked on these substances as a mother \nin Hartford, or a mother in Atlanta, or a mother in Los Angeles. We \nneed to be sensitive to that because they have to help us as well in \ntrying to build a base of public support in Mexico that will encourage \nMexican authorities to get tough on narcotraffickers and corrupt \ngovernment officials.\n  My colleague from Georgia may have addressed this already. I will \njust state it briefly. I think our colleague from Georgia has a very \nsound idea in terms of how we might look at this problem a bit \ndifferently. He has proposed that all countries that are involved in \nthe various aspects of the drug trade, whatever their level of \ninvolvement, sit down and start figuring out how we can work together \nto solve this problem. It isn't going to be solved in one year or two. \nIt isn't going to be solved at all unless we come up with a common \nplan--a plan developed by coequals trying to deal with this issue. That \nis the only way to get the kind of cooperation that is absolutely \ncritical if we are going to be successful in dealing with our allies \nand others who are producing these products.\n  I see my colleague. I will be glad to yield to him because I raised \nhis name and mentioned his program.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, first, I want to acknowledge the almost \ntireless support of the Senator from Connecticut in behalf of the \nconcept.\n  Just to take a second, the resolution before this body does for the \nfirst time enumerate the concept and calls on the administration to air \nit during the upcoming meetings in Mexico. I just wanted to mention \nthat.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for mentioning that.\n  I strongly urge the administration and others to take a strong, hard \nlook at this and come forward with ideas so we can get off the \ncertification track that brings us back here year in and year out \npicking winners and losers and deciding whether or not they are going \nto be on the good list, or the bad list, or the marginally good list. \nWhether they are going to be certified, decertified, or granted a \nnational interest waiver. Debating that kind of question and getting \nvotes of 55 to 45 or 65\n\n[[Page S2598]]\n\nto 30 for the various legislative initiatives surrounding certification \ndoesn't get us anywhere.\n  We have significant evidence that decertification has not fostered \nbetter cooperation from other countries. For the last 11 years we have \ndecertified a handful of countries year in and year out. None of these \ncountries counter narcotics efforts have improved as a result of that \naction.\n  The simple question that must be asked about the current procedure is \nif it is not working should it continue? Shouldn't we consider an \nalternative that might really be effective in achieving the cooperation \nthat is necessary to reduce the ravages of this problem?\n  If we don't try something new, we will be sitting here, I promise \nyou, with more charts next year and more charts the year after that, \nand more charts the year after that, and we can beat our chests, pound \nthe table, and scream at neighbors and allies. But my fear is that it \ndoesn't get any better.\n  So, when your idea is not working very well, you ought to think anew. \nWhat the Senator from Georgia has done in my view is think anew on \nthis. I commend him for it. I don't think he thinks nor do I think it \nis a perfect idea. But I think it has the seeds of success written into \nit. If we give it a chance and try to make it work, then I think it can \nproduce the results that we all are looking for.\n  Mr. President, again I commend the authors of this amendment. I think \nthey have expressed the views of all of us more or less. We are all \nblessed to have General McCaffrey heading up narcotics efforts. He has \ndone an excellent job and he enjoys universal support for his efforts.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment. But, more importantly, Mr. \nPresident, I urge that we find a different way in the coming weeks and \nmonths to address this issue before we find ourselves back again \nengaged in an exercise that isn't achieving the kind of results that \nmany of us would like to see accomplished.\n  With that, Mr. President, I urge adoption of the resolution and yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank my colleague from Connecticut for his remarks \nand again, as I have in the past, for his attention to this concept \nthat we have been discussing for now 2 years, and hopefully this \nresolution will bring it to a new level of discussion. I apologize for \ninterrupting, but I did want to note that we had embraced some of this \nconcept in the resolution.\n  Now, Mr. President, I yield up to 5 minutes of my time to the Senator \nfrom Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Chair. I thank my good colleague from \nGeorgia for yielding time to me. I would also like to thank and \nrecognize and compliment Senator Coverdell, Senator Feinstein, and \nothers who have worked tirelessly on this effort to try to get more \nhelp in stopping all the drug trafficking through Mexico. I know they \nhave worked very hard to try to craft a vehicle and language to be able \nto get at this issue, which we all want to do, which is reduce the drug \ntrafficking, reduce the amount of drug flow from and through Mexico to \nthe United States. I applaud their efforts and their tireless work in \ngetting this done.\n  However, in looking at the language of this bill, I must rise in \nopposition to certifying Mexico as complying with our drug-trafficking \nefforts, and this is not, in my estimation, as I consider this vote and \nweigh it carefully, about bashing Mexico. This is not about bashing the \nadministration. This is about complying with the law and interpretation \nof that law and a judgment that each of us must make. The fact is \nsection 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act requires that the President \ncertify that Mexico has cooperated fully with the United States or \ntaken adequate steps on its own to fight drug trafficking.\n  That is the law, and that is the interpretation and that is what each \nof us have to interpret, whether this is done: Has Mexico cooperated \nfully with the United States or taken adequate steps on its own? Sadly, \nI come to the conclusion the facts are that Mexico has not cooperated \nfully with the United States and the steps they have taken to combat \nthe drug trade are far from adequate. I am sad in taking that position \nand in looking at it this way, but I can arrive at no other conclusion.\n  There was a slight increase in 1996 in both drug seizures and arrests \nof drug traffickers. But sadly, again, this is because the numbers for \n1995 were so low. Their record over the 1992 to 1993 period shows that \nthey can do much better; they were much, much higher. So the Mexican \nGovernment, working more in cooperation with us, can do much better. In \nfact, Mexico's current record clearly indicates that they should not be \ncertified for antidrug cooperation. U.S. drug agents report that the \nsituation on the border has never been worse.\n  I applaud Senator Coverdell and Senator Feinstein for laying out in \ndetail the facts that are before us. I would like to reiterate some of \nthem again if I could.\n  Mexico continues to be a major transit point for cocaine entering the \nUnited States from South America. Fifty to 70 percent of the cocaine \nentering the United States transits Mexico, and Mexico is a supplier of \n20 to 30 percent of the heroin to the United States market and up to 80 \npercent of the foreign-grown marijuana. Seizures of cocaine were about \nthe same as the last 2 years but about half the level of seizures in \n1991 to 1993. Drug arrests were up for 1995. However, they were \nconsiderably less than arrests in 1992 to 1993. Mexico refuses to allow \nthe United States Navy ships patrolling for drug smugglers to put into \nMexican ports to refuel without 30 days' notice. Mexico has enacted \nmoney laundering legislation, but so far the legislation has not been \nimplemented, and Mexico is 12 months late in producing necessary \nbanking regulations.\n  The record on this issue is clear, and sadly so. It is not credible \nto claim that Mexico has fully cooperated with the United States in \nfighting drug trafficking. On the contrary, the major Mexico-based drug \ncartels have risen to being some of the most powerful trafficking \ngroups in the world.\n  I think we absolutely have to send a strong signal to the \nadministration and to our neighbors to the south that the certification \nprocess is not just a rubberstamp exercise and that we require action \non this issue. I say again that I arrive at this conclusion sadly \nbecause I think everybody in this body would much rather be able to \neasily certify, and I do applaud the efforts of Senator Coverdell, \nSenator Feinstein, Senator Hutchison, and many others in working on \nthis. But we are just not there and I cannot support the certification.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the junior Senator from Massachusetts \nhas requested time. I will yield 7\\1/2\\ minutes of my time to him, and \nI believe the Senator from Georgia will yield time.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. If the Senator from California will withhold this \nallotment of time for one moment while I deal with a unanimous consent \nthat both sides agreed to in trying to facilitate a number of our \nMembers who are trying to visit the White House and some others who are \ntrying to catch aircraft. I will do this and then we move to Senator \nKerry from Massachusetts under the circumstances the Senator has just \noutlined.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that the vote scheduled to \noccur at 4:45 today now occur at 3 p.m., and further, the following \nSenators to speak for up to the designated time: Senator Kerry for 15 \nminutes, Senator Hutchison for 10, Senator Feinstein for 5, Senator \nBoxer for 5 minutes, Senator Coverdell for 5 minutes, and any \nstatements relating to the issue provided for in the consent remain in \norder prior to the close of business today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator \nfrom Georgia for his intercession and his\n\n[[Page S2599]]\n\nhelp, and I particularly want to pay tribute to the Senator from \nCalifornia, [Mrs. Feinstein], who has been pressing so hard on this \nabsolutely vital issue of concern to every single American.\n  I listened carefully to the comments in the Chamber, particularly \nthose of the Senator from Connecticut a moment ago. We differ on the \nquestion of whether certification is effective or not. The fact is, \nwere it not for certification, we would not be here today fighting \nabout what the appropriate action is with respect to Mexico and there \nwould not be such sensitivities by Mexico or us to the consequences of \nour actions. Were it not for the certification process, there are whole \ncountries that would continue to disregard, as they did prior to the \ncertification process, any notions of cooperation. It is, frankly, only \nby virtue of the certification process that we have made the extra \njudgments with respect to Mexico that lead us to understand the dire \ncircumstances that we find ourselves in today.\n  Having said that, I want to comment on one other aspect of this, \nbecause I agree with the Senator from Connecticut. I have been, I \nthink, forceful in speaking out on this over the last years. Any \nefforts to make any judgment about any other country must be \naccompanied by efforts to make judgments about ourselves. In fact, \nefforts to judge ourselves ought to come first, and we ought to be much \ntougher on ourselves than we are on the others.\n  The fact is that after all these years of so-called declarations of \nwar on drugs and all of the talk about its importance and all of the \nhype, we really do not have a legitimate war on drugs in our own \ncountry. I hear some people sometimes say, well, the reason we are \nlosing the war on drugs is x, y or z. We are not losing the war on \ndrugs, Mr. President. We are not fighting the war on drugs. Ask a lot \nof prosecutors around the country whether they have sufficient \nresources. Ask judges whether they can move people through the courts \nfast enough. What happened to the initiative to have drug courts? Ask \ndrug addicts, who are the first people we ought to discuss this with, \nwhat they say about the system and if it is serious, because we treat \nless than 50 percent of the drug addicts in this country. If you want \nto take the pushers' clients away, we ought to have treatment on demand \nin America, clean the streets up of the addicts, have an outreach \neffort that identifies them in community after community and show some \ntough love in the United States and provide the treatment. You cannot \nhave pushers come along fast enough to make up for that loss of \nbusiness. Do you want to deal with the people who are hitting people \nover the heads and robbing cars and stealing radios and entering houses \nat night? Then that is the way to do it. But we do not. We do not even \neducate all our kids in America about the danger of drugs. Only 55 \npercent of our children get education about drugs. The fact is that \nfrom 1956 until 1994, we enacted 43 so-called comprehensive laws to \ndeal with international narcotics control. From 1961 to 1991 we passed \nover 100 bills to combat drugs. There have been 10 major multilateral \ndeclarations and agreements signed between 1970 and 1992. Between 1966 \nand 1991 we created roughly 18 new agencies, councils, offices, and \ninstitutes to pretend to deal with drugs. Since President Bush \nestablished the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, we \nhave had four drug czars.\n\n  I think these efforts tell the story. Drug use by adults may be down \na little bit, but the fact is that drug use by kids is on the rise. In \n1992, the number of 12th graders using illegal drugs was 27 percent; in \n1996 it was 40 percent. And our efforts to educate kids about the \ndangers of drugs are just plain inadequate. In 1996, only 36 percent of \n8th graders thought that if they took LSD once or twice they could risk \nharming themselves. Similarly, only 51 percent believe that crack can \nharm them; and only 45 percent think that cocaine could hurt them. All \nof these numbers are down from 1991.\n  So, as we talk about Mexico, let us not forget the failure of our own \nefforts. I intend to bring us back to this issue again and again, in \nthe next months. It is time for us to do the job here. Every day there \nare 20 million 10-15 year old kids out there who need something to do \nafter school. We cannot shut schools in the afternoon, we cannot be \ndevoid of after-school programs, we cannot cut sports, music, arts, all \nof the options for our children, and suggest that they go home to \nhouses where there is no parent, and not expect to reap the harvest of \nthat kind of abandonment. Mr. President, that is our responsibility.\n  Now, what about Mexico? They also have a responsibility. We are \nhonest, at least, about judging our court system. We are honest about \nputting our cops in the street, 100,000 more of them, to try to deal \nwith this. We are honest about trying to prosecute people, police \nofficers and others in various departments across the country, who have \nshown a proclivity to break the law. That does not really happen in \nMexico--not really. There is a fake process that goes on there. In \nfact, what really happens in Mexico is that one cartel buys out the \npolice and the judges and the prosecutors in order to bring pressure on \nits rival cartels. For example, the attorney general and 90 percent of \npolice, prosecutors and judges in Tijuana and the state of Baja \nCalifornia are judged to be on the payroll of the Arellano-Felix \ncartel.\n  Do you want to sit around and expect them to do something? They will \nnot because drug corruption is endemic throughout the system. Let me \nturn to some other examples. During his 2 years in office, former \nAttorney General Lozano fired some 1,250 Federal police officers and \ntechnical personnel for corruption. Yet not one of these has been \nsuccessfully prosecuted. When Mexican army officers raided the wedding \nparty of Amado Carillo Fuentes sister, they found members of the \nMexican Federal Judicial Police guarding the party. Carillo Fuentes \nescaped thanks to a tip from the police about the raid. And on the very \nday that certification for Mexico was announced, Humberto Garcia \nAbrego, brother of Juan Garcia Abrego, and chief money launderer of the \nGulf cartel was allowed to go free by Mexican officials, even though he \nwas still under investigation for drug related crimes.\n  Until the Mexican Government recognizes this reality and throws out \nall the policemen, prosecutors, judges, and military officials on the \npayrolls of the traffickers, and basically says, ``We are going to \nstart again, and we are committed to this,'' it is impossible to have \nthe kind of cooperation that is necessary in this effort. Our own DEA \nAdministrator, Thomas Constantine, has told us that ``There is not one \nsingle law enforcement institution in Mexico with whom DEA has an \nentirely trusting relationship.''\n\n  When we went down to meet with the President of the United States and \nvarious Cabinet people on this subject, President Clinton properly put \nthe issue to us. He made a judgment, for reasons that I can \nunderstand--I do not agree with, but I understand--he made a judgment \nthat the best way to get Mexico to try to engage in this effort was to \ncertify them. I disagree. In my judgment, to certify them, or anything \nless than what we are doing here now, is to ratify the status quo. And \nit is to say that the same patterns of behavior that have sufficiently \ngotten you by any critical judgments over the span of the last 10 years \nwill be able to continue into next year and the next year until \nwhenever it is that the United States decides they are going to start \nto judge things the way they really are.\n  The way they really are is known by everybody. Let me quote from our \nown State Department's International Narcotics Control Strategy Report \nfor this year:\n\n       Taking advantage of the 2,000 mile border between Mexico \n     and the United States and the massive flow of legitimate \n     trade and traffic, well entrenched polydrug trafficking \n     organizations based in Mexico have built vast criminal \n     empires that produce illicit drugs, smuggle hundreds of tons \n     of South American cocaine, and operate drug distribution \n     networks reaching well into the continental United States. \n     Mexico is the principal transit route for South American \n     cocaine, a major source of marijuana, and heroin, as well as \n     a major supplier of methamphetamines to the illicit drug \n     market in the United States.\n\n  And nowhere but California do they understand the methamphetamine \naspects of this better.\n\n       Mexico is the transshipment point for at least 50 to 60 \n     percent of the United States-bound cocaine shipments and up \n     to 80 percent of the methamphetamine precursors.\n\n\n[[Page S2600]]\n\n\n  According to our U.S. health experts the consumption of \nmethamphetamines is on the rise and may soon outdistance the use of \ncocaine as the drug of choice in the United States. Mexican-based drug \ntrafficking organizations are the heart of this trade. The DEA reported \nin 1996 that:\n\n        . . . criminal organizations from Mexico, deepening their \n     involvement in methamphetamine production and distribution in \n     the United States, have radically reshaped the trade. With \n     access to wholesale suppliers of precursor chemicals on \n     international markets . . . these groups can manufacture \n     unprecedented quantities of high purity methamphetamine in \n     large labs, both in Mexico and across the border in \n     California.\n\n  Mr. President, the problem is these very cartels have reached their \ntentacles so far into the Mexican structure that you really have to \nengage in the most extraordinary kind of effort in order to change what \nis happening. I recognize that there have been some positive steps here \nand there, but the fact is, they are truly small developments measured \nagainst what we know Mexico has to do and what we have asked Mexico to \ndo. That is the true measure of cooperation.\n  The fundamental problem in Mexico is the corruption that exists at \nany and all levels, even among those charged with fighting the drug \neffort. You see an occasional arrest, yes. But those arrests by Mexican \nauthorities are not necessarily reflective of the commitment to root \nout drug traffickers, but rather of a well-coordinated plan by one \ncartel to eradicate the other by having law enforcement officials on \ntheir payroll. One of the reasons we did not immediately realize that \nMexico's drug czar, Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, was corrupt was because he \narrested major drug traffickers but only those who worked for the \nrivals of the cartel that he worked for, that of Amado Carillo Fuentes. \nSo, on February 18 the Mexican Defense Secretary, Enrique Cervantes \nannounced that Gutierrez aided the Carillo cartel for 7 years by \nprotecting cocaine shipments in exchange for vehicles, real estate and \ncash.\n  It was his taste for the good life, not Mexican efforts to root out \ncorruption, that caught him up. And you could read a number of \njournalistic accounts of what happened that show that it was actually \naccidental that Gutierrez finally got caught.\n  Mexican authorities have also tried to tout the arrest and \ndeportation of Juan Garcia Abrego, and there is no doubt that the Gulf \ncartel has been severely hurt by that. But what we are seeing, already, \nare indications that the only long term effect of those efforts is \ngoing to be to allow Carillo Fuentes to move in and takeover the Gulf \ncartel's operations. Likewise, efforts to target the Tijuana cartel, \nrun by the Arellano-Felix brothers, are likely to wind up being \norchestrated by Carillo Fuentes through his connections with corrupt \nlaw enforcement officials.\n  Mr. President, what we are trying to do here today is be sensitive to \nthe needs of a friend and of relationships. I hope, and I pray that \nPresident Zedillo will be able to move in the direction that he has \nindicated that he wants to move. Unlike Colombia where you have a top-\ndown kind of corruption, in Mexico you have a bottom-up kind of \ncorruption. President Zedillo is going to need all the help he can get.\n  In my judgment what the United States Senate is going to do today, by \ngoing on record as supporting this resolution, will, hopefully, send a \nsignal that all of us need to do more, that all of us need to hold each \nother up to a tougher standard, and that we need to ask Mexico to do \nmore to help us stem this flow of drugs.\n  Is that the whole deal? No. As I have made clear, the bulk of the \nresponsibility is ours.\n  Until we face up more to the demand side of the equation, it may seem \ndifficult to be as demanding internationally. But that does not mean we \nshould not be, and it does not mean that we must not ask a country as \ndeeply affected by this as Mexico has been to begin to join us to a \ngreater degree in this battle. It is my hope and my belief that this \neffort today will enable us to continue to cooperate while \nsimultaneously sending an important signal about the seriousness of our \ncertification process.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTexas is recognized for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank Senators Coverdell and \nFeinstein. I think they have come a long way in this process, and I \nappreciate their willingness to stand with what I think will be the \nstrongest vote in the Senate and do something that is constructive, \nrather than destructive.\n  I thank Senator Dodd, Senator McCain, and Senator Domenici. I thank \nSenator Lugar for coming in and helping in this process. It took all of \nus together to come up with a solution that we thought would be \nsomething workable with our Senate colleagues, hopefully with our House \ncolleagues, and something that would be a help to our relationship with \nMexico.\n  I think that was the key to this matter, because, in fact, Mr. \nPresident, we are losing the war on drugs. Mexico is losing the war on \ndrugs. They are seeing their country rifled with corruption because of \nthe billions of dollars that are coming in illegally, and America is \nlosing the war on drugs because we see 1 in 4 of our children who say \nthey have been offered illegal drugs, children as young as 8, 9, 10, \n11, 12 years old. Yes, Mr. President, what we are saying today is it is \nno longer business as usual in the drug war.\n  Mexico is not a country that is thousands of miles from our border. \nThis is our border. Mexico is our border. We are tied. We are tied \neconomically; we are tied in security interests. We cannot walk away \nfrom this issue. It is our joint problem, and that is what we are \nsaying today by passing this resolution.\n  We had $8 billion of trade with Mexico in 1975. Today, it is over \n$100 billion. Mexico is the United States' third largest trading \npartner; it is Texas' largest trading partner, with $22 billion of \ntrade between Texas and Mexico. But our relationship is deeper than \nthat. It is not just dollars. Every one of the border States--\nCalifornia, New Mexico, Arizona and Texas--were once part of Mexico. So \nour cultures are ingrained. We together, in the past few years, have \ndrifted into accepting unacceptable conditions in the arena of drug \ntrafficking. I cannot imagine a worse situation.\n  In my State, we have ranchers who will not go outside into their \nfront yards without guns, because they may meet someone with an AK-47 \nwalking across their ranch with illegal drugs. There is a state of \nlawlessness in my State that we have not seen since the frontier days, \nand we cannot let this stand. In fact, a number of our ranchers are \nselling their land to the highest bidders because they feel \ndefenseless. And guess who the highest bidders are? They are people \nfronting for those who are trafficking illegal drugs. They are paving \ntheir way through the United States through the remote areas of our \nborder States. This is a frightening situation.\n  In Eagle Pass, the intimidation began when ``coyotes'' were smuggling \nillegal aliens through this remote border area took to cutting fences \nand using cattle ranches as a back-door entrance to America. When local \nand State officials complained to the Federal Government, the response \nwas that would be 2 years before we can get help to you. So my State \nsent Texas Rangers down to the border. But even that has not been \nenough to do the job. So we have a problem that we must solve together.\n  Another new thing that seems to be happening is our customs agents on \nour side of the border, many of whom have relatives in Mexico, are now \nbeing threatened with harm to their relatives in Mexico if they do not \ncooperate with drug traffickers. So this corruption is on both sides of \nthe border.\n\n  The number of drug seizures in Mexico in 1996 was only half the \nnumber of seizures in 1993. The number of drug-related arrests in \nMexico in 1996 was half the number in 1992. Mexico is the source of 20 \nto 30 percent of the heroin coming into our country, 70 percent of the \nforeign-grown marijuana, and the transit point for 50 to 70 percent of \nthe cocaine shipped into our country. This is a sieve, and we must plug \nthe holes.\n  I will say that having just described a horrendous situation in \nMexico, let's look at America. In America, according to the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy, over 12 million people are drug addicts; \n10.9 percent of young Americans between the ages of 12 and\n\n[[Page S2601]]\n\n17 are using illegal drugs; drug-related illness, death and crime cost \nthis country nearly $67 billion in 1996.\n  So I have been troubled about what we are doing on our side, and yet, \nshortly after taking office, the Clinton administration cut the Office \nof National Drug Control Policy staff by more than 80 percent, hardly \nmaking it a priority. They also have made proposals to cut the DEA, the \nDrug Enforcement Agency, the FBI, the Immigration and Naturalization \nService and other Federal agencies, including, though Congress has \nauthorized 1,000 Border Patrol agents, only coming forward with a \nbudget for 500.\n  I have spoken to the Attorney General, Janet Reno, I have spoken to \nthe new drug czar, Barry McCaffrey, both of whom I respect very much, \nand I have said this is unacceptable. I cannot have my State being \noverrun and have only half the contingent of new Border Patrol agents \nthat Congress has authorized. Congress has made this a priority, and we \nmust have the same commitment from the administration.\n  The ``Just Say No'' campaign that Nancy Reagan put forward was \neffective, and we must have an education effort much like that one that \nsays to our young people, ``Drugs will hurt you, they will hurt you \ntomorrow, and they will hurt you 20 years from now when you have \nchildren.'' We must let them know that if we are going to win this war \non drugs.\n  So, Mr. President, we are asking for more. We are asking for more \nfrom our country and more from Mexico, because the fact of the matter \nis, we are in this together. Just like any good marriage, when there is \na problem, you cannot solve it if only one party is willing to talk. We \nmust have both parties willing to talk, both parties willing to give, \nboth parties willing to say, yes, if we make a bigger effort together, \nwe can lick this problem, just as we have licked the problems for over \n300 years between our two countries. We don't really have an \nalternative and our children's lives are in the balance.\n  So the differences between Senator Feinstein and Senator Coverdell \nand myself and others about how we would solve this problem were all \ndifferences of what would be the most effective. There was never a \ndifference among any of us about what the problem is. And that is, we \nare losing the war on drugs. We are losing a generation of our young \npeople. And that is not good enough.\n  We must do better. And we will do better with the resolution that is \nbefore us today that says the two countries will sit down together and \nwe will address the concerns, we will address the concerns of money \nlaundering, of corruption. We will address the concerns of demand on \nour side. And, Mr. President, we will do it together. And that is why I \nhope this vote of the Senate is a clear message to our friend and \nneighbor to the south that we want to work together and we want results \nfor the sake of both of our future generations.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I would like to yield 3 minutes of my 5 minutes to the \nSenator from California, Senator Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Georgia, my colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein. Both of them worked so hard on this.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, on February 28, the administration, \npursuant to the requirement of the international narcotics trafficking \nstatute, made a decision regarding our Nation's fight against illegal \ndrug trafficking. The decision was made to certify that Mexico has, in \nthe past year, taken all appropriate and necessary actions in the fight \nagainst international narcotics trafficking.\n  I respectfully disagree with this decision, and I would like to \nexplain why.\n  Under our international narcotics trafficking statutes, in order for \na country which is known to be either a major source of narcotics or a \nmajor drug transit country to continue to receive U.S. aid, the \nPresident must certify by March 1 that the country is either performing \nadequately in cooperating with the United States or is taking steps on \nits own in the fight against international narcotics trafficking.\n  The law gives the administration three choices:\n  First, certification that the country is either fully cooperating \nwith the United States or has taken adequate steps on its own to combat \nthe narcotics trade.\n  Second, decertification of the country, concluding that the country \nhas failed to meet the requirements of cooperation or action.\n  Third, no certification, but a vital national interest waiver--\nessentially a finding that the country has not met the standards of the \nlaw, but that our own national interests are best protected by \ncontinuing to provide assistance to the country.\n  The question of Mexico is complicated. Mexico is the leading transit \ncountry for cocaine coming into the United States: 50 to 70 percent of \nall cocaine shipped into the United States comes through Mexico. It is \nalso a significant source of heroin, methamphetamines, and marijuana.\n  President Zedillo seems to be strongly committed to rid the Mexican \nlaw enforcement system of corruption and to fight the Mexican drug \ncartels. However, the reports and events of the past few weeks have \nmade it clear that corruption in police ranks--even up to the very top \nranks--is still rampant in Mexico.\n  Just a few weeks ago, it was revealed that the man hired to be \nMexico's drug czar--the head of their anti-narcotics agency--was fired \nabruptly after being accused of taking bribes from one of Mexico's most \npowerful drug lords.\n  It would be as if our own drug czar, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, were found \nto be in league with drug gangs in our country. Why didn't the Mexican \nGovernment tell us they were investigating their drug czar? Why did \nthey let our own drug agency brief him and give him important \nintelligence about our antidrug efforts? I do not call that \ncooperation.\n  Mexico has also failed to take its own steps to meet the standards of \nthe certification law. It has not acted boldly to root out corruption \nin its law enforcement establishment; it has extradited to the United \nStates only a few Mexican nationals suspected of involvement in United \nStates drug activities; it has failed to implement new anticrime laws \nenacted last year.\n  Given these facts, I do not believe Mexico qualifies to be certified \nin full compliance with the drug law. I do believe that the President \nwould have been justified in granting a vital national interest waiver \nfor Mexico so that sanctions would not have to be applied, and I wish \nthat he had followed that course.\n  Granting a waiver would send a message to Mexico that its actions in \nthe past year were inadequate, but it would also allow the United \nStates to continue its efforts to work with President Zedillo and \nothers in his administration who are committed to the drug fight. \nUnfortunately, our parliamentary procedures do not permit a vote on \nsuch a measure, because that is not what the President supported.\n\n  The resolution before the Senate today makes some good points. It \nfinds that, in several areas, Mexico's actions against narcotics \ntrafficking have been inadequate:\n  First, evidence of significant corruption among Mexican officials, \nespecially law enforcement;\n  Second, Mexico's failure to fully implement new anti-money laundering \nlaws;\n  Third, drug cartels operating with impunity in Mexico;\n  Fourth, Mexico's failure to grant our extradition requests concerning \nMexican nationals who have been indicted in United States courts; and\n  Fifth, decline in the number of cocaine seizures and arrests of drug \ntraffickers in Mexico in the past few years.\n  These findings put Congress on record stating that Mexico is not \ndoing enough to fight narcotics trafficking or to cooperate with the \nUnited States in doing so.\n  In addition to the findings, there is a sense of the Congress section \nstating that there has not been enough progress in halting the \nproduction in\n\n[[Page S2602]]\n\nand transit through Mexico of illegal drugs.\n  The meat of the resolution is contained in subsection (d), which \nrequires the President, by September 1, to submit a report to Congress \non the extent of progress made by the United States and Mexico in ten \nareas:\n  First, bringing down the drug cartels;\n  Second, strengthening United States/Mexico law enforcement \ncooperative efforts;\n  Third, strengthening bilateral border enforcement;\n  Fourth, improvement of extradition matters between the United States \nand Mexico;\n  Fifth, simplifying evidentiary requirements for narcotics and related \ncrimes;\n  Sixth, full implementation of money laundering laws;\n  Seventh, Crop eradication;\n  Eighth, screening backgrounds of law enforcement officials;\n  Ninth, increasing support for Mexico's efforts to prosecute corrupt \npublic officials; and\n  Tenth, strengthening overall bilateral cooperation.\n  The resolution does not specify a process for congressional review of \nthe President's report. However, as Senator Feinstein said earlier, \nmany of us will be keenly interested in the details of the report, and \nof course, Congress may respond in any way it deems appropriate.\n  So I conclude that while this resolution is not what I had hoped to \nvote for, I must support it, as it is the only vehicle we will have on \nwhich to make a statement concerning the Mexico drug certification \nquestion.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly on another \nsubject concerning our relationship with Mexico. That is the United \nStates embargo against Mexican tuna and the efforts by some, including \nthe Mexican Government, to lift this embargo.\n  The current embargo--which was imposed in 1990 against all countries \nthat do not have environmental policies that protect dolphins from \nunsafe tuna fishing practices--prohibits Mexican tuna vessels from \nselling their products in the United States market.\n  Lifting the embargo would undoubtedly lead to an increase in the \nnumber of Mexican vessels operating in the eastern tropical Pacific. I \nbelieve that, given the current power and reach of the drug cartels in \nLatin America--particularly Colombia and Mexico--and their frequent \nreliance on maritime vessels to make drug shipments, now is not the \ntime to open up a whole new avenue of maritime trade from Mexico.\n  Cartels are using fishing boats and cargo ships more and more often \nto smuggle cocaine from Colombia to Mexico where it is then shifted to \ntrucks and other vehicles for transport across the border into the \nUnited States.\n  The risk of capture for these vessels is low in an ocean so large. \nAnd even when the ships are stopped, it is hard for law enforcement to \nfind the drugs, which are hidden in secret compartments. Many fishing \nvessels have sophisticated radar equipment that allows them to keep \nahead of law enforcement.\n  According to an article in the January 30 Washington Post, our own \nCoast Guard admits that the eastern Pacific is ``one of the most \ndifficult places for us to interdict drug shipments. It's a vast ocean. \nThere are no choke points, no places to hide and lots of places to \nsearch--including 2,000 miles of coast.''\n  So why, at this time when narcotics trafficking in and through Mexico \ninto the United States is threatening to undermine our two countries' \nrelationship, would we deliberately make it harder to bring these \ncartels under control?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \ntwo documents relating to this question--one, the Post article to which \nI just referred, and two, a recent report by the Humane Society of the \nUnited States on the predicted impact on narcotics trafficking of \nlifting the tuna embargo at this time.\n  And I trust that we will not act in any way to increase opportunities \nfor drug smuggling.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 30, 1997]\n\n    Latin Drugs Flow North Via Pacific--Traffickers' Ships Hard to \n                               Intercept\n\n                            (By Molly Moore)\n\n       Mexico City.--The crew of the Ecuadoran ship Don Celso \n     claimed to be fishermen, but, hundreds of miles off Ecuador, \n     the 150-foot vessel's fishing gear looked as if it had not \n     been used in months. And when a U.S. Coast Guard law \n     enforcement team yanked open the fish hatches, it found \n     50,000 gallons of diesel fuel instead of tuna on ice.\n       If there was fuel where there should have been fish, Coast \n     Guard Petty Officer 2nd Class Keith Thompson wondered what he \n     would find in the fuel tanks. It took his team six days of \n     hard searching to find out--nearly seven tons of cocaine \n     crammed into secret containers inside the fuel tanks, the \n     second largest maritime cocaine bust in history.\n       The massive cocaine discovery last October, along with \n     three other record-breaking seizures in just the last 18 \n     months, illustrate how quickly sophisticated Colombian and \n     Mexican drug cartels are adjusting to law enforcement efforts \n     and finding new trafficking routes to the United States \n     despite the billions of dollars the U.S. government is \n     spending on its war against drugs.\n       Even as the United States has increased interdiction \n     efforts in the Caribbean and Mexico has forced curtailment of \n     incoming flights of huge cargo planes stuffed with cocaine, \n     traffickers have made the vast open waters and virtually \n     unpatrolled shipping lanes and coasts of the eastern Pacific \n     Ocean the primary trafficking route for cocaine entering the \n     United States, Mexican and U.S. law enforcement officials \n     say.\n       ``When you press the balloon in one area, it pops up in \n     another,'' said Vice Adm. Roger T. Rufe Jr., U.S. Coast Guard \n     commander for the Pacific area. ``We've been putting a lot of \n     stumbling blocks in their way in the Caribbean. It's a market \n     economy; with demand as it is in the U.S., they have plenty \n     of incentive to try other routes.''\n       Most of the cocaine travels by ship from South America to \n     Mexico's Pacific Coast, where it is unloaded onto trucks and \n     vans and transported across Mexican land borders into the \n     Southwest United States.\n       Officials estimate that as much as two-thirds of all the \n     cocaine destined for the United States, or at least 275 tons \n     a year, now travels by ship via the eastern Pacific in what \n     law enforcement authorities describe as the most formidable \n     interdiction battle they have faced in recent years.\n       Only 23 tons of cocaine was intercepted by U.S. maritime \n     operations in the region in the past 2\\1/2\\ years--most of it \n     in just three seizures, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.\n       ``The eastern Pacific has been one of the most difficult \n     places for us to interdict drug shipments,'' said Adm. Robert \n     E. Kramek, commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard and \n     interdiction coordinator for President Clinton's anti-drug \n     efforts. ``It's a vast ocean. There are no choke points, no \n     places to hide and lots of places to search--including 2,000 \n     miles of coast.''\n       The cocaine traffickers of Colombia and Mexico are not the \n     only drug organizations that have discovered the eastern \n     Pacific trafficking lanes. Illicit drug shipments are pouring \n     into Mexico's Pacific ports by the ton, hidden in secret \n     compartments of commercial vessels or mixed with legitimate \n     cargo in huge metal containers--hashish from Pakistan; \n     precursor chemicals for methamphetamines, or speed, from \n     Asia; and huge hauls of marijuana from South America.\n       The drug cartels believe the risk of getting caught is so \n     small that they are loading shipments of up to 12 tons of \n     cocaine on fishing vessels and commercial container ships, \n     which can slip largely undetected from South America and up \n     the western coast of Mexico. Moreover, the cartels use \n     sophisticated radar equipment and surveillance techniques as \n     a means of countering search and seizure efforts of drug \n     enforcement agencies.\n       Even the most primitive-looking fishing boat is often \n     equipped with radar and electronic equipment to help \n     smugglers determine if they are being followed, as well as \n     scanners that can eavesdrop on military frequencies, \n     according to U.S. law enforcement officers involved in \n     maritime interdiction. In addition, the cartels also \n     frequently send aircraft to fly over the trafficking routes \n     to be used by their ships in an effort to identify anti-drug \n     operations.\n       The discovery of 11 tons of cocaine on the Panamanian ship \n     Nataly I off the coast of Peru in July 1995--the largest \n     maritime cocaine haul ever--was the first tip-off that \n     traffickers were shifting operations to the eastern Pacific, \n     according to the Coast Guard's Kramek.\n       Last August, a Honduran ship intercepted 50 miles off the \n     coast of Colombia was found to be carrying two tons of \n     cocaine, a seizure followed by confiscation of the Don \n     Celso's seven tons in October. And last Thursday, U.S. Coast \n     Guard and Mexican authorities detained a fishing vessel 250 \n     miles off Mexico's Pacific coast whose fuel tanks were hiding \n     almost 3\\1/2\\ tons of cocaine.\n       Late last year the U.S. Coast Guard, which works with the \n     U.S. Navy, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Customs \n     Service and other agencies, launched Operation Caper Focus \n     off northern South America and up the Pacific coastline \n     northward to Mexico in an effort to identify and intercept \n     drug trafficking shipments closer to their departure ports.\n       ``Once they've loaded and are proceeding into the ocean, \n     it's very easy to hide,'' said Capt. Robert Wicklund, chief \n     of the Coast Guard's law enforcement section for the Pacific \n     area. ``There are no natural choke\n\n[[Page S2603]]\n\n     points that a vessel has to pass through where we can sit and \n     wait for them to come to us.''\n       And often even large-scale deployments do not result in \n     seizures. In November 1995, after a two-year intelligence-\n     gathering operation by anti-drug agents, a U.S. Coast Guard \n     cutter was dispatched to the eastern Pacific to monitor a \n     fishing vessel believed to be carrying--or preparing to \n     load--20 tons of cocaine.\n       The ship left Panama and headed for fishing grounds west of \n     the Galapagos Islands. The Coast Guard cutter tailed the \n     vessel for 2\\1/2\\ months but was never able to determine if \n     it was carrying cocaine and did not stop it.\n       ``We had the ability to know when he was fishing, when he \n     was doing his laundry, but we didn't know whether he had \n     drugs on board,'' a Coast Guard official said.\n       The most difficult drug shipments to detect are those \n     secreted in the cargo containers aboard commercial vessels. \n     Without informants at ports of departure or arrival, it is \n     virtually impossible to detect such drug shipments, according \n     to law enforcement officials.\n       ``At our two main ports of Veracruz and Manzanillo, 200 \n     containers arrive daily,'' said Francisco Molina Ruiz, until \n     recently the chief of Mexico's Institute to Combat Drugs, the \n     Mexican equivalent to the U.S. DEA. ``To check one container, \n     we need anywhere from 10 hours to three days. Some containers \n     are frozen; others contain toxic substances, and often the \n     dogs can't sniff for drugs.''\n       Mexican law enforcement agencies recently have discovered \n     several large drug stashes in container shipments, usually \n     after receiving tips or noticing irregularities in shipping \n     manifests.\n       Problems of drug interdiction in the eastern Pacific are \n     exacerbated because the United States has few bilateral \n     agreements with Pacific Coast nations on law enforcement \n     cooperation, such as those it has developed over the years \n     throughout the Caribbean.\n       As a result, until a few recent diplomatic breakthroughs \n     with some nations, U.S. law enforcement officials frequently \n     spent days in bureaucratic tangles attempting to get \n     permission to stop or pursue suspicious vessels.\n       And despite the large increase in the number of drug \n     shipments off the Mexican Pacific coast, the United States \n     and Mexico have not conducted joint operational exercises in \n     a year. Mexico declined to take part in the latest scheduled \n     exercises after former defense secretary William J. Perry \n     embarrassed Mexican officials by discussing the operations \n     before they had been announced to the Mexican public.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n   Lifting the Tuna Embargo and Changing the Dolphin-Safe Label: The \n               Predicted Impact on Narcotics Trafficking\n\n  (A Confidential Report of the Humane Society of the United States, \n                National Investigations, March 5, 1997)\n\n       Three U.S. laws are under attack from several Latin \n     American nations who want to regain access to our lucrative \n     tuna market: 1) the embargo provisions contained in the \n     Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA; prohibiting the \n     importation of yellowfin tuna from countries whose tuna fleet \n     kills over 25% more dolphins than the U.S. fleet); 2) the \n     International Dolphins Conservation Act (IDCA; prohibiting \n     the sale of dolphin unsafe tuna in the U.S.); and 3) the \n     Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act (DPCIA; \n     prohibiting the use of the ``dolphin safe'' label on any tuna \n     caught by chasing and setting nets on dolphins).\n       Since the establishment of the ``dolphin safe'' label and \n     the embargo against purchasing tuna caught by setting nets on \n     dolphins, the number of vessels fishing for tuna in the \n     Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean (ETP) has decreased \n     substantially. Lifting the embargo and changing the ``dolphin \n     safe'' label to allow its use on ``dolphin-unsafe'' tuna will \n     most likely result in a substantial increase in the number of \n     vessels fishing in the ETP. We are concerned that this will--\n     in addition to causing increased injury and death to \n     dolphins--create conditions that may lead to increased and \n     easier narcotics smuggling into the United States.\n\n\n              the flow of narcotics into the united states\n\n       Most of the world's cocaine--an estimated 80%--originates \n     in Colombia. In recent years, Colombian traffickers began to \n     funnel their cocaine through Mexico. Mexican drug smugglers \n     became the key transporters of Colombian cocaine, a service \n     for which they were paid in cash. Through the development of \n     successful networks and trans-border relationships, and the \n     ability to easily bribe local police, they became more and \n     more powerful. Eventually, they started taking their pay--50% \n     of each load--in cocaine. This development, and the weakening \n     of the Colombian cartels through arrests and deaths, allowed \n     Mexican traffickers to gain greater control over narcotics \n     trafficking in the Americas.\n       According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration \n     (DEA), over 70% of all cocaine entering the U.S. comes \n     through Mexico. In 1994 and 1995, approximately 200 of the \n     300 metric tons of cocaine that entered the U.S. each year \n     transited Mexico. At least two-thirds of the cocaine that \n     enters Mexico is shipped in maritime vessels from other Latin \n     American countries. It is then smuggled into the U.S. over \n     various land routes into California, Arizona, and Texas.\n\n\n                 government corruption eases smuggling\n\n       Narcotics trafficking is, arguably, Mexico's biggest \n     business. Drug sales account for as much as $30 billion a \n     year in illegal proceeds to Mexico--more than the country's \n     top two legitimate exports combined. Traffickers take in tens \n     of billions of dollars every year from the sale of cocaine, \n     and they spend millions of dollars--at least $500 million \n     each year by some estimates--to ensure the protection and \n     cooperation of government officials. Officials with the U.S. \n     State Department's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law \n     Enforcement Affairs have stated, ``Drug traffickers used \n     their vast wealth to corrupt police and judicial officials as \n     well as project their influence into the political sector.\n       According to testimony obtained during the trial of drug \n     lord Juan Garcia Abrego, the Gulf Cartel (one of Mexico's \n     four major cartels) spends millions of dollars every month \n     buying the support of corrupt government officials. Garcia \n     himself has been charged with paying at least $25 million in \n     bribes to high-ranking Mexican officials. One of his aides \n     has testified that some of this money went to buy Javier \n     Coello Trejo, the Deputy Attorney General in charge of drug \n     enforcement during the Salinas administration. The use of \n     bribes to ease smuggling is not limited to the Gulf Cartel: \n     Jose Gutierrez Rebollo, the head of Mexico's National \n     Institute for Combatting Drugs (Mexico's DEA), was recently \n     arrested for allegedly accepting bribes from the Juarez \n     Cartel, considered to be the most powerful of Mexico's \n     cartels.\n       Corruption in the Mexican government extends all the way \n     from the highest government officials, such as Coello and \n     Gutierrez, to federal and state police, who have reportedly \n     participated directly in cocaine smuggling. According to a \n     recent report from the General Accounting Office (GAO), \n     Mexican federal and state personnel were caught unloading a \n     jet carrying 6 to 10 metric tons of cocaine in November 1995. \n     In June 1995, federal judicial police were arrested for \n     protecting a major narcotics trafficker. In March 1995, \n     officers of the National Institute for Combatting Drugs were \n     arrested for accepting cocaine and cash to allow a shipment \n     of over a metric ton of cocaine to pass unimpeded. Mexican \n     and American officials have also acknowledged that, during \n     the Salinas administration, at least half a dozen \n     traffickers, including the Juarez Cartel's Carillo, were \n     ``quietly'' arrested and released by corrupt police and/or \n     judges.\n       Drug corruption is found on both sides of the border: U.S. \n     government agents have been swayed by the promise of easy \n     money as well. In February 1996, a U.S. Customs inspector was \n     convicted of scheming to allow 2,200 pounds of cocaine in \n     from Mexico through the Texas border in exchange for $1 \n     million.\n       Corrupt government officials in the right positions can \n     ease the transporting of narcotics in shipments of tuna and \n     other foodstuffs. According to witnesses in a pending U.S. \n     civil trial of a key Salinas administration political figure, \n     both former president Carlos Salinas de Gortari and his \n     brother Raul had ties to the Gulf Cartel during Salinas' \n     presidency. Raul Salinas is alleged to have received millions \n     of dollars from drug lords and to have distributed bribes to \n     other political figures. During this time period, Raul \n     Salinas directed the Mexican government's food distribution \n     organization, a position which he could have taken advantage \n     of to aid his narcotics-trafficking associates.\n\n\n          narcotics travel via eastern tropical pacific ocean\n\n       In recent years, as counternarcotics forces have become \n     more adept at intercepting drugs in the air, Latin American \n     drug traffickers have shifted their preferred method of \n     transporting cocaine to Mexico to the sea. Department of \n     Defense records show that since 1992, known drug-trafficking \n     events involving aircraft decreased 65 percent, while those \n     involving maritime vessels increased 40 percent.\n       Maritime vessels, such as fishing trawlers and cargo ships, \n     are becoming more widely used by drug cartels to smuggle \n     cocaine because the risk of capture is so low: The vastness \n     of the ocean makes intercepting ships nearly impossible. Even \n     when ships are apprehended, actually finding the drugs is \n     extremely difficult, because the illicit cargo is hidden in \n     hard-to-find secret compartments. In one recent seizure, it \n     took authorities six days of searching to discover a seven \n     ton load of cocaine on board a vessel of the type used for \n     tuna fishing. Moreover, many fishing vessels are equipped \n     with radar and scanners that allow them to determine if \n     they are being followed, giving them an edge over law \n     enforcement officials.\n       Law enforcement officials state that, without informants, \n     drug shipments in maritime vessels are essentially impossible \n     to detect. Drug interdiction in the Eastern Pacific is made \n     more difficult because the U.S. has few law enforcement \n     cooperative agreements with Pacific nations.\n       Officials estimate that at least 275 tons of cocaine \n     transit the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) every year. The \n     ETP is the preferred tuna fishery of many Latin American tuna \n     fleets that continue to fish by chasing and netting dolphins. \n     A class 5 or 6 tuna vessel--the type used to set purse-seine \n     nets on dolphins--is capable of concealing multi-ton \n     shipments of cocaine with much less risk of discovery than \n     other smuggling methods. Class 5 and 6 tuna vessels fish on \n     the high\n\n[[Page S2604]]\n\n     seas for months at a time. Although they may embark for \n     specific fishing areas, these areas cover hundreds of square \n     miles. Furthermore, unlike a cargo vessel, which generally \n     travels directly from point ``A'' to point ``B,'' a fishing \n     vessel may traverse an area many times--creating unique \n     opportunities for transporting illegal goods.\n       The following information describes several recent \n     incidents in which tuna vessels and other fishing-type \n     vessels were apprehended carrying shipments of drugs. The \n     section also discusses the arrests for alleged drug-related \n     activity of persons with involvements in fishing businesses. \n     In some instances, our sources identified the vessel or \n     business in question as involved specifically in tuna \n     fishing; in others, the sources did not specify whether the \n     particular fishing enterprise was a tuna operation. In \n     addition, the sources sometimes made it clear that the \n     vessels or business were not actually engaged in fishing, but \n     were merely false fronts. Our discussion reflects these \n     distinctions where they apply.\n       During the last eighteen months, four ``record-breaking'' \n     seizures of cocaine on fishing vessels have been made: in \n     July 1995, the Nataly 1, a Panamanian tuna vessel, was caught \n     off the coast of Peru with more than 12 tons of cocaine; in \n     August 1996, the Limerick, a Honduran-registered fishing ship \n     crewed by Colombians and Ecuadorians, was seized off the \n     Colombian coast with 2 tons of cocaine; in October 1996, the \n     Ecuadoran tuna-type vessel, Don Celso, was captured off the \n     country's coast with almost 7 tons of cocaine--cargo which \n     took a U.S. Coast Guard team 6 days to find; in January 1997, \n     the Viva Sinaloa, a Mexican fishing vessel operating out of \n     Mazatlan, was intercepted off Mexico's Pacific coast carrying \n     3.5 tons of cocaine.\n       In September 1996, Manuel Rodriguez Lopez--believed to be \n     tied to the Cali Cartel--and owner of Grupo Pesquero \n     Rodriguez, which includes tuna companies in Baja California, \n     was placed under house arrest at the port of La Paz on \n     charges of money laundering. Rodriguez's close ties with PRI \n     officials (the ruling party in Mexico) were also under \n     investigation. Assets confiscated during his arrest--\n     including six tuna vessels--were valued at $15 million. \n     Rodriguez also owned the Nataly I and administered the \n     fishing companies Pesquera Carimar S.A. de C.V., Pesquera \n     Santo Tomas, Pesquera Kino, and Pesquera Cipes--all fishing \n     companies believed to be involved in drug trafficking and \n     money laundering.\n       Colombian Cali Cartel trafficker Jose Castrillon Henao--\n     allegedly partners with Mexico's Rodriguez--was believed to \n     have a fleet of 100 vessels at his disposal for transporting \n     drugs. He owned the Panamanian-registered fishing company, \n     Pesquera Azteca, to which the Nataly I was registered. The \n     fleet's long range fishing boats were used to transport \n     cocaine to islands off the Mexican coast, where the drugs \n     were then loaded onto smaller boats for distribution along \n     the Mexican coast. Castrillon helped finance Colombian \n     President Ernesto Perez Balladares' 1994 campaign; the \n     President's party said they had assumed his tuna business was \n     legitimate when he made the contributions.\n       Victor Julio Patino Fomeque, a leader for the Cali Cartel, \n     allegedly in charge of its naval smuggling operations, was \n     recently captured by Colombian officials. A former police \n     chief, he has been accused of using false fishing businesses \n     to smuggle tons of cocaine to the United States from the \n     Pacific port of Buenaventura.\n\n\n                The Implications of Lifting the Embargo\n\n       The current embargo on tuna from countries whose fleets set \n     on dolphins in the ETP prohibits Mexican tuna vessels from \n     selling their products in the U.S. market. After the embargo \n     was imposed in 1990, the number of Mexican vessels fishing \n     for tuna fell from 85 to 40. Lifting the embargo will most \n     likely lead to a greater number of vessels operating in the \n     ETP. More fishing vessels in the ETP will lead to conditions \n     that may provide greater opportunities for drug smuggling and \n     a reduced risk of being caught. An increase in the number of \n     vessels, combined with the likelihood that Latin American \n     tuna vessels would have more reason to approach the U.S. \n     coast, would render our interdiction efforts even more \n     difficult.\n       The long term potential for the well-financed narcotics \n     smugglers to establish facilities for ``tuna'' processing at \n     U.S. ports is a significant additional incentive. The \n     existence of family connections on both sides of the border \n     has proven to be a significant aid to narcotics trafficking, \n     and the extension of the same methodology to smuggling via \n     the tuna industry is possible, should the embargo be lifted. \n     Direct coastal access to the U.S., either through offloading \n     at sea to small fast boats which can complete the journey to \n     our shores, or through direct unloading at tuna processing \n     facilities at U.S. ports, may expedite smuggling by \n     eliminating the need to cross the land border.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I thank my friend from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I believe, according to the previous \nunanimous consent, the next 5 minutes is allotted to my colleague from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank you.\n  I would like to thank again the Senator from Georgia. It has been a \ngreat pleasure to work with him and Senator Hutchison. We began this \neffort over a week ago. It has been a very intensive effort. I believe \nit has resulted in a resolution which will have dominant support from \nthis body, pass the House, and be signed by the President of the United \nStates.\n  More importantly, I think this resolution will become the law and \nwill have teeth. And those teeth are: Administration: Report on \nSeptember 1 the progress that has been made. Here are the specific \nareas in which we wish you to make progress. If there is inadequate \nprogress made, it leaves no alternative really but to fuel up for a \nmassive decertification battle in a year.\n  I want to say one thing about America's demand problem. Because the \nSenator from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, who spoke on this issue, I \nthink had it right. One of the things that I have found is that we have \nprograms in this country that work and programs that do not work. And I \nwould just like to recommend to everybody that might be watching this a \nprogram that does work, a program which has no Government funds, a \nprogram with whom my colleague from California and I are very well \nfamiliar.\n  That is a program called Delancy Street in San Francisco which takes \nthe hardest core drug addicts, with about a 4-year stay, and puts them \nthrough an intensive program--changes their environment, changes their \nlifestyle, and does rehabilitate. As mayor, I helped Delancy get some \nland right on the waterfront. The Delancy people built their own \nfacilities, which are stellar. They run their own businesses. They pay \nfor their program through their labor.\n  And I would just like to invite--Delancy does not know I am doing \nthis--anyone, anywhere in the United States that has an interest in \nreplicating a program to rehabilitate American drug addicts that works, \nto go to San Francisco, to call Mimi Silbert, the director, and take a \nlook at a program that works, does not take dime one of public money \nand does it all on their own. It is one of the most impressive programs \nanywhere in the United States.\n  If we had more Delancys and more kinds of permeations of Delancy, \nDelancy Streets for young children, children 14, 15, 16 years old, I \nthink we could turn this Nation around. If we had more programs like \nFacts on Crack from Glide Memorial Church in San Francisco, we could \nbegin to turn this Nation around. But in the meantime, we have to \nretard the supply of drugs. And that is a major first step.\n  So again, I say thank you to everyone that has participated. I look \nforward to the vote. I thank the Chair and I yield back the balance of \nmy few minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we are about at the hour to bring to a \nconclusion a very long and arduous effort to produce a positive result \nas we struggle with the ravages of drugs in our country and in Mexico \nand in the hemisphere.\n\n  I want to acknowledge Senator Kyl of Arizona who has made a \ncontribution in terms of border agents. Again, I want to thank the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms of North \nCarolina, for his great work and, of course, my immediate colleagues in \nthe work, Senator Feinstein and Senator Hutchison and the staffs that \nhave worked so long and late to produce this resolution.\n  This resolution is a renewal statement. It is a new place and it \nchanges the dynamics of the debate with regard to the drug cartels in \nthe United States, in Mexico, and the hemisphere.\n  I would simply close by reiterating my statement earlier. I hope all \nof our colleagues in the hemisphere, Mexico and the other countries, \nwill understand that this is a new statement, it is an honest appraisal \nof a war that is ravaging the opportunities before us as we come on the \nnew century, and see it as a new statement, a statement of renewal and \nreinvigorated alliance.\n\n[[Page S2605]]\n\n  Mr. President, the hour of 3 o'clock has arrived, and by the previous \nunanimous consent, I believe that moves us to the vote.

Some Senators will use this time to travel to distant and exotic \nlocations. Others will return home for busy rounds of meetings. Schools \naround the nation are also closing their doors for spring break. For \nmany college students, spring break has become a beach vacation ritual, \nreplete with loud parties, little self-restraint, and the over-\nconsumption of booze--alcohol. At home, spring sales are in full force, \nwith stores luring credit-happy buyers away from the outdoor pleasures \nthat warming days and budding gardens invite. The celebration of \nwinter's passing and the rekindling of life all around us has been \nlost, for many, in the materialistic and hedonistic whirlwind of \neveryday life. Only the pastel colors of paper flowers link the \nclimate-controlled interior of the shopping malls with the greening of \nthe spring earth.\n  But today is also the vernal equinox, that chiming peal on the \ncelestial clock that marks the turning of the seasons, the day on which \nthe periods of light and dark are again of equal length following the \nlong, cold, dreary nights of winter. In 325 A.D., during the reign of \nthat great convert to Christianity, the Emperor Constantine, the \ncouncil of Nicaea met. With the help of the Archbishop of Alexandria \nand the astronomers of that distant day, the Council decreed that \nEaster should fall on the first Sunday after the first full moon \nfollowing the vernal equinox. So, today we may look ahead with \ncertainty toward the Sunday after next for the enduring celebration of \nthat central mystery of the Christian faith, the resurrection of Jesus \nChrist.\n  Mr. President, although in recent years the trend has been to strip \nevery religious overtone from our calendar and from our schools--and \nthank God the Constitution protects my right to stand on this Senate \nfloor and talk about whatever I may please. Let it be religion. The \nSupreme Court cannot do anything about it.\n  So the trend has been to strip every religious overtone from our \ncalendar and from our schools to rename the Christmas holiday a \n``winter break'' and the Easter holiday a ``spring break.'' I am not \nsure that the result--a nation more interested in consumption, \ndepartment store sales, junk television, and professional sports \nperformances, than in church, community and family--is a happy one. I \nstill believe that there is a deep wellspring of religious belief that \nsustains our Nation as it does in the close-knit and caring communities \nin which I grew up. The community churches which still thrive in West \nVirginia were the focal point of towns and communities of my childhood.\n  And contrary to the beliefs of some of our sophisticated brethren in \nWashington and some of the other great metropolitan centers in this \ncountry, they do not have rattlesnakes in all of those churches. As a \nmatter of fact, I have never been in a church where there was a \nrattlesnake--a few two-legged ones perhaps, but that is where they \nought to go, to church. Social life revolved around Sunday services and \nactivities sponsored by, or otherwise intimately linked with, the \nchurch and celebrations of faith. But as I witness the slow unraveling \nof our communities, their weave frayed by casual greed and picked apart \nby drugs and violence, I worry that the clear-flowing waters of family, \nchurch and community that nourished me and millions like me are \nbecoming fouled and turbid. The erosion of Easter into a crass and \ncommercial ``spring break'' is but one sad example of the materialistic \ntrend in this country and in this age. More media coverage is awarded \nto the excesses of Mardi Gras on Fat, or Shrove, Tuesday--also called \nPancake Day--than on the entire forty days of Lent. I wonder how many \npeople who dress up and masquerade in that carnival parade recall that \nthe original purpose of Mardi Gras was to prepare for the Lenten fasts \nby using up the available cooking oil and fat in a pre-fast eating \nbinge? The binge was fun, but it did not blot out the central religious \npurpose of the repentant fast to follow.\n\n  Mr. President, Easter Sunday ends forty days of religious observance \nbeginning with Ash Wednesday, set as the beginning of Lent by Pope \nGregory at the beginning of the sixth century. This coming Sunday is \nknown as Palm Sunday, in observance of the palm-strewn entrance of \nJesus into Jerusalem. The following Friday, or Good Friday, marks the \nday that Jesus suffered on the Cross and died. It is a solemn day \nindeed, yet I fear that, for too many people, it is just another day \noff from work, filled with errands, or shopping, or travel, with not a \npassing thought given to the suffering of God's only Son on the cross.\n  I am not a minister. I do not profess to be worthy of the title. But \nI grew up in a Christian home. My foster father was a coal miner and my \nfoster mother was the only mother I ever knew. They were religious \npeople. They were not of the religious left or of the religious right. \nThey were not of the Christian center or the Christian left or the \nChristian right. Neither am I. They just were plain, down-to-Earth, \nGod-fearing, God-loving Christian parents.\n  And, so it is that I come to the Senate Chamber today, as I say, not \nas a cleric or as a minister. I probably could not be one. But I do \nbelieve in the Bible and its teachings, even though I have\n\n[[Page S2606]]\n\nnot always found it so easy to live up to those teachings.\n  Easter Sunday is not just a day to mark with brightly colored hard-\nboiled eggs or chocolate bunnies, or with jelly beans and plastic grass \nin wicker baskets. All of these ancient symbols of spring and rebirth \nhave their place, but it disturbs me to think that children may know \nChristmas day only for its early morning toy-filled stockings, and \nEaster only for its baskets and Easter egg hunts.\n  Easter Sunday commemorates the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I do not \nask everyone to believe as I do. I do not ask everyone to be a \nmissionary Baptist. It does not make any difference to me whether the \nSenator from Illinois, the Senator from Idaho, or the Senator from Iowa \nis a Baptist or a Methodist or an Episcopalian or Catholic or Jewish \nrabbi or Moslem; it doesn't make any difference to me. I can listen to \nall of them and still maintain my own way of looking at things.\n  So, all of these ancient symbols of spring and rebirth have their \nplace. But it disturbs me to think that children, as I say, may know \nEaster only as a day for baskets and Easter egg hunts.\n  Easter Sunday commemorates the resurrection of Jesus Christ. And I \nnow read from the King James version. That is the only version I will \nread. That is the Bible that was in my father's house. It is the only \none I know and the only one I will have in my house. So I read from the \nKing James version of the Bible the Gospel of St. Mark, Chapter 16, \nverses 1-7. Let us listen to Mark. He was the attendant of Peter. He \nspeaks to us of the resurrection:\n\n       And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the \n     mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that \n     they might come and anoint him.\n\n       And very early in the morning the first day of the week, \n     they came unto the sepulcher at the rising of the sun.\n       And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the \n     stone from the door of the sepulcher?\n       And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled \n     away: for it was very great.\n       And entering into the sepulcher, they saw a young man \n     sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; \n     and they were affrighted.\n       And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of \n     Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: \n     behold the place where they laid him.\n       But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth \n     before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said \n     unto you.\n\n  So Easter is a vivid and lasting celebration of the promise of life \nafter death. Like spring itself, Easter is, in its essence, a \ncelebration of the rebirth of living things. That hope, that promise of \nlife after death, guides our behavior in the here-and-now. It \nreinforces the need to act not only in our own selfish interests, but \nalso for the common good, else we be judged unworthy of Christ's \nsacrifice. It sustains us when we encounter harsh difficulties and \ntragic events in our lives--and I know because I have experienced such, \nas have many others of us in this Chamber.\n  We believe that there is a better life still to come. And, if we did \nnot have that hope, then this life would be empty. The promise of a \nlife after death comes to us through John, ``the beloved disciple''. \nReading from the King James version of the Bible, the Gospel of St. \nJohn, Chapter 20, verses 24-31:\n\n       But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with \n     them when Jesus came.\n       The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen \n     the Lord. But he [Thomas] said unto them, Except I shall see \n     in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into \n     the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I \n     will not believe.\n       And after eight days again his disciples were within, and \n     Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and \n     stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.\n       Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and \n     behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it \n     into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.\n       And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.\n       Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, \n     thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and \n     yet have believed.\n       And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his \n     disciples, which are not written in this book:\n       But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is \n     the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have \n     life through his name.\n\n  And so, Mr. President, that is the promise--``that believing'' we \nmight have life. The next two weeks may be a recess for some, and for \nsome a ``spring break,'' but for millions of Americans, the next two \nweeks are also a life-affirming celebration of the greatest gift any of \nus has ever received--hope in a future life. For those who have lost \nloved ones, Easter brings the joyous hope that we can again see, we can \nagain be with that loved one, as I lost my grandson 15 years ago this \ncoming April the 12th. He died on the Monday morning after Easter \nSunday, perhaps around 3:30, 4 o'clock in the morning, the victim of a \ntruck crash into a tree and a fire that devastated his beautiful body--\n17 years old, looking forward to graduation from high school, 6 feet 5, \nand 300 pounds, all man, with life ahead of him. And there are others \nin this Chamber who have suffered the loss of a child or a grandchild \nor a parent, a sister or brother or wife or husband. We can see our \nloved ones again.\n  So Easter represents the resurrection, it is the celebration of the \nresurrection, and it gives us hope that there will be a future \nresurrection. That is what it means to millions of people in this \ncountry.\n  As the sun warms our backs, and the spring breezes carry past us the \nmingled scents of pear blossoms and magnolia blossoms and the warm \nearth, let us offer our heartfelt prayers for our faith, for our \nfamily, for our church, for our community, and for our Nation. I hope \nthat my colleagues and those who hear or read my words will also take a \nfew moments away from the commerce of everyday life to reflect on the \ntrue reason why a recess is scheduled at this time--to celebrate this \nmost holy of Christian holidays, Easter.\n  Edwin L. Sabin captures both the solemnity and the joy of Christ's \nresurrection in his poem, ``Easter:''\n\n     The barrier stone has rolled away,\n     And loud the angels sing;\n     The Christ comes forth this blessed day\n     To reign, a deathless King.\n     For shall we not believe He lives\n     Through such awakening?\n     Behold, how God each April gives\n     The miracle of Spring.\n\n  Mr. President, I invite my colleagues to recall this miracle, and the \nfaith that gives them and gives communities throughout our Nation the \nstrength to persevere--to fight against the violence, the greed, and \nthe moral decay that threaten the fabric of our families, our \ncommunities, and our Nation.\n  I also invite my colleagues and my fellow citizens--and I invite \nmyself--to again see Easter Sunday as the celebration of the \nresurrection and the promise that there is a life after death. William \nJennings Bryan and my congenial colleague from the State of Illinois, \nMr. Durbin, will appreciate this especially. William Jennings Bryan \nexpressed it well in ``The Prince of Peace'':\n\n       If the Father deigns to touch with divine power the cold \n     and pulseless heart of the buried acorn and to make it burst \n     forth from its prison walls, will He leave neglected in the \n     earth the soul of man, made in the image of his Creator? If \n     He stoops to give to the rosebush, whose withered blossoms \n     float upon the autumn breeze, the sweet assurance of another \n     springtime, will He refuse the words of hope to the sons of \n     men when the frosts of winter come? If matter, mute and \n     inanimate, though changed by the forces of nature into a \n     multitude of forms, can never be destroyed, will the imperial \n     spirit of man suffer annihilation when it has paid a brief \n     visit like a royal guest to this tenement of clay? No, I am \n     sure that He who, notwithstanding His apparent prodigality, \n     created nothing without a purpose, and wasted not a single \n     atom in all of His creation, has made provision for a future \n     life in which man's universal longing for immortality will \n     find its realization. I am as sure that we live again as I am \n     sure that we live today.\n\n  William Jennings Bryan spoke those words in ``The Prince of Peace.''\n  Mr. President, may all of us, as we approach the blessed Easter \nseason, enjoy renewed hope in the message that we shall live again.\n  And when you get closer to 79--79 years and 4 months, as I am today--\nthe more you will believe and begin to see more and more the truth, the \nuniversal truth, the eternal truth that God still lives, that He \ncreated this great universe and all the universes, and that He created \nman. I don't know how He created man. I am not worried about that, by \nwhat method or through what process all that was done. But we are told \nthat God created man out of the dust of\n\n[[Page S2607]]\n\nthe ground in His own image, and breathed into his nostrils the breath \nof life. And man became a living soul. That is good enough for me.\n  So, Mr. President, as we approach this Easter, let us learn again the \nmessage that comes to us from Him who said 2,000 years ago: ``I, if I \nbe lifted up from the Earth, will draw all men unto me.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before I speak on the subject that I am \nhere to speak on, I want to thank the Senator from West Virginia for \nhis statement.

Mr. President, this is the fifth time I have taken the \nfloor to make observations about the FBI's upside-down management of \nits crime lab.\n  In my view, the FBI's Director, Louis Freeh, continues to mislead the \npublic about the lab. He would have us think that the FBI lab has met \nthe highest standards. He has maintained that the allegations of the \nlab's whistleblower, Dr. Frederic Whitehurst, are all wrong. He has \nsaid that no other scientist in the lab has come forward with similar \naccusations. His testimony before Congress recently was totally \nconsistent with that image.\n  But documents belie the Director's rosy portrayal of the lab., and of \nhis dark portrayal of Dr. Whitehurst.\n  Thus far, I have released documents showing there is credibility to \nsome of Dr. Whitehurst's allegations. I have pointed to press accounts \nin which the public has learned the IG's still-secret report uncovers \nproblems in three specific cases. thus backing up Dr. Whitehurst with \nspecifics. I released documents showing that Director Freeh was aware \nof the exact same allegations, investigated them, yet covered them up. \nI revealed that there was a second scientist who came forward with \nserious allegations that paralleled those of Dr. Whitehurst.\n  I do not know what it will take for Mr. Freeh to admit these things, \nMr. President. Perhaps the public needs to see more of the FBI`s \ndocuments that underscore my points. That's fine by me. Because \ndocuments don't mislead. They do not have a motive to. But, people do. \nAnd when leaders of the people mislead, there's a breakdown in \nconfidence and trust.\n  And so, I am here today, Mr. President, to test the boundaries of Mr. \nFreeh's denials. Today, I am releasing yet more FBI documents, obtained \nthrough the Freedom of Information Act. These documents contradict Mr. \nFreeh's own assertions. The American people have a right to know this.\n  Today, I will reveal a third scientist in the FBI lab, who \nsubstantiated some of Dr. Whitehurst's more serious allegations. He \nsubstantiated them just months after the FBI Director and his team of \nlawyers whitewashed them. This third scientist, in fact, was \nWhitehurst's unit chief in the lab.\n  Here are the facts. In December 1992, Dr. Whitehurst made the serious \nallegations that his lab reports were being altered by other agents who \nlacked authority to do so. Altered reports could constitute tampering \nwith evidence and obstruction of justice, and could therefore be \ncriminal.\n  The universe of cases being looked at was 48 cases. Not all of them \nwere altered. But all had to be checked. Some appeared to contain \nsubstantial changes. The Whitehurst memo of allegations went to the \nAssistant Director of the FBI for the Laboratory Division.\n  In May 1994, a review of the Whitehurst allegations--much more \nextensive than just the altered reports issue, but including them--was \ndone by Mr. Freeh's lawyers, rather than by an independent body with \nsome scientific background. Ironically, it was the IG's investigation \nthat supplied the needed independence and a scientific approach, and \nonly then did these problems get aired.\n  But, the FBI's review was headed by Mr. Freeh's general counsel, \nHoward Shapiro. He's the Director's top lawyer, himself a controversial \nfigure with Congress. Mr. Shapiro felt there was no need to have an \nindependent review because, as he said, the FBI has a long, proud \nhistory of doing its own reviews. Upon completion, the review was \neventually read and signed-off-on by Director Freeh.\n  So, here is what the FBI's own review found. First, there were no \nmajor problems in the lab. Everything was hunky dory. On the specific \nissue of altered lab reports, here is what Mr. Shapiro found.\n\n       [Laboratory Division] management made it clear that this \n     will not be tolerated and has instructed the Unit Chief's \n     (sic) to reiterate this policy.\n\n  How about that for a finding for this crack review team, Mr. \nPresident. They're investigating serious, possibly criminal activities. \nInstead of finding out whether it happened, Mr. Shapiro merely said \nit's not supposed to happen. His recommendation? If there were \nalterations, just correct the written report.\n  You see, Mr. President, under the long-standing Brady decision, the \ngovernment is required to provide the accused with any information that \nmight point to their innocence. Material alterations of lab analysis \nmight fit into that category. If changes had been discovered in some \nreports, the proper thing to do was to judge the impact of any \nalterations on each court case. Instead, Mr. Shapiro thought justice \nwould be served by simply correcting the paperwork. Cases closed.\n  By October 1994--about 5 months after Mr. Shapiro's review was \nissued--the IG got hold of the same allegations. The IG began its own \nreview of the 48 cases.\n  Meanwhile, in September 1994, the FBI lab managers discovered another \nagent making the same allegations of altered reports as Dr. Whitehurst \nwas making. The allegations by then were being investigated thoroughly \nby lab personnel.\n  By January 1995, the lab's investigation was completed. An FBI unit \nchief, whose name I will not divulge, wrote a memo of investigation to \nhis section chief. In it, he stated that 13 of Whitehurst's 48 cases \nhad significant alterations. He recommended the following:\n\n       That [Supervisory Special Agent] (blank) be held \n     accountable for the unauthorized changes he made in the \n     [Auxilliary Examiner] dictation of SSA Whitehurst by \n     administrative action to include both oral reprimand and a \n     letter of censure.\n\n  The unit chief concluded his memo this way: ``(Blank) committed \nerrors which were clearly intentional. He acted irresponsibly; he \nshould be held accountable; he should be disciplined accordingly.''\n  The scientist-unit chief writing the memo, and who backed up Dr. \nWhitehurst's allegations, identified the culprit. I won't reveal who \neither one is. But the memo is significant. It reveals yet another \nscientist--a unit chief, no less--who substantiated Whitehurst's \nallegations. It is another apparent example of an FBI lab agent shaving \nthe evidence to get a conviction.\n  What was covered over by Mr. Shapiro's team of crack lawyers less \nthan 1 year before, was now popping up. The lab's management was \nfinding the opposite of what Shapiro and his lawyers found. That meant \nthere were conflicting findings. And that is serious. The lab unit \nchief's report was at odds with Director Freeh's. What was senior \nmanagement--those above the lab managers--to do?\n  The answer was not long in coming. During this time frame, FBI \nmanagement indeed found a suitable discipline for this rogue agent. Mr. \nPresident, they promoted him. They made him a unit chief. The agent \nfound to have intentionally altered evidence was promoted. That tells \nus how senior management resolved the dilemma. They\n\n[[Page S2608]]\n\npromoted the rogue, and shot the messenger.\n  That set the stage for the coverup. Because just 10 months later, \nwhen the Whitehurst allegations became public, Mr. Freeh issued the \nfollowing statement in response. This was on November 8, 1995. He said:\n\n       The FBI has vigorously investigated his (Whitehurst's) \n     concerns and is continuing to do so. The FBI alone has \n     reviewed more than 250 cases involving work previously done \n     by the Laboratory. To date, the FBI has found no evidence \n     tampering, evidence fabrication, or failure to report \n     exculpatory evidence. Any finding of such misconduct will \n     result in tough and swift action by the FBI.\n\n  Is that what happened to the rogue agent, Mr. President? Yes. The FBI \ntook swift action to get him promoted.\n  The fact is, the statement by Mr. Freeh on November 8, 1995, was \nutterly false. Lab reports are evidence. If altered substantially--and \n13 reports were--that is evidence of possible evidence tampering, and \nmore.\n  Ultimately, the IG caught up with the rogue agent. The FBI did not. \nBut the IG did. When the IG report finally reached the Bureau, this \nrogue agent became one of the three who were transferred from the lab. \nYet no other action has been taken against him by the FBI. I aim to \nfind out why not.\n  Mr. President, what is clear about all this is, the FBI is buried \nunder a mountain of evidence showing it cannot police itself. It took \nthe inspector general's investigation to finally root out what the FBI \nhad covered up. Some good people in the FBI tried to do the right \nthing. But senior management got in the way. Senior management \napparently places a higher value on maintaining image, rather than \nrooting out wrong.\n  Therefore, the time may have come for independent review of the FBI. \nSomeone needs to police the police. They cannot police themselves. That \nis for sure. Perhaps the way to go is to beef up the independent IG, \ninstead of the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility, as the \nDirector has proposed.\n  Growing up on the family farm in Iowa, my father taught us to revere \nand respect the FBI. They were the champions of right versus wrong in \nour society. We looked up to them, whether justified or not.\n  I still have that same respect for the FBI. There are literally \nthousands of good, decent men and women serving their country as FBI \nemployees.\n  But those honest, hardworking agents need and deserve leadership that \nhas integrity and credibility. They need leaders who will go after bad \nguys, and protect good guys. Not the other way around. They need \nleaders who reward honesty and punish wrongdoing--not the other way \naround, as we see in this case.\n  The issue of bad management in the crime lab is serious. Bad \nscientific analysis used in court means good guys can go to prison, and \nbad guys can walk. That's not what we want. That is un-American. That's \nwhat they have in dictatorships. There is no room for that in a \ndemocracy.\n  Mr. President, I have talked to my colleagues about the culture at \nthe FBI under the present management. It seems to reward those who rush \nto a conviction. It seems to punish those who, in the FBI's eyes, \n``commit truth.''\n  There is no better image to show this than how they treated the rogue \nagent--they promoted him--and how they treated Dr. Whitehurst--they \nwent after him.\n  Mr. President, I do not have to say anything else. That says it all.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have relevant documents to \nwhich I referred, plus others that will help provide additional \ncontext, printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     From SSA Frederic Whitehurst\n     To Asst Director John Hicks\n\n     Re alteration of laboratory report of SSA Whitehurst.\n\n       Purpose: to document the alterations of auxiliary examiner \n     * * * laboratory reports of SSA Whitehurst * * *\n       Recommendation: That any alteration of AE dictation of SSA \n     Whitehurst be done with the full concurrence of SSA \n     Whitehurst and the Unit Chief of the Materials Analysis Unit.\n       Details: On 11/27/92 * * * of the Materials Analysis Unit \n     advised SSA Whitehurst, * * * that * * * had been told by * * \n     * that he was changing the auxiliary examiner dictation of \n     SSA Whitehurst before publishing reports from the Laboratory. \n     This information was the first that SSA Whitehurst has had \n     concerning the changing of his dictation in the five and one \n     half years that SSA Whitehurst has been a examiner in the \n     Laboratory. At no time has SSA * * * consulted SSA Whitehurst \n     concerning these changes.\n       As a result of receiving this information, SSA Whitehurst \n     reviewed his files to determine the cases that SSA Whitehurst \n     as worked as an auxiliary examiner since 1987 * * * which \n     these alterations have been taking place and the possible \n     effect of the alterations on the reported expert opinion of \n     SSA Whitehurst.\n       During the period from 1987 to present SSA Whitehurst has \n     written forty eight auxiliary examiner reports * * *. Of \n     those reports SSA Whitehurst was able to retrieve sixteen \n     files from records. The other files were listed as checked \n     out and their location was not pursued. Review of the files \n     indicates that * * * has often paraphrased or totally altered \n     the reports. Of the sixteen files reviewed, the Laboratory \n     reports were placed into four groups: 1.) Those where no \n     change was made to the auxiliary examiner report. 2.) Those \n     where paraphrasing of the report was such that the meaning \n     was the same but the words different. 3.) Those where \n     paraphrasing could cause possible problems in court. 4.) \n     Those where paraphrasing changed the meaning or significantly \n     altered the content of the report. In group one there were \n     three reports (70921005, 91121007, and 90615067). In group \n     two there were five reports (71116047, 71221007, 70921006, \n     91121008, and 71116048). In group three there were three \n     reports (80217150, 71125046 and 91207016). In group four \n     there were five reports (71124001, 90823043, 70920045, \n     90623042, and 91130017). Copies of the AE report and the \n     final Laboratory report from each matter are included in the \n     attached package.\n       This communication has been submitted to bring attention to \n     possible problems during testimony if AE dictation is \n     arbitrarily changed in the manner described. For example, in \n     Laboratory matter 90823043 the AE dictation is as follows:\n       ``Chemical and physical analyses of specimen Q4 have \n     identified the presence of Pyrodex low explosive.\n       The results of chemical analyses of specimen Q6 are \n     consistent with the presence of residues of Pyrodex low \n     explosive.\n       It is the opinion of this examiner that the residues in Q6 \n     originated from a low explosive mixture which contained \n     Pyrodex.\n       Pyrodex is a commercial low explosive produced by Hodgdon \n     Powder Co.''\n       On the other hand the final report dictation reads,\n       ``Present in specimen Q6 are explosive residues which \n     chemical analysis show to have originated from a low \n     explosive mixture which contained Pyrodex. Pyrodex is a \n     commercial low explosive produced by Hodgdon Powder Co. . . .\n       Present in specimen Q4 is a quantity of black-colored \n     powder which has been identified as Pyrodex low explosive.''\n       Though the wording in the first paragraph is a paraphrase \n     of the contents of the AE dictation, the contents of the \n     second paragraph do not say at all what was said in the AE \n     dictation. There is a big difference between determining that \n     Pyrodex is present and saying that the powder is Pyrodex. In \n     this particular matter there happened to be other materials \n     present in the powder. If faced on the stand with that \n     argument the examiner would have to admit that the dictation \n     was wrong. Opinions presented in the AE reports from the \n     Materials Analysis Unit have been thought out very carefully \n     and reviewed by the Unit Chief very carefully.\n       In FBI Laboratory matter 70920045 the AE dictation reads:\n       ``Specimen Q4 has the chemical and physical characteristics \n     of C-4 explosive. Semi-quantitative analysis determined that \n     Q4 is composed of 2.5% polyisobutylene, 7.0% Di-(2-\n     ethylhexyl) adipate plasticizer and oil and 91.5% high \n     explosive RDX containing a small amount of HMX high \n     explosive. C-4 is a military plastic explosive.\n       White powder found in specimen Q6 has the physical and \n     chemical characteristics of pentaerythritol tetranitrate \n     (PETN), a high explosive commonly found in detonating cord.''\n       The final Laboratory report reads:\n       `` . . . Present in specimen Q4 is a white putty-type \n     material which has been identified as United States Military \n     explosive type M112 commonly referred to as `C-4.' . . .\n       Present in specimen Q6 are two (2) lengths of detonating \n     cord which are yellow in color with three black tracer \n     threads that contain the high explosive PETN.''\n       In this particular matter no mention is made of the \n     analysis conducted on specimens Q4 or Q6 nor could the \n     Laboratory notes or AE report be found in the file.\n       In order to determine if the practice of altering the AE \n     dictation of SSA Whitehurst's explosives analysis results is \n     endemic to the Explosives Unit the reports of three other \n     examiners who are now or have been in the Explosives Unit \n     were reviewed. That review included reports from SSA * * *, \n     SSA * * * and SSA * * *. In not one of their reports were the \n     AE dictation reports of SSA Whitehurst changed even to \n     paraphrase the reports. SSA * * * practice of altering AE \n     reports appears to be an isolated situation.\n\n[[Page S2609]]\n\n     \n                                                                    ____\n                                                  October 7, 1994.\n     Re allegations regarding changes in FBI laboratory reports by \n         Frederick Whitehurst.\n\n     David R. Glendinning,\n     Office of Inspector General, Department of Justice, \n         Washington, DC.\n\n       Dear Mr. Glendinning: As you will recall, several months \n     ago you contacted me regarding numerous allegations your \n     office had received against the FBI Laboratory Division (LD) \n     from Supervisory Special Agent Frederick Whitehurst who is an \n     explosive residue examiner in the LD. You explained that \n     Whitehurst had made numerous allegations regarding problems \n     in the FBI LD, but that only one, involving the changing of \n     auxiliary examination dictation, warranted further \n     investigation by your office. I told you that the FBI's \n     Office of the General Counsel (OGC) had also received the \n     same allegations from Whitehurst and was already conducting \n     an investigation. As you know, our preliminary investigation \n     is complete, and the report dated May 24, 1994, was made \n     available to your office.\n       As you will recall, the allegation you were interested in \n     investigating involved Whitehurst's claim that in some cases, \n     Principal Examiners (PE) from the Explosives Unit had changed \n     his Auxiliary Examiner (AE) dictation without his approval or \n     knowledge. OGC contacted the LD management regarding this \n     allegation who advised that the LD had a longstanding policy \n     prohibiting any changes in AE dictation by the PE without the \n     express permission of the AE. The LD immediately reaffirmed \n     this policy with all its examiners. The May report made the \n     following recommendation regarding Whitehurst's allegations \n     on this matter:\n       Recommendation: We feel that LD management has \n     appropriately addressed this issue. However, we are making \n     the following recommendations to correct any past unapproved \n     AE dictation changes and ensure that the AE has a chance to \n     review final reports:\n       1. Examine all past reports where SSA Whitehurst and * * * \n     (the other explosive residues examiner) were the AE's, and \n     compare with the language of the final reports to ensure \n     there were no changes. If changes were made, appropriate \n     action should be taken to correct any substantive errors that \n     were contained in the final report(s).\n       2. Require a copy of the final report be distributed to the \n     AE examiners at the same time the final report is mailed to \n     the contributor.\n       The FBI adopted the recommendations from the report which \n     are currently being implemented by the LD. The deadline for \n     the review conducted pursuant to recommendation number one is \n     October 15, 1994, and I will forward a copy of the report to \n     your office as soon as it becomes available.\n       The LD examiner who is reviewing the Whitehurst and * * * \n     PE/AE reports advised that he believes there are still one or \n     two reports that have not yet been retrieved. Once a final \n     accounting of every report is completed, I will send you a \n     copy of any remaining reports not enclosed with this letter. \n     The only redactions in the enclosed reports are the case \n     names and other personal identifying data.\n       The following is a list of the enclosed reports which are \n     identified by the FBI LD number:\n     1. 00530046\n     2. 70724075\n     3. 70921005\n     4. 70921006\n     5. 70928045\n     6. 71019029\n     7. 71116047\n     8. 71116048\n     9. 71125046\n     10. 71224001\n     11. 71228078\n     12. 80121007\n     13. 80217150\n     14. 80803018\n     15. 80803019\n     16. 81108029\n     17. 81223004\n     18. 90403032\n     19. 90509063\n     20. 90615067\n     21. 90623042\n     22. 90626055\n     23. 90808074\n     24. 90823043\n     25. 91121007\n     26. 91121008\n     27. 91130017\n     28. 91204079\n     29. 91207016\n     30. 20124011\n     31. 20207023\n     32. 20416043\n     33. 20618039\n     34. 20624009\n     35. 20729026\n     36. 20812032\n     37. 21118013\n     38. 21123024\n     39. 21214070\n     40. 21221093\n     41. 21221094\n     42. 30422012\n     43. 30611054\n     44. 30708031\n     45. 30802045\n     46. 30812043\n     47. 30816032\n     48. 31001027\n       Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need any \n     further information or additional assistance.

J. Kearney\n\n     Re alternations and changes in AE reports by PE examiners \n         without approval of AE examiner scientific analysis \n         section [SAS] Laboratory Division [LD].\n\n       Reference Mr. H. M. Shapiro memorandum to Mr. Hicks, dated \n     6/8/94 and Messrs * * * and * * * memorandum to Mr. Shapiro, \n     dated 5/25/94.\n       Purpose: To Advise you of the actions being taken to \n     resolve the captioned issue.\n       Recommendation: None, for information only.\n       Details: As described in the * * * and * * * memorandum to \n     Mr. Shapiro, SSA Frederic Whitehurst, Materials Analysis \n     Unit, SAS, has alleged that in some instances Principal \n     Examiners (PE) from the Explosives Unit have changed his \n     Auxiliary Examiner (AE) dictation without his approval. \n     Following some review it appears that the practice is \n     isolated to one * * * .\n       In addition, prior to issuance of the referenced memoranda. \n     I was approached by * * * a second * * * who rendered a \n     similar complaint concerning the work of * * * I met with * * \n     *. Explosives Unit in an attempt to resolve the issue. During \n     the meetings, it was apparent there was a deeper unresolved \n     issue which existed between the examiners of the two units. \n     The issue centered around what each unit believed their \n     individual roles were when reporting the examinations of \n     evidence in bombing matters. It was the position of the \n     Explosives Unit that examiners in the Materials Analysis Unit \n     should limit their reporting to the chemical analysis of the \n     explosive residues and not discuss the nature of explosive \n     materials. On the Other hand, the Materials Analysis Unit's \n     position was that the Explosives Unit periodically went too \n     far in their interpretation of the residue data when they \n     formulated their conclusions and summary statements in their \n     reports.\n       In these meetings, the practice that a PE not change an \n     AE's dictation without first discussing the matter with, and \n     getting the AE's approval was reemphasized with each of the \n     Unit Chiefs and the Examiners. It was agreed that the two \n     units would follow the practice. In addition, in order to \n     ensure that the AE examiner is kept informed as to what is \n     being reported on regarding his work, it was reemphasized \n     that a tickler copy of the final report would be provided to \n     the AE examiner for his review and records.\n       Further, I recommended that when bombing cases go to trial, \n     we send both the explosive expert and explosive residue \n     expert to testify to their results. This policy is in keeping \n     with how testimony is handled in other cases in the \n     Laboratory having both AE and PE testimony and would prevent \n     any further confusion or possible misrepresentation of the AE \n     dictation in bombing cases.\n       In order to resolve the issue * * * I have asked * * * to \n     review * * *. Some of the cases have already been reviewed by \n     * * *. The remainder of the cases will be reviewed by * * * \n     and all cases will be placed into two categories:\n       Category One will include all those cases where no \n     alteration occurred or if an alteration occurred, it did not \n     change the meaning of the dictation.\n       Category Two will include all those cases where an \n     alteration of the dictation occurred which caused a change in \n     the meaning of the dictation and may have resulted in a \n     misrepresentation of the data.\n       It is anticipated that the remainder of the review will be \n     completed by October 15, 1994. A summary report of * * * \n     findings will be prepared. At that time, it will be \n     determined * * *.\n       I have enclosed * * * copy of this memorandum * * * so that \n     the review of this matter will be comprehensive and \n     efficient.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 January 13, 1995.\n     To: Mr. Kearney\n     From: * * *\n\n     Re alterations and Changes in auxiliary examiner (AE) reports \n         by principal examiner (PE) without approval of AE \n         examiner; Scientific Analysis Section (SAS) Laboratory \n         Division (LD).\n\n       Reference J.J. Kearney's directive on 1/4/95, to document \n     recommendations resulting from a review of captioned matter.\n       Purpose: To make recommendations regarding the documented \n     alterations of auxiliary examiner dictation from the \n     Materials Analysis Unit (MAU) by SSA Explosives Unit (EU).\n       Recommendations: 1. That SSA * * * be held accountable for \n     the unauthorized changes he made in the AE dictation of SSA \n     WHITEHURST by administrative action to include both oral \n     reprimand and a letter of censure.\n       2. That the Assistant Director in Charge of the Laboratory \n     Division mandate that all PEs provide a copy of all outgoing \n     reports that include AE dictation to the respective AEs to \n     avoid the possibility of mistakes/errors being furnished to a \n     contributor as a result of misuse or misinterpretation of the \n     AE dictation by the PE.\n       3. That the issue as to whether or not revised reports \n     should be prepared and furnished to the contributors in the \n     thirteen (13) cases where I have concluded significant \n     alterations were done SSA * * * be referred to General \n     Counsel for resolution.\n       4. That Laboratory policy be re-emphasized to insure that \n     PEs never be allowed to testify to the results/meaning of AE \n     dictation furnished to them that clearly falls outside their \n     expertise.\n       Details: Based upon a memorandum to each Laboratory Unit \n     Chief from J.W. HICKS dated 5/24/91, the approved, current \n     Laboratory policy for errors made by a person in the \n     Laboratory is clearly documented. This memorandum lists four \n     types of errors. The alteration of another examiner's \n     dictation without consultation with that examiner or his/her \n     Unit Chief would fit, in my opinion, the criteria of the most \n     serious type of error defined by the ``willful or grossly \n     negligent error.''\n       It has always been understood practice (perhaps not written \n     policy) that PEs do not change/alter/reword/revise AE \n     dictation without consulting with and receiving permission \n     from the AE, or their respective Unit chief in combination \n     with the AE.\n       The problems that could arise during testimony when AE \n     dictation is arbitrarily\n\n[[Page S2610]]\n\n     changed cannot be over-emphasized. The wording in all MAU \n     dictation is carefully thought out, discussed, peer reviewed \n     often times, and results from correct interpretations of the \n     data. Any dictation signed out by the MAU Unit Chief or his \n     designee should not be changed in any manner without the \n     proper notification and consent of the AE.\n       In my opinion, SSA * * * chose to ignore this longstanding \n     practice, a practice that everyone else adheres to.\n       It is clear that SSA * * * does not understand the \n     scientific issues involved with the interpretation and \n     significance of explosives and explosives residue \n     composition. He therefore should realize this deficiency and \n     differentiate between his personal opinions and scientific \n     fact. An expert's opinion should be based upon objective, \n     scientific findings and be separated from personal \n     predilections and biases.\n       In order to identify a given material, it is necessary for \n     the examiner to acquire sufficient data using acceptable \n     scientific techniques/protocols and instrumentation to \n     specifically identify it. If that level of data is not \n     acquired or does not exist, then complete identification is \n     not possible and words such as ``consistent with'' or \n     ``similar to'' are used. This is nothing new. It is taught in \n     our colleges and universities. It is a standard set by MAU \n     based on experience/background, education, discussions, \n     research and peer review of the analytical procedures in \n     place. By rewording AE dictation, SSA * * * places an \n     examiner in the position where he/she would be required to \n     advise the court that the report overstates the findings and \n     therefore is incorrect.\n       A FBI Laboratory report is evidence. Often times the report \n     itself is entered into evidence during the trial proceedings. \n     The fact that SSA * * * did make unauthorized changes in \n     these reports could have resulted in serious consequences \n     during legal proceedings and embarrassment to the Laboratory \n     as well as the entire FBI.\n       In conclusion, SSA * * * committed errors which were \n     clearly intentional. He acted irresponsibly; he should be \n     held accountable; he should be disciplined accordingly. The \n     problems regarding AE alterations by SSA * * * are verified. \n     All of the AE dictation furnished to SSA * * * by SSA \n     WHITEHURST has been reviewed. The causes, reasons and events \n     which led to the occurrence of the errors has been discussed. \n     The appropriate administrative action, in my opinion, should \n     be that SSA * * * be given a letter of censure.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            Department of Justice,\n\n\n                              Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 8, 1995.\n       FBI Director Louis J. Freeh today released the following \n     statement:\n       The FBI looks forward to working with the Blue Ribbon Panel \n     named today. The FBI will assist the panel in every manner \n     possible to ensure an objective review of our examinations \n     and policies.\n       Over the past several years, Special Agent Frederic J. \n     Whitehurst has raised a variety of concerns about forensic \n     protocols and procedures employed in the FBI Laboratory. The \n     FBI has vigorously investigated his concerns and is \n     continuing to do so. The FBI alone has reviewed more than 250 \n     cases involving work previously done by the Laboratory. To \n     date, the FBI has found no evidence tampering, evidence \n     fabrication or failure to report exculpatory evidence. Any \n     finding of such misconduct will result in tough and swift \n     action by the FBI.\n       The FBI Laboratory conducts over one million examinations \n     per year and our experts testify hundreds of times annually \n     in state and federal courts of law. At trials, FBI Laboratory \n     examinations are constantly subject to extraordinarily \n     vigorous challenge through cross-examination and the \n     presentation of expert testimony by defense witnesses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback).

Mr. President, leadership often involves seizing the \nmoment. And right now the moment is a realbut rapidly fleeting chance \nto actually balance the Federal budget. For those of us who have long \nbeen dedicated to stopping the Federal Government from spending more \nthan it takes in, the moment is now. While we're away from Washington \nduring the recess, I hope that we will use this time to prepare \nourselves for serious work on the budget when we return. We cannot let \nanother opportunity to do what's right pass us by.\n  I recognize the fear on both sides. The President is understandably \nreluctant to embrace a necessary change in the Consumer Price Index \nbecause of its effect, however minimal, on benefits for a large and \nvocal segment of the population. The Republican Party is reluctant to \nscale back its calls for a massive tax cut because of a similar effect \non an equally vocal segment of their supporters.\n  But simple math dictates that both must occur if we are truly \ninterested in balancing the budget and keeping it in balance over the \nlong term. And the reality is that entitlements have got to be curbed, \nand the resulting savings have got to go to reducing the deficit, not \ntax cuts.\n  The Speaker of the House has taken a bold step by expressing a \nwillingness to surrender tax cuts until the budget is balanced. I hope \nthe President will meet this bold step by expressing his willingness to \nreconsider an adjustment in the CPI, or some other means to accomplish \nthe same goal.\n  As meetings take place over the course of the congressional recess, I \nwould encourage both sides to use as a starting point the Centrist \nCoalition budget developed last year by a bipartisan group of Senators, \nincluding myself.\n  The Centrist plan, known also as the Chafee-Breaux plan, was the only \nbudget in the Senate last year that received bipartisan support. In \nfact, the Centrist plan received 46 votes. And to me, that seems like a \nlogical place to start.\n  Our plan used conservative economic assumptions, a rational reduction \nin the Consumer Price Index, and a modest tax cut. We did not have, \nwithin our coalition, universal agreement on all aspects of the plan. \nPersonally, I have always wanted to postpone even modest tax cuts until \nwe actually achieve balance. But, I believe it provides a reasonable \nroadmap now of how to get from here to a budget that balances. I hope \nthat this plan will help guide congressional and White House \nnegotiators during their upcoming budget talks.\n  With that, Mr. President, I hope all of our colleagues come back \nfully reenvigorated and ready to start producing some results.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

But John came to Iowa to go to \ncollege.\n  Iowa is where his Air Force career began.\n  He won an athletic scholarship to the University of Iowa and enrolled \nin the Air Force ROTC program.\n  After graduating in 1951, he went to flight school. He earned his \nwings and began flying the F-86 Saber jet.\n  Then he went to Korea with one goal: shoot down a MiG.\n  Fortunately, for everyone concerned, that conflict came to an end \nbefore his wish came true.\n  But to John that was one of the biggest disappointments of his life.\n  Mr. President, I am proud that John Boyd was educated in Iowa.\n  He was a great American who dedicated his life to public service.\n  I would like to honor him by speaking briefly about some of his most \nimportant accomplishments.\n  First and foremost, John Boyd was a legendary Air Force fighter \npilot.\n  But John was no ordinary jet jockey. He applied his vast intellect to \nunderstand the dynamics of air combat maneuvering at which he excelled.\n  To do that, though, he had to teach himself calculus so he could work \nthe formulas to quantify the problem.\n  This was the problem he saw.\n  Why did the heavier and slower American F-86 achieve near total \ndomination of the superior MiG-15 encountered in Korea?\n  John wanted an answer to the question.\n  After doing some truly original and pioneering work, he began \nadvancing a theory.\n  His tactical ``Aerial Attack Study'' became the bible for air-to-air \ncombat training.\n  It was instrumental in the creation of the Fighter Weapons School at \nNellis Air Force Base, NV.\n  That's the Air Force equivalent of the Navy's ``Top Gun'' program.\n  John being John, he never slacked off. He kept right on working and \ndeveloping his theory of aerial combat.\n\n[[Page S2611]]\n\n  He wanted to take it to a higher plane.\n  And he did.\n  It culminated in the Energy Maneuverability Theory.\n  This was a very important piece of work.\n  John Boyd's Energy Maneuverability Theory was seminal in the \ndevelopment of two of our premier fighters: first the F-15 and then the \nF-16.\n  That theory helped to shape the design of those two very important \nairplanes.\n  So, Mr. President, John Boyd was truly a giant in the field of air \nwarfare.\n  When I first met John in early 1983, he was applying his genius in an \nentirely different field.\n  He had retired from the Air Force and had set up shop over in the \nPentagon.\n  He was given a small consulting contract and a cubbyhole-size office \nto go with it.\n  His Pentagon cubbyhole was the birthplace of some very important \nideas.\n  That's when I met John Boyd. He was just beginning his reform \ncrusade.\n  He was the leader of the Military Reform Movement.\n  At that point in time, I was wrestling with the Reagan \nadministration's plan to pump up the defense budget.\n  I was searching for an effective strategy to freeze the defense \nbudget.\n  Cap Weinberger was the Secretary of Defense, and he kept asking for \nmore and more money.\n  The DOD budget was at the $210 billion level that year.\n  But Cap Weinberger had plans to push it first to $300, then $400, and \nfinally to $500 billion.\n  The money sacks were piled high on the steps of the Pentagon.\n  It seemed like there was no way to put a lid on defense spending--\nthat is until John Boyd walked in my office.\n  To this day, I don't know how he got there. Ernie Fitzgerald may have \nintroduced us. I don't quite remember.\n  But John had a secret weapon.\n  His secret weapon was Chuck Spinney.\n  Chuck was an analyst in the Pentagon's office of Program Analysis and \nEvaluation, or PA\n  He had a briefing entitled ``Plans/Reality Mismatch.''\n  John's plan was to use Spinney's material to expose the flaws in \nWeinberger's plan to ramp up the defense budget.\n  So I asked DOD for Mr. Spinney's briefing but ran smack into a stone \nwall.\n  At first, the bureaucrats tried to pretend it didn't exist.\n  For example, Dr. Chu, Spinney's boss, characterized Spinney's \nbriefing as nothing more than: ``Scribblings and writings gathered up \nand stapled together.''\n  Well, that didn't wash. It just added fat to the fire.\n  DOD could no longer suppress the truth.\n  The Wall Street Journal and Boston Globe had already published major \nreports on Spinney's briefing. A number of other newspapers had it and \nwere ready to roll.\n  The press knew this was a substantial and credible piece of work.\n  John's behind-the-scenes maneuvering finally led to a dramatic \nhearing that was held in the Senate Caucus Room in February 1983.\n  It was an unprecedented event.\n  It was the only joint Armed Services/Budget Committee hearing ever \nheld.\n  In a room filled with TV cameras and bright lights, Spinney treated \nthe committee to a huge stack of his famous spaghetti charts.\n  This was Spinney's bottom line: The final bill of Weinberger's 1983-\n87 defense plan would be $500 billion more than promised. It was \ndevastating.\n  Mr. Spinney's outstanding performance won him a place on the cover of \nTime Magazine on March 7, 1983.\n  And it effectively put an end to Weinberger's plan to pump up the \ndefense budget.\n  Two years later, my amendment to freeze the defense budget was \nadopted by the Senate.\n  If John Boyd hadn't come to my office and told me about Chuck \nSpinney, the hearing in the Senate Caucus Room might not have taken \nplace.\n  And if that hearing hadn't happened like it did, I doubt we would \nhave succeeded in putting the brakes on Weinberger's spending plans.\n  The Plans/Reality Mismatch hearing was just one episode in the \nhistory of the military reform movement, but it is the one that brought \nme and John together.\n  There were many others. John was always the driving force behind the \nscenes, giving advice, planning the next move, and always talking with \nthe press.\n  John Boyd always set an example of excellence--both morally and \nprofessionally.\n  Mr. President, since John died, there have been several articles \npublished about some of his exploits.\n  There was a truly beautiful obituary--if such a thing exists--in the \nMarch 13 issue of the New York Times.\n  It describes John's vast contributions to air warfare.\n  Second, there is a more colorful piece, which will appear in the \nMarch 24 issue of U.S. News and World Report.\n  That one is written by Jim Fallows and is entitled ``A Priceless \nOriginal.''\n  Mr. Fallows describes some of John's important contributions against \nthe backdrop of his unusual character traits.\n  Then, there is the letter from the Marine Corps Commandant, General \nKrulak.\n  General Krulak describes John as ``an architect'' of our military \nvictory over Iraq in 1991.\n  That's an oblique reference to John's ``Patterns of Conflict'' \nbriefing. This piece of work had a profound impact on U.S. military \nthought.\n  It helped our top military leadership understand the advantages of \nmaneuver warfare. Those ideas were used to defeat Iraq.\n  And finally, Col. David Hackworth has devoted his weekly column to \nJohn Boyd. It is entitled: ``A Great Airman's Final Flight.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have these reports printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, we have lost a great American--a true patriot. I will \nmiss him.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 13, 1997]\n\n       Col. John Boyd Is Dead at 70; Advanced Air Combat Tactics\n\n                      (By Robert McG. Thomas, Jr.)\n\n       Col. John R. Boyd, a legendary Air Force fighter pilot \n     whose discovery that quicker is better than faster became the \n     basis of a far-reaching theory that helped revolutionize \n     American military strategy, died on March 9 at a hospital in \n     West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 70 and had lived in Delray \n     Beach.\n       The cause was cancer, his family said.\n       To combat pilots of the late 1950's, it was always high \n     noon in the skies above the Nevada desert. A pilot, a crack \n     instructor at Nellis Air Force Base, perhaps, or a hotshot \n     Navy flier passing through would get on the radio to call him \n     out and within minutes Colonel Boyd would have another notch \n     in his belt.\n       They did not call him 40-second Boyd for nothing. From 1954 \n     to 1960 virtually every combat pilot in the country knew that \n     Colonel Boyd, a former Korean War pilot who helped establish \n     the Fighter Weapons School at Nellis, had a standing offer: \n     take a position on his tail, and 40 twisting, turning seconds \n     later he would have the challenger in his own gun-sights or \n     pay $40. Colonel Boyd never lost the bet in more than 3,000 \n     hours of flying time.\n       A high school swimming champion who won an athletic \n     scholarship to the University of Iowa, Colonel Boyd, a native \n     of Erie, Pa., had superior reflexes and hand-eye \n     coordination, but what made him invincible in mock combat was \n     something else.\n       At Nellis he taught himself calculus so he could work out \n     the formulas that produced his repertory of aerial maneuvers \n     and led to his 1960 report, ``Aerial Attack Study,'' the \n     bible of air-to-air combat.\n       His combat experience was limited to a few missions in \n     Korea, but they were enough to produce a breakthrough \n     insight. Wondering why the comparatively slow and ponderous \n     American F-86's achieved near total domination of the \n     superior MIG-15's, he realized that the F-86 had two crucial \n     advantages: better visibility and a faster roll rate.\n       This, in turn, led Colonel Boyd to develop what he called \n     the OODA Loop, to denote the repeated cycle of observation, \n     orientation, decision and action that characterized every \n     encounter. The key to victory, he theorized, was not a plane \n     that could climb faster or higher but one that could begin \n     climbing or change course quicker--to get inside an \n     adversary's ``time/cycle loop.''\n       The fast-cycle combat theory, expanded by Colonel Boyd into \n     a lecture he later delivered hundreds of times, has since \n     been widely applied to fields as diverse as weapons \n     procurement, battlefield strategy and business competition.\n       One implication of the theory was that the best fighter \n     plane was not necessarily the one with the most speed, \n     firepower or range. Colonel Boyd, who enrolled at Georgia \n     Tech\n\n[[Page S2612]]\n\n     after his Nellis tour, was helping a fellow student with his \n     homework over hamburgers and beer one night when he had an \n     insight that led to a way to quantify his ideas. The \n     resulting Energy Maneuverability Theory, which allows precise \n     comparisons of maneuverability, is now a standard measure of \n     aerial performance.\n       Assigned to the Pentagon in 1964, Colonel Boyd became an \n     important figure in a movement that started in response to \n     $400 hammers and other headline excesses of Defense \n     Department spending and soon expanded to question the need \n     for many hugely expensive weapons systems.\n       Although he had allies in the Pentagon, Congress and \n     business, Colonel Boyd's ideas often went against the grain \n     of a military-industrial bureaucracy devoted to the \n     procurement of the most advanced, most expensive and (not \n     coincidentally, he felt) most profitable planes.\n       Although his design ideas helped give the F-15 a big, high-\n     visibility canopy, his major triumph was the F-16, a plane \n     lacking many of the F-15's high-tech, expensive features, but \n     which is far more agile and costs less than half as much, \n     allowing for the purchase of many more of them for a given \n     expenditure.\n       Top Air Force officers were so opposed to the concept of \n     producing a plane that did not expand on the F-15's cutting \n     edge technology that Colonel Boyd and some civilian allies \n     developed it in secret.\n       The plane was hailed for its performance in the Persian \n     Gulf war, a war whose very strategy of quick, flexible \n     response was based largely on ideas Colonel Boyd had been \n     promoting for years.\n       Colonel Boyd, who maintained that the lure of big-money \n     defense contracts invariably perverted weapons assessment, \n     was so personally fastidious that during his years in the \n     Pentagon he became known as the Ghetto Colonel because he \n     lived in a basement apartment.\n       He carried his notion of propriety to such an extreme that \n     when he retired in 1975 and began some of his most productive \n     work, as a Pentagon consultant, he insisted that his family \n     live on his retirement pay. Initially offering to work full \n     time without pay, he was persuaded to accept one day's pay \n     every two-week pay period, because he had to be on the \n     Pentagon payroll to have access to the building, before \n     retiring in 1988.\n       He is survived by his wife, Mary; three sons, Stephen, of \n     Springfield, Va., Scott, of Burke, Va., and Jeff, of Delray \n     Beach, Fla.; two daughters, Kathryn, of Delray Beach and Mary \n     Ellen Holton of Centerville, Va.; a brother, H.G. Boyd of \n     Pompano Beach, Fla.; a sister, Marion Boyd of Erie, and two \n     grandchildren.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From Inside the Pentagon, Mar. 13, 1997]\n\n                          Letter to the Editor\n\n       To the Editor: I was deeply saddened to learn of the \n     passing of Colonel John Boyd, USAF (Ret.). How does one begin \n     to pay homage to a warrior like John Boyd? He was a towering \n     intellect who made unsurpassed contributions to the American \n     art of war. Indeed, he was one of the central architects in \n     the reform of military thought which swept the services, and \n     in particular the Marine Corps, in the 1980's. From John Boyd \n     we learned about competitive decision making on the \n     battlefield--compressing time, using time as an ally. \n     Thousands of officers in all our services knew John Boyd by \n     his work on what was to be known as the Boyd Cycle or OODA \n     Loop. His writings and his lectures had a fundamental impact \n     on the curriculum of virtually every professional military \n     education program in the United States--and on many abroad. \n     In this way he touched so many lives, many of them destined \n     to ascend to the very highest levels of military and civilian \n     leadership.\n       Those of us who knew John Boyd the man knew him as a man of \n     character and integrity. His life and values were shaped by a \n     selfless dedication to Country and Service, by the crucible \n     of war, and by an unrelenting love of study. he was the \n     quintessential soldier-scholar--a man whose jovial, outgoing \n     exterior belied the vastness of his knowledge and the power \n     of his intellect. I was in awe of him, not just for the \n     potential of his future contributions, but for what he stood \n     for as an officer, a citizen, and as a man.\n       As I write this, my mind wanders back to that morning in \n     February, 1991, when the military might of the United States \n     sliced violently into the Iraqi positions in Kuwait. \n     Bludgeoned from the air nearly round the clock for six weeks, \n     paralyzed by the speed and ferocity of the attack, the Iraqi \n     army collapsed morally and intellectually under the onslaught \n     of American and Coalition forces. John Boyd was an architect \n     of that victory as surely as if he'd commanded a fighter wing \n     or a maneuver division in the desert. His thinking, his \n     theories, his larger than life influence, were there with us \n     in Desert Storm. He must have been proud at what his efforts \n     wrought.\n       So, how does one pay homage to a man like John Boyd? \n     Perhaps best by remembering that Colonel Boyd never sought \n     the acclaim won him by his thinking. He only wanted to make a \n     difference in the next war . . . and he did. That ancient \n     book of wisdom--Proverbs--sums up John's contribution to his \n     nation: ``A wise man is strong, and a man of knowledge adds \n     to his strength; for by wise guidance you will wage your war, \n     and there is victory in a multitude of counsellors.'' I, and \n     his Corps of Marines, will miss our counsellor terribly.--\n     Proverbs 24:5-6\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  C.C.

John Boyd, who retired from the Air \n     Force in 1975, died March 9 at age 70. A fighter pilot of \n     legendary ability, Boyd was the author of several pivotal \n     explorations of warfighting theory, including ``Destruction \n     and Creation'' (1976), ``Patterns of Conflict'' (1981), and \n     ``Conceptual Spiral'' (1991).\n       While still in the Air Force, Boyd was largely responsible \n     for the early design of the F-15 and F-16 fighters, and \n     contributed significantly to the design of the A-10 close air \n     support aircraft. His ``energy maneuverability theory'' is \n     still in use in designing aircraft for maximum performance \n     and maneuverability.\n       Boyd is probably best known for developing the concept of \n     the ``OODA Loop,'' short for ``observe, orient, decide, \n     act''--effectively a guide to anticipating enemy moves in a \n     fast-paced battle and heading them off at the pass. The term \n     was widely used during the 1991 Persian Gulf war in reference \n     to the U.S. force's ability to get ``inside'' Iraq's \n     decisionmaking cycle.\n       Boyd is considered the father of the Air Force's original \n     ``fighter mafia'' and, after his retirement, a key leader of \n     the military reform movement in the 1980s.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n            [From U.S. News & World Report, March 24, 1997]\n\n                          A Priceless Original\n\n                           (By James Fallows)\n\n       True originality can be disturbing, and John Boyd was \n     maddeningly original. His ideas about weapons, leadership, \n     and the very purpose of national security changed the modern \n     military. After Boyd died last week of cancer at age 70, the \n     commandant of the Marine Corps called him ``a towering \n     intellect who made unsurpassed contributions to the American \n     art of war.'' Yet until late in his life, the military \n     establishment resisted Boyd and resented him besides.\n       Boyd was called up for military service during the Korean \n     War and quickly demonstrated prowess as an Air Force fighter \n     pilot. More important, he revealed his fascination with the \n     roots of competitive failure and success. U.S. Planes and \n     pilots, he realized, did better in air combat than they \n     should have. In theory, the Soviet-built MiG they fought \n     against was far superior to the F-86 that Boyd flew. The MiG \n     had a higher top speed and could hold a tighter turn. The \n     main advantage of the F-86 was that it could change from one \n     maneuver to another more rapidly, dodging or diving out of \n     the MiG's way. As the planes engaged, Boyd argued, the F-86 \n     could build a steadily accumulating advantage in moving to a \n     ``kill position'' on the MiG's tail.\n       Boyd extended his method--isolating the real elements of \n     success--while maintaining his emphasis on adaptability. In \n     the late 1950s, he developed influential doctrines of air \n     combat and was a renowned fighter instructor. In the 1960s, \n     he applied his logic to the design of planes, showing what a \n     plane would lose in maneuverability for each extra bit of \n     weight or size--and what the nation lost in usable force as \n     the cost per plane went up. Within the Pentagon, he and \n     members of a ``Fighter Mafia'' talked a reluctant Air Force \n     into building the F-16 and A-10--small, relatively cheap, yet \n     highly effective aircraft that were temporary departures from \n     the trend toward more expensive and complex weapons.\n       Warrior virtues. After leaving the Air Force as a colonel \n     in 1975, Boyd began the study of long historical trends in \n     military success through which he made his greatest mark. He \n     became a fanatical autodidact, reading and marking up \n     accounts of battles, beginning with the Peloponnesian War. On \n     his Air Force pension, he lived modestly, working from a \n     small, book-crammed apartment. He presented his findings in \n     briefings, which came in varying lengths, starting at four \n     hours. Boyd refused to discuss his views with those who would \n     not sit through a whole presentation; to him, they were \n     dilettantes. To those who listened, he offered a worldview in \n     which crucial military qualities--adaptability, innovation--\n     grew from moral strengths and other ``warrior'' virtues. Yes-\n     man careerism, by-the-book thought, and the military's \n     budget-oriented ``culture of procurement'' were his great \n     nemeses.\n       Since he left no written record other than the charts that \n     outlined his briefings, Boyd was virtually unknown except to \n     those who had listened to him personally--but that group grew \n     steadily in size and influence. Politicians, who parcel out \n     their lives in 10-minute intervals, began to sit through his \n     briefings. The Marine Corps, as it recovered from Vietnam, \n     sought his advice on morale, character, and strategy. By the \n     time of the gulf war, his emphasis on blitzkrieglike \n     ``maneuver warfare'' had become prevailing doctrine in the \n     U.S. military. As a congressman, Dick Cheney spent days at \n     Boyd's briefings. As defense secretary, he rejected an early \n     plan for the land war in Iraq as being too frontal and \n     unimaginative--what Boyd would have mockingly called ``Hey \n     diddle diddle, straight up the middle''--and insisted on a \n     surprise flanking move.\n       John Boyd laughed often, yet when he turned serious, his \n     preferred speaking distance was 3 inches from your face. He \n     brandished a cigar and once burned right through the necktie \n     of a general he had buttonholed.\n\n[[Page S2613]]\n\n     He would telephone at odd hours and resume a harangue from \n     weeks before as if he'd never stopped. But as irritating as \n     he was, he was more influential.

Hackworth)\n\n       Col. John R. Boyd of the United States Air Force is dead.\n       Future generations will learn that John Boyd, a legendary \n     fighter pilot, was America's greatest military thinker. He's \n     remembered now by all those he touched over the last 52 years \n     of service to our country as not only the original ``Top \n     Gun,'' but as one smart hombre who always had the guts to \n     stand tall and to tell it like it is.\n       He didn't just drive Chinese fighter pilots nuts while \n     flying his F-86 over the Yalu River during the Korean War, he \n     spent decades causing the top brass to climb the walls and \n     the cost-plus, defense-contractor racketeers to run for \n     cover.\n       He was not only a fearless fighter pilot with a laser mind, \n     but a man of rare moral courage. the mission of providing \n     America with the best airplane came first, closely followed \n     by his love for the troops and his concern for their welfare. \n     Many of the current crop of Air Force generals could pull out \n     of their moral nose dive by following his example.\n       After the Korean War, he became known as ``40-Second'' Boyd \n     because he defeated opponents in aerial combat in less than \n     40 seconds. Many of his contemporaries from this period say \n     he was the best fighter pilot in the U.S. Air Force.\n       Not only was he skilled and brave, but he was also a brain. \n     The Air Force recognized this and sent him to Georgia Tech, \n     not to be a ``rambling wreck,'' but to become a top graduate \n     engineer. It was there that he developed the fighter tactics \n     which proved so effective during the Vietnam War, and the \n     concepts that later revolutionized the design of fighter \n     aircraft and the U.S.A.'s way of fighting wars, both in the \n     air and on the ground.\n       He saved the F-15 from being an 80,000-pound, swing-wing \n     air bus, streamlining it into a 40,000-pound, lean and mean \n     fixed-wing fighter, which Desert Storm proved still has no \n     equal.\n       Boyd was also a key player in the development of the F-16, \n     probably the most agile and maneuverable fighter aircraft \n     ever built, and costing half the price of the F-15. The top \n     brass didn't want it. To them, more expensive was better. \n     Boyd outfoxed them by developing it in secret.\n       Chuck Spinney, who as a Pentagon staffer sweated under \n     Boyd's cantankerous, demanding tough love says, ``The most \n     important gift my father gave me was a deep belief in the \n     importance of doing what you think is right--to act on what \n     your conscience says you should act on and to accept the \n     consequences. The most important gift Boyd gave me was the \n     ability to do this and survive and grow at the same time.''\n       Boyd never made general--truth-tellers seldom do in today's \n     slick military because the Pentagon brass hate the truth, and \n     try to destroy those who tell it. They did their best to do a \n     number on John. But true to form, he always out-maneuvered \n     them.\n       Norman Schwarzkopf is widely heralded as the hero of Desert \n     Storm, but in fact, Boyd's tactics and strategy were the real \n     force behind the 100-Hour War. Stormin' Norman simply copied \n     Boyd's playbook, and the Marines were brilliant during their \n     attack on Kuwait.\n       As USMC Col. Mike Wyly tells it, Boyd ``applied his keen \n     thinking to Marine tactics, and today we are a stronger, \n     sharper Corps.''\n       His example inspired many. He affected everyone with whom \n     he came in contact. He trained a generation of disciples in \n     all the services, and they are carrying on his good work, \n     continuing to serve the truth over self.\n       For those who know, the name Boyd has already become a \n     synonym for ``doing the right thing.'' His legacy will be \n     that integrity--doing the hard right over the easy wrong--is \n     more important than all the stars, all the plush executive \n     suites and all the bucks.\n       God now has the finest pilot ever at his side. And He, in \n     all His wisdom, will surely give Boyd the recognition he \n     deserves by promoting him to air marshal of the universe.\n       For sure, we can all expect a few changes in the design of \n     heaven as Boyd makes it a better place, just as he did planet \n     earth.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Senator Bennett of Utah, Senator Thomas \nand Senator Enzi of Wyoming, and I have been working on a matter that \nwe wish to discuss with our colleagues in the Senate for the next few \nmoments. Senator Thomas needs to leave so he is going to lead off.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair.\n Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the college \nfootball Bowl Alliance. I am concerned that under the Bowl Alliance \nstructure, athletic excellence is not being recognized in postseason I-\nA college football play.\n  Fresh in the minds of Wyoming football fans is the last game of \nregular season play when the nationally ranked Cowboys played against \nNo. 5-ranked Brigham Young University for the Western Athletic \nConference [WAC] championship title. Both teams went into the game \nbelieving the winner would be selected for major postseason bowl \naction. UW and BYU delivered a terrific conference championship game. \nBYU won 28-25 over Wyoming in overtime play. It was the first WAC title \ngame won in overtime. Unfortunately, neither WAC team was invited to a \nmajor New Year's bowl.\n  The 1996 selections to the New Year's bowl games shed revealing light \non the college football Bowl Alliance. Invitations to the most \nlucrative major bowls games--the Orange Bowl, the Sugar Bowl, and the \nFiesta Bowl--were largely sent to high-profile, highly marketable teams \ninstead of worthy teams. Many sports fans were disappointed at the \npostseason New Year's bowl matchups. I am concerned about the closed \nselection process that has developed and the impact the Bowl Alliance \nstructure will have on I-A collegiate football.\n  The Bowl Alliance operates outside the purview of the National \nCollegiate Athletics Association [NCAA]. The Bowl Alliance was created \nin 1993 when the Atlantic Coast Conference, the Big East Conference, \nthe Big 12 Conference, the Southeastern Conference and Notre Dame came \ntogether and took it upon themselves to provide and acquire teams to \nparticipate in the major bowl games. These Bowl Alliance conferences \nhave contracts with the television networks and large corporate \nsponsors--Federal Express, Tostitos, and Noika. Champions from each \nalliance conference are automatically guaranteed a berth in one of the \nmajor bowl games. The nonalliance conferences remaining out in the cold \nare the Western Athletic Conference [WAC], the Big West Conference, \nConference USA, the Mid American Conference and the 11 Independent \nteams.\n  The Bowl Alliance claims its purpose is to create optimal matchups \nand identify and national champion. Considering the 1996 selections for \nthe bowl games, I question if quality matchups is the true goal. Last \nseason, TV viewers saw No. 20 Texas lose to No. 7 Penn State 38-15 in \nthe Fiesta Bowl. Texas' record was 8-4. The Orange Bowl showcased No. 9 \nVirginia Tech losing to No. 6 Nebraska 41-21.\n\n  Appearance in a Bowl Alliance game pays well. Each participating team \ntakes approximately $8,000,000 back to its school. In addition, the \nteams get the national visibility and prestige that leads to strong \nathletic recruitment. Conferences outside the alliance have a remote \nchance of participating in one of the Alliance Bowls. Over time it will \nhurt the quality of the nonalliance teams who will have difficulty in \nrecruitment. The Alliance Bowl structure will make the alliance teams \nstronger and relegate the nonalliance teams to a second-tier status.\n  The alliance ensures its monopoly through the use of the at-large \nrule. Although the champions of the self-selected Alliance Bowl \nconferences automatically appear in one of the major bowl games there \nare two remaining at-large spots. It is questionable as to whether \nthose two spots are truly at-large and open to any high-quality team \nthat can play their way into one of the spots. A team from the WAC was \ndeserving of one of those at-large spots last year, but the invitation \nnever came.\n  I am concerned for the future of the athletes and schools in the \nnonalliance conferences. That is why I joined with Senators Mitch \nMcConnell, Robert Bennett, and Mike Enzi in writing to the Department \nof Justice [DOJ] and the Federal Trade Commission [FTC] to request an \ninvestigation of the Bowl Alliance. We suspect possible violations of \nthe Sherman Antitrust Act. In 1996, the eight Alliance Bowl \nparticipants, including the Rose Bowl participants, went home with a \ntotal of $68 million. The 28 teams that played in the minor bowl games \nshared a pot of\n\n[[Page S2614]]\n\n$31 million. We requested a formal investigation of the matter. If \nthere is wrong-doing we want to see the DOJ and the FTC use their \nstatutory enforcement powers to break this lock on college football.\n  We are not asking for special consideration for any one team. We \nwould like to see genuinely open competition restored to college \nfootball postseason bowls. Postseason play should be about recognizing \nachievement. Letting the best teams play is in the best interest of our \nstudent athletes and our schools.\n  I wish to associate myself with the efforts of the Senator from \nKentucky, the Senator from Utah, and my friend from Wyoming in doing \nsome things that we think have impact in football. The Bowl Alliance \nhas a great effect on small schools, particularly the University of \nWyoming, BYU, Louisville, and others, and so we think this is an issue \nwhich needs to be discussed. I am very proud to be associated with the \ncomments my friends will make.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Wyoming for his contribution to \nthe matter that we will now proceed to discuss with our colleagues.\n  Mr. President, at a time when the country is swept away by March \nmadness--particularly, I notice the occupant of the chair has a fine \nteam in March madness that will probably, no doubt, come in second to \nKentucky in the end--and the excitement of competitive college \nbasketball, we are nevertheless reminded of the fundamental unfairness \nof college football's pseudo playoffs. Specifically, I am talking about \nthe College Bowl Alliance.\n  The alliance is a coalition of top college football conferences and \ntop postseason bowls. Over the past few years, the alliance has entered \ninto a series of restrictive agreements to allocate the market of \nhighly lucrative postseason bowls. By engaging in this market \nallocation, the coalition bowls and the coalition teams have ensured \nthat they will receive tens of millions of dollars, while the remaining \nteams and bowls are left to divide a much smaller amount. The alliance \nagreements have the purpose and effect of making the already-strong \nalliance teams stronger while relegating the remaining teams to a \nfuture of, at best, mediocre, second-class status.\n  Mr. President, in college football, there can be no Cinderella \nstories. There can be no unranked, unknown Coppin State going to the \nplayoffs and beating the SEC regular season champion, South Carolina, \nand going down to the wire with a Big 12 power like Texas.\n  A team like Coppin State could never make it to the lucrative college \nfootball postseason. You see, a team like that would be excluded \nbecause it's not in the College Bowl Alliance and its fans don't travel \nwell. It doesn't even have its own band.\n  College football has no room for a Sweet 16 that includes teams like \nSt. Joseph's and the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. The \nopportunity to be in college football's Elite Eight and Final Four is \nessentially determined before the season begins.\n  The basic message, Mr. President, is that--if David wants to slay \nGoliath--he'd better do it during basketball season. He won't be \nallowed to play Goliath when the football postseason rolls around.\n  College football has no room for the underdog. In fact, as evidenced \nby the 1997 New Year's bowls, college football doesn't even have room \nfor top-ranked teams--unless those teams are members of the exclusive \nBowl Alliance.\n  I first raised this issue in 1993 when my alma mater, the University \nof Louisville, had a 7-1-0 record and a top ranking, but was \nautomatically excluded from the most lucrative New Year's bowls. I \ncontacted the Justice Department and explained that the alliance \nagreements constituted a group boycott, and, thus, violated the Sherman \nAct.\n  The Justice Department promised to promptly review the matter.\n  Shortly thereafter, the College Bowl Alliance entered into a revised \nagreement whereby the 1997 New Year's bowls would be open to any team \nin the country with a minimum of eight wins or ranked higher than the \nlowest ranked--alliance--conference champion.\n\n  Despite this pledge, the alliance continued its apparent boycott of \nnonalliance teams. During the 1996 season, Brigham Young University and \nthe University of Wyoming, both members of the nonalliance Western \nAthletic Conference [WAC], met the alliance criteria. Wyoming finished \nthe season 10-2 and ranked 22d in the country, while BYU won 13 games \nand was ranked the fifth best team in the country.\n  Neither team, however, was afforded an opportunity to play in the \nalliance bowls. In fact, BYU's record and ranking was superior to \nnearly every alliance team, including four of the six teams who \nparticipated in the high-visibility, high-payout alliance bowls.\n  Mr. President, this issue is about more than football, apple pie, and \nalma mater. This is about basic fairness and open competition. This is \nabout a few conferences and a few bowls dividing up a huge \nmultimillion-dollar pie among themselves.\n  In 1997, the eight participants in the alliance bowls, including the \nRose Bowl participants shared an estimated pot of $68 million while the \n28 nonalliance bowl participants were left to divide approximately $34 \nmillion. In short, the market has been divided such that eight teams \nrake in 70 percent of the postseason millions, while 28 teams get \nnothing more than the leftover 30 percent.\n  This chart may have printing that is too small for the camera to pick \nup, but it illustrates the nature of the problem.\n  The Alliance bowls--Fiesta, Sugar, Orange, and Rose--totaled $68.2 \nmillion. That is eight teams that benefited from the $68.2 million. The \nnonalliance bowls--and here is a whole list of them--collectively \nshared $34 million. Clearly, most of these teams never had an \nopportunity, no matter how good they were, to participate in the New \nYears Day payout bowls. Therein lies the antitrust problem, a clear \nantitrust problem I might say.\n  These short-term millions lead to long-term benefits for the alliance \nconferences. Guaranteed appearances in high-visibility bowls directly \ntranslate to: more loyal fans, more generous alumni, and much more \nwilling athletic recruits.\n  If you don't believe it's easier for alliance teams to recruit, just \npick up the phone and call the coach at an independent school like \nCentral Florida, or the coach at the University of Louisville or BYU. \nThese coaches will tell you time after time that the top high school \nathletes don't want to play for teams that don't have a shot at the top \nNew Year's bowl games.\n  Mr. President, in summary, there is substantial evidence that the \nmost powerful conferences and the most powerful bowls have entered into \nagreements to allocate the postseason bowl market among themselves and \nto engage in a group boycott of nonalliance teams and bowls. The effect \nof these agreements is to ensure that the strong get stronger, while \nthe rest get weaker.\n  I have joined with my colleagues--Senator Bennett, Senator Enzi, and \nSenator Thomas--to request that both the Justice Department and the \nFederal Trade Commission investigate the intent and effect of the \nalliance agreements. I ask unanimous consent that the Justice \nDepartment letter be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCONNELL. In closing, I'd like to point out that this effort is \nmuch more than just a few Senators cheering for their home teams. The \nSupreme Court has said it much more clearly than we ever could. So, I \nquote the Court, which I seem to be doing quite often these days:\n\n       [O]ne of the classic examples of a per se violation of \n     section 1 is an agreement between competitors at the same \n     level of the market structure to allocate territories in \n     order to minimize competition . . . This Court has reiterated \n     time and time again that ``horizontal territorial \n     limitations . . . are naked restraints of trade with no \n     purpose except stifling of competition.''\n\n  This fundamental principle of antitrust law should guide the review \nof the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. In the \nwords of the D.C. Circuit, ``the hallmark of the [unlawful] `group \nboycott' is the effort of competitors to `barricade themselves from \ncompetition at their own level.' ''\n  Today, we are calling on all interested parties to break the \nbarricade.\n\n[[Page S2615]]\n\n We are challenging the NCAA, the Bowl Alliance commissioners, and the \nAlliance bowl committees to take action to bring about genuine \ncompetition to college football and the postseason.\n  Postseason playoffs can be a reality for college football. It works \nfor college basketball, college baseball, and it works for college \nfootball--at the Division I-AA, Division II, and Division III \nlevels. They all have a playoff system, all of them except Division I.\n\n  The opportunity to compete in postseason bowls should be based on \nmerit, not membership in an exclusive coalition.\n  So, Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague from Utah, \nSenator Bennett, for his fine work on this issue. And also Senator Enzi \nfor his great work on this. We are hoping for the best. Obviously, the \nsolution to this problem that we would all prefer is for the \norganizations themselves to solve the problem. But, if they do not, it \nseems pretty clear to each of us that this is an antitrust case the \nJustice Department should pursue.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 14, 1997.\n     Hon. Joel I. Klein,\n     Acting Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division, U.S. \n         Department of Justice, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Klein: We believe that there is substantial \n     evidence of serious violations of Section 1 of the Sherman \n     Act (15 U.S.C. 1) by the College Bowl Alliance \n     (``Alliance'').\n       The Alliance is a coalition of top college football \n     conferences and representatives of top postseason college \n     football bowls. Over the past few years, the Alliance has \n     entered into a series of restrictive agreements to allocate \n     the market of highly-lucrative New Years' bowls. By engaging \n     in this market allocation, the coalition bowls and the \n     coalition teams have ensured that they will receive tens of \n     millions of dollars, while the remaining teams and bowls are \n     left to divide a much smaller amount. In 1996, for example, \n     the eight Alliance bowl participants (including the Rose Bowl \n     participants) went home with a total of $68 million, while \n     the 28 non-Alliance bowl participants shared a pot of $31 \n     million. Moreover, the Alliance agreements have the \n     additional purpose and effect of making the already-strong \n     Alliance teams stronger while relegating the remaining teams \n     to a future of, at best, mediocre, second-class status.\n       As you will recall, the Antitrust Division commenced a \n     review of this coalition in late 1993. Shortly thereafter, \n     the Alliance agreed that the top bowls would be open to all \n     teams based on merit. The 1997 New Year's Bowls, however, \n     proved to the contrary. We are writing to advise you of these \n     recent material events and to urge that you initiate a formal \n     investigation into this matter.\n\n                             I. Background\n\n       Courts have routinely declared that agreements among \n     competitors to allocate territories and exclude would-be \n     competitors are a violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. \n     See, e.g., Smith v. Pro Football, Inc., 593 F.2d 1173, 1178 \n     (D.C. Circuit 1978). As the D.C. Circuit has explained:\n       ``The classic `group boycott' is a concerted attempt by a \n     group of competitors at one level to protect themselves from \n     competition from non-group members who seeks to compete at \n     that level. Typically, the boycotting group combines to \n     deprive would-be competitors of a trade relationship which \n     they need in order to enter (or survive in) the level wherein \n     the group operates. . . . [The hallmark of the `group \n     boycott' is the effort of competitors to barricade themselves \n     from competition at their own level.' ''\n       Id. This fundamental principle should be kept in mind while \n     reviewing the facts surrounding the College Bowl Alliance.\n\n\n              a. original college bowl alliance agreement\n\n       In 1991, five college football conferences (ACC, Big East, \n     Big Eight, Southeastern, and Southwestern conferences) and \n     the independent University of Notre Dame, formed a coalition \n     with the prestigious College Bowl Committees of the Federal \n     Express Orange, USF Sugar, IBM Fiesta, and Mobil Cotton \n     Bowls (``Alliance bowls'').\\1\\ The Pac-10 and Big Ten also \n     participated in the coalition, although their champions \n     played in the Rose Bowl under a separate agreement.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ The Bowl Alliance was originally called the Bowl \n     Coalition. Additionally, pursuant to the dissolution of the \n     Southwest Conference, the Big Eight became the Big 12, and \n     the Cotton Bowl dropped out of the coalition.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The coalition agreement was expressly designed to reduce \n     competition in the postseason match-ups of teams and bowls, \n     and to guarantee every coalition team an opportunity to vie \n     for a lucrative, high-visibility bowl. The contract \n     specifically guaranteed that each coalition team \n     participating in any of the Alliance bowls would receive a \n     minimum payout based on similar terms. Typically, an Alliance \n     bowl team has taken home a purse in excess of eight million \n     dollars. Moreover, the original Request for Proposal \n     contained a clause requiring that no Alliance bowl or \n     Alliance team could compete in time slots opposite other \n     Alliance bowls.\n       The agreement also stipulated the procedure by which the \n     top-ranked and lesser-ranked Alliance teams were matched up \n     with participating Alliance bowls. Three conferences were \n     guaranteed berths at a specific Alliance bowl regardless of \n     the ranking of their champion team. Any team not in the \n     Alliance, however, was precluded from competing in any of the \n     Alliance bowls, regardless of its record or ranking.\n       The Alliance conferences and Notre Dame received \n     substantial benefits from the coalition agreements. They were \n     assured a berth at a major postseason bowl--regardless of \n     their topmost ranking. Further, all of the participants in \n     the Alliance bowls were guaranteed to receive a substantial \n     minimum payment and national visibility. Such visibility in \n     turn enhanced fan support, alumni fund-raising, and athletic \n     recruiting for the bowl teams.\n       By dividing the lucrative market of major postseason bowls \n     among themselves, the Alliance Conferences and Notre Dame \n     expressly and effectively excluded a substantial number of \n     the other Division 1A teams from any of the prestigious New \n     Year's Bowls. The excluded teams were those which were either \n     independent or in non-Alliance conference such as the Western \n     Athletic Conference, the Big West, and the Middle America \n     Conference.\n\n\n             B. Initial Request for Antitrust Investigation\n\n       In response to these market allocations, Senator Mitch \n     McConnell formally requested that the Justice Department \n     investigate the intent and effect of the Bowl Alliance \n     agreements. Specifically, Senator McConnell pointed out that \n     the Bowl Alliance agreements precluded a non-Alliance team \n     from going to the significant and lucrative Alliance Bowls--\n     even when the non-Alliance team had a better record and a \n     better ranking than an Alliance team. In response, the \n     Justice Department commenced a review of the Bowl Alliance.\n\n\n                  C. ``Revised'' College Bowl Alliance\n\n       Thereafter, the College Bowl Alliance entered into a \n     revised agreement whereby the 1997 New Year's bowls would \n     supposedly have two of the six Alliance slots ``open to any \n     team in the country with a minimum of eight wins or ranked \n     higher than the lowest-ranked conference champion from among \n     the champions of the Atlantic Coast, The Big East Football, \n     The Big Twelve and Southeastern conferences.''\n       At that point, Senator McConnell concluded that the ``new \n     arrangement seems to open competition to the top tier bowl \n     games.'' (Letter from Honorable Mitch McConnell to the \n     College Football Association, December 21, 1995.) The Justice \n     Department apparently made a similar determination.\n       Notwithstanding the promise of open competition, the \n     Alliance announced that it would consider non-Alliance teams \n     for the ``at-large'' openings only if they signed a special \n     restrictive agreement. The Alliance demanded that the terms \n     of this ``participation agreement'' be kept confidential. \n     Nevertheless, a key term of this agreement apparently was \n     that the at-large participants had to promise to accept an \n     offer from an Alliance bowl over any offers from non-Alliance \n     bowls. In the words of the Alliance, ``[t]here are no `pass' \n     or withdrawal options.''\\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\2\\ In the fall of 1996, the Alliance sent out \n     ``participation offers'' to presumably all of the non-\n     Alliance teams. Both Brigham Young University and the \n     University of Wyoming signed the restrictive participation \n     agreements, but included a proviso stating they would not \n     agree to all of the restrictive terms. Specifically, the \n     University of Wyoming explained that ``the University . . . \n     and the Western Athletic Conference will not comply with any \n     expressed or implied provision that prevents other members of \n     the WAC from participating in bowls that compete with any \n     Alliance Bowl, or with any other provisions that might \n     violate antitrust laws.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n               D. Continued Boycott of Non-Alliance Teams\n\n       The potential antitrust fears became a reality after the \n     1996 regular season when the Alliance continued its apparent \n     boycott of non-Alliance teams. During the 1996 season, \n     Brigham Young University and the University of Wyoming, \n     members of the non-Alliance Western Athletic Conference, had \n     ``a minimum of eight wins or [were] ranked higher than the \n     lowest-ranked [Alliance] conference champion. . . .''\n       BYU, in fact, met both of the Alliance criteria by \n     compiling a remarkable 13-1 record and earning a ranking of \n     the fifth best team in the country. This record and ranking \n     was superior to nearly every Alliance team, including the \n     University of Texas, 8-5 record and a No. 20 ranking; \n     Pennsylvania State University, 11-2 record and a No. 7 \n     ranking; Virginia Tech, 10-2 record with a No. 13 ranking; \n     and Nebraska, 11-2 record and a No. 6 ranking. Nevertheless, \n     BYU did not receive an at-large invitation to play in any of \n     the prestigious Alliance bowls; while Texas, Penn State, \n     Virginia Tech, and Nebraska all were invited to play in \n     various Alliance bowls, with the attendant financial and \n     recruiting benefits. Similarly, Wyoming finished with an \n     impressive 10-2 record and a No. 22 ranking, but was not \n     afforded an offer to play in the Alliance bowls.\n\n\n                 E. Formation of the ``Super Alliance''\n\n       In June 1996, the Alliance lock on college football power \n     was strengthened as the Rose\n\n[[Page S2616]]\n\n     Bowl agreed to join the Alliance, which guaranteed the Big \n     Ten and Pac-10 conferences automatic berths in an Alliance \n     bowl. The Alliance has officially renamed itself the ``Super \n     Alliance.''\n\n    II. Sherman Act Prohibits Market Allocations and Group Boycotts\n\n       The Sherman Act prohibits the Alliance agreements. Section \n     1 of the Sherman Act is violated where: (1) there is an \n     agreement, (2) that unreasonably restrains trade, and (3) \n     affects interstate commerce. 15 U.S.C. 1. It is beyond \n     dispute that interstate commerce is affected by the millions \n     of dollars that flow through the Alliance bowls to the \n     Alliance conference teams. Thus, our analysis focuses on the \n     existence of agreements and the unreasonable restraint of \n     trade.\n\n\n         a. the alliance is linked by at least three agreements\n\n       The Alliance coalition is linked by a minimum of three \n     agreements that limit competition. First, the Alliance \n     conferences--the ACC, Big East, Big 12, Big Ten, Pacific 10 \n     and the Southeastern conferences--have horizontally agreed \n     not to compete with each other for the top postseason bowls. \n     Next, the Alliance bowls--the Sugar, Fiesta, and Orange \n     bowls--have horizontally agreed not to compete with each \n     other for the top-ranked teams. Third, the Alliance \n     conferences and the Alliance bowls have vertically agreed to \n     further their horizontal agreements by limiting participation \n     with non-Alliance teams and non-Alliance bowls. These \n     agreements individually and in their totality demonstrate ``a \n     conscious commitment to a common scheme designed to achieve \n     an unlawful objective.'' Monsanto Co.  v. Spray-Rite Serv. \n     Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 768 (1984).\n       Moreover, strong evidence suggests the existence of an \n     ``anti-overlap'' agreement. The coalition's original Request \n     for Proposal contained an explicit ``anti-overlap'' clause. \n     Under the terms of such an agreement, no Alliance bowls or \n     teams could compete in time slots opposite other Alliance \n     bowls. Although this clause was officially removed following \n     a letter of protest from the Holiday Bowl, the Alliance's \n     exclusive prime television slots are strong indicators of an \n     anti-overlap agreement. Such circumstantial evidence may be \n     used to prove the existence of an agreement. See id.\n\n\n b. the alliance agreements unreasonably restrain trade under either a \n                  per se test or a rule of reason test\n\n       The effect of these interlocking agreements is to \n     unreasonably restrain trade. Courts determine the \n     reasonableness of a restraint by applying either a per se \n     test or a rule of reason test. See, e.g., NCAA v. Board of \n     Regents, 468 U.S. 85, 100-01 (1984). The Alliance agreements \n     fail under either analysis.\n\n\n                          (1) per se analysis\n\n       The facts underlying the Alliance warrant the stringent per \n     se analysis. Although courts have often analyzed regulations \n     of sports organizations under a rule of reason, see, e.g., \n     Justice v. NCAA, 577 F. Supp. 356, 380 (D. Ariz. 1983) \n     (citations omitted), such a lenient review is inappropriate \n     where the purpose of the regulations is to eliminate business \n     competition. See, e.g., id. (citing M & H Tire Company, Inc. \n     v. Hoosier Racing Tire Corp., 560 F. Supp. 591, 604 (D. Mass. \n     1983); Blalock v. Ladies Professional Golf Assoc'n, 359 F. \n     Supp. 1260, 1264-68 (N.D. Ga. 1973)). The Alliance cannot \n     cloak its purpose and effect under the garb of NCAA self-\n     regulation, cf., Justice, 577 F. Supp. at 379 (rule of reason \n     is appropriate where NCAA enforced rules against compensating \n     athletes), where the underlying facts demonstrate that \n     business-minded entities acted with the clear intent to \n     exclude non-Alliance bowls and non-Alliance teams from multi-\n     million dollar opportunities.\n       Courts have routinely condemned such market allocations and \n     group boycotts under the per se rule. See Fashion \n     Originators' Guild v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 312, U.S. 457 \n     (1941) (group boycott); United States  v. Addyston Pipe & \n     Steel Co., 85 Fed. 271 (6th Cir. 1898), mod., 175 U.S. 211 \n     (1,899) (market division). As the Supreme Court has \n     explained:\n       [o]ne of the classic examples of a per se violation of \n     section 1 is an agreement between competitors at the same \n     level of the market structure to allocate territories in \n     order to minimize competition. . . . This Court has \n     reiterated time and time again that ``horizontal territorial \n     limitations . . . are naked restraints of trade with no \n     purpose except stifling of competition.''\n       United States v. Topco Associates, 405 U.S. 596, 608 (1972) \n     (citations omitted).\n       For example, in United States v. Brown, 936 F.2d 1042 (9th \n     Cir. 1991), the Ninth Circuit held that an agreement between \n     two billboard advertising companies providing that each would \n     not compete with the other's former billboard leaseholds for \n     one year was per se illegal. Similarly, the agreement among \n     the Alliance bowls not to compete with each other for teams \n     should be per se illegal. Id. Likewise, the agreement among \n     the Alliance teams not to compete with each other for the \n     Alliance bowls should be struck down. Id.\n\n\n                           (2) Rule of reason\n\n       The Alliance agreements also fail under a rule of reason \n     analysis. Under the rule of reason, courts require a \n     plaintiff to show that there are significant anti-competitive \n     effects. See NCAA v. Board of Regents, 468 U.S. 85, 100-01 \n     (1984). Once this burden has been met, the defendant must \n     show that there are pro-competitive effects, which then \n     shifts the burden back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that \n     such effects can be achieved in a less restrictive manner. \n     Id. at 120 (striking down restraint on broadcast of college \n     football where there was no sufficient pro-competitive \n     justification).\n\n\n                      (a) anti-competitive effects\n\n       As set forth above, the anti-competitive effects of the \n     Alliance on college football generally and the New Year's \n     bowls specifically are undeniable. Instead of having all the \n     bowls bidding for all the teams, a super-coalition of \n     powerful bowls and powerful teams has divvied up the prized \n     opportunities among themselves. As the Supreme Court stated \n     in NCAA v. Board of Regents, ``[t]he anti-competitive \n     consequences . . . are apparent . . . [when] [i]ndividual \n     competitors lose their freedom to compete.'' 468 U.S. at 107-\n     08.\n       The facts of the 1996 season indicate that non-Alliance \n     teams were not allowed to genuinely compete for one of the \n     lucrative Alliance bowls. For example, BYU was not invited to \n     an Alliance bowl in spite of having a ``minimum of eight \n     wins'' and being ``ranked higher than'' four of the \n     Alliance teams participating in Alliance bowls. Moreover, \n     non-Alliance bowls were unable to genuinely compete for \n     the Alliance teams in light of the anti-overlap rule and \n     the ``no-pass'' rule--the latter of which mandated that \n     all Alliance-eligible teams must accept offers from \n     Alliance bowls--regardless of how lucrative a non-Alliance \n     bowl offer might be.\n       These anti-competitive effects are in direct contravention \n     of well-established Supreme Court precedent. In NCAA, the \n     Court explained that `` `[i]n a competitive market, each \n     college fielding a football team would be free to sell the \n     right to . . . its games for whatever price it could get.' '' \n     NCAA, 468 U.S. at 106 (quoting district court and striking \n     down restraints). The Alliance agreements clearly restrict \n     such a right for both the non-Alliance bowls and the non-\n     Alliance teams. See also United States v. Paramount Pictures, \n     Inc., 334 U.S. 131, 154 (1948) (striking down block booking \n     because it ``eliminate[s] the possibility of bidding for \n     films theater by theater. [Such agreements] eliminate the \n     opportunity for the small competitor to obtain the choice \n     first runs, and put a premium on the size of the circuit.'')\n\n\n                     (b) No Pro-competitive Effects\n\n       The Alliance cannot establish that its restrictive \n     agreements produce any pro-competitive effects. In fact, the \n     Alliance's own language reveals that it did not have even a \n     pro-compeititve purpose. The Alliance states that its \n     ``framework enhances the quality of postseason college \n     football match-ups, increases the likelihood of pairing the \n     two highest ranked teams in the nation in a bowl game, and \n     provides excitement for the coaches, players, and fans.'' \n     According to a recent Sports Illustrated article, the purpose \n     and effect of the Alliance is not to determine the true \n     national champion, but rather ``is to avoid the creation of \n     NCAA-run national playoffs. . . . The Alliance exists to keep \n     the power and the money in the hands of the Alliance bowls \n     and the four conferences that receive guaranteed berths in \n     those bowls. . . . Any national championship games that \n     result are a bonus.'' Layden, Tim, ``Bowling for Dollars,'' \n     Sports Illustrated, Dec. 16, 1996 at 36.\n       The Alliance goals fall far short of actually allowing the \n     best teams to compete in the best bowls. The 1996 season is a \n     painful reminder of this fact. Instead of consumers getting \n     to watch a highly-competitive match-up between No. 5 ranked \n     BYU and another top-ranked team, they were forced to endure \n     two blow-outs in the Alliance: the Fiesta Bowl where No. 7 \n     Penn State defeated No. 20 Texas 38-15, and the Orange Bowl, \n     where No. 6 Nebraska trounced No. 9 Virginia Tech 41-21. \n     These match-ups were based on membership in the Alliance, not \n     on merit.\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\3\\ Additionally, there is evidence which indicates that the \n     decision was not based on consumer preference. One poll is \n     reported to have shown that fans would have preferred the \n     following teams in an Alliance bowl: BYU--48%, Penn State--\n     22%, and Colorado--21%. As the Court has stated, ``[a] \n     restraint that has the effect of reducing the importance of \n     consumer preference . . . is not consistent with [the] \n     fundamental goal of anti-trust law.'' NCAA, 468 U.S. at 107 \n     (citation omitted).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In short, the Alliance ``framework'' fails to enhance \n     competition, as well as failing to meet its own stated goals. \n     The rule of reason inquiry must end here where the anti-\n     competitive restrictions are ``not offset by any pro-\n     competitive justifications sufficient to save the plan . . . \n     .'' NCAA, 468 U.S. at 97-98.\n\n                            III. Conclusion\n\n       Based on the facts available at this time, it is clear that \n     the Alliance agreements fail under either a per se rule or a \n     rule of reason. As the Supreme Court has explained, ``the \n     essential inquiry remains the same--whether or not the \n     challenged restraint enhances competition.'' NCAA, 468 U.S. \n     at 104. The restrictive Alliance agreements reduce \n     competition in the lucrative New Year's bowls, and guarantee \n     every Alliance team an opportunity to reap the short- and \n     long-term profits of a high-visibility bowl. The Alliance not \n     only perpetuates the current power structure, but, in fact, \n     exacerbates it. The strong get stronger, while the rest get \n     weaker.\n       As policymakers and football fans, we urge the Justice \n     Department to use its statutory enforcement powers to break \n     this lock on\n\n[[Page S2617]]\n\n     college football. We have every reason to believe that your \n     investigation will reveal additional evidence of the \n     Alliance's anti-competitive purpose and effects. Action must \n     be taken to restore genuinely open competition to college \n     football and to postseason bowls.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mitch McConnell.\n     Craig Thomas.\n     Robert F. Bennett.\n     Mike Enzi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the home State of the BYU \nCougars, the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank you for that commercial. I must, \nin the spirit of full disclosure, report that I am not a graduate of \nBrigham Young University but of the University of Utah, which happens \nto be ranked in the top three in the current basketball season along \nwith the University of Kansas and the University of Kentucky. I wish \nthe Final Four could include Utah, Kentucky, and Kansas, but I am \nafraid Utah and Kentucky will have their showdown prior to the Final \nFour and only one of the two will make it. If it is not Utah--as I am \nconfident, of course, that it will be--I hope, for the sake of my \nfriendship with the Senator from Kentucky, that it will be Kentucky \nthat goes to the Final Four with Kansas.\n  But the very fact that we can have this conversation about the NCAA \nunderscores the importance of what we are talking about with respect to \nfootball. These teams will get to the Final Four in basketball on the \nplaying field and not in the boardroom. The decision will be made on \nthe basis of how good they are and how entertaining they can be on \ntelevision by virtue of their skill, rather than how sharp the \nnegotiators were that put together the stacked deck in advance of the \nfinal event.\n  I have a chart here that reports what happened in the last bowl \ncircumstance. Every team in color, whether it is the two in yellow, the \ntwo in orange, or the two in red, appeared in an alliance bowl.\n  The two teams in white, No. 2 and No. 4, that did not appear in an \nalliance bowl, appeared in the Rose Bowl, which is now part of the \nalliance. Only one of the top seven teams did not appear in a lucrative \nalliance bowl--and that happens to be the team from BYU.\n  Rather than go on in a parochial fashion, as the Senator from the \nState in which BYU appears, I would like to summarize this circumstance \nfrom a source that is clearly not parochial and not particularly biased \nto BYU as a school.\n  I am quoting from the article that appeared in Sports Illustrated on \nthe 16th of December, 1996, entitled, ``Bowling For Dollars.'' In the \narticle they made it very clear what the real criteria was here. \nQuoting from the article:\n\n       Sunday's selections shed revealing light on the alliance. . \n     . , It was the shunning of Brigham Young, however, despite \n     the fact that the Cougars have a higher ranking and a better \n     record than either of the at-large teams chosen (Nebraska and \n     Penn State) by the alliance, that served to trash two widely \n     accepted myths.\n       Myth No. 1: The purpose of the alliance is to determine the \n     true national champion.\n\n  Sports Illustrated says:\n\n       Not even close. The purpose of the alliance is to avoid the \n     creation of NCAA-run national playoffs. Such playoffs would \n     put the NCAA in charge of the beaucoup dollars the event \n     would generate. The alliance exists to keep the power and the \n     money in the hands of the alliance bowls and the four \n     conferences that receive guaranteed berths in those bowls.\n\n  A fairly direct statement to the point raised by my friend from \nKentucky.\n  Now, Sports Illustrated goes on:\n\n       Myth No. 2: The alliance bowls exist to give fans the best \n     possible games.\n       Bowls are businesses, with major corporate sponsorship and \n     huge television deals. Their purpose is to fill stadiums, \n     generate TV ratings, and create precious ``economic impact'' \n     on their communities in the days leading up to the games.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, comes the paragraph that makes it clear that \nSports Illustrated is not necessarily friendly to BYU in every \ncircumstance, but summarizes why this decision was made.\n\n       BYU fails, not only on the strength-of-schedule issue but \n     also on the economic-impact side. Bowls, particularly the \n     Sugar Bowl, thrive on bar business. One of the tenets of the \n     Mormon faith is abstinence from alcohol. You do the math. In \n     the French Quarter, they don't call the most famous \n     thoroughfare Milk Street. ``We used to go to the Holiday \n     Bowl, and our fans would bring a $50 bill and the Ten \n     Commandments, and break neither'' says BYU Coach LaVell \n     Edwards. Nebraska fans, on the other hand, travel like \n     Deadheads, and spend like tourists.\n       Choosing bowl teams based in significant part on the \n     rabidity and spending habits of their fans isn't fair to the \n     audience watching the bowls at home. For all its flaws, BYU \n     would even be a more intriguing opponent for Florida State \n     than a team the Seminoles have already beaten. Unfortunately, \n     money rules all matchups.\n\n  Mr. President, BYU did go to a postseason game--the Cotton Bowl. The \nPresiding Officer from Kansas and this Senator from Utah entered into a \nfriendly wager, which fortunately this Senator from Utah won when BYU \nbeat the team from Kansas.\n  Satisfying as that victory was for Brigham Young University, the \npoint made by Sports Illustrated is still important. It is the fans on \ntelevision who support the tremendous amount of money available to \nthese alliance bowls, by tuning in and being available as an \nadvertising audience.\n  It is those fans who were deprived of the opportunity of seeing the \nbest game available on New Year's Day.\n  So for that reason, I am delighted to join in this effort to see to \nit that we do something to see that the antitrust laws apply here and \nthat a conspiracy in a boardroom does not take place to siphon off the \nheavy money to one group at the expense of not only the other group but \nalso of the fans.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am not sure it is a question, but rather an \nobservation. Also, the BYU Cougars, as a result of the Cotton Bowl \nappearance probably--I don't have the figure in front of me, maybe \nstaff does--probably got about $2.5 million as opposed to the roughly \n$8 million that would have been available had they been selected, as \nthey obviously should have been selected, for an alliance bowl. We are \ntalking not just about bragging rights here, we are talking about real \nmoney. We are talking about a $6 million differential, Mr. President. \nSo this is not just putting a trophy in the school gym. This is a big \nbusiness with huge economic implications.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Senator from Kentucky is exactly correct. One of the \nreasons, I am sure, why the Senators from Wyoming are joining in this \neffort is that under the rules of the Western Athletic Conference, \nBrigham Young would not take that money home by itself. It would be \nshared with the other schools in the conference, one of whom posted a \nsterling record themselves, the Wyoming Cowboys. They were frozen out \nof any bowl appearance at all on New Year's Day. They cannot even salve \nthat particular wound with the money Brigham Young would distribute \nthroughout the Western Athletic Conference with participation in an \nalliance bowl.\n  As I said before, the money comes primarily from television revenues, \nand by creating a restraint-of-trade circumstance to hold those \ntelevision revenues for a certain set of conferences, the leaders of \nthe alliance have damaged every other conference in the country, \nincluding schools like Wyoming, which would have received a significant \namount of money had it been available to the Western Athletic \nConference.\n  The message out of the alliance is: WAC need not apply, regardless of \nhow their teams are or have ever been.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Thank you, Mr. President. Today, I am pleased to join my \ncolleagues, Senator Thomas from Wyoming, Senator McConnell from \nKentucky, and Senator Bennett from Utah, in urging the Justice \nDepartment to exercise its enforcement powers to break the current \nanticompetitive lock on college football, if football does not do it \nitself.\n  I have a special interest in college athletics. I followed college \nathletics for some years, and I enjoy the excitement and competition of \ncollege basketball and football. I especially enjoy the competition in \nthe Western Athletic Conference. My son, Brad, played basketball at the \nUniversity of Wyoming, and so I watched numerous WAC games, both as a \nCowboy fan and as a father. I am disappointed to see the University of \nWyoming and other very\n\n[[Page S2618]]\n\ncompetitive WAC teams kept out of the top college bowl games because of \nthe anticompetitive College Bowl Alliance. These clandestine agreements \nkeep our players on the bench and in the grandstand when they should be \nout there on the field.\n  I think it is interesting we are discussing the anticompetitive \neffects of the college football alliance in the midst of the NCAA \ncollege basketball tournament. The NCAA basketball playoff system, \nwhile not perfect, aims to include the finest 64 college basketball \nteams in the Nation. In this tournament, any of those 64 teams has the \npossibility of winning the national championship. This arrangement is \ndesigned to maximize competition for the benefit of all the players, \nthe fans, and the schools involved. In contrast, the College Bowl \nAlliance has decreased the competitiveness of college football to the \ndetriment of the fans and schools involved.\n\n  The alliance is a coalition of top football college conferences and \nrepresentatives of the top post-season college football bowls. Over the \npast few years, the alliance has entered into a number of restrictive \nagreements designed to divide the market of the most highly lucrative \nNew Year's football bowls. These agreements effectively preclude the \nnonalliance teams from having access to the most prestigious and \nlucrative bowl games, even when one of the nonalliance teams has a \nbetter record and a higher national ranking than any of the alliance \nteams. These restrictive agreements are bad for football, and they \nviolate Federal antitrust law.\n  Just this last January, as you have heard, 2 of the top 25 ranked \nfootball teams in the country fell victim to this anticompetitive \nalliance. Brigham Young University, a member of the nonalliance Western \nAthletic Conference, finished the year with a remarkable record of 13 \nand 1 and was ranked 5th in the Nation. Another member of the WAC, the \nUniversity of Wyoming, finished its regular season with a formidable 10 \nand 2 record and a national ranking of 22, but it was not given an \noffer to play in any of the alliance bowls. In fact, as has been \nmentioned, despite its excellent year, the University of Wyoming was \nnot given the opportunity to play in any post-season bowl game. This \ncame as a great disappointment to the Cowboy fans nationwide.\n  The alliance is bad for football since, as a practical matter, it \nprohibits teams from outside the alliance playing the top bowl games. \nThe football games are now taking a back seat to the money games being \nplayed behind doors closed to both players and the fans. This has \nresulted in alliance teams having an institutional advantage in both \nbowl receipts and future recruiting.\n  In 1996, the eight alliance bowl participants, including the teams \nplaying in the Rose Bowl, split a total of $68 million. That was eight \nteams. In contrast, the 28 nonalliance participants divided a total of \n$31 million. This disparity in financial return is not good business. \nIt results in a built-in advantage for alliance teams in the areas of \nfuture recruiting and program development.\n  The alliance agreement provides unlawful economic protection for its \nmembers to the detriment of college football generally. The alliance's \nmarket allocation agreements have, in turn, hurt consumers. One poll \nhas shown that college football fans would have preferred to have seen \nseveral nonalliance teams, including Brigham Young University and the \nUniversity of Colorado, in top bowl games. These agreements amounted to \nchanging the rules with 2 minutes left in the fourth quarter. These are \nprecisely the type of market allocation agreements the Sherman \nAntitrust Act was passed to prohibit.\n  I strongly urge the Justice Department and the Federal Trade \nCommission to use their statutory powers to end the alliance's \nanticompetitive stranglehold on college football if they cannot do it \non their own.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator from Minnesota just allow me a couple \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Wyoming for \nhis important contribution to this issue and express to our colleagues \nthat we intend to stay interested in this. There is some indication in \ntoday's paper that some accommodation to the WAC and to the Conference \nUSA may be forthcoming. But I want to reassure all of those who have \nbeen left out that the antitrust case is clear and that the four of us \nplan to continue our interest in this, if the problem is not solved by \nthe organizations themselves. I thank my friend from Wyoming for his \nimportant contribution.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would like to add one more statement \nfor the edification and information of Senators. The Senator from \nWyoming referred to his team's record of 10 and 2. One of those two was \na loss to Brigham Young University literally in the last seconds with a \nfield goal that no one expected anybody could make that caused the game \nto go into overtime, and then Brigham Young won in overtime.\n  If that had gone the other way, it would have been Wyoming that would \nhave earned the position that BYU was denied. They would have beaten \nthe fifth ranked team, would have had a 10 and 1 record and would have \nbeen a clear choice for an alliance bowl. It was BYU's victory over \nWyoming that pulled BYU to that level. That is why I am happy to join \nwith him in saying we both got robbed.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Not to take away from the debate of my fellow Senators and friends \nhere, I still have to just root on our Minnesota Gophers tonight as \nthey take on Clemson in the ``Sweet Sixteen'' and hope and wish them \nthe best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2613-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2618-S2619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE 90TH BIRTHDAY OF HAROLD STASSEN\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \naccomplishments and contributions of a great Minnesotan, Harold Edward \nStassen, as he approaches his 90th birthday.\n  Harold Stassen began to make his mark on our Nation's history when he \nwas elected Governor of Minnesota in 1938 at the young age of 31. He \nwas known as the Boy Governor, he was twice reelected and remained the \nyoungest chief executive of any State until 1943.\n  In 1943, Mr. Stassen resigned from office as Governor to accept a \ncommission in the U.S. Navy. There, he served honorably on the staff of \nAdm. William Halsey until 1945 and attained the rank of Captain. During \nWorld War II, Mr. Stassen earned the Legion of Merit award, was awarded \nsix major battle stars, and was otherwise decorated three times.\n  One little known fact about Harold Stassen is that he was personally \nresponsible for freeing thousands of American prisoners of war in Japan \nshortly before that country surrendered in World War II.\n  According to a 1995 newspaper account, Mr. Stassen spent 2 weeks \nplanning the evacuation of some 35,000 prisoners from POW camps \nscattered throughout Japan. At the time, there was considerable anxiety \nthat Japanese soldiers would choose to retaliate against the prisoners \nfor their country's loss in the war.\n  On August 29, 1945, before the official surrender date, Mr. Stassen \nactually set foot in Japan and began what would be the largely \nsuccessful implementation of his evacuation plan.\n  After World War II, Harold Stassen was appointed by President \nFranklin Roosevelt as a delegate to the 1945 San Francisco conference \non the founding of the United Nations. He is now the only living \nAmerican who participated in the drafting, negotiating, and signing of \nthe United Nations Charter.\n  Mr. Stassen went on to become an influential advisor throughout the \nadministration of President Eisenhower. This included serving as a \nmember of the National Security Council, as the Director of the Foreign \nOperations Administration, and as the Deputy Representative of the \nUnited States to the United Nations Disarmament Commission.\n\n[[Page S2619]]\n\n  Mr. Stassen also has made many contributions outside of public life, \nincluding his service as the president of the University of \nPennsylvania from 1948 to 1953.\n  However, he will be best remembered for his life-long interest in the \nUnited Nations. Since his involvement in the founding of the United \nNations, Harold Stassen has maintained a dedicated and passionate \ncommitment to bettering this international organization.\n  In fact, he has published numerous proposals for reforming the United \nNations Charter and has made it his personal mission to educate the \nAmerican public about the U.N.\n  Just 2 years ago, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the United \nNations. On April 13th of this year, Harold Stassen will celebrate his \n90th birthday. A wide array of national and State officials will come \ntogether on this day in St. Paul, MN, to recognize Mr. Stassen.\n  As we continue our bipartisan efforts to renew and strengthen the \nrelationship between the United States and the United Nations, I think \nit is fitting to honor one American with a distinguished record of \npublic service who has long supported that effort.\n  As the chairman of the International Operations Subcommittee, the \nU.S. Congressional Delegate to the United Nations General Assembly, and \nalso a fellow Minnesotan, I want to wish Harold Stassen a very happy \n90th birthday and congratulate him for his accomplishments and many \npositive contributions to the history of the State of Minnesota, the \nUnited States, and the United Nations.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2618-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AGRICULTURE IN WASHINGTON STATE\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, agriculture is a cornerstone of Washington \nState's economy. Washington State farmers produce over $5.8 billion \nworth of agriculture products, employ more that 100,000 people, and \nexport nearly a quarter of all their goods to international markets. \nWithout a doubt, Agriculture is Washington's No. 1 industry.\n  As I travel around the State I have listened closely to the comments, \nsuggestions, and concerns of our State's agriculture community. Farmers \nand ranchers in Washington have without exception told me they want a \nsmaller and less intrusive Government; a Government that lets farmers, \nranchers, and local communities make decisions for themselves; and most \nimportantly, a Government that will step up to the plate and fight for \nissues that affect their lives. As Washington's senior Senator, I plan \nto work for just that.\n  The web of Federal practices, laws and regulations governing \nagriculture in the United States should offer our farmers consistency, \nflexibility and market access for their goods. Farmers view the Federal \nGovernment, like the weather and seasons, as an outside force to be \ndealt with. I want to ensure that the Federal Government is a partner \nwith agriculture, instead of an east-coast overseer.\n  This year, the wheat, barley, canola, pea and lentil, potato, hops, \nsweet cherry, and apple associations, as well as countless other \ngrowers' organizations, have visited me in Washington, DC. From our \ndiscussions, I have compiled a list of broad agriculture priorities on \nwhich I will focus in the 105th Congress.\n  I have always had, and will retain, open channels of communication \nwith my State's agriculture communities. Firsthand knowledge of the \nsituations and problems that farmers and growers face is, for me, an \ninvaluable tool as I work on issues that impact their way of life. So, \nI intend to meet with farmers, ranchers, irrigators, processors, \nshippers, and other agricultural interests during the April recess to \ndiscuss these matters.\n  For 3 days I will tour eastern Washington to discuss private property \nrights, tax reform, salmon recovery issues, agriculture research, \ntransportation issues, the Endangered Species Act, trade policies, \nregulatory relief, the future of the Hanford reach and the reform of \nimmigration policies important to the agricultural communities \nthroughout Washington State.\n  During my visits to Yakima, Spokane, and the tri-cities, I will \ndiscuss my top 10 priorities for agriculture, refine them, and solicit \nfeedback from the various agriculture interests that are affected by a \nwide range of intrusive Federal policies. My visit to eastern \nWashington will give me the opportunity to continue discussions already \nbegun with Washington State's farmers, explain my intentions, and \nreaffirm my commitment to the agriculture community.\n  To reiterate, the agriculture community's interests are Washington \nState's interests--Washington's economic health and job base are \ngreatly affected by the success or failure in this sector of our \neconomy. I will therefore pursue my 10 priorities, which I believe will \nhelp build a stronger future for Washington State.\n  Two years ago agriculture communities in eastern Washington gave me \nthe opportunity to work for them, represent their interests, and fight \nagainst policies that threaten their livelihood. As their Senator, I \nwill be working aggressively to promote their interests in the 105th \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, I take this occasion to thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Hawaii who has been here longer than I have and has waited \npatiently for recognition, allowing my short remarks to precede his \nlonger ones. He is a kind and thoughtful gentlemen.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his appreciation \nand wish him well during this break.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Akaka pertaining to the introduction of S. 490 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2619-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2619-S2624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      ASIAN-AMERICANS AND THE POLITICAL FUNDRAISING INVESTIGATION\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as we prepare for hearings on campaign \nfundraising irregularities, I would like to express concern about the \nnegative impact that this issue is having on the image of the Asian-\nAmerican community.\n  Mr. President, Asian-Americans are an important part of our body \npolitic. They have made significant contributions to politics, \nbusiness, industry, science, sports, education, and the arts. Men and \nwomen like Senator Dan Inouye, Kristy Yamaguchi, Tommy Kono, I.M. Pei, \nDavid Henry Hwang, An Wang, and Ellison Onizuka have enhanced and \ninvigorated the life of the Nation.\n  Indeed, Asian-Americans have played a fundamental part in making this \ncountry what it is today. Asian immigrants helped build the great \ntranscontinental railroads of the 19th century. They labored on the \nsugar plantations of Hawaii, on the vegetable and fruit farms of \nCalifornia, and in the gold mines of the West. They were at the \nforefront of the agricultural labor movement, especially in the \nsugarcane and grape fields, and were instrumental in developing the \nfishing and salmon canning industries of the Pacific Northwest. They \nwere importers, merchants, grocers, clerks, tailors, and gardeners. \nThey manned the assembly lines during America's Industrial Revolution. \nThey operated laundries, restaurants, and vegetable markets. They also \nserved our Nation in war: the famed all-nisei 100th/442d combat team of \nWorld War II remains the most decorated unit in U.S. military history.\n  Despite their historical contributions, Asian immigrants and Asian-\nAmericans have suffered social prejudice and economic, political, and \ninstitutional discrimination. They were excluded from churches, barber \nshops, and restaurants. They were forced to sit in the balconies of \nmovie theaters and the back seats of buses. They were required to \nattend segregated schools. They were even denied burial in white \ncemeteries--in one instance, a decorated Asian-American soldier killed \nin action was refused burial in his hometown cemetery. Rather than \nreceive equal treatment, Asians on the whole were paid lower wages than \ntheir white counterparts, relegated to menial jobs, or forced to turn \nto businesses and industries in which competition with whites was \nminimized.\n  For more than 160 years, Asians were also refused citizenship by a \nlaw that\n\n[[Page S2620]]\n\ndenied their right to naturalize, a law that remained in effect until \n1952. Without citizenship, Asians could not vote, and thus could not \nseek remedies through the Tammany Halls or other political \norganizations as did other immigrant groups. The legacy of this \ninjustice is seen today in the relative lack of political influence and \nrepresentation of Asian-Americans at every level and in every branch of \ngovernment.\n  Additionally, Asians were denied immigration rights. The Chinese \nExclusion Act of 1882 singled out Chinese on a racial basis, and the \nGentlemen's Agreement of 1908 and the National Origins Act of 1924 \nprohibited Japanese immigration--while permitting the annual entry of \nthousands of immigrants from Ireland, Italy, and Poland. The 1924 law \nalso allowed European immigrants to bring their wives from their \nhomelands, but barred the entry of women from China, Japan, Korea, and \nIndia. Even Asians who were United States citizens were prohibited from \nbringing Asian wives into the country. Conversely, the 1922 Cable Act \nprovided that any American woman who married an Asian would lose her \ncitizenship. It was not until the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act \neliminated immigration by national origins that the vestiges of these \nlegal restrictions were lifted.\n  Asians were also targeted by laws prohibiting them from owning \nproperty. The alien land laws passed by California and other Western \nand Southern States earlier this century, fostered by nativists and \nenvious competitors, placed heavy obstacles in the path of struggling \nAsian immigrants and their children that were not faced by others.\n  Perhaps most egregiously, Asians were denied civil rights guaranteed \nunder the Constitution. The relocation of Asian-Americans from the west \ncoast and Hawaii and their detention in internment camps between 1941 \nand 1946 is one of the worst civil rights violation in our history. One \nhundred twenty thousand men, women, and children of Japanese descent, \ntwo-thirds of them citizens, were incarcerated behind barbed wire \nfences, without due process or evidence of wrongdoing, under the grim \nview of machine gun towers. German-Americans or Italian-Americans did \nnot suffer a similar fate. In the process, Americans of Asian ancestry \nwere torn from their friends, their loved ones, their property, and \ntheir faith in the American dream. It was only in 1988, through \nlegislation sponsored by Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens, and others \nwho serve in this body today, that the U.S. Government officially \napologized for this injustice.\n  The reasons for historical prejudice and discrimination against \nAsians are complex, often involving economic or political motives. For \nexample, at one time European immigrant labor groups felt threatened by \ncheap Asian labor and staged strikes and acts of violence against \nAsians. Employers cultivated such ethnic antagonism as a stratagem to \ndepress wages for all workers, Asian and European. Nativists used \nAsians as a foil for their racist philosophies. Politicians cynically \nexploited anti-Asian sentiment to maintain power. And the press used \nthe ``Yellow Peril'', the specter of unlimited ``oriental'' \nimmigration, to sell papers. But at heart, the reasons for anti-Asian \npractices remain far simpler: Asians looked different, they \nhad accents, they worshipped different gods. They came from cultures \nand spoke languages that were beyond the narrow experience of \ntraditional, white America.\n\n  Thus, Asians and Asian-Americans were targets. Unlike other \ncontemporaneous immigrants--Irish, Italians, Poles, Jews--Asians stood \nout; they could not blend into the majority white population. Asians \nwere naturally suspect for their skin color and appearance: they looked \ndifferent so many Americans believed they must be different; that is to \nsay, somehow less than true-blooded American. In many instances, the \nreaction of Asians was to turn inward, to establish their own \ncommunities or ghettoes, like Chinatown or Japantown, or turn to small \nbusinesses or farms where they did not have to compete for employment \nagainst Caucasians--further isolating and insulating their communities \nfrom the rest of American society.\n  In time, however, Asians became more integrated in American life. The \nprogeny of immigrants were born citizens, spoke only English, watched \ntelevision and went to the movies, danced to the latest music, and felt \nthey earned their place in society through workplace contributions and \nmilitary service. As they assimilated, Asian-Americans enjoyed success \nin many areas of endeavor; in fact, they have been so successful that \nAsian-Americans have been cited as the ``model minority.'' Today, \nAsian-Americans tend to have high educational achievement, some are \nprominent in business and the professions, and they have been cited by \nsocial scientists for having community spirit, a sense of fiscal \nresponsibility, and a strong work ethic.\n  But the model minority image is mythical in many respects. On \naverage, Asian-Americans earn less than Caucasians. There is a \nsignificant income disparity between Asians and whites with equal \neducation. Asian-Americans also tend to be located in secondary labor \nmarkets, where wages are low and prospects minimal, and occupy lower or \ntechnical positions, where income potential is not as great as in the \nexecutive ranks. Proportionately fewer Asian-Americans are managers \nthan is the case with other population groups; they constitute less \nthan half of 1 percent of the officers and directors of the Nation's \nthousand largest companies. In corporate America, Asian-Americans have \ntheir own ``glass ceiling.''\n  In addition, many Americans mistakenly view the successful \nassimilation of more established, affluent groups such as Chinese-\nAmericans and Japanese-Americans as the community norm. They do not \nrealize that the community is extremely diverse in terms of ethnicity \nand recency of immigration. The more recent arrivals from Southeast \nAsia--for example, Vietnamese, Thais, Cambodians, Laotians--have \nsignificantly lower levels of income, education, and occupational \nadvancement.\n\n  Perhaps because of their success, perceived and otherwise, Asian-\nAmericans continue to suffer for their minority status. They are \nperiodically targets of hate crimes. The 1982 baseball bat killing of \nVincent Chin in Detroit, a scapegoat for the Detroit auto industry's \ninability to compete with Japan, illustrated America's ignorance about \nAsian-Americans--Chin was of Chinese, not Japanese, heritage--and the \ninequality of justice for Asian-Americans--the killers paid a fine of \n$3,780 and never served jail time. In 1987, teenagers chanting, \n``Hindu, Hindu,'' beat a young Indian-American to death. These are not \nisolated incidents. Last year, a report by the National Asian Pacific \nAmerican Legal Consortium found that hate crimes against Asian Pacific-\nAmericans grew from 335 incidents in 1993 to 458 incidents in 1995, a \n37 percent increase in just two years.\n  These violent incidents have been paralleled and surely fed by a \ngrowing national xenophobia. The fear of things foreign has manifested \nitself in cutbacks in international programs; the growth of the English \nonly movement; and the passage of California's proposition 187 and \nFederal legislation to curtail social services to undocumented aliens \nand legal residents. Fear of Asians and other minorities is also seen \nin proposals to rollback minority language provisions of the Voting \nRights Act and in broadbased attacks on affirmative action in \neducation, employment, and contracting.\n  I recall that only a few years ago, during the height of the debate \nover the budget deficit, much was made of the fact that a significant \nportion of our debt was held by Japan, but overlooked was the fact that \nboth the British and Dutch had far greater investments in United States \ndebt and property than the Japanese. Likewise, Japanese purchases of \nsignature properties like Pebble Beach and Rockefeller Center received \nsensationalized coverage, but few stories traced the decline and \neventual sale of these high-profile investments to other owners.\n  Today, with the hype and hoopla surrounding Asians and Asian-\nAmericans involved in the fundraising controversy, we see hints of the \nkinds of anti-Asian treatment that have been practiced in the past.\n  The first and most obvious of these is the inappropriate and \nmisguided attention paid by the media, commentators, and public figures \nto the ethnic heritage of those involved in the fundraising\n\n[[Page S2621]]\n\ncontroversy. For example, an early Washington Post front page headline \ntrumpeted an ``Asian Funds Network.'' However, upon a careful \nexamination of the article, the reader found the article was \nprincipally concerned with Asian-Americans, not Asians. Clearly, in \nsome quarters, ``Asian'' and ``Asian-American'' are synonymous, unlike \nthe case with Europeans and European-Americans. In fact, the term \n``European'' Americans is rarely heard in public discourse, because the \nethnic origin of European Americans is not presumed to have a bearing \non their patriotism.\n\n  Despite the fact that Asian-Americans have paid taxes, lived and \nworked here for several generations, and died in military service, a \ndifferent standard applies: Asian-Americans are still deemed to have an \nextraordinary, perhaps sinister, connection to their countries of \norigin.\n  Mr. President, I think that I speak for the entire Asian-American \ncommunity in expressing the hope that we can get to the bottom of this \nwhole controversy, wherever the cards may fall. Those responsible for \nviolations of laws or improper conduct should be identified and \nappropriately dealt with by the relevant authorities. However, I know \nthat Asian-Americans also agree that the gratuitous attention to the \nheritage and citizenship of John Huang and other fundraisers is unjust \nand destructive. According to the press and others, John Huang isn't \nsimply a DNC fundraiser or even an Asian-American fundraiser; rather, \nhe is referred to as a ``Taiwan-born naturalized citizen with ties to \nan Indonesian conglomerate'' or, worse, ``an ethnic Chinese with \noverseas connections.''\n  Last fall, during an appearance at the University of Pennsylvania, \nPresidential candidate Ross Perot erroneously referred to John Huang as \nan ``Indonesian businessman.'' Later, alluding to the fundraising \ncontroversy, Mr. Perot rhetorically asked his audience, ``Wouldn't you \nlike to have someone out there named O'Reilly? Out there hard at work. \nYou know, so far we haven't found an American name.'' The implication \nof these and other characterizations is that being Asian and \nnaturalized, rather than of European stock and native born, somehow \nrenders one less American.\n  Mr. President, this hyphenation or qualification of citizenship \nstatus is one of the subtle ways in which Asian-Americans are cast as \ndifferent and therefore suspicious. To some, Asians and Asian-Americans \nare the Fu Manchus of Hollywood legend--evil, cunning, and inscrutable \nEasterners who march in lockstep to some hidden agenda. According to \nthis view, being of Filipino or Thai or Pakistani heritage is all the \nsame--if your skin is yellow or brown, you are alleged to share certain \ninvidious characteristics of your race; your individualism fades into a \nkind of monolithic group identity.\n  Thus, all Asians and Asian-Americans are, by extension, responsible \nfor John Huang's or Charlie Trie's or Johnny Chung's alleged misdeeds. \nFurthermore, goes this circular reasoning, since it is accepted that \nAsians lack individualism, John Huang, Charlie Trie, and Johnny Chung \nmust be part of an Asian conspiracy.\n\n  A columnist for the New York Times played on this stereotype when, in \na series of editorials last year, he wrote of the ``penetration of the \nWhite House by Asian interests'' and characterized John Huang as ``the \nwell-subsidized Lippo operative placed high inside Clinton Commerce.'' \nThe columnist also referred to an ``Asian connection'' which provided \ncontributions through ``front men with green cards.'' Even the \nrespected Wall Street Journal described some of John Huang's donations \nas coming from ``people with tenuous connections to this country,'' \nalthough it is unclear whether it was referring to Asian residents or \nAsian-Americans.\n  A more recent manifestation of this stereotype can be found on this \nweek's cover of the National Review, which depicts President Clinton \nand Mrs. Clinton with slanted eyes, buckteeth, and wearing a coolie hat \nand Mao cap, respectively, over the headline, ``The Manchurian \nCandidates.'' This is a true low for reporting standards, more \nreminiscent of William Randolph Hearst's Yellow Press than of modern \njournalism. Some irresponsible publications, in the interests of \nsensationalism, are obviously more than willing to conflate racist \nstereotypes with modern standards of objective journalism. The \nPresident, Mrs. Clinton, and the Asian-American community are owed an \napology for this gross affront to decency and taste.\n  Mr. President, a second major fallout of the fundraising affair is \nthe impression fostered by the media and commentators that legal Asian-\nAmerican participation in the political process is illegitimate. \nCharges of undue influence on the part of the Asian-American community \nhave been raised with regard to immigration policy, specifically, the \n``fourth preference'' category that allows siblings of citizens to \nimmigrate.\n  The press makes much of the fact that Asian-Americans who are \nconcerned about this matter also contributed money to the campaign. \nCertainly Asian-Americans, the majority of whom are immigrants, wish to \nbe reunited with their families. However, it is improper to imply that \ncontributions to political campaigns by Asian-Americans should be held \nto a higher standard or any more suspect than contributions by other \nAmericans. This is tantamount to suggesting that the practice of giving \nto political campaigns should be limited only to non-Asians.\n  A third troublesome impact of the fundraising allegations is the \noverhasty and excessive reaction to the issue of legal contributions by \npermanent residents. In the wake of the ``Asian donor'' story, \nproposals have been made to eliminate their eligibility to make \npolitical contributions. Alarmed by the public fallout of the \ncontroversy, the Clinton administration and the Democratic National \nCommittee have preemptively decided not to accept contributions from \npermanent residents or U.S. subsidiaries of foreign corporations. And a \nnumber of Members of Congress have returned contributions made by \npermanent residents who are Asian, not because the contributions were \nillegal but because they feared the public's reaction to their \naccepting ``Asian'' money.\n\n  Mr. President, I acknowledge that there are legitimate concerns \nregarding the wisdom of allowing permanent residents to make \ncontributions to political campaigns, apart from the possibility that \nproscribing such contributions may violate the free speech rights \naccorded all residents, citizens and aliens alike, by the Constitution. \nAs my colleagues know, the Supreme Court has held that campaign \ncontributions are an activity protected by the first amendment, and \nthat the first amendment rights of legal residents are fully protected.\n  In this instance, however, I am more concerned by the possibility \nthat the only reason why campaign contributions by permanent residents \nhas become an issue now is because, for the first time, Asians and \nAsian-Americans happen to be involved in a major way. Evidence of this \nperhaps can be seen in the DNC's private audit of supposedly suspect \ncontributions.\n  Reportedly, DNC auditors asked Asian-American donors whether they \nwere citizens, how they earn their money, if they would provide their \ntax returns, and other intrusive questions, while threatening to tell \nthe press if the donors did not cooperate. Some of the Asian-Americans \ncontacted were longtime political contributors with impeccable \nreputations, who were naturally outraged. The DNC audit clearly smacked \nof selective harassment of those who happened to have Asian surnames; \nit underscores the Asian-American community's fear that they are being \nasked to pay for the alleged transgressions of a handful of individuals \nwho happen to be of Asian heritage.\n  Mr. President, a fourth major concern of the fundraising affair is \nthat it has undermined Asian-American leadership opportunities in \nGovernment. According to some analyses, the fundraising affair impelled \nthe Clinton administration to drop from consideration the names of \nUniversity of California-Berkeley Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien and former \nU.S. Congressman Norm Mineta for the positions of Secretary of Energy \nand Secretary of Transportation, respectively. Thus far, no Asian-\nAmerican has ever held Cabinet rank, and only a handful are represented \nin the senior ranks of Government.\n\n[[Page S2622]]\n\n  Furthermore, I would not be surprised to learn that every Asian-\nAmerican candidate for political appointment is currently being \nscrutinized for contacts he or she may have had, no matter how \ninnocent, with the Asian and Asian-American principals in the \nfundraising investigation. As a consequence, I greatly fear that \npromising Asian-American candidates for responsible Federal office will \nfall by the wayside, victims of guilt by association.\n  A fifth and perhaps most serious impact of the fundraising story, \nhowever, is its long-term effect on Asian-American participation in the \npolitical process. Last year, a record 75,000 Asian-Americans \nregistered to vote, a sign of the Asian-American community's newfound \nconfidence and political maturity. I am deeply concerned that biased \nscrutiny of Asians and Asian-Americans by the press, politicians, and \ninvestigators will kill this initial flowering of a historically \nquiescent and apolitical community, a flowering that led to the \nhistoric election of an Asian-American to governorship of a mainland \nState.\n  Will this scandal confirm Asian-Americans' fears that the system is \nrigged against them, discouraging them from participating in the \ndevelopment of public policy in a meaningful way? If so, this would be \ntragic for a community that is by far the fastest growing in the \nNation, which is expected to comprise 7 percent of the population by \n2020, and which has so many skills and experiences to offer our \ncountry. This tragedy would be compounded for those immigrants recently \nescaped from the yoke of authoritarianism, who might find the \nconsequences of political activism reminiscent of the penalties \nexperienced in their countries of origin.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, as we investigate the fundraising \naffair, let us remember the bigotry, prejudice, and discrimination \nfaced by Asian immigrants and Asian-Americans as they struggled for \nacceptance in the New World. Let us recall how they overcame steep \nsocial, economic, and institutional barriers to become valuable, \ncontributing members of society.\n  With this in mind, Mr. President, let us keep our attention on \nmatters of substance--the laws that were possibly broken, the processes \nand procedures that were bent, the individuals who circumvented or \ncorrupted the system, and most of all what we can do to prevent abuses \nin the future. These are the real issues at hand.\n  By the same token, Mr. President, let us avoid focusing on such \nirrelevancies as the ethnicity of the participants in this affair. Let \nus cease characterizing individuals by meretricious stereotypes; \nconversely, let us avoid judging an entire community by the actions of \na few individuals. To do otherwise, Mr. President, would be a grave \ndisservice to the seven million Americans of Asian ancestry who are \nvalued and rightful participants in our great democratic experiment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of \narticles by Robert Wright and Frank Wu addressing Asian-Americans and \nthe fundraising controversy be printed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From Legal Times, Feb. 10, 1997]\n\n The Asian-American Connection--the Campaign Contributions Fiasco and \n                          Racial Stereotyping\n\n                            (By Frank H. Wu)\n\n       As Congress prepares for hearings on the campaign fund-\n     raising fiasco arising from the work of Democratic Party \n     official John Huang, the racial aspects of the controversy \n     have become obvious to many Asian-Americans, if not to the \n     general public. But to combat the problem of racial \n     stereotyping in this matter, its presence first must be \n     acknowledged.\n       Consider the following evidence:\n       Before the November election, independent presidential \n     candidate Ross Perot commented about the controversy: ``You \n     know, so far we haven't found an American name.'' And: \n     ``Wouldn't you like to have someone out there named O'Reilly? \n     Out there hard at work.'' Likewise, during the campaign. \n     Republican candidate Robert Dole and House Speaker Newt \n     Gingrich warned of foreigners buying the White House. After \n     Bill Clinton's re-election, auditors from the Democratic \n     National Committee began contacting Asian-American donors, \n     asking whether they are citizens, how they earn their money, \n     and if they will provide their tax returns, all the while \n     threatening to tell the press if the donors do not cooperate.\n       Meanwhile, New York Times columnist William Safire, who \n     seems to have written about nothing else since introducing \n     this scandal to the mainstream media, dubs the controversy \n     the ``Asian connection''--the title itself revealing a \n     perceived racial element to the matter. The Wall Street \n     Journal, in its initial series of articles, described Asian-\n     Americans as ``people with tenuous connections to this \n     country.'' Huang himself is almost always referred to as an \n     ``ethnic Chinese'' with overseas connections, despite his \n     U.S. citizenship and low-key assimilationist approach.\n       Imagine how odious the same stories would be with a \n     different racial or religious group standing in for Asian-\n     Americans. If Jewish politicos were described as having a \n     ``Jewish connection'' or portrayed as traitors who \n     represented Israeli interests, many more people might be \n     troubled by the anti-Semitic implications. When Pat Buchanan \n     and Gore Vidal began to verge on such claims in the 1980's, \n     none other than William F. Buckley was prompted to publish a \n     book of essays discussing the ``new'' anti-Semitism.\n       Furthermore, nobody has suggested that the ethical lapses \n     of Speaker Gingrich can be traced to his ancestry. Nor do \n     people believe that the disgrace of consultant Dick Morris \n     reflects on his entire racial group. Yet the leading \n     newspapers and television networks continue to focus almost \n     exclusively on Asian-Americans who are alleged to have given \n     money improperly, attributing their behavior to their racial \n     backgrounds, while giving only passing notice to campaign \n     contribution transgressions by whites, (In this past \n     election, after all, it was a Dole adviser who received the \n     heaviest fine ever assessed for a proven case of money-\n     laundering.)\n       Recently, journalists Robert Wright and Michael Kelly \n     argued over whether l'affaire Huang was an incident of \n     ``yellow peril'' revisited. Writing in the online magazine \n     Slate, Wright suggested that racism had been used to \n     transform a minor scandal into a case of alleged major \n     wrongdoing. Kelly responded in The New Republic that this \n     view was merely a ploy by the Democrats to avoid answering \n     questions about misconduct.\n       Despite this focus, Asian-Americans are strangely missing \n     from the scene, the silent subjects of the debate. Asian-\n     Americans cannot afford simply to stand by and allow the \n     attacks on Huang to proceed, without at least asking people \n     to pause before assuming he represents all of us. By the very \n     nature of the allegations, however, Asian-American (as well \n     as Democratic) commentators are assumed to be self-interested \n     or covering up. Moreover, if we do speak out, we look like we \n     are defending not only the behavior of a monolithic community \n     but also the actions of foreign companies. We're in a classic \n     Catch-22 situation.\n       There have been a few exceptions to this silence. As the \n     scandal was developing last October, the nonpartisan \n     Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus Institute \n     (CAPACI) held coordinated press conferences in Washington, \n     Chicago, and Los Angeles to denounce the treatment of the \n     Huang matter. Yet the only coordinated Asian-American \n     response to the crisis was given minimal media coverage.\n       Similarly, the day before CAPACI held its event, the Rev. \n     Jesse Jackson called a press conference in New York. The \n     Rainbow Coalition leader was as supportive of Asian-American \n     political empowerment as he was critical of Indonesian \n     government labor policies. His statements attracted even less \n     attention than did CAPACI's.\n       Despite the intense media interest in Asian-American \n     involvement in campaign contributions, our positive electoral \n     accomplishments are ignored. Until the president praised him \n     in his State of the Union message last week, how many \n     Americans were aware that Gary Locke, the son of Chinese \n     immigrants, was the first person of Asian descent to win a \n     governorship on the continental United States when he was \n     elected to head the state of Washington last November? Nor \n     was it widely reported that in the last election, Asian-\n     American civil rights and community groups organized an \n     unprecedented nationwide naturalization drive to ensure that \n     eligible individuals became citizens and exercised their \n     rights. Or that a record number of Asian-Americans voted. \n     These stories and others received a fraction of the coverage \n     that the Huang spectacle has attracted.\n       The nature of the impropriety alleged against Huang also \n     belies a racial bias, or at least a lack of understanding of \n     what constitutes valid national vs. improper special \n     interests. Initially, the nexus between the contributions and \n     public policy decisions was said to be some vague influence \n     on American foreign policy by multinational companies or \n     Asian governments. Later, the alleged ``payoff'' for campaign \n     contributions was alleged to be related to immigration \n     matters--an issue that clearly is of particular interest to \n     the Asian-American community, but also one of national \n     concern.\n       Indeed, last year, immigration was the issue dividing the \n     country. The Clinton administration's strategy, like that of \n     moderates in Congress, was to distinguish between legal and \n     illegal immigration: Save the legal immigrants by sacrificing \n     the illegal immigrants.\n       As it happens, Asian-Americans--a majority of whom are \n     immigrants--generally supported family-based immigration. \n     Like other Americans, many Asian-Americans were especially \n     concerned with protecting the so-\n\n[[Page S2623]]\n\n     called fourth preference, which allows citizens to sponsor \n     their brothers and sisters as immigrants.\n       Huang recognized the obvious. He organized a dinner \n     bringing together Asian-Americans and the Democratic Party at \n     a lucrative fund-raiser, a dinner at the Hay-Adams Hotel in \n     Washington at $25,000 per couple. President Clinton himself \n     attended the fete.\n       Huang wrote a briefing memo prior to the dinner stating \n     that immigration would be a key issue for Asian-American \n     voters. President Clinton denies that he ever read the memo. \n     In any event, his administration had already made the \n     strategically sensible decision to oppose abolition of the \n     fourth preference.\n       Critics have suggested that this series of events \n     demonstrates that the president ``flip-flopped'' on the \n     fourth preference, sacrificing the interests of the American \n     public in controlling the borders for an infusion of foreign \n     money to his campaign. Such a view, of course, ignores the \n     fact that the people who seek to bring over their relatives \n     are themselves citizens. And the view is based on an \n     erroneous understanding of what the administration's position \n     had been.\n       In fact, in the past, the Clinton administration had sought \n     only to suspend use of the fourth preference temporarily, \n     until the waiting list was cleared out. It never pushed for \n     outright elimination of the provision. Thus, a \n     misunderstanding of the distinction between interrupting use \n     of the fourth preference and abolishing it may have produced \n     the appearance of impropriety.\n       Indeed, the scandal is not that Asian-Americans were able \n     to voice our views on immigration, but that we had to look \n     like we were potential donors of large sums of money before \n     we would be heard. Assuming that Asian-American contributors \n     helped save the national tradition of immigration, there is \n     nothing shocking about people trying to bring together their \n     families or actively participating in politics in an effort \n     to do so.\n       Immigration connects our nation to the rest of the world. \n     Much as the rules of immigration affect citizens along with \n     their immigrant relatives, they also turn on domestic \n     politics blended with foreign affairs. If Asian-Americans and \n     others who care about allowing immigrants to come to this \n     country are motivated by some sort of racial self-interest, \n     then the same might be said of whites and others who wish to \n     close the borders.\n       There is a better way than to allow political disagreements \n     to degenerate into such suspicions. Otherwise, genuine issues \n     of campaign finance reform will be obscured by racial \n     accusations and counter-accusations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Slanted--Racial Prejudice Is Part of What Fuels the Clinton Campaign \n                                Scandal\n\n                           (By Robert Wright)\n\n       The New York Times runs a lot of headlines about scandals, \n     but rarely does it run a headline that is a scandal. On \n     Saturday, Dec. 28, it came pretty close. The headline over \n     its lead Page One story read: ``Democrats Hoped To Raise $7 \n     Million From Asians in U.S.'' On the inside page where the \n     story continued, the headline was: ``Democrats' Goal: \n     Millions From Asians.'' Both headlines were wrong. The story \n     was actually about a 1996 Democratic National Committee \n     document outlining a plan to raise (as the lead paragraph put \n     it) ``$7 million from Asian-Americans.''\n       Memo to the New York Times: ``Asian-Americans'' are \n     American citizens of Asian ancestry. ``Asians,'' in contrast, \n     are Asians--citizens of some Asian nation. And ``Asians in \n     U.S.'' are citizens of some Asian nation who are visiting or \n     residing in the United States. This is not nit-picking. It \n     gets at the heart of the subtle, probably subconscious racial \n     prejudice that has turned a legitimately medium-sized scandal \n     into a journalistic blockbuster.\n       Would a Times headline call Polish-Americans ``East \n     Europeans in U.S.''? (Or, in the jump headline, just ``East \n     Europeans''?) And the headline was only half the problem with \n     Saturday's story. The story itself was wrongheaded, implying \n     that there's something inherently scandalous about Asian-\n     Americans giving money to a political campaign. In fact, the \n     inaccurate headline was necessary to prevent the story from \n     seeming absurd. Can you imagine the Times running--over its \n     lead story--the headline ``Democrats Hoped To Raise Millions \n     From U.S. Jews''?\n       Political parties target ethnic groups for fund-raising all \n     the time (as Jacob Weisberg recently showed in these pages). \n     They target Hispanics, they target Jews, they pass the hat at \n     Polish-American dinners. To be sure, the Asian-American fund-\n     raising plan was, in retrospect, no ordinary plan. It went \n     quite awry. Some of the projected $7 million--at least $1.2 \n     million, according to the Times--wound up coming in the form \n     of improper or illegal donations (which, of course, we \n     already knew about). Foreign citizens or companies funneled \n     money through domestic front men or front companies. And \n     sometimes foreigners thus got to rub elbows with President \n     Clinton. For all we know, they influenced policy.\n       But the truly scandalous stuff was old news by Dec. 27. \n     What that day's story added was news of the existence of this \n     document outlining a plan to raise money from Americans of \n     Asian descent. And that alone was considered worthy of the \n     high-scandal treatment.\n       Leave aside this particular story, and consider the \n     ``campaign-gate'' scandal as a whole. What if the same thing \n     had happened with Europeans and Americans of European \n     descent? It would be just as improper and/or illegal. But \n     would we really be so worked up about it? Would William \n     Safire write a column about it every 15 minutes and use the \n     loaded word ``aliens'' to describe European noncitizens? If \n     Indonesian magnate James Riady looked like John Major, would \n     Newsweek have put a huge, ominous, grainy black-and-white \n     photo of him on its cover? (``Clinton's European connection'' \n     wouldn't pack quite the same punch as ``Clinton's Asian \n     connection''--the phrase that Newsweek put on its cover and \n     Safire has used 16 times in 13 weeks.) Would the Times be \n     billing minor investigative twists as lead stories?\n       Indeed, would its reporters even write stories like that \n     Saturday's? The lead paragraph, which is supposed to \n     crystallize the story's news value, is this: ``A White House \n     official and a leading fund-raiser for the Democratic \n     National Committee helped devise a strategy to raise an \n     unprecedented $7 million from Asian-Americans partly by \n     offering rewards to the largest donors, including special \n     access to the White House, the committee's records show.'' \n     You mean Democrats actually offered White House visits to \n     Americans who cough up big campaign dough? I'm shocked. Wait \n     until the Republicans discover this tactic! The Friday after \n     Christmas is a slow news day, but it's not that slow. And as \n     for the ``unprecedented'' scale of the fund-raising goal: \n     Virtually every dimension of Clinton's 1996 fund-raising was \n     on an unprecedented scale, as we've long known.\n       There are some interesting nuggets in the Times story. But \n     among them isn't the fact, repeated in the third paragraph, \n     that fund-raisers told Asian-American donors that ``political \n     contributions were the path to power.'' And among them isn't \n     the fact, repeated (again) in the fourth paragraph, that \n     ``the quid pro quo promised'' to Asian-American donors was \n     ``in many cases a face-to-face meeting with the President.'' \n     And, anyway, none of these nuggets is interesting enough to \n     make this the day's main story. The only way to do that is to \n     first file Asian-Americans in the ``alien'' section of your \n     brain. That's why the story's headline is so telling.\n       The funny thing about this scandal is that its root cause \n     and its mitigating circumstance are one and the same. Its \n     root cause is economic globalization--the fact that more and \n     more foreign companies have an interest in U.S. policy. But \n     globalization is also the reason that the scandal's premise--\n     the illegality of contributions from ``foreign'' interests--\n     is increasingly meaningless. Both the Times and the \n     Washington Post (in its blockbuster-lite front-page story, \n     the next day) cited already-reported evidence that a $185,000 \n     donation (since returned) may have originated ultimately with \n     the C.P. Group. The C.P. Group is ``a huge Thai conglomerate \n     with interests in China and elsewhere in Asia'' (the Times) \n     and is ``among the largest foreign investors in China'' (the \n     Post). But of course, Nike, Boeing, General Motors, \n     Microsoft, IBM, and so on are also huge companies with \n     interests in China and elsewhere in Asia. They, no less than \n     Asian companies, at times have an interest in low U.S. \n     tariffs, treating oppressive Asian dictators with kid gloves, \n     and so on. Yet it is perfectly legal for them to lubricate \n     such lobbying with big campaign donations.\n       Why no journalistic outrage about that? Well, for starters, \n     try looking at a grainy newsweekly-sized photo of Lou \n     Gerstner and see if it makes you remember Pearl Harbor. (By \n     the way, neither the Times nor the Post noted that the \n     ominous C.P. Group is involved in joint ventures with Ford \n     and Nynex.)\n       You might think that, in an age of globalization and with \n     the United States' fate increasingly tied to the fate of \n     other nations, the United States' best newspaper would be \n     careful not to run articles that needlessly feed xenophobia. \n     Guess again. Six weeks ago a Times op-ed piece by political \n     scientist Lucian Pye explored the formidable mindset that \n     governs China today. Current Chinese leaders have \n     ``distinctive characteristics'' that give them ``significant \n     advantages'' over the United States in foreign policy. They \n     ``see politics as exclusively combative contests, involving \n     haggling, maneuvering, bargaining and manipulating. The \n     winner is the master of the cleverest ploys and strategems \n     [sic].'' Moreover, Chinese leaders are ``quick to find fault \n     in others'' and try ``always to appear bold and fearless.'' \n     Finally (``in a holdover from classical Chinese political \n     theory''), China's leaders ``insist on claiming the moral \n     high ground, because top leaders are supposed to be morally \n     superior men.'' In short, China's ``distinctive'' edge lies \n     in combative, Machiavellian, mud-slinging, blustery, self-\n     righteous politicians. Gosh, why didn't we think of that?\n       These peculiar traits, Pye noted, aggravate another \n     disturbing feature of modern China. It seems that the Chinese \n     people vacillate ``between craving foreign goods and giving \n     vent to anti-foreign passions.'' in other respects, too, they \n     evince a ``prickly xenophobic nationalism.'' Imagine that.\n\n\n                                 Links\n\n       Feel free to read the Times story that got me so exercised \n     (the Times Web site requires that you register before serving \n     you the page; registration is free).

Mr. President, the Environmental Protection Agency has \nproposed new rules to modify the ambient air standards for ozone and \nparticulate matter. I recently wrote to the EPA and urged the agency to \nreaffirm the current standards, conduct additional monitoring of \nparticulate matter and related air quality issues, and allow our States \nto complete action on the ambitious clean air standards that are \nalready in place before implementing additional regulations. I was \njoined in this letter by Senators Rockefeller, Ford, Glenn, and Robb.\n  These proposed rules have been extremely controversial, and have been \nsharply criticized by State Governors, municipal leaders, and business \norganizations. I have recently been made aware that these rules have \nalso been criticized by other Federal agencies.\n  During the interagency review of these rules overseen by the Office \nof Management and Budget, several Federal agencies submitted comments \nwhich questioned many aspects of the proposed rules, including their \nscientific basis and cost effectiveness. These comments are part of the \npublic record. Judging by the tone of the comments from the interagency \nreview process, it appears that many Federal agencies are concerned \nabout these proposed rules.\n  In but one example, the EPA has stated that the total national cost \nof implementing the ozone rule would be $2.5 billion. However, the \nCouncil of Economic Advisers has stated that the cost of full \nattainment of just the ozone rule could be $60 billion, or $57.5 \nbillion more than estimated by the EPA. This is a substantial \ndiscrepancy. The Department of Transportation, in its initial \ninteragency review submission, concluded that ``it is incomprehensible \nthat the administration would commit to a new set of standards and new \nefforts to meet such standards without much greater understanding of \nthe problem and its solutions.'' The U.S. Small Business Administration \nstated that EPA's proposed regulation ``is certainly one of the most \nexpensive regulations, if not the most expensive regulation faced by \nsmall businesses in 10 or more years.'' The SBA said that ``considering \nthe large economic impacts suggested by EPA's own analysis that will \nunquestionably fall on tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands \nof small businesses, this (proposal) would be a startling proposition \nto the small business community.''\n  I understand that some of these Federal agencies had also planned on \nsubmitting comments to the EPA as part of the public comment period. \nHowever, the Oil Daily, a trade publication, has reported that these \nagencies were prevented from doing so. The Oil Daily reported that \n``according to a leaked memo, the agencies were muzzled [by OMB] * * * \n'' The article further quotes the memo as instructing agencies that \n``based upon reports from a meeting this morning * * * Federal agencies \nwill not [I repeat not] be transmitting comments on the EPA \nproposals.''\n\n  Although the agencies provided critical comments during the \ninteragency review process, there is no evidence that the proposed \nrules were significantly modified to reflect their concerns. OMB \ncannot, therefore, defend its ``muzzling'' of Federal agencies--as \ncharacterized by the Oil Daily--by arguing that the proposed rules \nreflect the collective wisdom and judgment of Federal agencies, when \nthe exact opposite is the case. I would also note that the interagency \nreview comments from last fall are part of the public record, and so \nthere is no reason why the agencies could not also submit comments \nduring the public comment period. EPA and OMB are apparently holding \nconversations with some of the Federal agencies, but the critical \ncomments of other agencies will not be shared with Congress and other \ninterested parties. On its face, this becomes a private comment period, \nrather than a public comment period.\n  I am disturbed by this apparent lack of candor and public \naccountability on the part of the administration in discussing these \nrules. These proposed rules will impose significant costs, not only on \nour Nation, but also on Federal agencies themselves. Many agencies and \ndepartments operate facilities that will be directly affected by these \nrules. As the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I \nbelieve that these impacts and costs must be considered and reviewed as \npart of the appropriations process.\n  I am, therefore, today writing to various Federal agencies requesting \nthat these agencies individually comment on the cost of the proposed \nEPA rules, both with regard to the operations of the individual \ndepartments, and upon that aspect of the Nation's infrastructure that \nis regulated by the departments in question. I am also writing to the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget, requesting his \ncomments on the cost of these proposed rules to the Federal Government \nin its entirety.\n  As our Nation strives to balance the budget, while at the same time \nproviding Federal programs and services desired by the public, it is \nimportant that the significant costs of new regulations, such as these, \nbe made available and taken into account as part of the budget process.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do not want to take much time. Am I \ncorrect in assuming that the Senate is ready to recess shortly?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senate is still waiting for \nthe House with respect to the adjournment resolution.\n  (The remarks of Mr. DOMENICI and Mr. GORTON pertaining to the \nsubmission of S. Con. Res. 16 and S. Con.

Mr. President, on March 16, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the \nsenior Senator from New York State, turned 70. Senator Moynihan has \nbeen referred to, quite properly, as the intellectual of the Senate and \ncalled by many, a renaissance man. I mean no disrespect when I say that \nduring a couple of the gatherings of the Irish on March 17, he was also \nreferred to as the ``World's Largest Leprechaun.''\n  To me, Senator Moynihan is a good friend and a mentor, a wise voice \nthat I heard before I was in the Senate, and since. He is a man who has \nspoken with great prescience on issues involving families and the \neconomy, global power and welfare reform, on so many things.\n  Senator Moynihan has served in administrations of both Democrat and \nRepublican Presidents. He has always been ahead of his time, sometimes \nwith a controversial voice that then turns out to be the only accurate \nvoice.\n  Like all other Senators, I wish him very well as he heads into the \nlatest decade of his life.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a column by David Broder \nentitled ``The Moynihan Imprint'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 16, 1997]\n\n                          The Moynihan Imprint\n\n                          (By David S. Broder)\n\n       Today is the 70th birthday of a unique figure in the public \n     life of this nation for the past four decades, the senior \n     senator from New York, Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Tomorrow, a \n     day-long symposium and a celebratory dinner at the Woodrow \n     Wilson Center will make it clear just how large Moynihan's \n     legacy is.\n       Previewing the papers to be delivered, as Georgetown \n     professor Robert A. Katzmann, a onetime student of Moynihan's \n     and organizer of the tribute, allowed me to do, was a \n     reminder of just how rich and varied the New York Democrat's \n     contributions have been.\n\n[[Page S2625]]\n\n       He has been prescient about subjects as diverse as the \n     crisis of the American family and the breakup of the Soviet \n     Union. As his fellow scholar Seymour Martin Lipset points \n     out, his 1965 report for President Johnson, titled ``The \n     Negro Family: The Case for National Action,'' was bitterly \n     controversial at the time. But 30 years later, everyone has \n     come to understand that the wave of out-of-wedlock births and \n     the scarcity of jobs in the inner cities are overwhelming the \n     welfare system and threatening the stability of the whole \n     society.\n       As Michael Barone of Reader's Digest notes, it was Moynihan \n     in January of 1980 who said that ``the defining event of the \n     decade might well be the breakup of the Soviet empire.''\n       Moynihan was unable to persuade his colleagues in \n     government to move in timely fashion to head off the family \n     crisis he discerned, or to curb the excessive costs of the \n     1980s arms race with the Russians.\n       But as Stephen Hess, his deputy in the Nixon White House, \n     and half a dozen others argue, he was a shrewd and often \n     successful operative in policy jobs and diplomatic posts \n     under four presidents (two of each party) and for the last 20 \n     years as a member of the Senate.\n       For all his focus on social problems, Moynihan has left a \n     strong physical imprint on the nation as well. In his Labor \n     Department days under President Kennedy, he managed to \n     rewrite the architectural standards for government \n     buildings and to launch the rehabilitation of Pennsylvania \n     Avenue into what is now nearing completion as the grand \n     ceremonial thoroughfare of the Republic.\n       As a senator, Moynihan six years ago fundamentally \n     redirected national transportation policy by converting the \n     traditional highway program into something grandly called the \n     Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act--a charter \n     for states and communities to use federal funds for mass \n     transit as well as roads. Characteristically, as another \n     paper points out, he had written a magazine article as far \n     back as 1960 on the negative impact the highway-building boom \n     of the 1950s was having on older cities like New York.\n       Sweeping as they are, the papers to be delivered tomorrow \n     do not embrace all the aspects of the Moynihan persona. \n     Together with his wife, Liz, a warmhearted woman with the \n     toughness it takes to have run most of his campaigns, \n     Moynihan has a great gift for friendship, a talent for \n     keeping score of slights or rebuffs--and a really wicked \n     sense of humor.\n       On the last point, a speech that Moynihan delivered at a \n     Gridiron Club dinner during the Reagan administration remains \n     indelible in the memories of all who were there. It was his \n     idea to explain to a bemused President Reagan that David \n     Stockman--Reagan's precocious but controversial budget \n     director, who had been a live-in baby sitter of the Moynihans \n     during his Harvard graduate student years--was in fact a \n     Democratic mole who had been programmed to subvert the Reagan \n     presidency from within. It may have been the funniest \n     Gridiron speech ever.\n       I also cherish the memory of a Moynihan speech in \n     Philadelphia during the Democratic presidential primaries of \n     1976. Moynihan was supporting his great friend, Sen. Henry M. \n     ``Scoop'' Jackson of Washington, and had been dispatched by \n     the Jackson campaign to fire up a dinner audience of labor \n     union Jackson backers. They were, of course, drunk and \n     boisterous by the time he arose, but Moynihan delivered a \n     scholarly discourse on the forces shaping the American \n     economy and the Western alliance, worthy of a Harvard \n     seminar. And when he got around to his candidate, a man of \n     sterling qualities but no great pizazz, he was inspired to \n     describe Jackson with one of the most gracious phrases ever \n     applied to someone who was really boring. ``Our candidate,'' \n     said Moynihan, ``is blessed with the charisma of \n     competence.''\n       The union guys had no idea what the hell he meant, but they \n     knew it deserved applause. That's the way many of us in the \n     press feel about Moynihan. He's sometimes over our heads, and \n     often light years ahead of us. But we know he's something \n     special.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Broder speaks far more eloquently than I could of what \nSenator Moynihan has done and continues to do as he climbs new heights \nevery year.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that an article from The \nHill of Wednesday, March 19, entitled ``The Senate's Renaissance Man \nTurns 70,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Hill, Mar. 19, 1997]\n\n     Daniel Patrick Moynihan--The Senate's Renaissance Man Turns 70\n\n       In a public career spanning three decades in the groves of \n     academe and the halls of government, Sen. Daniel Patrick \n     Moynihan (D-N.Y.) has helped shape public policy on a wide \n     range of issues that bear on almost every major aspect of \n     American life.\n       Thus, when he turned 70 on St. Patrick's Day, a group of \n     Moynihan's friends, aides, colleagues and supporters used the \n     occasion to highlight his accomplishments at a day-long \n     celebration at The Woodrow Wilson Center.\n       The four-term senator, former U.S. ambassador to India, \n     former Harvard professor and aide to three presidents was the \n     guest of honor at a dinner culminating the tribute to ``The \n     Intellectual as Public Servant,'' excerpts of which follow.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n       (By Michael Barone, Senior Staff Editor, Reader's Digest)\n\n       Harry McPherson, writing about the Senate of the 1950s, \n     described a Senate dominated by ``whales'' and populated \n     otherwise by `minnows.' But the Senate in which Daniel \n     Patrick Moynihan took his place was quite another place. The \n     senators after whom the three Senate office buildings were \n     named had all died--Richard Russell in 1971, Everett Dirksen \n     in 1969, Philip Hart in 1976. Sam Ervin had retired in 1974 \n     and William Fulbright was beaten that year. Hubert Humphrey \n     was battling the cancer that killed him in 1978 and his old \n     adversary James Eastland would retire that year. Lyndon \n     Johnson and Robert Taft were long gone. Mike Mansfield had \n     retired and the new majority leader, Robert Byrd, was \n     regarded as a technician, in an office that carries none of \n     the great powers appertaining to the Speaker of the House. \n     Fully 18 of the 100 senators in January 1977 had been elected \n     for the first time. CBS News had to rent the large room in \n     the Sheraton Carlton Hotel and repaint it for their ``Meet \n     the Senators'' program. This was a heavily Democratic Senate, \n     but a Senate without driving Democratic leaders, and a Senate \n     which knew little or nothing about its new Democratic \n     president. It was a Senate in which political and policy \n     entrepreneurs could articulate their ideas and advance their \n     causes: not a bad place for a Renaissance man. ``In this \n     Senate, you do your work in committees, not on the floor,'' \n     Moynihan has said. And so Moynihan's first and perhaps most \n     important decisions were what committees to serve on. He had \n     confronted the question in a debate in the 1976 primary, \n     unsure at first how to answer. His opponents gave predictable \n     answers--Labor, said one, because that is where the great \n     urban aid programs are drawn up; Foreign Relations, said \n     another, the forum for the great debates on the Vietnam War; \n     another said Judiciary, which handled civil rights. \n     Moynihan's answer: ``Finance. Because that's where the money \n     is.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n   (By Nicholas N. Eberstadt, Visiting Scholar, American Enterprise \n                               Institute)\n\n       Anyone even vaguely familiar with his long and \n     distinguished career will already know that Daniel Patrick \n     Moynihan is a polymath. For over four decades, this sometime \n     speechwriter, political adviser, domestic affairs counselor, \n     diplomat and senator has also occupied himself, with seeming \n     effortlessness, as an established expert--in fact, a pre-\n     eminent authority--in an unnerving multiplicity of \n     intellectual disciplines and academic fields: among them, \n     American history, architectural criticism, arms control, \n     educational policy, ethnology, income policy, international \n     law, public finance, public policy research and evaluation, \n     the sociology of the family, and urban planning. As a \n     habitual and evidently incorrigible trespasser in the \n     sometimes jealously guarded fields of specialized learning, \n     it should come as no surprise that Moynihan's intellectual \n     ambit has taken him into many other areas not enumerated \n     above.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n (By Suzanne Garment, Resident Scholar, American Enterprise Institute)\n\n       The foreign service will never be composed of Moynihans--\n     and a good thing, too. The international political system \n     would collapse under the pressure. Still, every so often the \n     debate resumes about whether the foreign service is \n     professionalized enough and whether too many ambassadorial \n     appointments are going to outsiders who do not have \n     ``ambassadorial temperament.'' When we hear this argument, we \n     should remember that making reasonable room for outsiders is \n     necessary if we are to have room for the Moynihans, and that \n     having one Moynihan around at a crucial foreign policymaking \n     juncture makes it worthwhile to put up with entire troops of \n     lesser professionals in the ambassadorial ranks.\n\n  (By Robert A.

For that is \n     when the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government \n     Secrecy issued its report.\n       Most commissions receive scant attention. Rare is the \n     commission report which has a life beyond its issuance; most \n     are consigned to the microfiche collection in the basement of \n     some federal depository library. But this report on secrecy \n     would be different because of its chair, Sen.

Mr. President, let me just say that Senator Domenici, the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, has come to the floor this afternoon \nand presented two possible budgets. One is the President's budget, but \nwithout the trigger mechanism the President provided to assure balance \neven if the Congressional Budget Office projections are the ones that \nare used.\n  The President's budget, of course, reaches unified balance by the \nestimates of the Office of Management and Budget, but it does not reach \nbalance by the estimates of the Congressional Budget Office. And I want \nto emphasize, ``unified balance.'' All of us need to understand that is \nnot real balance.\n  Nobody should be fooled anywhere about any of these budgets that talk \nabout balancing on a so-called unified basis, because when they use \nthat big word, what they are talking about is putting all of the trust \nfunds into the pot to claim balance. So I think it is important to \nunderstand I do not believe any of these budgets that claim unified \nbalance are really balanced budgets at all.\n  But, with that said, I think it is also important to understand when \nyou hear these differences between Office of Management and Budget \nprojections and Congressional Budget Office projections, the fact is \nboth of them over the last 4 years have been overly pessimistic. They \nhave overestimated what the deficit would be. And I think that is also \nimportant to keep in mind.\n  As I understand it, the Senator from New Mexico, the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, offered the President's budget but without his \ntrigger mechanism. Why did the President not balance according to CBO's \nprojections? Well, very simply, when he did his budget he did not have \navailable to him the CBO baseline. He did not have available the CBO \nprojections. Although he asked for them, and asked for them repeatedly, \nthey were not prepared in time.\n  So in order to fulfill his responsibility to present a budget, he \nused his Office of Management and Budget projections, which, again, I \nemphasize have been overly pessimistic, not a rosy scenario, overly \npessimistic over the last 4 years in order to present a budget. He \nprovided a trigger mechanism so that if, in fact, CBO's projections \nwere different, were even more pessimistic than his own Office of \nManagement and Budget's, that he could still be in unified balance by \nthe year 2002.\n  I also understand the Senator from New Mexico has offered a second \nbudget that has no tax cuts or no net tax cuts and also has very deep \ncuts in domestic discretionary spending. When we use the term \n``domestic discretionary spending,'' what we are talking about is that \ncategory of spending that includes education, roads, bridges, airports, \nparks. Those are the categories of spending that are included in so-\ncalled domestic discretionary spending.\n  Mr. President, if I could, the reason I came to the floor this \nafternoon was to try to put this all in some perspective. Because I \nthink unless people have an idea of what we are talking about in terms \nof the estimated expenditures of the Federal Government over the next 5 \nyears and the estimated revenues and where the money goes, it is very \nhard to understand the nuances of these budget discussions.\n  This chart shows over the next 5 years what we are anticipating \nspending from the Federal Government: $9.3 trillion. The revenue that \nis forecasted for the Federal Government over the next 5 years is here \nin this block: $8.5 trillion.\n  So it is readily apparent that we are faced with a circumstance that, \nwithout change, we are going to be adding $800 billion to the national \ndebt.\n  Unfortunately, our friends on the other side of the aisle in Senate \nbill 2, which means clearly that is one of their highest priorities, \nsays the first thing to do is to cut the revenue anticipated by $200 \nbillion. So they take this sliver off to start with. They reduce our \nrevenue from $8.5 trillion down to $8.3 trillion as the initial step in \naddressing this gap between expenditure and revenue. It makes no sense \nto me why you would dig the hole deeper before you start filling it in. \nThat is what our friends on the other side of the aisle have been \ntalking about.\n\n  Instead of addressing this $9.3 trillion worth of expenditures with \n$8.5 trillion of revenue, they say cut it to $8.3 trillion of revenue \nto begin with. So now we have $1 trillion that will be added to the \nnational debt.\n  Mr. President, this chart shows where the money is going to be going \nover the next 5 years. This is where the money is scheduled to be \nspent, and I think this is what our friends across the way are \nstruggling with as they struggle to come up with a budget resolution. \nWhere are you going to cut? If we can see we are faced with adding $1 \ntrillion to the national debt based on scheduled spending and scheduled \nrevenues, and they start out by first taking $200 billion of revenue \naway, so you create a $1 trillion hole to fill in, where are you going \nto cut?\n  Here is where the money is scheduled to go: Social Security, $2.1 \ntrillion of the $9.3 trillion that we are scheduled to spend over the \nnext 5 years. Interest on the debt, $1.3 trillion. Clearly you cannot \ncut interest on the debt. Everybody is against cutting Social Security. \nThose two alone are 37 percent of the scheduled expenditures. Defense, \n$1.4 trillion, another 15 percent. We do not hear much of anybody \ntalking about cutting defense. So you start adding it up, defense is 15 \npercent, Social Security is 23 percent, which is 38 percent, and \ninterest on the debt is 14 percent. That is 52 percent of the scheduled \nexpenditures which nobody is talking about cutting.\n  That takes us to Medicare, $1.3 trillion, or another 14 percent of \nFederal expenditures. Medicaid, $600 billion, about 7 percent of \nFederal expenditures over the next 5 years. Other entitlements. We use \nthat terminology and it refers to things like retirement, nutrition for \nchildren, welfare. Those are things that are in the categories of \n``other entitlements.''\n\n[[Page S2627]]\n\n  Then there is nondefense discretionary spending, which I referred to \nearlier and which Senator Domenici, in the second budget that he laid \ndown here, would cut very deeply. He would cut from an unconstrained \nbaseline $263 billion out of this category. That is a tremendous amount \nof money out of defense and nondefense. Those two are called \ndiscretionary spending. From the nondefense discretionary side, the \nbudget he just presented would cut $183 billion out of a total that we \nare scheduled to spend over the next 5 years of $1.5 trillion. Again, \nwhat we are talking about there is education, roads, bridges, airports, \nparks, law enforcement.\n  Do we really want to be cutting those areas in the magnitude of the \nbudget that the chairman of the Budget Committee has laid down? I do \nnot think so. I do not think Senator Domenici thinks so. In fact, I am \nquite confident he does not think so. He is just making a point with \nthe second budget he laid down of what it would take even with no tax \ncuts to achieve unified balance. Remember, unified balance is not \nbalance at all. That is when you take all the money from all the trust \nfunds and throw those into the pot to claim that you are balancing the \nbudget.\n  I hope this puts in some perspective what it is that we face this \nyear. This is not going to be easy. That is, hopefully, the message \nthat I have communicated here. When you look at what the scheduled \nrevenue is of the Federal Government--maybe we could show that chart \nagain--$9.3 trillion are the expenditures, and we are scheduled to have \n$8.5 trillion of revenue. If the first thing you do is take $200 \nbillion out of the revenue column, now you are at $8.3 trillion, and \nyou have $9.3 trillion of expenditures, you have $1 trillion added to \nthe national debt. Is that what we want to do? To have the kind of \nmassive tax cut that some have talked about, you have to borrow it all. \nDoes that make sense? Should we borrow money to have a tax cut? Does \nthat make sense to people? We already have a $5 trillion national debt. \nHow deep in the hole are we going to go around here before we respond?\n  Mr. President, these are the major categories of Federal spending. I \nthink one can see that if we are going to be serious about balancing \nthe budget and doing it in an honest way, we have a tall order in front \nof us. Talking about tax cuts of $200 billion over the next 5 years, \nwhich our friends on the other side of the aisle have put up as their \nSenate bill No. 2, really makes no sense to me. It especially makes no \nsense when you look at what happens to that tax cut proposal in the \nsecond 5 years. This is not just a matter of reaching some kind of \nbalance in the year 2002. We have to be looking over the horizon here, \nbecause the real challenge is, where is this all going? The real \nchallenge is we have the baby boom generation coming along, and they \nare going to start retiring in the year 2012, and they will double the \nnumber of people almost overnight eligible for our major programs.\n  We are headed for a circumstance in which, if we fail to change \ncourse, we are going to either have an 80 percent tax rate--yes, 80 \npercent; does anybody believe we will do that?--or a one-third cut in \nall benefits. Cut Social Security one-third, cut Medicare one-third, \ncut all veterans benefits one-third. Those are the kind of draconian \noptions that will be presented to this Congress and a future President \nif we fail to act.\n  We have a responsibility to respond. I submit that having tax cuts of \n$200 billion over the next 5 years that explode to $500 billion over \nthe next 10 years is not rational, is not responsible, is not the way \nto begin to fill in the hole. I have never seen anybody that went out \nto fill in a hole and the first thing they did was dig it deeper. It \nmakes very little sense to me.\n  I hope that Senator Domenici, by presenting these budget options this \nafternoon, sobers up people on both sides of the aisle here, sobers up \nthose who think that we can have massive tax cuts. That is not in the \ncards. That is not serious if people are going to be honest with the \nlong-term fiscal imbalances this country faces. That is not facing it \nhead on or squarely. Also, I hope it stands as a message to people on \nmy side of the aisle, some who are opposed, for example, to correcting \nthe Consumer Price Index that we use to adjust for the cost of living. \nThe evidence is overwhelming that we are making an overcorrection for \nthe cost of living by as much as perhaps 1 percent a year. It sounds \nlike a small amount, but it makes a big difference over time. That 1 \npercent mistake will cost the U.S. Government $1 trillion over the next \n12 years. Some on my side say we cannot touch that.\n  If we can't touch that, and the other side says we have to have a big \ntax break, you begin to wonder what can we do around here? Goodness \nknows, if we can't correct a mistake, which I believe the CPI is in \nterms of adjusting for the cost of living based on the best evidence \nthat we have, what can we do? If our friends on the other side want to \nhave dessert before we start eating our vegetables in the face of this \nenormous challenge of these long-term fiscal imbalances, then how \nserious are they really about addressing the challenges facing \nAmerica's future?\n  We have an opportunity here to do something great for America, \nbecause this isn't just some dry discussion about making columns of \nnumbers add up. That isn't what this is about. This is not a counting \nexercise. This is about the future economic strength of America. This \nis about what kind of jobs are going to be available for our kids. This \nis about what kind of life future Americans are going to enjoy. This is \nabout the competitive position of America. That is what is at stake. It \nis not just some dull, lifeless debate about balancing a budget. This \ndiscussion is about what we can do to strengthen America for the future \nand the difference that we can make in the lives of the people of our \ncountry by being responsible now, because what we have been told is, if \nwe balance this budget in this window of opportunity we have before the \nbaby boomers start to retire, our economy in the future will be 30 \npercent larger than if we fail to act.\n  Some may be listening to this saying, ``Wait a minute. I am lost. \nWhat is the connection between balancing the budget now and having a \nbigger economy later?'' It is very simple, but it is very real. If we \nare going to grow the economy, if we are going to make it bigger, if we \nare going to have more jobs, we need investment. To have investment you \nhave to have savings. The biggest threat to savings in this country is \nthe deficits that the Federal Government runs, because those deficits \ntake money out of the pool of savings of our society.\n  That is why this debate matters. It is perhaps the single most \nimportant debate we will have in this Congress this year. If we all do \nit seriously and honestly and face our responsibilities squarely, we \ncan do something great for our country.\n  I thank the Chair.

Mr. President, I rise this evening to address an issue \nwhich is one that many of us have labored over for decades, the legacy \nof the Vietnam war.\n  So many people have said and written that the returning veterans did \nnot receive the credit which they deserved for putting their lives on \nthe line for our Nation. Regardless of the wisdom or popularity of that \nwar, so many of those veterans came home and, frankly, found it \ndifficult to start their lives again in America.\n  In this Congress of the United States about 12,000 men and women have \nserved in the House of Representatives, and it is my understanding that \n1,843 men and women have served in this U.S. Senate.\n  It was my good fortune to serve in the House before I came to the \nSenate and my better fortune to meet an extraordinary individual in the \nHouse of Representatives, a Vietnam veteran, who had an amazing story \nto tell. This colleague of mine in the House from the State of Florida, \nPete Peterson, was an Air Force pilot in the Vietnam war. Pete served \n27 years in the Air Force. He gave most of his adult life in service to \nhis country. But the most amazing part of his service in Vietnam was \nnot in an airplane in the clouds but on the ground. For 6\\1/2\\ years \nPete\n\n[[Page S2628]]\n\nPeterson was a prisoner of war in Vietnam.\n  He is a very soft-spoken and friendly person. He hardly ever brings \nup the subject about his military service. But one day over lunch, I \nsaid, ``Pete, if you are not uncomfortable to talk about it, tell us \nwhat you remember about those 6\\1/2\\ years.'' For the next hour Pete \nspoke and answered our questions from his colleagues in the House. I \nwill tell you that my memory of that conversation will be with me for \nthe rest of my life. To try for a moment to envision or imagine what it \nmust have been like to spend 6\\1/2\\ years in a prison camp in North \nVietnam is almost beyond any of us. He talked about the deprivations, \nphysical and mental, and how he managed to survive.\n  Pete is not one to boast about it. He is not alone in having gone \nthrough that experience. Our colleague from Arizona, Senator John \nMcCain, had a similar experience as prisoner of war in Vietnam. I have \nnot spoken to my colleague, John McCain about it. But I read about it \nin a book published recently entitled ``The Nightingale Song,'' which \ntold the history and the story of others who went through that \nexperience.\n  The interesting thing about Pete Peterson is that he came out of that \nexperience, went to work in Florida, and decided that there was more to \ngive to this country. So he ran for the U.S. House of Representatives \nand was elected.\n\n  Then in April of last year President Clinton turned to then \nCongressman Pete Peterson and asked him to undertake what was a major \nresponsibility, to serve as the first U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam. It \nwas a controversial posting. Some in this body and others really \nquestioned whether or not we should have diplomatic relations. But \nmany, like Pete Peterson and John McCain, believe that we have reached \nthat moment in history where the best thing for both of our countries \nis to have diplomatic relations. I thought the President made a wise \nchoice.\n  Those who watched the program 60 Minutes which was on last Sunday \nnight may have seen the segment about Pete Peterson, once a downed \npilot in a rice paddy in Vietnam, pushed away into a prison camp for \n6\\1/2\\ years, now with the opportunity to return as the Ambassador from \nthe United States of America to Vietnam and, I am certain, to return to \nthat same village and meet the people who held him at bay and pushed \nhim into that prisoner-of-war camp.\n  So Pete Peterson's name was put up and suggested, and the reaction \nwas positive. People said what a fitting choice to take someone who has \nbeen through this life experience, who has endured this time as a \nprisoner of war, and to ask him to serve as our Ambassador in Vietnam.\n  Of course, his name was submitted to the Senate at that point for \nconfirmation. Some problems arose and questions about whether or not as \na sitting Congressman he could be appointed to a post that was created \nduring his term in office. But after all was said and done, his name \nwas resubmitted this year in January, and he received a favorable \nhearing in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In fact, his \nsponsors at his hearing included not only his home State Senator, \nSenator Graham of Florida, but also Senator John McCain, a man from the \nopposite side of the aisle who identified with Pete's experience and \nsaid that he would be an excellent choice as the Ambassador to Vietnam.\n  So we come this evening to the Chamber in the hopes that we can make \nit clear that his name, Pete Peterson's name, will come before this \nSenate for consideration and, I hope, confirmation in the very near \nfuture.\n  The majority leader, Senator Lott, and I had a conversation on this \nsubject earlier in the day. He was kind enough to return to the Chamber \nfor this moment to speak to this issue. I thank my colleague for doing \nthat. I will at this point yield the floor so the Senator from \nMississippi may make comments on this confirmation of Pete Peterson.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator from Illinois will yield, I will be glad to \nrespond to his comments. They have certainly been very good ones.\n  We all understand and appreciate and agree with the remarks about the \ntremendous service and the quality of man that Pete Peterson is. I am \nsatisfied that he would be a great representative for our country in \nany position, whether it be an easy one, great luxury, or a tough one, \nas this one will be when he is confirmed.\n  The Senator is right that there are those of us in the Chamber and in \nAmerica who doubt the wisdom of going forward with this normalization \nwith Vietnam for a variety of reasons. Particularly, the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, Mr. Smith, has raised a lot of questions and concerns \nover the years about POWs and missing in action, accounting for those \nPOWs. He is very concerned about those servicemen that have not been \nidentified, have not been accounted for. He has made that very clear. \nHe has serious doubts that Vietnam is actually doing all that it can do \nor all it has said it would do in moving toward normalization and \naccounting for those POW/MIAs, and he has asked me as majority leader \nin a very good, strong letter, lengthy letter to give him an \nopportunity to ask some questions and get some answers.\n  I try to honor that kind of request for any Senator on either side of \nthe aisle whenever I can within reason. And I have also joined him \nthrough my staff that deals with the Intelligence Committee to work \nwith the intelligence staff to try to get a report or reports in \nresponse to the questions that Senator Smith has asked.\n  Those reports may not be sufficient or they may not be good, but \nSenator Smith has indicated he has no desire to hold this nomination up \nat length. In fact, I think he would agree with me and the Senator that \nthis is an excellent choice for any position.\n  So it is my intent, barring some unforeseen complication, that this \nnomination would be brought up on Tuesday or Wednesday the week we come \nback. I believe that would be the 8th or 9th. I do not think it would \nbe appropriate to hold it up beyond that. And again, barring something \nthat I cannot imagine right now--and, of course, assuming that over the \nnext 2\\1/2\\ weeks we will get these reports--we would call that \nnomination up. I think we would be able to do that, and I certainly \nwant to. I do not see any reason why we would not be able to based on \nmy conversations with Senator Smith.\n  We appreciate the interest of the Senator in his former colleague \nfrom the House, and look forward to working with the Senator on this \nand other issues.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the majority leader. This will be good news in \nMarianna, FL, where Pete Peterson is waiting for word on his new \nassignment. He has accepted the important assignment for this country. \nHe has given so much more than any of us have ever been asked to give. \nAnd this new assignment to Vietnam is one that Pete takes very \nseriously.\n  My colleague and friend from Mississippi, the majority leader, has \nraised an important critical issue of the unaccounted for POWs and \nMIAs. I cannot think of a person who will take that responsibility more \nseriously than Pete Peterson, who knows men whom he served with in the \nAir Force and other branches who are not accounted for. And I am \ncertain that he will work with diligence to try to establish their \nwhereabouts to the satisfaction of their families as quickly as \npossible.\n  Of course, in terms of our relations with Vietnam, that debate will \ngo on, and our relationship with that country will be decided based on \nthe conduct of Vietnam toward the United States and vice versa. A man \nof Pete Peterson's stature I think will enhance that relationship, and \nI am confident that when he is called for consideration on Tuesday or \nWednesday after we return, he will receive strong bipartisan support \nfor this assignment.\n  I thank the majority leader for coming to the floor. I know he has a \nvery busy schedule, but I consider this an important matter, as I am \nsure he does. I appreciate his cooperation. I thank my colleague from \nArkansas for giving me this opportunity to speak first.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator from Arkansas allow me to put a couple \nbrief\n\n[[Page S2629]]\n\nstatements in the Record and make a unanimous consent request. This \nshould not take very long at all.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. My pleasure, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2627-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO SAM ADCOCK\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize and say \nfarewell to an outstanding staffer and dear friend of mine, Sam Adcock.\n  For the past 7 years, Sam has served not only as my national security \nadvisor, but as one of my most-trusted and able advisors. Sam is moving \non to other challenges, but it is my privilege to commend him for the \nservice he has provided me and the Senate as a whole.\n  The youngest of four children born to Pat and Larry Adcock, Sam was \nborn in Baton Rouge, LA, and although Sam was not a native \nMississippian, he assured me he had relatives in the Magnolia State.\n  I am not sure what effect being the youngest in such a large family \nhad on Sam, but I think it must have played some part in cultivating \nhis competitive nature.\n  It is this, combined with a gut instinct for effective legislation, \nwhich has made Sam Adcock such an important part of my team.\n  Sam joined my staff as a full-time employee in 1990, after serving \nfor a year as a military liaison. He served as my legislative assistant \nwhile I was a member of the Armed Services Committee, and quickly sank \nhis teeth into the complicated process of military appropriations.\n  Mississippi's shipyards and military bases owe Sam Adcock a debt of \ngratitude for the countless hours he spent arguing on their behalf.\n  During the 1991, 1993, and 1995 Base Realignment and Closure [BRAC] \nprocedures, due in large part to Sam's hard work, Mississippi was the \nonly State that had no bases closed.\n  Among the many areas where Sam's expertise was invaluable to me were \nthe development of the LHA and LHD programs. Perhaps one of our \ngreatest legislative triumphs was working in 1995 to help Ingalls \nShipbuilding of Pascagoula, MS, win the $1.4 billion contract for LHD \n7.\n  Sam worked around the clock to help Ingalls win this contract so \nimportant to the men and women of Jackson County, MS, but that was not \nunusual for him. I know Mississippians would be proud to know how \nrelentlessly Sam pursued what was in their State's best interests.\n  The country, too, should be proud to have had such a champion of \nstrong military ideals fighting to preserve our Nation's military \nprowess. I could always count on Sam to go into a meeting for me and \ncome away with the best possible deal for Mississippi and our country \nas a whole.\n  In addition to his service as my armed services advisor, Sam was \npromoted to the position of legislative director. He has always been a \ntake-charge kind of guy, and he ensured that my office's legislative \nstaff was prepared and proactive. As effective as Sam's leadership was, \nhe was also one of the most well-liked members of my staff.\n  While those who have worked against Sam know what a formidable \nopponent he is, those who have worked with him know what a pleasant and \napproachable man he can be.\n  As Sam Adcock moves on to a new and exciting position as vice-\npresident for government operations at Daimler Benz, I wish him, his \nwife Carol, and their young son Austin, the best of luck.\n  Sam exemplifies all that is good in the congressional staffers who \nwork so hard here on Capitol Hill. He is honest, industrious, \nintelligent, and talented.\n  My office will be poorer for his departure, but the people of this \ncountry are richer from his time as a Senate staffer. For his loyal and \ndedicated service, I thank him.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2629-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JIM GRAHNE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to express the gratitude of the \nSenate to Jim Grahne, the director of our Senate Recording and \nPhotographic Studios. Jim is retiring this week after 27 years of \ndedicated service to the Senate.\n  Jim Grahne has been one of our most talented technical and management \nprofessionals in the Office of the Sergeant at Arms.\n  He is an engineer by training and profession and has used his skill, \ncreativity and expertise to shepherd the Senate through nearly 30 years \nof broadcast and photographic technology. I am referring to the \ntelevision, radio and photographic services on which we as members, and \nas an institution, so readily rely.\n  It was Jim's leadership that made technically possible the broadcast \nof the proceedings of the Senate floor.\n  While that accomplishment may be one of his professional highlights, \nhe always sought ways to improve products and services to members.\n  Some of the recent successes of Jim and his staff include the \ninstallation of a fiber optic network for the broadcast of committee \nhearings, CD-Rom and on-line photo data base services for members' \noffices. Jim and his staff have also pioneered the use of closed \ncaptioning text, audio and visual technologies.\n  This year the studios released full text and audio search and \nretrieval of floor proceedings. Offices may now search for and download \nany speech or debate text and audio with 15 minutes of its being given.\n  Our gratitude for Jim is not limited to his understanding and \nappreciation for technology. Because he came to the Senate from the \ncommercial news and broadcast industry, he understands the importance \nof the press and of the role played by visual and sound images.\n  Every day that the proceedings of the Senate are made available to \nthe press here and around the world, it is an affirmation and practical \nexample of democracy in action. That goal has been an important part of \nJim's motivation.\n  Mr. President, our Senate family wishes Jim and Linda, his wife of 34 \nyears, and their children--Mark, Lena, and Karen--the very best and \nhope he gets some time to spend on that sailboat with his \ngranddaughter, Megan. But, knowing Jim as we do, we can expect his \nsleeves will be rolled up and into another challenge in the very near \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2629-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2629-S2630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY ACT AMENDMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I regret the objection from our colleagues \non the other side of the aisle. I know the Senator from Illinois was \nobjecting on behalf of other Senators that could be directly affected \nby this issue. I have filed a cloture motion on the motion to proceed \nto the nuclear waste bill. So I now ask unanimous consent that the \ncloture vote be at 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday, April 8, and the mandatory \nquorum under rule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. In light of this agreement to conduct this cloture vote on \nTuesday, April 8, I now announce that there\n\n[[Page S2630]]\n\nwill be no votes during the session of the Senate on Monday, April 7, \nthe day that we return, although there will be debate on that day. I \nexpect debate to occur on the pending motion to proceed to the nuclear \nwaste bill on that Monday, and the Senate may be asked to consider \nother legislative or executive items on that Monday. I will be \ndiscussing Monday's schedule further with the Democratic leader and \nwill inform the Senate as to what other items the Senate may consider \nwhen it reconvenes following the Easter recess period.\n  I thank all my colleagues for their attention. I now withdraw the \nmotion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is withdrawn.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just in conclusion, I want to recognize the \nSenator from Arkansas, who is in the Chamber at this time. I thank him \nagain for his courtesy in allowing me to do this and recognize that he \nis a member of the Committee of Energy and Natural Resources that \nreported this legislation. I think it is very important legislation. I \nunderstand that the Senators from Nevada will have to make their points \nin opposition to what it would do, but I do think it is just absolutely \nessential that this country face up to the need to deal with our \nnuclear waste. There is no easy way to do it. There is no perfect \nsolution for all 100 Senators. But we passed it last time through the \nSenate and it died aborning in the House. I am told this time that we \nwill, when we pass it, the House will also pass it, and this time we \nhope we can get it to the President. And we hope we can get it to the \nPresident in a way that he feels he can sign it.\n  We must do this because it is an issue that will not go away. Nuclear \nwaste is sitting in cooling pools and barrels all over this country \nfrom South Carolina to Vermont, from the banks of the Mississippi River \nto the shores of the Pacific Ocean. We must deal with this problem, and \nso that is why I take this procedure to make sure that we get it up for \nconsideration and for debate when we return from the Easter recess.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me say before I begin my remarks on a \nseparate subject, that the majority leader is absolutely right when he \ntalks about the necessity for developing a system of disposing of high-\nlevel nuclear waste in this country from our nuclear powerplants.\n  I, when I was Governor of Arkansas 22 years ago, wondered how on \nEarth we were going to deal with that. That was the reason I was always \nopposed to building more nuclear plants when we had not figured out how \nwe were going to decommission the ones that we had and dispose of the \nnuclear waste that was coming out of them. So it is one of the most \ndifficult, knotty problems I have ever faced.\n  I am ranking on the Energy Committee and we have wrestled with this \nat length over the years. This is no time to debate it, except to say \nit is one of the most awesome, difficult problems I have ever been \nconfronted with.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2629-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2630-S2631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               FORGO TAX CUTS UNTIL WE BALANCE THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my colleague in \nthe House, Speaker Gingrich. For those of you who think that I must \nneed a saliva test for saying that, here is why. It was earlier this \nweek in a press conference, that Speaker Gingrich made a very \nresponsible statement. He said that this Congress should forgo tax cuts \nuntil we balance the budget--an eminently sensible, unassailable \nproposition insofar as I am concerned.\n  I expected him to get the reception he got. Some of his very best \nfriends in the House jumped on him and said, ``You have betrayed us.'' \nThirty House Members sent him a hot letter, saying, ``What on Earth are \nyou thinking?''\n  I don't know what he was thinking, but I assume he was thinking the \nsame thing I was thinking, and that is that the snake oil of cutting \ntaxes and balancing the budget makes no sense whatever. We have tried \nit. Ten years from now or 20 years from now, when memories have faded a \nlittle further, I would rather expect people to say, yes, we can cut \ntaxes and balance the budget. But we are, really, only 4 years away \nfrom the end of George Bush's tenure as President; we are 16 years away \nfrom 1981 when the U.S. Senate took leave of its senses and passed a \nmassive tax cut on the proposition that if we would do that and \nsimultaneously balance the budget, which was at that moment $87 billion \nout of kilter, that we could balance the budget by 1984 if we just \nbought into this proposition that we needed to cut taxes monumentally \nto stimulate the economy.\n  But I am again happy to report to my colleagues I did not buy that \nsnake oil. There were 11 Senators--believe it--11 U.S. Senators who \nsaid, ``This is crazy. It will never work. It makes no sense whatever. \nIt violates economic principle, violates normal sanity.'' But we went \nahead and did it, and I will never forget that fall day when President \nReagan, at Rancho Mirage, signed the bill in front of about 100 \ntelevision cameras, saying, ``You have given me the tools. Now I'll do \nthe job and nobody will be left behind.''\n  Here is what happened. Twelve years later, we had accumulated $2.5 \ntrillion in additional debt to go with the already $1 trillion debt \nthat we had incurred during the first 200 years of this country's \nhistory--actually less than that. But from the date we adopted and \nratified the Constitution in 1789, until the day we passed that tax cut \nin 1981, the debt had accumulated to less than $1 trillion. Twelve \nshort years later, we had increased that trillion-dollar debt by $3 \ntrillion, and the national debt at that time then became $4 trillion, \nand we have been striving to dig ourselves out of that hole ever since.\n  Mr. President, 3 or 4 weeks ago I was walking out that door to go \nback to my office and one of the most conservative Republican Senators \nin the U.S. Senate, who happens to be a good friend, came over to me \nand he said, ``I'll tell you, Dale, confidentially, I've never seen \nthings better. The economy is as good as it ever gets. A lot of things \nare going right in this country.'' I almost fainted. I said, ``I could \nnot agree with you more.''\n  I sometimes wonder why people are not dancing in the streets. Since \n1992 we have taken the deficit from $290 billion to $107 billion in 4 \nshort years. The unemployment rate in this country is the lowest in \nyears. Some economists say you you cannot get it much lower than 5.3 or \n5.4 percent. Interest rates are at a manageable level. And this \nmorning, everybody who read the Washington Post saw a feature story \nabout how the deficit is continuing to go down.\n  Let me back up. The President sent his budget over here and he said: \nIn 1997, the deficit will be about $127 billion. It will be about the \nsame in 1998. This morning the newspaper reports that because of this \neconomy, enjoying the longest sustained growth since Dwight Eisenhower \nwas President, even CBO, which is very conservative in their \nprojections, says the deficit this year is going to be down to $115 \nbillion. But other very reputable economists say, no, you are \nunderestimating the taxes the people of this country are going to pay \nthis year because the economy is doing just fine.They say, we believe \nthe deficit will be under $100 billion.\n  I am the eternal optimist. I like to believe that last statement, \nthat the deficit will be below $100 billion, turns out to be true, in \nwhich case we will have done something that is unprecedented in this \ncountry. We will have had 5 sustained years of deficit reduction.\n  Do you want the economy to continue as it is now and have this \nsustained growth that we have been enjoying? I will tell you a simple \nway to do it. You send a message to the American people that the U.S. \nCongress has come to its senses, and decided to forgo tax cuts of any \nkind until the United States budget is in balance.\n  Then tell them, on top of that, this year's deficit is not going to \nbe $99 billion; we're going to further reduce it to $90 billion or $85 \nbillion. I can tell you, Wall Street will jump with joy.\n  Why would we be considering tax cuts of $193 billion, almost $200 \nbillion? Why would the U.S. Senate be considering a $200 billion tax \ncut over the next 5 years and $508 billion over the next 10 years? Why \nare we considering that when we know that a tax cut of that magnitude \nis going to stimulate\n\n[[Page S2631]]\n\nthe economy? And why do we want to stimulate an economy that is perking \nalong so well that Alan Greenspan keeps Wall Street on edge every day \nsaying, ``If this economy gets any hotter, I'm going to raise interest \nrates''? That is the constant threat every time the Federal Reserve \nBoard meets, the threat of higher interest rates.\n  You cut capital gains taxes, and I promise you it will not be long \nuntil you will have an interest rate increase from the Fed. You cut \nthese other taxes to the tune of $200 billion over the next 5 years, \nand I promise you interest rates will go up. Alan Greenspan will see to \nit. And if interest rates go up, the market will drop and economic \nactivity will drop. So why would we insist on making a crazy economic \ndecision to stimulate an economy which is moving along sharply?\n  I see statements in the press every morning of some politician \nsaying, ``Well, people know how to handle their money a lot better than \nWashington. It's a lot better to leave it in their pocket than send it \nto Washington.'' I understand that, and I understand that if you are \nlooking for applause, that statement is a good way to get it. But I \nalso understand that we have a golden opportunity that does not present \nitself often, and that is to honestly balance the budget and give the \npeople of this Nation a night's sleep like they have never had before.\n  The Senator from New Mexico offered two budgets this afternoon. One \nwas the President's. I said many times on this floor, I am not enamored \nwith the President's budget. I am not enamored with any budget which \ndoes not reduce the deficit this year and next. The Senator from New \nMexico is getting very close to singing my song. You like \nbipartisanship? You like for Republicans and Democrats to agree? The \nSenator from New Mexico probably is not trying to curry my favor, but \nhe is getting awfully close to doing it with his resolution which says \nno tax cuts until we get to a balanced budget using CBO's figures.\n  Mr. President, the Budget Committee has been deliberating, and I \nthink they have been making some progress, incidentally. They even \nthink they have the deficit down to $111 billion now, and if they are \nthat close, I think it is absolutely imperative that we improve over \nthe 1996 deficit by cutting it below $107 billion this year and below \nthat next year.\n  One of the things about the proposal of the Senator from New Mexico \nis that when we reach that happy day--when we are in balance--then half \nof any surplus will go to reduce the cuts made in nondefense \ndiscretionary spending. That is education, law enforcement, \nenvironment, health care, medical research. It is all the things that \nmake us a great nation. But the Senator from New Mexico very carefully \nhas focused on making cuts in nondefense discretionary spending. Well, \nwhat is wrong with asking the Defense Department to help out? Why in \nthe name of all that is good and holy would we, in 1996, insist that \nthe Defense Department take $9 billion more than they even asked for?\n  I sit on the Defense Appropriations Committee, and I am telling you, \nI get absolutely nauseated at times. You take the F-22 fighter plane, \nwhich we do not need, I promise you--and I am going to stand at this \ndesk and maybe lose another battle on the F-22--but when you start \ntalking to me about building 438 airplanes at $180 million each to \ncompete with a Russian airplane that is not even on the drawing board, \nlet alone being off the drawing board, and at a time when we are \nbuilding 1,000 advance F-18's which will be as good, or better, than \nany plane that could possibly challenge us for the next 20 years, and \nthen follow that in 2015 with a joint strike fighter--no, they want to \nfill in what they say is a gap with a plane, Mr. President, that costs \n$180 million a copy, 438 of them.\n  Would you like to know how much the estimated cost of the F-22 has \ngone up in the past year compared to what we were told in 1996? $15 \nbillion. $15 billion in 1 year. God knows what it will be by the year \n2006 or 2007 when we start building these airplanes. We will not be \nable to afford them, I can tell you that.\n  I am simply saying that we should look at what we are going to cut. \nThe Senator from New Mexico has a $100 billion cut in Medicare. And \nwhat about Medicaid? I do not know whether we are cutting Medicaid $9 \nbillion or $22 billion. You hear conflicting numbers on that, but bear \nin mind what these programs are. Medicare is health care for our \nelderly; Medicaid is health care for the poor, the most vulnerable of \nall our children.\n  Last year, we cut welfare recipients' food stamps, everything, for \nthe poorest people in the country, $55 billion. Mr. President, I am not \ngoing to go home and tell my constituents that I voted to savage the \nmost vulnerable people in our population, the children and the elderly \nand the poor, and that I voted to give the money to the wealthiest 5 \npercent of the people in America. And I promise you, if I were running \nagainst somebody that had done that, I could make that case in spades \nand be absolutely certain of my ground.\n\n  I did not vote for the welfare bill last year. I was one of the 21 \npeople that did not. You can call me a bleeding heart liberal. You can \ncall my anything you want to. But when this body starts saying the only \nway we can balance the budget is by giving the Pentagon billions they \ndid not even ask for and cutting Medicare by $100 billion, and \ndepriving the poorest children in the country of Medicaid to the tune \nof $22 billion, and making $55 billion in welfare cuts--you see, I \nwould have to say I never went to Methodist Sunday school as a boy, but \nI did. I believed those Methodist Sunday school stories about my \nobligation to my fellow man. You hurt your fellow man, you insult God.\n  So I am not going to do it, whether you want to talk about religion \nor whether you want to talk about common sense, whether you want to \ntalk about what has made this country great. One thing that has made \nthis country great is our commitment to the elderly. We reduced the \npoverty rate among them from 25 percent to 12 percent since 1950. We \nought to keep doing it. We ought to come to our senses.\n  I intend to sit down and visit with the Senator from New Mexico and \ntalk seriously with him about this. I am not negotiating on behalf of \nthe President or anybody else. But I want to applaud the Senator from \nNew Mexico this afternoon because he has made a very important \nstatement that a lot of people on that side will disagree with. But I \nthink he is on the right track. I think Newt Gingrich made a very \nimportant statement earlier this week, and I applaud him for it.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate having the opportunity to make these \nstatements. I have been intending to do this all week and had such a \nschedule I could not do it. But I am feeling better tonight about the \ndirection we are headed than I have in some time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nimmediately proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnominations on the executive calendar: Calendar Nos. 39, 40, 61, and \n62.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, this \ninvolves two appointments to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review \nCommission, a nominee to be a U.S. district judge for the District \nCourt in DC, Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, and Rose Ochi to be Director, \nCommunity Relations Service, Department of Justice.\n\n\n               nomination of judge colleen kollar-kotelly\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last night we finally broke through the \nstall and the Senate confirmed the nomination of Merrick Garland to be \na judge on the United States Court of appeals for the District of \nColumbia Circuit. During that extended debate on a nomination that had \nbeen delayed too long, I urged the Republican leadership to take up the \nnomination of Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly to the U.S. District Court \nfor the District of Columbia.\n  I am encouraged that those who schedule matters in the Senate have\n\n[[Page S2632]]\n\nheard our plea and are finally willing to consider this nomination, as \nwell. When we confirm Judge Kollar-Kotelly, we as a Senate will \nliterally double the number of judges we have confirmed this year--from \none to two. Unfortunately, there will still be 68 vacancies on the \ndistrict courts around the country and a record 24 vacancies on the \nFederal courts of appeals.\n  Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly's nomination was first received from the \nPresident in March 1996 and was previously reported to the Senate in \nSeptember 1996. This nomination was not acted upon before the \nadjournment of the 104th Congress. She was renominated on the first day \nof this Congress. her nomination was re-reported again without a single \ndissent from the Judiciary Committee 2 weeks ago. During that time \nthere has been an anonymous Republican with an unspecified concern that \nhas prevented this nomination from being considered. In other words, \nthere is an unspecified hold.\n  Over the last 5 years, the District Court for the District of \nColumbia has been at full strength with 15 active judges for only about \n6 months. The court has been operating with three vacancies for over a \nyear and another judge is currently absent due to illness. I understand \nthat the vacancies have been contributing to a rise in the backlog of \ncivil and criminal cases pending before the court.\n  The criminal case backlog increased by 37 percent in 1996. So much \nfor getting tough on criminals. We are fortunate to have senior judges \nwho were willing and able to pitch in during these vacancy periods. \nIndeed, senior judges recorded one-third of the total court time spent \nby all judges in this district from July 1995 to June 1996. In the \nwords of the court's chief judge: ``The Court cannot continue to rely \non senior judges to bear this much of the caseload.'' I agree.\n  I thank the majority leader for agreeing to proceed to Senate \nconsideration of Judge Kollar-Kotelly's nomination. And I thank \nChairman Hatch of the Judiciary Committee for pressing forward with \nthis important nomination.\n  The Senate has not been doing its job when it comes to considering \nand confirming nominations for judicial vacancies. I asked last night \nwhat justified the unconscionable delay in taking up Judge Garland's \nnomination, what fatal flaw in his character or fairness the \nRepublicans had uncovered? I ask those questions again with respect to \nthis nominee, a hard-working woman who has been serving on the superior \ncourt bench here in the District of Columbia for the last 13 years, \nhaving been appointed by President Ronald Reagan. The answer is the \nsame: There is no explanation why she was not confirmed before now. She \nis another of the unlucky victims of the majority's shutdown of the \nconfirmation process last year.\n  With respect to this nominee, I note that the ABA Standing Committee \nunanimously found her well qualified for this position, thereby giving \nher the ABA's highest rating. She has been an associate judge of the \nSuperior Court of the District of Columbia since 1984 and has served as \nthe deputy presiding judge of the Criminal Division.\n  Before that she was the chief legal counsel at Saint Elizabeths \nHospital here in the District. She served as an attorney in the \nappellate section of the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice \nfor almost 3 years.\n  She is a distinguished graduate of Catholic University and its \nColumbus School of Law. She clerked for the Honorable Catherine B. \nKelly on the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. She has been active \nin bar associations and on numerous committees of the Superior Court.\n  I thank all Senators for confirming this nominee as a judge on the \nUnited States District Court for the District of Columbia.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am not going to object to the \nunanimous consent for the confirmation of the nomination of Colleen \nKollar-Kotelly to be U.S. district judge for the District of Columbia, \nbut I would like it recorded that if we had conducted a rollcall vote \non the nominee, I would have voted in the negative.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the nominations \nbe confirmed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, any \nstatements relating to the nominations appear at the appropriate place \nin the Record, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction, and the Senate then return to legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nominations were confirmed as follows:\n\n\n                             the judiciary\n\n       Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, of the District of Columbia, to be \n     U.S. District Judge for the District of Columbia.\n\n\n                         department of justice\n\n       Rose Ochi, of California, to be Director, Community \n     Relations Service, for a term of 4 years.\n\n\n            federal mine safety and health review commission\n\n       Mary Lucille Jordan, of Maryland, to be a Member of the \n     Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission for a term \n     of 6 years expiring August 30, 2002.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about an issue that was \ntalked about at great length today in the House of Representatives and \nvoted on. That is the issue of partial-birth abortions, or as the \nCongressman who led the debate on the floor of the House, Congressman \nHenry Hyde, refers to it as partial-birth infanticide where, in fact, \nyou have a baby that is at or near viability in the fifth and sixth \nmonth of pregnancy when most of these abortions are performed, \ndelivered completely out of the mother, and all that is left in the \nmother is the head--what we are talking about here is not an abortion. \nWhat we are talking about is killing a child.\n  I think, incredibly, frankly, given the results of the last election \nwhere the Republicans lost seats in the House, and getting a sufficient \nnumber of House votes to override a--hopefully not, but probably--\nPresidential veto of this bill--we needed 290 votes. We thought going \nin we would be assured of that number. In fact, we thought we would be \nwell assured of that number, given the results of the election and what \nwe thought was the intention of the Members.\n  It turned out that the House passed the partial-birth abortion ban by \na vote of 295 to, I believe, 136. That is five votes more than the \nrequired constitutional majority of 67 percent of the House. So they do \nhave enough votes in the House of Representatives to override a \nPresidential veto.\n  The action now shifts here to the U.S. Senate. We are going into \nrecess and will be for the next couple of weeks, but I have had \nconversations with the majority leader, and we anticipate bringing that \nbill up sometime shortly after we reconvene here in the Senate in April \nand hope for a full debate on this issue.\n  As to what happened in the House, when we saw the number of votes \nchange, resulting in a sufficient number to override the President's \nveto, I hope that same kind of dynamic occurs here in the Senate. Those \nvotes changed because of new information that has been brought to light \nabout what actually is going on out in America on this issue of \npartial-birth abortions. We were originally told by the advocates of \nthe procedure, the industry and those who support the procedure, the \nabortion rights groups, that\n\n[[Page S2633]]\n\nthis was ``a rare procedure.'' That phrase was used over and over \nagain, ``A rare procedure.'' The President of the United States used \n``a rare procedure, done only in the third trimester, in cases where \nthe mother's life or health was in danger or where there was a severe \nfetal deformity.''\n  That was the argument and the reason the President vetoed it, and \nthat is why many Members of the Senate stood here and said they could \nnot find themselves in a position where if someone was in this kind of \ndire consequence that they would limit a person's option.\n  We had plenty of medical testimony at the time, and even more has \ncome in since, that says that this is never an indicated procedure to \nprotect the life or health of the mother, never an indicated procedure. \nIt is not in any textbook on obstetrics. You will not find it in any of \nthe medical literature. I am quoting lots of obstetricians who have \ntestified before Congress, including an obstetrician in the House of \nRepresentatives, Dr. Tom Coburn, a Member of the House, and C. Everett \nKoop, the former Surgeon General, who worked with small premature \nbabies. So we have overwhelming medical authority that this procedure \nis never indicated to protect the life and health of the mother.\n  But we also found out new information, that in fact this is not a \nrare procedure. This is a procedure that is done thousands upon \nthousands of times. The estimate given by the abortion providers is \n3,000 to 5,000 times a year. The only independent evidence we have been \nable to gather is by a press reporter in Bergen County, NJ, who \nsurveyed a clinic in her community, and in that one clinic in northern \nNew Jersey there were 1,500 partial-birth abortions performed every \nyear. Now, if there are 1,500 in one clinic, and we have another doctor \nwho has testified in Nebraska, Bellevue, NE--no offense to my \ncolleagues from Nebraska, but hardly a large metropolitan area--where \nthis doctor said in the last 2 years he has done 1,000 partial-birth \nabortions, if you just take those two isolated instances and the fact, \nas the reporter from Bergen County said, that this procedure, according \nto the doctors there, is done in other places in the New York \nmetropolitan area, but if you just take those two sites alone, it is \nvery hard to say we only have 3,000 to 5,000 of these being performed \nnationwide.\n  There is no way to check because the people who provide the \nstatistics are the advocates for the procedure. So, of course, they are \nnot going to give us the real numbers. They know that their Achilles \nheel in this debate, in the debate not just on partial-birth abortions \nbut, frankly, on all abortions, is late-term abortion. This is not \nsomething the American public feels comfortable with, but in fact, \nsomething the American public overwhelmingly rejects. They think that \ngoes too far. So there is really no reason for them to give us accurate \ninformation. When I say there is no reason for them to give us accurate \ninformation, it is because there is no way to check whether that \ninformation is accurate. The Government keeps no statistics on the \nnumber of partial-birth abortions. So there is no way for anybody to \nindependently verify this.\n  Now, I have asked many reporters who have covered this issue, ``How \nabout doing a little reporting? How about verifying your story instead \nof taking what the Alan Guttmacher Institute,'' which is an arm of the \nabortion advocacy group and is always cited in literature and in the \npress as this ``independent source.'' That is just ludicrous. They are \nan advocate, a zealous advocate of the absolute right to choose. So \nusing their information is as bad as using the providers themselves who \nare advocates of the procedure.\n  Now, some reporters have actually gone through the process of calling \ntheir clinics. We have gotten a variety of different feedback. I talked \nto a reporter from the Baltimore Sun who said she called some of the \nhospitals and clinics in Baltimore that do abortions, and they hung up \nthe phone on her. They didn't want to talk to the press. It is none of \ntheir business. Others have said they have called and had nice \nconversations and were told, ``We don't do that here.'' They very well \nmay not do it, but we have no way of checking. The press has no way of \nchecking because they are not going to make their records available. It \nis confidentiality, and I understand that. But there is no way for us \nto know how many abortions are done, partial-birth or late-term \nabortions. You will have advocates get up for this procedure on the \nSenate floor and talk about this as being ``very rare,'' or ``only a \nfew thousand.'' Just imagine, put yourself in the context of children--\nchildren are used a lot on this floor as a defense for a lot of \nGovernment programs.\n  Imagine if you were talking about 3,000 to 5,000 children who we \nwould let starve to death in this country; what would we do about it \nhere? Would we say it is only 3,000 or 5,000 who we are going to let \ndie because we don't want to take any action? I am not too sure that we \nwould do that. But, in fact, that is what we are doing. We are \naccepting their numbers, which I don't accept. I don't think, frankly, \nthe press should accept them. I think throwing this number out of 3,000 \nto 5,000, quoting an advocate of the procedure as the authority for the \nstatistical information as a basis for the debate--I mean, I will throw \na number out--let's say 50,000, which is probably as credible as the \nnumber you are going to get from the other side. It is probably as \ncredible, and probably even more credible because I am just pulling it \nout of a hat; they are deliberately throwing a number out that they \nknow is well below what the actual number is.\n  So I hope that when we have this debate, we realize, number one, that \nit is not a rare procedure. And, frankly, we don't know how rare it is. \nWhat we do know is that the numbers given out in the past were lies. \nLet's call it what they were--lies, a deliberate attempt by the \nabortion industry and advocates to mislead the Congress. They sent \npeople up here and they testified to that lie. So now we are going to \nbelieve them and give them a second chance to lie to us.\n  I am sorry. Fool me twice, shame on me. They are not going to fool me \ntwice. I am not going to accept their number, and I don't think anybody \nshould. They have no credibility because they have lied once and, \nnumber two, there is no independent verification of that number, \nbecause they will not open up their books. They won't even let \nreporters talk to them. So I encourage the press covering this debate \nnow, and who covered it in the past, not to use a phony number. As \nhorrible as that number is, my goodness we are talking of an admission \nof at least 3,000 to 5,000--3,000 to 5,000 innocent children, at least \n90 percent of which--according to their industry--are healthy babies \nand healthy mothers.\n\n  Frankly, even if it were 300 to 500, or just 30 to 50, it should \noutrage every Member of the Senate that we allow that to happen in such \na barbaric way. But 3,000 to 5,000--maybe it's 30,000 to 50,000; who \nknows? But it is not a rare procedure, and it is not done just on \nmothers who have severe health complications or life-threatening \nailments. We know that. One reason is obvious that we know it. We know \nit by understanding what the procedure is. The other reason we know is \nbecause we have all the medical experts testifying that this procedure \nis never indicated to protect the health or the life of the mother. But \nthe other reason we know that this procedure would not be used is just \nby knowing what the procedure is. Take a case. We have a mother whose \nlife is in danger. Now, I will add that we have a provision in this \nbill to protect the life of the mother. If this procedure is ever \nneeded to protect the life of the mother, it can be used. But let me \nsuggest that that would never happen. We have it in there, frankly, for \ncosmetic reasons. It would never happen, because if a mother's life is \nin imminent danger, would any physician use a procedure that takes 3 \ndays to perform? If the woman presents herself to the hospital in a \nlife-threatening condition, would you say, ``We have this great \nprocedure that takes 3 days to do; we will give you medication, come \nback in 2 days''? You would if you want to kill the mother, or if you \nwant malpractice, but not if you want to provide competent medical \nservices to a woman in need. So it would not be used in that situation.\n  Let's talk about the health condition. Again, if somebody presents \nherself with a severe health consequence,\n\n[[Page S2634]]\n\nthey could use their fertility or--to be honest with you, I don't know \nwhy someone would suggest that we want to protect ourselves from losing \nour fertility by killing a healthy baby. I don't understand that. If \nyou want to protect your fertility to have children, why would you kill \na healthy baby to do that? This is something that strikes me as an \nargument that I have not heard a sufficient answer to on the other \nside. Why would you kill one child so you could have more children? As \nfar as I know, there is no guarantee of being able to get pregnant \nagain. Unfortunately, there are tens of thousands, probably hundreds of \nthousands of couples who are trying to have children and can't. If you \nhave been blessed with a healthy baby and a healthy pregnancy, I don't \nknow why you would do this procedure. But the point is, you would not \ngo through this 3-day procedure if there was an imminent health risk to \nthe mother. It is just not logical.\n  This procedure was not designed by a physician who was looking out \nfor the health and life of the mother. This was designed by a \nphysician, in his own words, as a more efficient way to do abortions \nfor the abortionist, not for the mother. It is efficient in that the \nmother can come in and do it on an outpatient basis. Late-term \nabortions are much more complicated. It is much more involved. This \nbasically prepares the woman for a shorter visit to the clinic and a \nmore convenient way for this abortionist to perform the abortion and to \nbe able to do more of them in one day. That is the reason this \nprocedure was developed.\n  You will hear testimony of people who have written textbooks on \nabortion, who said they would never use this, and they do late-term \nabortions. So I just ask my colleagues to listen to all of the facts. \nWe had, I think, last year--and it was unfortunate, and I will not \npoint blame at anybody. I am not too sure there is blame. We had a \nsituation where the vote came up in an election year, in an election \nclimate. Members are people, too. They feel a comfort zone on issues. \nIt is very hard for them to sort of break out of this comfort zone into \nunknown territories, particularly around a very politically charged \nenvironment, even though the facts were there; many of the facts were \navailable for the override vote. Certainly, a lot of them were not \ngiven credibility in the mainstream media. Now they have been.\n  So I ask many of my colleagues who have already cast a vote more than \nonce on this issue to have an open mind, to step back and look at the \nreality of partial-birth infanticide and recognize your obligation to \nthose children, recognize your obligation to your constituents in \ntrying to ascertain the truth, and make a decision that is in the best \ninterest for America and for your State, not for the interest group \nthat supports you in your election, not for the advocates who you may \nhave good relationships with. We are in our comfort zone with people \nwho agree with us. It is very easy for us to sort of hang around those \npeople and sort of feed off each other. I understand that. But \nsometimes you have to step back from all of that. You have to step out \nin the cold and look at the cold, hard facts and make a decision using \nyour mind and using your heart on what is right--not what is right \npolitically for me, not what is right for my friend, but what is right \nfor our culture and what is right for our whole existence as a country.\n\n  I think when we do that, I think when Members take time to do that, \nwe will see something very special happen here, which is what happened \nin the House today. Members will have stepped out of that comfort zone, \nwhich I know is very hard to do, will take an honest look at the facts \nand make a decision that is right for America. That is my hope.\n  I am going to be working very diligently, and I know other Members \nare, in making sure that this information is disseminated.\n  I again encourage the press to do your job, fact-check your stories \nbefore you write them, and ascertain the truth. Do not just report what \npeople say. I know some people think that is their job. If that is the \njob of a reporter, then reporting has sunk to a new low in this country \nif all we do is run around and report what people say. That is not \njournalism, in my book. At least make an attempt to find out the truth. \nAt least check. This is serious stuff. We are not talking about how the \nSenate buys paper here. It is important. It takes taxpayer dollars. We \nhave a system. We are talking about very weighty issues. We are talking \nabout the issues of life and death, about a barbaric procedure that \njust goes beyond any vision that I can imagine that people in this \ncountry have of what our civilization and what humanity is.\n  So take that responsibility seriously on your side. We take it \nseriously here. I think, if you do your job and if Members of the \nSenate do their job, which is to honestly face the facts, allow those \nfacts to rebound off your sense of judgment, your sense of right and \nwrong, then I think what will bounce back is a vote to end this \nbarbarism in this country by an overwhelming vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2632-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  (During today's session of the Senate, the following morning business \nwas transacted.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2634-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2634-S2635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ACCEPTANCE OF PRO BONO LEGAL SERVICES\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on October 3, 1996, the Senate adopted \nSenate Resolution 321, which I introduced, and which had the bipartisan \nsupport of both the Majority and Minority Leaders. The resolution \nauthorizes a Senator to accept pro bono legal services when challenging \nthe constitutionality of a Federal statute, and then only when the \nstatute in question expressly authorizes the Senator to file such a \nsuit.\n  In addition, Senate Resolution 321 required the Select Committee on \nEthics to establish regulations providing for the public disclosure of \ninformation relating to the acceptance of pro bono legal services \nperformed as authorized by the resolution. Those regulations were \nadopted by the Committee on February 13, 1997, and were subsequently \nprinted on page S1485 of the Congressional Record dated February 24, \n1997.\n  Specifically, those regulations state, in relevant part:\n\n       A Member who accepts pro bono legal services with respect \n     to a civil action challenging the validity of a Federal \n     statute as authorized by S. Res. 321 shall submit a report to \n     the Office of Public Records of the Secretary of the Senate \n     and the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. . . .\n\n  The regulations go on to state:\n\n       All reports filed pursuant to these Regulations shall \n     include the following information: (1) A description of the \n     nature of the civil action, including the Federal statute to \n     be challenged; (2) the caption of the case and the cause \n     number, as well as the court in which the action is pending, \n     if the civil action has been filed in court; and (3) the name \n     and address of each attorney who performed pro bono services \n     for the Member with respect to the civil action, as well as \n     the name and the address of the firm, if any, with which the \n     attorney is affiliated.\n\n  On January 2, 1997, I, along with former Senator Hatfield, Senator \nLevin, Senator Moynihan, and Representatives Waxman and Skaggs, filed a \ncivil action in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia \nchallenging the constitutionality of Public Law 104-130, the Line Item \nVeto Act. That suit, titled Byrd v. Raines, was filed pursuant to \nsection 3 of the Act, which authorizes precisely this type of suit.\n  In our quest to utilize the best legal talent available, we have, in \naccordance with Senate Resolution 321, chosen to accept the pro bono \nservices of several distinguished attorneys. To date, they have \nprovided each of us with invaluable service through consultation, \nresearch, analysis, and legal representation.\n  At this time, I would like to advise the Senate that, as required by \nthe aforementioned regulations issued by the Select Committee on \nEthics, Senators Levin, Moynihan, and I have filed the necessary \nreports fully disclosing the representation which we have received. \nHowever, in an effort to comply with not only the letter of those \nregulations, but also with their spirit, I am today placing in the \nCongressional Record copies of those reports so that all Senators will \nbe thoroughly apprised of the details of this matter.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the two reports to which \nI have referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S2635]]\n\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 1997.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, last week, the Boston Globe carried a \nsuperb series of articles on poverty in the rural towns of western \nMassachusetts. The series was entitled ``Hidden Massachusetts'' and it \nwas written by two Globe reporters--David Armstrong and Ellen O'Brien. \nThese two have done an excellent job portraying the impact of job loss \non both individuals and communities. The towns in this area have been \ndevastated by plant closings and layoffs. Factories and mills \nthroughout the region have pulled out for warmer climates and cheap \noverseas labor. The jobs which remain are predominantly low paying. \nSalaries in the communities west of Worcester are dramatically lower \nthan those in the remainder of the state. With this sense of economic \nhopelessness has come increased levels of crime, violence and abuse.\n  These articles are a poignant reminder that the rising economic tide \nhas not lifted all boats. Similar stories could be told about \nimpoverished communities in every one of our states. For those with \nlimited education and outdated employment skills, the economic \nenvironment is growing increasingly hostile. The macro-economic numbers \nwhich describe a growing economy conceal a great deal of individual \npain and dislocation. As a nation, we need to pay much more attention \nto the disturbing growth in income disparity. The working poor are \nbecoming poorer, and the middle class are finding it tougher to \nmaintain their living standard. We must provide these hard working men \nand women with the tools they need to succeed in the new economy. We \nmust provide them with the opportunity to share in the prosperity.\n  I call these articles to your attention, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat excerpts from them be printed in the Record, because their message \nis a national one. The problems faced by the people of western \nMassachusetts are the same problems which confront us all across \nAmerica. We must make the American dream a reality for more of our \ncitizens. These stories are an important reminder that we have not yet \ndone so.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Mar. 9, 1997]\n\n                          Hidden Massachusetts\n\n\n      behind the scenic landscapes, on the back roads of a rural \n     Massachusetts, is a world of poverty and abuse, violence and \n                              desperation\n\n                 (By David Armstrong and Ellen O'Brien)\n\n       It's dim and stale in the basement lockup at district \n     court, the sickly yellow walls echoing the tales of a \n     thousand petty criminals who have sat here waiting to see the \n     judge upstairs. There are two cells, each with heavy steel \n     bars painted black. There are no windows.\n       In the far cell, on the edge of a wooden bench, sits a \n     stocky, babyfaced 11-year-old with straight brown hair that's \n     cut short. He stares at a concrete wall where someone has \n     scratched the words ``White Power.'' In the corner is a \n     shiny, metal toilet welded to the wall.\n       He is Chevy Van Pickup--so named because his parents \n     thought it sounded cool. He's here for allegedly mugging a \n     woman outside a package store in Athol, a small town near the \n     New Hampshire border where he lives.\n       Chevy already is the youngest child in the custody of the \n     State Department of Youth Services, the agency that oversees \n     the treatment and punishment of kids in trouble.\n       His rap sheet would be impressive if he were an adult, \n     never mind a child a decade shy of the legal drinking age.\n       Athol police first picked him up when he was 5 years old \n     (his mother can't remember what he did). When Chevy was 7 \n     years old, the youngest age at which someone can be charged \n     with a crime in Massachusetts, he was arrested four times--\n     once for attacking another student with a trumpet.\n       Now confirmed to a facility for young criminals in \n     Lancaster, Chevy spends his free time making cards for his \n     grandfather and trying to earn good behavior points so he can \n     buy presents for his sisters. For the first time, he is \n     learning how to read.\n       On the rare occasions his mother visits, Chevy repeatedly \n     asks for hugs and tells her how much he loves her.\n       Head west from Boston, past the pricey suburbs, beyond the \n     bustle of Interstate 495, and you'll find some of the \n     loveliest landscapes in New England.\n       But it's a cruelly deceiving portrait.\n       Behind the pastoral facade live some of the poorest, most \n     violent, most abused, and desperate young people in the \n     state. This is the hidden Massachusetts--the tragic, ugly \n     underside of a state renowned for prestigious universities, \n     famous hospitals, high incomes, and educated residents.\n       In many towns and small cities along Route 2, where \n     tourists crowd maple sugar stands, assaults are more \n     widespread than in Boston or Springfield.\n\n[[Page S2636]]\n\n       South of the Quabbin Reservoir, a stone's throw from \n     antique shops and Old Sturbridge Village, there are towns \n     with more high school dropouts, pregnant teenagers, and \n     families on food stamps per capita than in Brockton or Lynn.\n       And in parts of Berkshire County, where the well-to-do \n     spend summer nights sipping wine on the lawn at Tanglewood, \n     the rate of child abuse is the highest in Massachusetts.\n       Police and city officials in Boston, 80 miles from Chevy's \n     house in Athol, brag about a drop in juvenile crime and earn \n     praise nationally for their efforts. It's just part of a \n     steady diet of good news in the Boston area these days: Home \n     sales are up, unemployment down, consumer confidence high.\n       But police chiefs in many small towns watch as their crime \n     rates soar. Child protection officials may tout an overall \n     decline in reported child abuse, but in some places out here, \n     it's happening more and more.\n       People in these towns talk not of success stories, but of a \n     lost generation growing up without hope on the backroads of \n     Massachusetts.\n       ``People in Boston think I am dealing with Mayberry RFD,'' \n     says Southbridge Police Chief Michael Stevens. ``They don't \n     know anything. I've got big-city problems.''\n\n\n                      Passing time, making trouble\n\n       Before he was sent off to Lancaster, Chevy often roamed the \n     streets of downtown Athol. It wasn't that long ago that Main \n     Street pulsed with the comings and goings of thousands of \n     factory workers. On Thursdays, payday at the two biggest \n     mills, stores stayed open until 9 p.m.\n       Today, clothing shops and theaters have given way to human \n     service agencies. One of the remaining industries is the \n     casket manufacturer where Chevy's father worked before he \n     died. The buzz on the street comes not from shoppers, but the \n     ``benchies,'' teenagers who hang out on Main Street benches, \n     doing drugs and harassing passersby.\n       Teenagers in towns like Athol complain they are trapped. \n     They say there is nothing to keep them busy and no buses or \n     subways to take them to malls or theaters. When they quit \n     school or graduate, they quickly find out there are few \n     jobs that pay more than $6 an hour.\n       For some, making trouble is an easy way to pass the time.\n       It was three teenagers from Athol who captured national \n     headlines two years ago when they embarked on a wild spree \n     down the Eastern Seaboard that ended with the shotgun murder \n     of a elderly Florida man in his home.\n       In Greenfield, a 22-year-old mildly retarded man was slowly \n     tortured to death in 1995 by four men he considered his \n     friends, police say.\n       And last August, two teenage Sturbridge girls were brutally \n     beaten to death with a log, allegedly by an older man who \n     regularly offered to buy beer for young girls in town.\n       Many in Athol, a town of 11,588 residents, dismiss the \n     Florida incident as an aberration, pointing out that murders \n     are still rare and crimes committed by strangers an \n     exception. Residents of other rural towns make the same \n     point.\n       But clearly, life has changed.\n       Once cherished for their simple ethos of hard work, many of \n     these former farming and industrial centers are among the \n     most violent places in the state.\n       Of the 30 communities with the highest rates of assault, \n     eight are located along scenic Route 2, from Interstate 495 \n     to the New York border.\n       Some of the youngest children ordered into state custody in \n     the past two years come from similar towns just the other \n     side of the Quabbin Reservoir.\n       They include two 12-year-olds from Ware; two 13-year-olds \n     from Warren and West Brookfield; and a 13-year-old Brookfield \n     boy committed this June for possession of a hypodermic \n     syringe.\n       Ask anybody--a teacher, a cop or a social worker--what went \n     wrong and what can be done to fix it, and the answer is \n     always the same: The good jobs left and until they are \n     replaced things will probably get worse.\n       ``The lack of an economic future for these kids is \n     unbelievable,'' says Lynne Simonds, who coordinates youth \n     programs in the Central Massachusetts town of Ware. ``Look \n     around: They see what you see. People out of work, hanging on \n     street corners. They choose crime as a way to make a \n     living.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Mar. 11, 1997]\n\n                          Hidden Massachusetts\n\n\n    without jobs that pay a living wage, little will change for the \n               struggling families of rural massachusetts\n\n                 (By David Armstrong and Ellen O'Brien)\n\n       Although many poor families in Central and Western \n     Massachusetts are on welfare, most struggle to stay off, \n     working at low-paying jobs, creatively juggling their bills, \n     accepting private charity when desperate.\n       These are their stories.\n       HEATH.--Bob Tanner's day begins shortly after 2 a.m. with a \n     22-mile drive down unforgiving mountain roads to his job \n     sweeping floors and cleaning restrooms at McDonald's.\n       The trip is hard enough, but some mornings Tanner climbs \n     into his car and finds his fuel tank empty. The gas thieves, \n     armed with siphons, have hit three times this winter.\n       ``It's just hard times,'' his wife, Donna, says matter-of-\n     factly, grimly acknowledging that those who steal gas from \n     struggling families are also hurting.\n       Bob, who recently turned 44, takes home about $180 a week, \n     after $60 a week is deducted for health insurance. It is the \n     only income for the couple and their two children.\n       The commute alone costs $50 a week in gas, and their rent \n     is $100 a week.\n       ``Sometimes I'm just worn out,'' Donna says of the constant \n     struggle to pay bills and buy the basics, like food. ``ninety \n     percent of the people out here die from stress.''\n       The Tanners live with Donna's mother in a home that sags \n     under the burden of long winters and years of neglect. The \n     only heat comes from a wood stove in the front room. The \n     homemade stove was crafted from a 50-gallon oil drum.\n       Wood is the primary or only source of heat in many homes \n     throughout the hill towns near the Vermont and New Hampshire \n     borders. In Heath, 42 percent of the homes are heated by \n     wood, according to the US Census. The state average is 1.5 \n     percent. A third of the homes in Heath also lack complete \n     plumbing, the largest percentage in the state.\n       Bob cuts as much wood as he can in the spring, but he \n     usually ends up having to buy three cords each winter. In the \n     never-ending battle for survival, it is a major expense.\n       Bob has applied for other jobs, at Mayhew Steel down in \n     Shelburne Falls and at several businesses in Greenfield, but \n     he is not optimistic about improving his situation any time \n     soon.\n       ``If you don't have a good job now, forget it,'' he says. \n     ``It's getting worse. Every company is moving.''\n       The Tanners point to neighboring Colrain, where the largest \n     employer in town, American Fiber & Finishing, has announced \n     it will move to North Carolina next June. The town's second \n     largest employer, Veratec Cotton Bleachery, is also \n     threatening to leave unless it gets economic incentives to \n     stay.\n       Neil Stetson, 49-year-old pastor of the Colrain Community \n     Church and a native of Heath, said the scenic hill towns off \n     Route 2 in Western Massachusetts are filled with hard-working \n     people who lose hope with the departure of every decent-\n     paying job.\n       ``You can't eat the view,'' he says. ``It's a beautiful \n     area. I know that's what tourists see. But it's kind of a \n     facade of beauty. Behind it, there is much pain. With every \n     plant closing, the window of opportunity diminishes.''\n       Isolated by geography, families like the Tanners also feel \n     forgotten. They read about the billions of dollars spent on \n     the Big Dig in Boston and find it hard to believe more can't \n     be done to help bring jobs to the western part of the state.\n       ``Governor Weld and all of them never come this way,'' Bob \n     says. ``They forget the people here are helping to pay their \n     salaries.''\n\n\n                      familiar, destructive cycle\n\n       ATHOL John Guyer walks into his small, basement apartment \n     carrying a pillow and sleeping bag. It's 7:30 p.m. and he is \n     tired, sore, and reeking of chicken. He woke up before dawn, \n     sat or slept in a cramped van with no heat for two hours, and \n     worked all day at a farm in Connecticut before making the \n     long return trip home. His hands and arms are a patchwork of \n     red scratch marks left by angry birds.\n       The 22-year-old Guyer spends his day moving chickens in and \n     out of cages, giving them shots to inoculate them from \n     disease and slicing the beaks off chicks. Most of the work \n     takes place in stifling hot barns where it is difficult to \n     breathe in the swirl of dust and feathers. During busy times, \n     the grueling work can stretch nonstop over several days and \n     nights.\n       For this, John is paid $6 an hour.\n       He hates working with the chickens, but has been unable to \n     find anything better. From time to time he quits, only to go \n     back when he needs the money. He is deep in debt and behind \n     on the rent and almost every other bill.\n       When asked about the good jobs in the area, John ticks off \n     a few: Installing satellite dishes for as much as $110 a day \n     or building above-ground pools during the summer at $175 a \n     unit. These jobs are hard to get, however, and tend to be \n     seasonal.\n       In the not-so-distant past, men like John could find decent \n     paying work at one of the many factories in Athol. They were \n     the kinds of jobs that could support a family and provide a \n     comfortable retirement. But today, only one large factory \n     remains--the Starrett Tool Co., which employs 1,100.\n       ``For kids right out of school, there are low-paying jobs \n     out there,'' says Tom Kussy, director of the North Quabbin \n     Chamber of Commerce in Athol. ``We have plenty of those jobs. \n     It is a problem. We will never be the great industrial center \n     we were before.''\n       John is typical of a lot of struggling young men in Athol. \n     He dropped out of high school in the ninth grade and became a \n     father before he was 20. He and his 18-year-old wife, Sherry, \n     were married in October. They have been together since she \n     became pregnant in middle school with their first son, who is \n     now 3. They have another boy 8 months old.\n       The danger for John, say probation officers and police in \n     Athol, is slipping into a familiar cycle of excessive \n     drinking and violence that often follows the frustration of \n     working one lousy job after another or not working at all.\n       John has been arrested several times, mostly for minor \n     incidents. In July, he was charged with assaulting Sherry and \n     placed on probation.\n       Despite a court order to stop drinking, John hosted his own \n     bachelor party in October. Police found him sitting with \n     friends in\n\n[[Page S2637]]\n\n     the smoke-filled living room of his apartment. In a chair in \n     the corner, Sherry fed their baby a bottle. John admitted \n     drinking a few beers that night and was ordered into alcohol \n     counseling sessions, which he reluctantly attends.\n       John recently quit the chicken job again. He is working 20 \n     hours a week for $6.50 an hour at a Shell station in Gardner, \n     15 miles away.\n       As bad as things are now, some worry it could get worse in \n     Athol. There are whispers about Starrett's moving south, like \n     so many of the other factories that once made this a vibrant \n     industrial center.\n       Douglas R. Starrett, the company's CEO, has heard the \n     rumors and is the first to admit Athol would be \n     ``devastated'' if his company left. Nonetheless, he offers no \n     guarantees.\n       ``I can't say we will never do anything, but we want to \n     stay here,'' says Starrett, who is 76 and a lifelong \n     resident. ``A lot of people see a gritty mill town, but that \n     is not what I see. It is a great place * * * made on the wood \n     stove.\n       One of her children jokes about being able to make \n     ``welfare casserole'' again: macaroni and cheese, a can of \n     tuna fish and cream of mushroom soup.\n       Although the family is not on welfare, they subsist \n     entirely on government benefits and the generosity of local \n     charities.\n       There is $212 a month in food stamps, $1,135 a month in \n     disability payments, $106 every other week in veterans' \n     benefits, $325 each winter in fuel assistance, and clothes \n     and food baskets form the Clothing Collaborative in nearby \n     Orange. All the children receive free or reduced-priced \n     lunches at school.\n       Only one member of the family has health insurance and that \n     is provided by the publicly funded MassHealth plan.\n       Cindy worked for a time last year as a store clerk in \n     nearby Winchester, N.H., at $6 an hour, but says she quit \n     because her son was having problems at school.\n       The Sheffields are one of thousands of families barely \n     surviving in the hill towns of Central and Western \n     Massachusetts.\n       ``People have no idea this town exists,'' Cindy says. ``You \n     say Warwick and they say, `Warwick, Rhode Island?' ''\n       Warick sits about five miles north of Route 2 between Athol \n     and Greenfield. It is a town of fewer than 1,000 people with \n     no industry. The only store in town recently went out of \n     business.\n       The Sheffields live up a steep, dirt road in a house built \n     by Cindy's husband, Bob, who collects disability payments for \n     mental illness. The interior was never finished, and Cindy \n     doubts they will ever have enough money to cover the plywood \n     floors.\n       While the long country roads in Warwick recall another era, \n     the scene inside Cindy's home is decidedly modern and \n     chaotic.\n       Her oldest son, Donald, just had a baby with his 15-year-\n     old girlfriend; all three are living in the home. There are \n     Cindy's other children, a 10-year-old son and 12-year-old \n     daughter, adding to the crunch are relatives from South \n     Carolina, a family of six that has returned to Massachusetts \n     to look for work and are staying with the Sheffields \n     temporarily.\n       Every day begins early, with the children getting ready for \n     school. The oldest are bused to Northfield, a trip that takes \n     an hour each way.\n       At 10 a.m., Cindy bundles up the baby and walks her son, \n     Ben Morin, to the elementary school nearly two miles away. \n     Cindy recently bought a car, but has no money to register or \n     insure it. At noon, the three of them make the return trip, \n     either on foot or in the car of a school employee.\n       They walk because Ben is not allowed on the school bus and \n     only allowed to attend a special two-hour tutoring session in \n     a room isolated from other students. The arrangement was made \n     after he allegedly threatened to kill his teacher earlier in \n     the year, a charge he and his mother deny.\n       There is a telephone in the Sheffield home, but it can't \n     receive incoming calls and only toll-free and collect calls \n     are possible when dialing out.\n       A shiny satellite dish stands out among the abandoned cars \n     and furniture in the front yard. Cindy bought the dish after \n     a cable company employee told her there was a ``better chance \n     of seeing Jesus Christ'' than having cable installed in her \n     area.\n       ``We got to get something for the kids,'' she says. The \n     Sheffields couldn't keep up the payments, however, and the \n     satellite service was shut off.\n       Satellite dishes sprout like weeds in the yards of many of \n     the poorest homes in this part of the state. It's one of the \n     things social workers count on seeing when they visit.\n       Ray Burke, head of the westermost office of the state \n     Department of Social Services, says a former social worker \n     who left to take a similar job in North Carolina explained \n     there was only one difference between poor families in the \n     two states.\n       In rural Massachusetts, every poor family has a satellite \n     dish, TV and piles of cut wood. In North Carolina, every poor \n     family has a satellite dish, TV and air conditioner.\n\n\n                     should have stayed on welfare\n\n       Orange.--Tina Jellison works the first shift at Catamount \n     Manufacturing in this old mill town, stuffing plastic ties \n     into boxes as they roll down an assembly line.\n       At $6.83 an hour, it's a job that pays her only about $50 a \n     month more than what she received on welfare three years ago. \n     The paycheck is not nearly enough to pay off her debts and \n     keep up with the rent and never-ending bills.\n       Tina is realistic about the chances of finding a higher \n     paying job, so she turns to lady luck and the Massachusetts \n     State Lottery for help. She is a self-described scratch \n     ticket addict, looking for a big hit to turn around her life.\n       ``I started playing lottery tickets because I was desperate \n     to get out of the hole,'' she says. ``I've never hit on \n     scratch tickets and I've cut back lately.''\n       Cutting back means spending $25 instead of $60 on payday \n     for scratch tickets.\n       Tina, who lives in a second floor apartment in downtown \n     Athol with her two sons, ages 10 and 12, is not the only one \n     with lottery fever. In a town with one of the state's lowest \n     median incomes, residents spent $5.1 million on instant \n     tickets alone in 1995.\n       Tina is struggling to hold onto her job. Her two sons are \n     frequently in trouble with the police and forced to skip \n     school to attend hearings at the Orange courthouse. A single \n     mother, she never misses a court hearing or school meeting. \n     It also means a lot of missed workdays.\n       Then there is her car, an aging Chevy Citation with so many \n     problems Tina is thankful for each day it gets her to work.\n       ``I should have just stayed on welfare,'' she says.\n       But she plans to keep working, in part because new welfare \n     rules will make it difficult to begin collecting again. As \n     for those scratch tickets?\n       ``I could get over the hump if I could just get over the \n     scratch tickets,'' she says.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2635-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2637-S2639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NEW WELFARE LAW HURTS MENTALLY DISABLED IMMIGRANTS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, under the new welfare law, many mentally \ndisabled legal immigrants will lose their SSI and AFDC benefits. As a \nresult, some of these immigrants will be unable to pay their room and \nboard at residential treatment facilities. They may be forced to live \non the street, without enough money to buy their life-saving \nmedication.\n  Two cases demonstrate this problem. In the first case, Mr. X, a \nformer officer in the South Vietnamese army, came to the US as a \nrefugee in 1991. As a result of 12 years on the front lines of the \nVietnam War, and 10 years of torture in a re-education camp, he suffers \nfrom serious mental illness. At the age of 54, he is too old to start \nover, learn a new language, and hold down a job.\n  He receives treatment at a mental health center in California, and \nreceives SSI. If his benefits are terminated, he will no longer have \nenough money to pay for his treatment. He is studying to pass the \nnaturalization exam, but his memory impairment limits his ability to \nstudy.\n  In the second case, a refugee from Vietnam receiving SSI has been \ndiagnosed with schizophrenia, and relies heavily on medication. Without \nit, he hears voices, and cannot concentrate, follow instructions, or \nremember anything he learned. He receives $772 a month, of which $692 \ngoes for room and board at a residential facility. If his SSI benefits \nare cut off, he will be forced to leave the facility, and will be \nunable to pay for his medication.\n  Unless Congress takes action, these stories will continue, and \nimmigrants who need help for serious mental disabilities will be turned \naway from their treatment centers and residential facilities. I ask \nunanimous consent that two recent newspaper articles on this issue may \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        [From the Miami Herald]\n\n                          A Catastrophe Awaits\n\n       In the rhetoric of Congress, welfare reform was to push the \n     able-bodied off the dole and into the work place. In the \n     reality of South Florida's legal immigrants--those who have \n     met every legal test for being here, but who now are cruelly \n     to the rejected--it bids to push the aged, the sick, and the \n     disabled off their balance and into the street. Or the grave.\n       What awaits is a human tragedy. It is unwise, unfair, and \n     manifestly un-American. It will be felt in South Florida as \n     in few places in this, the nation made great by immigrants.\n       Maria Cristina Rodriguez is 76 and a social worker at the \n     Little Havana Activities and Nutrition Center. She now runs \n     six support groups for anxious seniors. She can't forget the \n     79-year-old woman who--as talk of benefits cuts rolled radio \n     waves last year--jumped to her death from her subsidized \n     apartment. ``Here I finish,'' said her suicide note, ``before \n     they finish me.''\n       Now the final countdown has started, and this kind of panic \n     is spreading. One day recently, 500 distressed seniors waited \n     for the local office of U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-\n     Miami, to open. There they sought succor. But little was to \n     be had, Congress had spoken.\n\n[[Page S2638]]\n\n       Social-service agencies already are feeling the rising tide \n     of dread and demand. At the Little Havana Center, two 80-\n     year-old women walked in with a written suicide pact. With no \n     family to turn to, and facing loss of their Supplemental \n     Security Income--their sole means of living--they thought it \n     best to kill themselves. Heed that, Congress.\n       Would that this panic were overblown. It is not. Thanks to \n     last year's welfare-reform law, legal immigrants who are \n     destitute, sick, or aged will lose their federal assistance \n     beginning in August. Florida expects 115,000 immigrants to \n     lose life-sustaining benefits, principally food stamps and \n     SSI.\n       The numbers in Dade are particularly frightening. Here, if \n     nothing is done, 80,000 legal immigrants--nearly twice the \n     number of Dade's U.S.-citizen ``welfare moms'' who'll lose \n     benefits in the next two years--will lose there life-line \n     support. That 80,000 includes more than 40,000 who get SSI--\n     the cash aid for the most poor, aged, and disabled.\n       The new welfare law did make some exceptions. Immigrants \n     who worked in the United States 10 years, were veterans of \n     the nation's armed forces, or who were admitted as refugees \n     or granted asylum may remain eligible for aid. For most legal \n     immigrants, though only citizenship offers a safety net.\n       What the welfare law did not provide was any assistance for \n     those immigrants too old and infirm to document their work \n     history or other eligibility criteria. Not did it provide for \n     those already in the naturalization process. Nor did it allow \n     for those who, because of mental disability, are not legally \n     competent to take the citizenship oath. In this saddest of \n     categories, at least 5,000 immigrants will lose benefits in \n     Dade and Broward, says the Alliance for Aging, which \n     administers federal funds to 30 local agencies.\n       U.S.-citizen Floridians transitioning from welfare to work \n     are getting two years and job training before their aid is \n     cut. In that light, the transition time offered legal \n     immigrants--a scant one year--its pathetic. It comes at a \n     time when the Miami Immigration and Naturalization Service \n     office has 90,000 cases to process, and becoming a citizen \n     can easily take 10 to 13 months. So even if the INS adds 70 \n     new employees to process applications--a plan announced this \n     week--some legal immigrants could lose months of vital \n     benefits before becoming citizens and having their \n     eligibility restored.\n       Picture Dade (and to a lesser extent Broward) after August. \n     Elderly legal immigrants evicted and homeless. Anxiety-\n     provoked deaths and disease. Overwhelmed families and social-\n     services agencies. For the economy, the loss of $200 to $300 \n     million annually. It is a book of tragedy waiting to be \n     written not in chapters, but in paragraphs--each representing \n     a single, undeserved, preventable human tragedy.\n       Many Floridians express concern, but few so far have taken \n     meaningful action. Some legislators have been searching for \n     solutions in Tallahassee and Washington. Governor Chiles has \n     been pressing for federal fixes as well. Area agencies are \n     cooperating in trying to think the unthinkable. Catholic \n     Charities of the Archdiocese of Miami, for one, has been \n     trying to raise funds for a massive naturalization and \n     immigrant-assistance drive.\n       Yet, altogether, inexplicably, with five months to go, \n     south Florida remains woefully undermobilized. (By \n     comparison, Los Angeles County, Calif, organized 200 agencies \n     and started a massive naturalization drive last October.)\n       Unless superhuman efforts begin now, there won't be enough \n     time to avert the human carnage.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Salt Lake Tribune, Jan. 27, 1997]\n\n After Decades, Uncle Sam Tells Elderly Noncitizens We Won't Help You \n               Anymore: Uncle Sam Rolling Up Welcome Mat\n\n                           (By Patty Henetz)\n\n       Federal lawmakers meant to be absolutely clear when they \n     ordered the end of public assistance to legal immigrants in \n     the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996.\n       Just look at the bill's name. If questions remain, its \n     backers will spell it out: Come to America. But never forget \n     you are a guest and must pull your own weight.\n       Rose Boyer assumed that responsibility when she emigrated \n     here from Lebanon 76 years ago. But the 92-year-old widow, \n     who has been in nursing homes for the past 30 years, can't \n     speak for herself because she has no idea what is going on \n     around here.\n       Which may be just as well, since the letter she received \n     from the state the first week of December would have been \n     incomprehensible even if she did not suffer from dementia.\n       The letter said her medical-assistance case would be closed \n     as of Dec. 31, 1996. Under new federal regulations, she is \n     not qualified to receive Medicaid benefits. The $2,700 her \n     nursing home received each month for her care would cease. \n     Incredibly, the government appeared to be telling her it was \n     time she quit shirking her responsibilities.\n       At the same time, state Humane Services Director Robin \n     Arnold-Williams alerted Gov. Mike Leavitt that Boyer was \n     likely to lose her aid, as could several others. The governor \n     vowed to protect her--at least until August. ``He isn't going \n     to kick people out on the street because there was a line in \n     the regulation that said we had to,'' says Leavitt \n     spokeswoman Vicki Varela.\n       So now, no legal immigrants will lose their Medicaid \n     protections. And if Leavitt, state humane services officials, \n     the immigrants' families and friends have their way, no one \n     will--even though on its face the federal law would have done \n     it otherwise.\n       Rose Boyer's husband was naturalized in 1939 and died in \n     1946. She reared nine children, all U.S. citizens. She has \n     outlived one of them. Her youngest living child, Sandy \n     resident Louis Boyer, is 59. Her oldest son is retired and \n     ill; another lives on his Social Security payment of $500 per \n     month. The other three sons have diabetes. One has lost two \n     legs, another has lost one leg, and all three were blinded by \n     their disease. One daughter is a retired maid who can't walk \n     much anymore; the other daughter, a 61-year-old clerical \n     worker who wants to retire, also has difficulty walking.\n       Louis Boyer helps out the five siblings who live in Utah.\n       ``I try to do what I can,'' he says. ``I could pay for her \n     keep, but then I would be in trouble. Our family has a lot of \n     problems, but so far our mother is the only one on welfare. \n     It was a big shock to me when they said they were going to \n     kick her out.''\n       Kris Mosley, Murray Care Center's social worker, was beyond \n     shock. ``I was furious,'' she says. ``I was screaming mad. \n     Who would want to discharge this little lady who can't walk, \n     can't talk, who can barely feed herself?''\n       It may be difficult for affected families to take much \n     comfort in this, but Utah is getting off easy. The federal \n     welfare cuts are hammering more populous states, particularly \n     those on the coasts.\n       Nationwide, 250,000 elderly immigrants are expected to lose \n     their food-stamp allotments. About 500,000 legal noncitizens, \n     the vast majority of them elderly, will lose their \n     Supplemental Security Income benefits. SSI is paid to \n     qualified people with severe disabilities. In California \n     alone, about 390,000 of the 2.7 million on Aid to Families \n     with Dependent Children are legal noncitizens.\n       Utah officials are optimistic that few residents here will \n     be hurt by the new restrictions because the state can decide \n     whether to continue some benefits. Leaders are working to \n     avoid harming noncitizens who are in the country legally, \n     especially the most vulnerable elders on Medicaid.\n       Last fall, the Utah departments of Health and Human \n     Services surveyed the rolls of legal noncitizens receiving \n     Medicaid and found that as many as 250 could be in jeopardy. \n     They examined ways to keep from cutting benefits and reduced \n     that list to 10 names. Further culling left only three people \n     ineligible for Medicaid, says Michael Diely, director of the \n     state Health Department's division of health-care financing. \n     Two are in nursing homes, one is at the state training \n     center.\n       Legal noncitizens who receive food stamps will lose that \n     benefit April 1, and the state is not allowed to do anything \n     to continue it. Some 1,900 Utah legal noncitizens receiving \n     SSI are now under review; because SSI eligibility \n     requirements have become increasingly strict under the \n     reforms, hundreds stand to lose their disability pay.\n       The Utah Legislature this session will consider a bill, the \n     Family Employment Program Bill, sponsored by Rep. Lloyd \n     Frandsen, R-South Jordan, that could provide noncitizen legal \n     residents with cash payments. And Leavitt has been asked to \n     take part in related negotiations with federal leaders during \n     the National Governors Association meeting next month.\n       ``The whole issue of having a handful of people that we \n     need to take care of and the possibility of more down the \n     road demonstrates the need for more flexibility from the \n     federal government,'' Varela says.\n       Many of the people affected by the reforms are noncitizens \n     who have not bothered to become naturalized. They are known \n     as PRUCOLS, or people residing in the country under color of \n     law. The Immigration and Naturalization Service knows and has \n     known they are here, but has made no move to deport them. \n     This group includes those who came to the country on \n     temporary or student visas and never left. They work here, \n     have families and pay taxes, have stayed beyond their legal \n     limit but have not been deemed illegal. Many of them are old, \n     and now, most of them are scared.\n       Lorena Riffo, who heads the state Office of Hispanic \n     Affairs, says she is working with the federal Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service to assist the many older legal \n     noncitizens who have applied for citizenship since the \n     federal reforms were enacted. It may be possible, she says, \n     to allow people older than 65 to take the citizenship exam in \n     their native languages and in senior centers instead of INS \n     offices, which could quell anxieties.\n       These measures won't help people who are incapable of \n     becoming citizens, such as Rose Boyer and Lia Andrienko.\n       Andrienko's husband was one of the millions killed during \n     the Stalinist purges in the old Soviet Union. After her \n     husband was killed in 1938, she was ordered to leave Kiev or \n     risk death for having married an enemy of the state. Her \n     daughter was 1 year old. For most of her life, Mila \n     Andrienko, now Popova, kept her father's history a fearful \n     secret.\n       In 1989, when it was possible, Mila and her husband, Oleg, \n     left Ukraine for the United States. Mila, who had been a \n     physician, now works as a medical assistant. Oleg, formerly a \n     civil engineer, delivers newspapers. In 1991, they sent for \n     Lia, who was 82 and without other family. She became ill with \n     dementia\n\n[[Page S2639]]\n\n     soon afterward. She would not sleep at night; her daughter \n     and son-in-law, who worked all day, stayed awake while Lia \n     roamed the house sobbing and tearing her clothes. ``For three \n     years, I did not sleep.'' says Popova. ``She did awful things \n     at night. I do not know why I didn't give her pills.''\n       Finally, the Popova asked the state for help, Andrienko \n     went on Medicaid and moved into the Murray Care Center, where \n     Rose Boyer also lives. And like Rose Boyer, Andrienko got a \n     letter in December telling her--though she could not \n     understand--that her time on American medical assistance had \n     run out.\n       ``When I received this letter, I cried,'' says Popova. \n     ``What will I do? I cannot leave my job to care for her. And \n     Kris (Mosley) said `We will fight. We will fight.'''\n       Social worker Mosley has been fighting since the letters \n     came. The promise Leavitt made to protect the three legal \n     noncitizens who otherwise would lose their Medicaid is good \n     until August. Mosley is on an ad hoc committee trying to \n     figure out how to extend the protection. ``One answer is to \n     go through the deportment process, with an attorney,'' she \n     says. A judge could find it absurd to send Rose Boyer back to \n     Lebanon more than seven decades after she left and issue a \n     `suspension of deportation,' which would allow her to stay on \n     Medicaid. Lia Andrienko could apply for political asylum, but \n     probably wouldn't get it, leaving the Popovas to pay for care \n     they simply cannot afford.\n       ``Their answer is not a pretty one,'' Mosley says. ``Under \n     all the guidelines, no matter what piece of paperwork I fill \n     out, I cannot change their alien status.''\n       Naturally, Louis Boyer is worried. ``My mother needs 24-\n     hour care. I wouldn't be able to take care of her,'' he says. \n     ``I don't know why she never became a citizen. She went to \n     school here, but never finished her education because she was \n     barefoot and pregnant for so many years. She must have \n     figured that with her husband and her children all citizens, \n     it was no big deal. She entered the country legally, but she \n     never had a green card. She has a Social Security card, given \n     to her in 1972.''\n       Popova doesn't know what is going to happen with her \n     mother. She certainly can't go back to Ukraine. For now, \n     Popova consoles herself with her sense of gratitude and good \n     luck at being in the United States.\n       ``Every time I am in the nursing home, I say, `Bless \n     America. Bless these people,''' she says. ``I am happy \n     because my family is happy here. I am an American.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2637-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2639-S2640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SPONSORSHIP STUDY SHOWS DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF IMMIGRATION LAW\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, a soon-to-be-released study commissioned \nby the Immigration and Naturalization Service shows that the \nimmigration law Congress passed last year will have a devastating \nimpact on family reunification--especially for working families.\n  Members of Congress may think they voted last year to put aside \nproposals to reduce legal immigration. But in fact, as this new study \nshows, last year's bill may have accomplished back door cuts that could \nnot have been achieved through the front door. The onerous new \nsponsorship requirements are likely to cause a one-third reduction in \nthe number of immigrants entering the United States to join close \nfamily members here.\n  The new law requires immigrants and US citizens seeking to bring \nimmigrant relatives to the US to meet strict income requirements. \nAnyone sponsoring an immigrant relative for admission to the US must \nearn at least 125% of the poverty level. For a family of four, 125% of \nthe poverty level is more than $20,000 per year.\n  The INS study examined sponsorship patterns under the old law, and \nfound that 29% of family sponsors had incomes below 125% of poverty. \nThat means 3 out of every 10 families who came here in recent years \nprobably could not have been reunited with family members under the new \n125% rule. In addition, 52% of immigrants who sponsored their spouses \ndid not meet the 125% income threshold. In other words, over half of \nall immigrants who brought in husbands or wives--the closest of all \nfamily members--would be disqualified if they tried to bring them in \ntoday.\n  In addition, according to the study, 29% of American citizens who \nsponsored their spouses earn below the 125% level. That's 3 out of \nevery 10 American citizen sponsors who could not be reunited with their \nspouses under the new law.\n  The new requirement hurts both working American families and legal \nimmigrants. As a result, large numbers of them cannot reunite with \ntheir loved ones. The new threshold means that the average construction \nworkers with two children could not sponsor their immigrant spouse.\n  We are talking about hard-working Americans and legal immigrants--\npeople who have played by the rules. I doubt that anyone in this \nCongress wants to deny American citizens the opportunity to bring their \nspouse to America or watch their children grow up here. But, that is \nwhat the 125% requirement does. It denies hard-working Americans these \nopportunities because the full time job they hold doesn't pay enough.\n  Supporters of the new requirement claim that the income requirement \nis intended to keep immigrants off welfare. But in reality, after last \nyear's sweeping welfare reforms, there is very little public assistance \nfor which legal immigrants qualify. They are banned from receiving SSI \nand Food Stamps until they have worked and paid taxes for 10 years--or \nuntil they become citizens. They are banned from Medicaid and other \nneeds-based programs for their first five years in the United States, \nafter which they receive assistance only if their sponsors are unable \nto provide for them. So even if their sponsors have only modest \nincomes, the immigrants they sponsor are ineligible for public aid.\n\n  I supported measure to make sponsors more responsible for the care of \nthe immigrants they bring in. But these requirements should not be so \nburdensome that they prevent American citizens from having their wives \nor husbands or children join them in the United States.\n  We expect sponsors to be responsible--far more responsible than we \nexpect ordinary Americans to be. We expect sponsors to do it all--\npursue the American dream, hold a good job, and under the new law, hold \na better job than almost a third of American citizens. The 125% \nrequirement contained in the new immigration law puts family \nreunification out of reach for many hard-working Americans and the \nmajority of legal immigrants.\n  In addition, the study found that the 125% requirement \ndisproportionately affects minority communities. Half of the immigrants \ncoming from Mexico and El Salvador had sponsors who earned less than \n125% of the poverty level. The same was true for a third of immigrants \ncoming from Korea and the Dominican Republic, and a fourth of \nimmigrants coming from China and Jamaica. So, future immigrants from \nthese countries will have unfair difficulty reuniting with their \nfamilies in the United States.\n  Supporters of the 125% requirement often point out that the new law \nallows low income sponsors to overcome the 125% hurdle by lining up \nbackup sponsors. What they fail to say, however, is that low-income, \nworking class sponsors usually have low-income, working class friends. \nAs a result, it is extremely difficult to find back up sponsors with \nincome sufficient to meet the 125% requirement.\n  In addition, because the new law makes sponsorship agreements legally \nbinding contracts, non-family members are unlikely to agree to \nsponsorship. Friends and family know that if they agree to sponsor an \nimmigrant, they can be sued by the federal, state, or local government \nif the immigrant needs public assistance. If the immigrant they sponsor \nis injured on the job and needs medical care, the back-up sponsor may \nhave to pay thousands of dollars in medical bills. Many families are \nnot willing to ask their friends and other relatives to shoulder such a \nheavy burden.\n  I hope that all of us in this Congress who are concerned about \nfamilies in the immigration laws will work together to revise these \nharsh provisions. There is no justification for this blatant kind of \nbias in the immigration laws, and Congress has an obligation to end it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a recent article from the New York Times \non this new study be printed at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 16, 1997]\n\n           Immigrant Study Finds Many Below New Income Limit\n\n                          (By Celia W. Dugger)\n\n       A new Federal analysis has found that an immigration law \n     adopted last fall will make it much more difficult for poor \n     and working-class immigrants to bring family members to the \n     United States legally, especially Mexicans and Salvadorans, \n     whose incomes\n\n[[Page S2640]]\n\n     are generally lower than those of other immigrant groups.\n       But Congressional sponsors of the legislation say their \n     intent was not to impose unfair burdens on immigrant families \n     but simply to prevent them from becoming dependent on public \n     aid.\n       The law requires immigrants seeking to bring relatives here \n     to meet income requirements and to make legally enforceable \n     promises to support the newcomers.\n       Advocates for immigrants say these restrictions are a \n     backdoor way to slash legal immigration in a year when \n     Republicans in Congress failed to reduce immigration levels \n     directly. They say it will needlessly divide hard-working \n     husbands and wives from each other and their children.\n       The law, which is to go into effect later this year after \n     regulations are finalized, requires immigrants sponsoring \n     family members for admission to the United States to make at \n     least 125 percent of the poverty level, or $19,500 for a \n     family of four.\n       Under the old law, there was no income test for sponsors, \n     just a requirement that incoming immigrants show they would \n     not need public aid. In deciding whether to issue visas, \n     consular officers at United States embassies overseas could \n     consider whether prospective immigrants had jobs waiting, \n     marketable skills, enough savings to support themselves or a \n     sponsor.\n       Preliminary research, sponsored by the United States \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service and based on a random \n     survey of 2,160 statements signed by sponsors of family \n     immigrants in 1994, found that about 3 in 10 of those \n     sponsors had incomes below the new standard.\n       Another study conducted last year by the Urban Institute, a \n     nonprofit research group in Washington, reached similar \n     conclusions. Its examination of 1993 Census Bureau income \n     data found that 40 percent of immigrant families in the \n     United States and 26 percent of Americans born in the United \n     States would not make enough to sponsor an immigrant under \n     the new standard.\n       Federal immigration officials refused to discuss their new \n     research, which had not yet been released, or to say whether \n     the preliminary findings had changed. But several people \n     familiar with the research--three who opposed the new law and \n     two who favored it--described the findings on condition that \n     their names not be used.\n       Based on the survey of statements signed by sponsors, \n     immigration officials estimated that roughly half of the \n     Mexicans and Salvadorans, one-third of the Dominicans and \n     Koreans, one-fourth of the Chinese and Jamaicans and one-\n     fifth of the Filipinos, Indians and Vietnamese would not have \n     met the new income requirements.\n       One opponent of the new laws who spoke on condition of \n     anonymity said the study showed that half of the legal \n     permanent residents and about 3 in 10 of the citizens who \n     sponsored their wives in 1994 would not have met the income \n     standard.\n       The cases surveyed included both immigrants seeking to join \n     their families here and those already in the United States, \n     who may have entered on student visas or illegally, trying to \n     become legal permanent residents.\n       In 1994, 461,725 immigrants came to the United States to \n     join their families here, according to Federal statistics. \n     Demographers with the New York City Planning Department \n     estimate that about 1 in 6 of those immigrants came to the \n     city.\n       But the new research comes with these cautions: the income \n     reported on each statement was not verified, and the size of \n     the families and the incomes they would need to meet the new \n     standard were difficult to determine in a substantial portion \n     of the cases.\n       Representative Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican who is \n     chairman of the House Immigration Subcommittee and a sponsor \n     of the law, said in a statement on Friday that he had been \n     advised that the methodology of the immigration service's \n     research was ``fatally flawed.''\n       New studies of the impact of last year's immigration law \n     are being scrutinized because the issue of immigration is so \n     politically charged and because legal changes so often have \n     unanticipated consequences.\n       Complicating this debate is the disagreement among experts \n     about just how much legal immigrants rely on public \n     assistance. The Urban Institute says that 94 percent of \n     immigrants do not receive welfare. George J. Borjas, a \n     professor of public policy at the John F. Kennedy School of \n     Government at Harvard University, using a broader definition \n     of welfare benefits, says that 21 percent of all immigrant \n     households receive some type of public assistance, compared \n     with 14 percent of native households.\n       Even with the data on the income requirements, it is \n     difficult to predict exactly what impact the new law will \n     have on immigration levels. For one thing, people who cannot \n     immigrate legally may come anyway.\n       ``The perverse effect of the law will be to encourage \n     illegal immigration,'' said Cecilia Munoz, a deputy vice \n     president of the National Council of La Raza, a nonprofit \n     Hispanic civil rights organization. ``The ties between \n     families are probably stronger than our laws.''\n       All immigrants seeking to join their families will need a \n     sponsor when the law takes effect; the old law did not \n     require a sponsor for those who convinced officials that they \n     could support themselves. About one-quarter of the immigrants \n     who joined their families in 1994 had no sponsor, according \n     to the new research, and it is not possible to determine how \n     they would have fared under the new law.\n       In addition, under the new law, sponsors who do not meet \n     the new income standards will be allowed to recruit a friend \n     or other relative who does earn enough to sign a statement in \n     their stead, promising to support the new immigrant if \n     necessary.\n       That may enable more people to bring in relatives, although \n     another provision of the law is already discouraging some \n     close family members, not to mention friends, from signing \n     such legally binding statements, immigration lawyers say.\n       In the past, such promises have generally been found \n     unenforceable in the courts, but the new law specifically \n     empowers Federal, state and local governments to sue sponsors \n     of immigrants who wind up on public assistance. It also \n     allows immigrants to sue their sponsors for support. The \n     sponsor is responsible until the immigrant becomes a citizen \n     or has been working and paying taxes for 10 years.\n       Ana C. Zigal, an immigration lawyer in Baltimore, said she \n     represents a young college student married to an illegal \n     Mexican immigrant who installs air-conditioners for a living. \n     The student, who works as a sales clerk in a department \n     store, does not make enough to sponsor her husband and her \n     father is ``very scared'' about signing a statement promising \n     to support his son-in-law if necessary, Mr. Zigal said.\n       ``What if that kid has a car accident that leaves him a \n     paraplegic?'' Ms. Zigal said. ``The father is weighing his \n     daughter's happiness against these future unknowns.''\n       The new requirements continue to stir debate about the \n     purpose of immigration to the United States. Groups that \n     favor more restrictive policies, like the Federation for \n     American Immigration Reform, contend the law will help keep \n     out those who cannot support themselves.\n       ``We don't need to import a poverty class into this \n     country,'' John L. Martin, special projects director at the \n     federation, said.\n       But advocates for immigrants say the new law runs counter \n     to America's commitment to encouraging immigrants to \n     reconstruct their close families here.\n       ``The new law will mean that literally thousands of U.S. \n     citizens and lawful permanent residents won't be able to \n     reunite with their spouses, children and other family \n     members,'' said Jeanne A. Butterfield, executive director of \n     the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2639-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2640-S2641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN RECOGNITION OF PAUL HOSHIKO\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fine \nAmerican, a great father and a good friend, Paul Hoshiko of Eaton, \nColorado. Paul recently passed away, but left behind him a legacy of \naccomplishment and achievement that deserves to be recognized by all \nAmericans.\n  To many, Paul Hoshiko was known as a leader in the agricultural \narena. To others he was known for his civic involvement and his \ndonation of time and money for various charities. I knew him not only \nin those regards, but also as a moral man who put his family first; who \nhad a deep and abiding faith in his God; and one who was an unabashed \npatriot. But in all regards and to all who knew him, Paul Hoshiko, was \nadmired and respected.\n  He served on numerous boards and committees throughout his life which \nshowed his standing in the community. One of the most prestigious \npositions he held was his appointment by the U.S. Secretary of \nAgriculture to the Colorado State Agricultural Stabilization and \nConservation Committee. Some other organizations he was involved with \nwere the Extension Advisory Committee, Colorado Seed Growers \nAssociation, Central Weld Water District, member of Kersey & Greeley \narea Chamber of Commerce, member of Weld County Farm Bureau, Director \nof Lower Latham Reservoir for over 30 years, and the hospital \nfoundation, among others. He received countless awards from these \nassociations which illustrate his leadership and influence.\n  Paul was perhaps best known around the country as the ``onion king''. \nIn fact, his sole appearance on commercial television (at least so far \nas I know) was standing in an onion field explaining to a future U.S. \nSenator what it took, ``to be a good onion man''. He was elected to the \nBoard of the National Onion Association and served as president for \nfive years. During his tenure the national office was moved to Greeley, \nColorado. He served on the board of directors of this association until \nhis death.\n  However, perhaps most notable and dearest to his heart, Paul should \nbe recognized for his lifelong devotion to the 4-H program. He actively \nparticipated in this organization his entire life, both as a member and \nas a leader. He was continuously taking strides to\n\n[[Page S2641]]\n\nmake 4-H an astronomical success, including but not limited to his \nactive involvement in the International Farm Youth Exchange program, \nthe National Western Stock Show, an annual State 4-H golf tournament, \nand a 4-H lighted softball field. He made a tremendous impact on those \nlives he touched while partaking in the 4-H program. His devotion is \nreflected in the faces of those youth who had the opportunity to work \nwith him in these projects.\n  In summary, Mr. President, as you can see by my remarks, Paul was a \nborn leader. He gave to his family, community, church and region \nunselfishly. He was the kind of man who only comes along every so often \n. . . and his life deserves to be recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2640-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, in any state, there are certain \nindividuals who make their mark in one or more fields, and in the \nprocess, they not only earn personal success, but they also make \nsignificant contributions to the place they call ``home''. I rise today \nto pay tribute to one such man, Edwin Craig Wall, Jr., who was a \nsuccessful businessman and civic booster, who recently passed away \nafter being struck by a heart attack.\n  During his adult life, Mr. Wall distinguished himself as a leader of \nbusiness and industry in the Grand Strand area of South Carolina. This \nregion is one of the fastest growing parts of the Palmetto State and \nrepresents a well developed and diversified economy that includes \nmanufacturing, tourism, and shipping concerns. Tens of thousands of \nSouth Carolinians are employed in good paying, secure jobs, and the \nrevenues that are contributed to our State's coffers from this area are \ncertainly significant. Without question, Mr. Wall helped to create this \nvery impressive picture of economic health that typifies the Grand \nStrand and Pee Dee.\n  Though Mr. Wall entered the businessworld with a tremendous \nadvantage, his father had built a very successful company called Canal \nIndustries, he chose not to rest on the accomplishments of his \nnamesake. Trained at the business schools of Davidson College and \nHarvard University, Mr. Wall was determined to find ways to streamline \nCanal and make it more efficient and profitable. From what I \nunderstand, he was more than successful in his objectives, as Canal is \nnow a world leader in the timber industry, as well as becoming a \nprominent company in commercial development in the Myrtle Beach area.\n  Perhaps one of the hallmarks of a good business person is how much \nthey give back to the community and state which allowed them to \nprosper. In the case of Mr. Wall, he was very generous in what he \ncontributed to South Carolina and he set an excellent example for other \ncorporate executives to follow. His expertise and insight were valued \nby many, and he served on countless boards, including those of Davidson \nCollege and NationsBank. He was a strong advocate of education and \nworked hard to ensure that the Palmetto State had a school system that \nwould guarantee that none of our citizens lack for the skills they \nwould require to succeed in life.\n  Mr. President, Craig Wall was a man who had a tremendous impact on \nlife in South Carolina, and though he passed away at far too young an \nage, his star certainly shone bright. We are all grateful for the \nleadership and contributions he made throughout his life and career, \nand his wife and children have my deepest sympathies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2641-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL AGRICULTURE DAY\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I would guess that many in the gallery \ntoday, and even some of my colleagues, are unaware of today's \nsignificance for rural America. Today is National Agriculture Day and \nshould be a time of great reflection and celebration for all Americans. \nIt is unfortunate that many in today's society are unaware of \nagriculture's daily role in their lives, but the fault for this may lie \nwith those of us in the agricultural sector who have not properly told \nour story. The significance of this day is held in the tremendous, yet \nquiet, success story American farmers have written in building this \nnation. Although our agricultural community is in a period of great \ntransition, there still can be no dispute--American farmers produce the \nworld safest, most abundant and affordable food and fibers. This did \nnot come by accident. American farmers, with a few exceptions, have \nenjoyed a positive partnership with their government. Congress has long \nbacked vital research, promotion and insurance activities for farmers. \nThese efforts, for the most part, need to continue in order to maintain \nour excellence. Just coming out of the 1996 Farm Bill, we should now \ncarefully evaluate our work to determine where our policies have been \nsuccessful and where we need work. Let's not forget that agriculture is \nour nation's number one export product, and in my state, is the largest \nindustry. My point is, just like a good crop, our agriculture community \nneeds attention.\n  Now, what is the future of agriculture? I tend to believe that our \nfuture is in trade and technology. We are strategically positioned to \ncompete and win on a world market. We are also leading the world in our \nag research with many exciting advancements on the horizon. Where we \nneed to concentrate is on the crafting of future Agriculture leaders \nfor America. In my state, the Georgia Farm Bureau, the Georgia \nAgribusiness Council and the state Department of Agriculture and \nUniversity, in coordination with others involved in agriculture, have \nteamed up to promote a program for future ag leaders. Program \nparticipants are selected for their leadership, integrity and \neffectiveness and are chosen in order to better communicate with non-ag \nleaders the many challenges facing agriculture today. This program was \nadopted six years ago and is called the Georgia Agri-Leaders Forum. The \nAgri-Leaders of Georgia are all standouts in various fields related to \nagriculture. They come from farms, banks, electrical membership \ncooperatives, commodity groups and other organizations with a common \nagricultural thread. These leaders should be commended for their \ncontributions to agriculture and their service in what should be a \nmission to better educate America on just what her annual harvests mean \nto our national security and health. They are the best and brightest in \nGeorgia agriculture each year, and I want to recognize them on this \nimportant day.

Mr. President, earlier this week, I met with Monica \nMcWilliams of the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition. She and Pearl \nSagar were the only two women participating in the Northern Ireland \npeace talks, so ably chaired by our former Senate colleague George \nMitchell, when they began last June.\n  The Northern Ireland Women's Coalition is composed of Unionist and \nNationalist women who have united in common cause for peace and for an \nend to religious discrimination in Northern Ireland. The Coalition \nserves as an eloquent voice of civility in an often uncivil climate. It \nis especially important that women's voices continue to be heard in the \nsearch for an end to the violence and a peaceful future for Northern \nIreland.\n  Monica McWilliams talks frankly and effectively about her commitment \nto inclusive peace talks and an end to the violence in Northern \nIreland. Speaking about the intransigence of some in the talks, she has \nsaid, ``We're naming them, we're blaming them, and we're shaming \nthem.'' She has called on the IRA to restore its cease-fire, and called \non the British Government to admit Sinn Fein to the peace talks when \nthe cease-fire is restored.\n  Monica McWilliams and her colleagues in the Coalition have shown a \ngreat deal of courage in their involvement in the political process. \nMs. McWilliams recently had her car vandalized, but as she bravely \nstated, ``That's okay, as long as there's peace.''\n  Mr. President, the Women's Coalition offers real hope for a better \nfuture for Northern Ireland. I ask unanimous consent that a recent \narticle about the Coalition which appeared in the Manchester Guardian \nin England be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the Guardian, Feb. 17, 1997]\n\n  Women All Together Now--If the Political Talks in Northern Ireland \n             Collapse, Will the Women's Coalition Survive?\n\n                          (By David Sharrock)\n\n       In its corridors of power, the political brokers of \n     Northern Ireland's future have weighty issues on their minds. \n     Here comes Monica McWilliams of the Women's Coalition, being \n     tackled by one of Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists \n     lieutenants. Constitutional reform? Bill of Rights? Cross-\n     border bodies? Well no, actually. It's about the trouser suit \n     she's wearing. Doesn't she realise that ladies ought to wear \n     skirts? It's not easy being a woman politician in Ulster. All \n     the main parties have them, but as the DUP's Iris Robinson \n     opined just three years ago, their role has been that of the \n     ``ordinary housewife'', more often in the kitchen brewing the \n     tea than in the conference hall making policy.\n       Not any more. When John Major called an election for May 30 \n     last year, a group of women got together and decided to enter \n     the fray. But if the political talks at Stormont collapse \n     under the weight of a renewed terrorist onslaught while \n     everyone awaits a new Government in Westminster, will the \n     Women's Coalition survive? It has been a rocky nine months \n     since the Stormont talks and the Separate Forum meetings \n     began, in many respects a baptism of fire for these women \n     with little experience of life at the political coalface. \n     Perhaps for that reason, the Women's Coalition seems nowhere \n     near as depressed as the other parties by the lack of \n     progress.\n       A sense of humour helps. Monica McWilliams, a senior \n     lecturer in social policy at the University of Ulster, and \n     Pearl Sagar, an east Belfast community worker, need thick \n     skins to survive the bearpit that is the forum, a body \n     boycotted by Sinn Fein and the SDLP. Ten days ago, for \n     instance, the DUP MP Rev. William McCrea told the Forum in \n     his best Old Testament delivery: ``As long as I live, I'll \n     have a mission, which is to teach those two women to stand \n     behind the loyal men of Ulster.'' So Sagar and McWilliams \n     burst out singing Stand By Your Man. ``He was raging,'' \n     McWilliams laughs, adding: ``You can be shocked by the abuse \n     you get. I had to ask the chair to call order three times. At \n     one stage, Ian Paisley Junior started mooing.'' May Blood \n     knows why they are treated like this. ``It's because we're \n     making inroads, they're threatened by us. The strange thing \n     is, I would know the DUP quite well, living and working on \n     the Shankill. Now outside they're one thing, but I can meet \n     them inside the talks and it's as if I didn't even exist. I \n     can understand where they're coming from, but you can't be \n     thinking like that now. They've got to realise that women \n     have as much part to play here and I think this is what \n     really bugs men.'' But it's not just the way they are treated \n     by their political equals that irks the Women's Coalition. \n     The media, they claim, aren't prepared to take them seriously \n     either. Last month, Blood, McWilliams and Sagar were invited \n     to Number Ten for talks with the prime minister. A half-hour \n     meeting ran on for an hour and a quarter. But neither the BBC \n     nor UTV in Northern Ireland covered the event. The Belfast \n     Telegraph gave it 300 words.\n       ``If it had been any of the other parties, they would have \n     been all over them,'' says Kate Fearon, a 27-year-old think \n     tank assistant director. ``The problem is, we tend to get \n     into the press only when we are being badly treated by the \n     other parties and it's easy to reel off such stories.'' They \n     are all frustrated at the lack of recognition they have \n     received for the behind-the-scenes work going on at the \n     talks. The confirmation of former US Senate leader George \n     Mitchell as chairman, for example, in a marathon session \n     running into the early hours of the morning.\n       The drafting of an ``Order in Council'' which could \n     immediately enact the North report's proposals on regulating \n     parades was another coup. Labour's Mo Mowlam commented: ``If \n     the Women's Coalition can produce draft legislation with such \n     speed and with very little administrative back-up, why can't \n     the Government?'' Blood thinks a major spin-off from their \n     party has been the promotion of women into public roles by \n     the other parties. Brid Rodgers of the SDLP has a much higher \n     profile now than 12 months ago, while women in Sinn Fein have \n     always been active but rarely received the recognition they \n     deserved. The loyalist Progressive Unionist Party even has \n     its own women's executive.\n       ``Iris Robinson's not saying `I'm only a housewife' now. \n     She regards and presents herself as a credible representative \n     of her party. And she's good in the debates. You'll find a \n     lot of women in the parties who may not admit it publicly but \n     they are saying privately, thank God the coalition came into \n     being.'' The greatest good women can bring to the political \n     talks, Fearon believes, is the ability to ``Untaint the \n     concept of compromise, because we have always had to \n     compromise. It's a dirty word to men.'' Compromise may be a \n     long way down the road, but there's one thing the men in the \n     other parties could do straight away to show they are \n     reformable. ``They've only recently been able to start \n     calling us the Women's Coalition, before that it was always \n     the Ladies' Coalition. They couldn't get their heads around \n     it. The only time they use women was when they prefixed it \n     with whingeing or whining.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2642-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2642-S2644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING ARNOLD ARONSON ON HIS 86TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am here along with a number of my \ncolleagues to honor Arnie Aronson on his 86th birthday, which was March \n11. Arnie eminently deserves his reputation as one of the greatest \nfounders of the civil rights movement.\n  Throughout his long and brilliant career, he has been a leader in \nevery stage of the struggle for equal justice for all Americans. Over \nhalf a century ago, in 1941, he headed the Bureau of Jewish employment \nproblems, a one-person agency in Chicago that investigated \ndiscrimination against Jews. There were no fax machines, no cellular \nphones, no computers then, no television sets--just one person with an \niron will to eradicate discrimination.\n  Arnie recognized that the plague of discrimination would not be \novercome unless victims of different races and religions joined \ntogether. As Arnie once said, ``the struggle for civil rights cannot be \nwon by any one group acting by or for itself alone, but only through a \ncoalition of groups that share a common commitment to equal justice and \nequal opportunity for every American.''\n  At that time, Arnie also formed the Chicago Council Against Religious \nand Racial Discrimination, a coalition of religious, labor, ethnic, \ncivil rights, and social welfare organizations. His organization was \nimmensely successful in addressing the problems of discrimination.\n  For over 30 years, from 1945 to 1976, Arnie was program director for \nthe National Jewish Community Relations Advisory Council, a coalition \nof national and local Jewish agencies. During this period, he worked on \nevery major piece of civil rights legislation, and every major civil \nrights issue. In 1954, after the historic Supreme Court decision in \nBrown versus Board of Education, Arnie organized the Consultative \nConference on Desegregation. This organization provided much-needed \nsupport to clergy members who were under fire for speaking out in favor \nof the decision. He coordinated the campaign that resulted in 1957 in \nthe enactment of the first civil rights laws since reconstruction. He \nwas also a leader in persuading Congress to enact the three great civil \nrights laws of the 1960's--the Public Accommodations Act of 1964,\n\n[[Page S2643]]\n\nthe voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. The \nlist goes on and on.\n  Arnie was also a principal founder of the Leadership Conference on \nCivil Rights. To this day, the Leadership Conference is a powerful \nforce for progress on civil rights precisely because of Arnie's \ninfluence and example in the 1950's. When others were seeking to divide \nthe Nation with prejudice and bigotry, Arnie was uniting the Nation \nthrough hope and opportunity. The statement of purpose he prepared for \nthe Leadership Conference has as much power today as it did when Arnie \ndrafted it in 1967. The statement reads:\n\n       We are committed to an integrated, democratic, plural \n     society in which every individual is accorded equal rights, \n     equal opportunities and equal justice and in which every \n     group is accorded an equal opportunity to enter fully in the \n     general life of the society with mutual acceptance and regard \n     for difference.\n\n  In 1985, Arnie became president of the Leadership Conference \nEducation Fund. Under his guidance, the Fund has focused on working \nwith young children to root out prejudice early and instill an \nappreciation for the diversity that is the Nation's greatest strength.\n  As we all know, the battle is not over. Civil rights is still the \nunfinished business of America. But because of Arnie Aronson, we have \nmade substantial progress. Arnie is powerful proof that one person can \nmake a difference in the lives of millions of our fellow citizens. It \nis an honor to join in wishing Arnie a very happy belated birthday.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor to wish Arnie \nAronson a happy belated 86th birthday and to commend him on his many \nachievements.\n  Arnie has been working for civil rights for over 50 years. He began \nat a time when help wanted ads openly specified ``Gentile Only'' or \n``Irish Need Not Apply.'' In the early 1940's he organized a coalition \nof religious, ethnic, civil rights, social welfare and labor \norganizations into the Chicago Council Against Religious and Racial \nDiscrimination. By 1950 he was working with Roy Wilkins and many others \nto organize support for President Truman's proposed civil rights effort \nand engineered the combination of national organizations that created \nthe Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.\n  He and the Leadership Conference were instrumental in the enactment \nof the first extensive Federal civil rights laws since Reconstruction, \nthe landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act, the fundamental Voting Rights Act \nof 1965 and the pivotal Fair Housing Act of 1968. They have been \ncritical to our civil rights efforts at every turn ever since.\n  The Statement of Purpose he drafted for the Leadership Conference \nsays a great deal about this extraordinary man and his dedication to \nthe rights of all: ``We are committed to an integrated, democratic, \nplural society in which every individual is accorded equal rights, \nequal opportunities and equal justice and in which every group is \naccorded an equal opportunity to enter fully into the general life of \nthe society with mutual acceptance and regard for difference.''\n  Arnie went on to help organize clergy, churches and synagogues. He \nwas a founding member of the National Urban Coalition and a charter \nmember of Common Cause. In the last 10 years, while well in his 70's, \nhe assumed the presidency of the Leadership Conference Education Fund \nand helped invigorate its educational and public service activities.\n  I am proud to call Arnie my friend and to take this opportunity to \nwish him a happy belated birthday.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Arnold \nAronson, a man that has spent his life working for a goal that is dear \nto my heart; an integrated, democratic, plural society in which every \nindividual is accorded equal rights, equal opportunities and equal \njustice.\n  Mr. Aronson began his work toward achieving his goal in a time when \ndiscrimination was overt and widespread in our country. Beginning in a \none-person agency founded in 1941 to combat employment discrimination \nagainst people of the Jewish faith, Mr. Aronson eventually became the \nSecretary of the Leadership Council on Civil Rights, an organization \ndedicated to insuring equal rights to all segments of society.\n  Under his guidance the Leadership Council was able to plan, \ncoordinate and facilitate the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the \nVoting Rights Act of 1965 and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. His ability \nto recognize the strength of building coalitions in support of a common \nlegislative goal was instrumental in the passage of all of these bills, \nand this belief helped assure that the tough decisions that had to be \nmade did not fracture the coalition.\n  Since 1985, Mr. Aronson has served as the President of the Leadership \nConference Education Fund. Under his supervision, the Fund has \nincreasingly focused on programs aimed at developing positive \nintergroup attitudes among young children. This focus has included a \n10-year partnership with the Advertising Council of America aimed at \ndeveloping public service announcements dealing with diversity and \nprejudice. As we all know, the children of today will be growing up \ninto the teachers, doctors and Presidents of tomorrow. Discussing this \ntopic with the children of today, should help us achieve our goal of \nequal rights, equal opportunities and equal justice for all.\n  Mr. President, while not a household name in the battle for civil \nrights, Arnold Aronson deserves our recognition and high praise for his \nyears of hard work fighting for civil rights for all. I remain hopeful \nthat in the foreseeable future we will be able to achieve our goal of \nequal rights, equal opportunities and equal justice for all.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to pay tribute to Arnold Aronson, and I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning \nArnold Aronson. For some Americans, civil rights is a cause. For \nothers, civil rights has been a crusade. For Arnold Aronson, civil \nrights has been his life.\n  In his quiet, effective, persistent way, Arnold Aronson fought the \nbattles that too many Americans simply talked about. It made no \ndifference whether the victims were Jewish workers or Protestant \npastors, black adults or white children, Arnold Aronson knew that there \nwas only one American dream and that it applied to all Americans.\n  Arnold Aronson has over the last half century worked with all the big \nnames in civil rights, Americans like A. Philip Randolph and Roy \nWilkins. But Arnold Aronson should not be honored for the big names for \nwhom he worked but for the countless millions who he worked so hard to \nhelp.\n  Arnold Aronson once said: ``The struggle for civil rights cannot be \nwon by any one group acting by or for itself alone but only through a \ncoalition of groups that share a common commitment to equal justice and \nequal opportunity for every American.''\n  For Arnold Aronson, opportunity knew no boundaries of age, race, or \nreligion. Opportunity was simply a principle to be lived and practiced, \nconsistently, lovingly, and most of all, together.\n  From his work with the Bureau on Jewish employment in Chicago in 1941 \nto his presidency of the Leadership Conference Education Fund for the \npast decade, Arnold Aronson has turned that principle of opportunity \nfor all into his life's mission.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of the \nfounders of our Nation's civil rights movement, Arnie Aronson on the \noccasion of his 86th birthday.\n  Mr. Aronson began his fight against discrimination in 1941. He headed \nthe Bureau on Jewish Employment Problems in Chicago, Illinois. At that \ntime discrimination against Jews was overt and widespread. Oftentimes \nhelp wanted ads stated ``Gentile Only\" need apply. Realizing that \nemployment discrimination was a prevalent problem that affected people \nof all races, he organized the Chicago Council Against Religious and \nRacial Discrimination, a coalition of religious, labor, ethnic, civil \nrights, and social welfare agencies. As Council Secretary, Mr. Aronson \ndirected the campaign that led to the first Municipal Fair Employment \nPractices Commission in the Nation.\n  He went on to form a statewide coalition, the Illinois Fair \nEmployment Council which initiated the Illinois campaign for fair \nemployment practices legislation. Due to his experience in the area of \nemployment discrimination he served as a consultant to other states \nthat sought similar legislation.\n\n[[Page S2644]]\n\n  From 1945 until 1976, Mr. Aronson served as the Program Director for \nthe National Jewish Community Relations Advisory Council, a coalition \nof national and Jewish agencies. He helped develop policies and \nprograms for Jewish agency involvement on issues of civil rights, civil \nliberties, immigration reform, church/state separation, Soviet Jewish \nemigration, and support for Israel.\n  In 1949, Mr. Aronson served as Secretary of the National Emergency \nCivil Rights Mobilization. This group was formed to lobby in support of \nPresident Truman's proposed civil rights program. The Mobilization \nconsisted of approximately 5,000 delegates from 32 states representing \n58 national organizations. At the time, it was described as the \n``greatest mass lobby in point of numbers and geographical \ndistribution'' that ever came to Washington.\n  In 1950, Mr. Aronson helped found the Leadership Conference on Civil \nRights, one of the nation's leading civil rights organizations. He \nserved as Secretary of the Conference from 1950 to 1980. In addition to \nbeing responsible for the overall administration of the Conference, he \nhelped plan and coordinate the campaign that resulted in the enactment \nof the first civil rights laws since Reconstruction, the 1964 Civil \nRights Act, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of \n1968. During Mr. Aronson's tenure with the Conference, he helped \ncontribute to some of the Conference's most productive years.\n  I could go on, Mr. President, for there is no shortage of \nachievements, but I think that these few examples are sufficient to \nillustrate what an extraordinary contribution Arnie Aronson has made to \nthe civil rights of our Nation. It is no exaggeration to say that \nmillions of men and women of all races--who may never know Arnie \nAronson--have benefited directly from his dedication and personal \nsacrifice on behalf of civil and human rights. He has made a positive \nand constructive difference for our Nation. I am pleased to wish him a \nbelated happy 86th birthday.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, it is time for attention to be given to \nArnold Aronson. Few students in this country, when studying Civics in \ntheir high schools and elementary schools, learn of the name Aronson. \nWhen they read about the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act \nof 1965, the Fair Housing Act of 1968, the Civil Rights Restoration Act \nof 1988, and the Americans with Disability Act--each in their own right \na high water mark for our Nation--they hear names like King, Kennedy, \nand Johnson--but not Aronson.\n  This is a lamentable omission for two reasons. First of all, none of \nthese landmark pieces of legislation would ever have happened if it \nhadn't been for him. Second, school children across the Nation should \nbe taught about the vital role non-elected individuals have played in \nour society, and the indispensable role of grass roots efforts and \ncoalition building--two pillars of our political structure exemplified \nby Arnie Aronson. Mr. President, this nation should understand that our \nlandmark civil rights laws were born in our Nation's communities, not \nin the minds of our Presidents. The truth is that the leadership came \nfrom the bottom, so to speak; not the top. The initiative required for \nthese fundamental shifts in our society were born in the hearts of \nthousands of individual citizens, each of whom reached out to their \nrespective communities, and were strung together delicately and \npersistently by a few motivated and foresighted leaders like Arnie \nAronson.\n  The reality is that Arnie has no one to blame but himself for his \nlack of notoriety. Arnie, as his friends and colleagues all know, shuns \npublicity with the same energy that some employ in its pursuit. But had \nArnie been a self-promoter, then he never could have satisfied the \ncomplex interpersonal agendas necessary to organize so many disparate \nviews, so many different goals, so many challenging attitudes. Arnie \nweaved together practically every major civil rights organization in \nthe country into the grandparent of all coalitions, and perhaps still \none of the most successful coalitions this century, the Leadership \nConference on Civil Rights. Some of the organizations that eventually \nfound a voice under his umbrella were in their infancy at the time and \nnow are household names; others had such distinct agendas that it is \nnothing short of miraculous that they were willing to lend their names \nto any unified cause. But Arnie is a master consensus builder, and he \naccomplished more than most people could imagine, by advancing the \ninterests of others rather than himself, by the practically unknown \narts of self-sacrifice and behind-the-scenes hard work.\n  By doing what he does, Arnie sets an example for us all. He has shown \nus what this Nation is capable of accomplishing, if it has the right \ngoal in mind, and the will to reach that goal. He is an inspiration, \nbecause of his tolerance, his eagerness to hear out views that others \nmight find offensive, his patience to find new, non-threatening ways of \nexpressing strong opinions, and his ability to harness and channel \ntremendous energy in productive directions. There are millions of \nAmericans enjoying lives and jobs and suffering far less discrimination \nthan their parents endured, thanks to Arnie.\n  Mr. President, Arnie Aronson should be anything but a secret in this \nnation. He is a role model for us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2642-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2644-S2645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PUBLIC CALL FOR CHILDREN'S HEALTH COVERAGE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last week, over one-half dozen groups \nrepresenting millions of Americans spread out across Capitol Hill to \nlobby for legislation that would guarantee every child health \ninsurance. Their message was simple: it is wrong that America, alone \namong industrialized nations, doesn't assure health protection for its \nchildren.\n  We in Congress should heed their call and work together to erase this \nignoble distinction.\n  Bolstering their message was the release last week of the Children's \nDefense Fund's 1997 edition of the ``State of the Children Yearbook.'' \nThe picture that report paints of the state of children's health care \nis bleak.\n  Every 48 seconds a child is born without insurance. One in every 7 \nchildren is uninsured for the entire year. Nearly 1 in every 3 is \nuninsured for at least one month during any year. Nine out of every 10 \nuninsured children is from a family where at least one parent works.\n  In announcing the results of this report, Marian Wright Edelman, \nCDF's President, succinctly sums up the situation. ``Lack of health \ninsurance is a problem we can solve right now and make a huge \ndifference in many child lives. The issue is whether we care enough to \nbuild the political will to do it.''\n  The effects of children not having insurance are well known to us \nall: Children without health coverage get less cost-effective \npreventive care, less basic care and more costly acute care when their \nillness is too advanced to ignore. Further, uninsured children are more \nlikely to suffer preventable disease and have trouble learning.\n  How can we reverse these trends? Proposals to address this problem \nare well known to all of us and simply stated through the following \nprinciples. First, make health coverage available to every uninsured \nchild through age 18 and every uninsured pregnant woman. Second, make \ncoverage genuinely affordable to all families. Third, give children \naccess to coverage that provides for the full range of health care that \nchildren need. Finally, build on--do not replace--the current employer-\nbased system, Medicaid and public-private initiatives in the States.\n  Advocates of guaranteeing all children health insurance are telling \nus to act bipartisanly. And there is ample precedent for bipartisan \naction on behalf of children's health. Almost every health reform bill, \nDemocratic and Republican alike, introduced in the 103d Congress \nprovided assistance to low-income Americans to purchase private health \ncoverage--most had special assistance for the cost of children's \ncoverage.\n  In other words, we have agreed in the past that children who fall \nthrough the cracks deserve proper health coverage.\n  Children don't vote; they do not sit on corporate boards; and they \ncannot argue their case on the Senate floor. But we have a vote. We can \ntake it upon ourselves to improve the lives of our children and their \nfamilies by making our nation's children our top priority.\n\n[[Page S2645]]\n\n  The public has taken note. Now is the time to answer their call. Our \nchildren deserve no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2644-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:54 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \npartially exclude from the gross estate of a decedent the value of a \nfamily-owned business, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n       the family business and family farm protection act of 1997\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am proud to be introducing the \nFamily Business and Family Farm Preservation Act of 1997, which will \nprovide urgently needed estate tax relief to our Nation's family-owned \nbusinesses and farms. It is no accident that this is my first bill as a \nMember of the U.S. Senate, for I fervently believe that small, family \nenterprises hold the key to our economic growth and prosperity and that \nGovernment policies must promote and not undermine their continued \nexistence.\n  Simply put, the extremely high estate tax rates make it very \ndifficult for many families to pass their businesses on to the next \ngeneration--the very opposite of what Government policy should be. \nAfter allowing for what is essentially a $600,000 exemption, an amount \nwhich has not been increased in a decade, the marginal rates that \neffectively apply for estate tax purposes range from 37 to 55 percent, \nhigher than any other generally applicable Federal tax rates. Adding \ninsult to injury, some of what we leave to our children has already \nbeen subject to income taxation, and the combined effect of income and \nestate taxes can be a tax bite as high as 73 percent.\n  It should come as no surprise that when a family business or farm is \nleft to the sons and daughters of the owner, the estate often lacks the \ncash to pay the tax. A 1995 Gallup survey found that one-third of the \nowners of family businesses expect that some or all of the company will \nhave to be sold to satisfy estate tax liabilities. That this actually \ncomes about is reflected in the experience of the inheritors of such \nbusinesses, 37 percent of whom reported that they had to shrink or \nrestructure the enterprises solely to meet estate tax obligations.\n  Mr. President, behind these statistics are the stories of hard-\nworking Americans whose life's work is dismantled by a confiscatory \ntax. One of those stories was recently told to me by Judy Vallee of \nCumberland, ME. In 1933, her father opened a restaurant in Portland and \nworked hard over time to expand the business into a chain of 25 \nrestaurants along the east coast. When the father died in 1977, the \nfamily was left with a staggering estate tax bill of about $1 million. \nLacking the cash to pay the tax, they had to take on partners outside \nthe family, totally restructure the company, and arrange to pay the tax \nin installments. Unfortunately, even these measures were not enough, \nand they ultimately had to liquidate the business at fire-sale prices.\n\n  Ironically, Judy Vallee now finds herself in the very same situation, \nbut this time as a business owner and not a potential heir. When the \noriginal business was liquidated, she managed to purchase one of the \nrestaurants in her own name, which she has now developed into a \nprosperous enterprise. Eager to leave the restaurant to her son and \ndesperate to ensure that history does not repeat itself, she has spent \na small fortune on life insurance to enable her son to enjoy the fruits \nof her own hard work.\n  Mr. President, jobs are the primary worry of Maine people, and often \noverlooked in this debate is the negative effect of the estate tax on \nemployment. Let me give you an example. A potato bag manufacturer in \nnorthern Maine, the area I'm originally from, has told me that he would \nbe able to expand his operation and hire more people were it not for \nthe money he has to spend on estate planning and life insurance. In \nanother instance, the owner of a Maine trucking company made the \npainful decision to sell the business to a large, out-of-state \ncorporation rather than leaving it to his children and forcing them to \nassume a large debt to pay the estate tax. Not only was he compelled to \nabandon what he and his father before him had spent their lives \nbuilding, but making matters worse, the new corporate owner moved the \nadministrative operations out of State, costing Maine 50 good jobs.\n  Maine's experience is common throughout our Nation. The Gallup survey \nfound that 60 percent of business owners reported that they would add \nto their work forces were it not for the estate tax. Two studies \nmentioned in a Wall Street Journal editorial last month quantified the \njob losses caused by this levy--one put it at 150,000 and the other at \n228,000. In a word, the harm is widespread.\n  My bill would give relief to small businesses. It would raise the \namount effectively excluded from the tax from $600,000 to $1,000,000, \nwhich probably does little more than compensate for inflation during \nthe past decade. While $600,000 understandably seems like a \nconsiderable sum, the fact is that many small businesses require \ninvestment in complex or heavy equipment which easily exceeds that \nthreshold. Referring to a machine essential to his business, the owner \nof a Maine sawmill recently asked me, ``What are my sons supposed to \ndo? Sell the debarker to pay the tax?'' There is no justification for \nthis legal Catch 22, under which the second- or third-generation \nbusiness owner can only pay the tax by selling assets essential to \nrunning the business.\n\n  My legislation would also lower the effective tax rate for the next \n$1.5 million from 55 to 27.5 percent and would increase from 10 to 20 \nyears the time during which family businesses could pay the tax on an \ninstallment basis.\n  These measures are not designed to provide relief to large \nenterprises. Rather, the beneficiaries, Mr. President, will be \nenterprising Americans, many of whom risk their life savings and work \nat their factories, mills, offices, and farms 7 days a week to build a \nsmall business, with the reasonable expectation that their Government \nwill let them pass it along to their children.\n  Prior to becoming a Member of the Senate, I ran Husson College's \nFamily Business Center in Bangor, ME. I would share with you two \nlessons I learned from that experience. First, those family business \nowners who understand the estate tax cannot comprehend why the Federal \nGovernment imposes a tax that undermines the very type of activity it \nsays it wishes to encourage. Second, many small business owners do not \ntake the extreme measures required to prepare for the estate tax, often \nwith devastating and totally unexpected consequences for their \nfamilies.\n  Why do I call these measures extreme? In the Gallup survey, the \nrespondents estimated spending an average of more than $33,000 over \n6\\1/2\\ years on lawyers, accountants, and financial experts to help \nplan and prepare for the estate tax. The cost is not only monetary, for \nthe average number of hours spent in the planning process was 167.\n  As currently designed, the estate tax represents bad public policy. \nIn my State, it is the 30,000 small businesses, many of them family \nowned, which provide most of the new employment opportunities, and it \nis these businesses which will account for two-\n\n[[Page S2648]]\n\nthirds of the new jobs in the future. By discouraging the development \nand expansion of family enterprises, the estate tax stands as the enemy \nof job creation and economic growth.\n  Mr. President, it is time for our actions to match our rhetoric. If \nwe believe in promoting family businesses, as we say we do, and if we \nbelieve in promoting family farms, as we say we do, we must change a \ntax policy which takes the family out of the family business and family \nfarm. Mine is not a call for Government assistance or for special \ntreatment. Mine is a call to reform an unfair, destructive, and \nconfiscatory tax.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBB (for himself and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 483. A bill to fully fund the construction of the Woodrow Wilson \nMemorial Bridge; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n          THE WOODROW WILSON MEMORIAL BRIDGE FULL FUNDING ACT\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that responds \nto an urgent situation facing the Capital region--the crumbling Woodrow \nWilson Bridge. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by my \ndistinguished colleague from the other side of the Potomac, Senator \nMikulski. The bridge is already a major bottleneck for travelers on \nInterstate 95, and in 7 years the current bridge will probably need to \nbe closed as unsafe for travel.\n  It is with this knowledge that Congress created the Woodrow Wilson \nMemorial Bridge Authority in 1995 to hasten the selection, design, and \nreplacement of the old bridge. The replacement bridge has now been \nselected, and construction will begin in late 1998 or 1999.\n  Last Thursday, the Washington Post joined the chorus calling for \naction to fund the bridge, and I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nthe Post editorial, ``Fixing a Dangerous Bridge,'' be included in the \nRecord. The Post points out that the Clinton administration's $400 \nmillion funding proposal is wholly inadequate, that it wouldn't buy \nthree lanes at yesteryear prices. I wholeheartedly agree.\n  So today my distinguished colleague, Senator Mikulski and I are \nintroducing the Woodrow Wilson Bridge Full Funding Act to ensure the \nbridge is completed quickly and funded without tolls. Our legislation \nauthorizes full Federal funding for building the new bridge.\n  This proposal is forward-looking. Today, area roads are already \nterribly congested. Only Los Angeles has more traffic. And over the \nnext few decades, traffic congestion is expected to increase by 70 \npercent. The Woodrow Wilson Bridge is a bottleneck today because it is \nold and narrow. Ten years from now we'll still have a bottleneck if, \nbecause of inadequate Federal funding, we're forced to put toll booths \non the bridge. We need full funding now to keep tomorrow's traffic \nmoving.\n  Full funding for the bridge is also important for the environment--\nthis metropolitan area has been classified by the EPA as a \nnonattainment area because of its poor air quality. Traffic congestion \ncontributes significantly to this pollution. For that reason, I've \nsupported mass transit initiatives like commuter rail service and the \nMetro system, higher fuel economy standards, alternative-fuel vehicles, \nand transportation alternatives such as telecommuting. These \ninitiatives, while important, are only part of the solution. We also \nneed to keep traffic moving to reduce the amount of time vehicles stand \nidling and adding to the smog problem in this region. Full funding for \nthe Woodrow Wilson Bridge replacement will not solve the congestion \nproblems in northern Virginia, but it will help.\n  Finally, my proposal is also reasonable. The Woodrow Wilson Bridge is \npart of the interstate highway system. Comparable interstate projects, \nincluding the nearby Baltimore's Fort McHenry Tunnel have received 90 \npercent Federal funding, despite the fact the projects are owned by the \nindividual States. The bridge, on the other hand, is wholly owned by \nthe Federal Government. Moreover, as a recent opinion piece in Car & \nTravel put it, the bridge is ``a major gateway to our Nation's \nCapital.'' It's time for the Federal Government to pay its share.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 483\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Woodrow Wilson Memorial \n     Bridge Full Funding Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) traffic congestion imposes serious economic burdens on \n     the metropolitan Washington, D.C., area, costing each \n     commuter an estimated $1,000 per year;\n       (2) the volume of traffic in the metropolitan Washington, \n     D.C., area is expected to increase by more than 70 percent \n     between 1990 and 2020;\n       (3) the deterioration of the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge \n     and the growing population of the metropolitan Washington, \n     D.C., area contribute significantly to traffic congestion;\n       (4) the Bridge serves as a vital link in the Interstate \n     System and in the Northeast corridor;\n       (5) identifying alternative methods for maintaining this \n     vital link of the Interstate System is critical to addressing \n     the traffic congestion of the area;\n       (6) the Bridge is--\n       (A) the only drawbridge in the metropolitan Washington, \n     D.C., area on the Interstate System;\n       (B) the only segment of the Capital Beltway with only 6 \n     lanes; and\n       (C) the only segment of the Capital Beltway with a \n     remaining expected life of less than 10 years;\n       (7) the Bridge is the only part of the Interstate System \n     owned by the Federal Government;\n       (8)(A) the Bridge was constructed by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (B) prior to the date of enactment of this Act, the Federal \n     Government has contributed 100 percent of the cost of \n     building and rehabilitating the Bridge; and\n       (C) the Federal Government has a continuing responsibility \n     to fund future costs associated with the upgrading of the \n     Interstate Route 95 crossing, including the rehabilitation \n     and reconstruction of the Bridge; and\n       (9) the Federal Government should provide full funding for \n     construction of the replacement Bridge.\n\n     SEC. 3. FULL FUNDING OF BRIDGE.\n\n       (a) Interchanges.--Section 404(5)(F) of the Woodrow Wilson \n     Memorial Bridge Authority Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-59; 109 \n     Stat. 629) is amended by inserting ``interchange,'' after \n     ``roadway,''.\n       (b) Funding.--Section 104(i) of title 23, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``From'' and all that \n     follows through ``final engineering'' and inserting ``The \n     Secretary shall obligate sums made available under paragraph \n     (3) for final engineering and construction''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) Authorization of appropriations.--There are \n     authorized to be appropriated out of the Highway Trust Fund \n     (other than the Mass Transit Account) for fiscal years 1998 \n     through 2004 such sums as are necessary to carry out this \n     subsection.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 484. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nthe establishment of a pediatric research initiative; to the Committee \non Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n             THE PEDIATRICS RESEARCH INITIATIVE ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.  Mr. President, I introduce legislation that will \nincrease our Nation's investment in pediatric research.\n\n\n                              THE PROBLEM\n\n  Children under the age of 21 represent 30 percent of the population--\nand yet, the NIH devotes only somewhere between 5 and 14 percent of its \nbudget to their needs.\n  Just as there has been a recognition in recent years that women and \nminorities have been neglected in research efforts nationwide, there's \na growing consensus that children deserve more attention than they are \ngetting.\n\n\n                              THE SOLUTION\n\n  The bill I am introducing today would help us begin to remedy this \nlack of research into children's health. This legislation would create \na Pediatric Research Initiative within the Office of the Director of \nNIH to encourage, coordinate, support, develop, and recognize pediatric \nresearch. The bill would authorize $75 million over the next 3 years \nfor this initiative. Last year, we received a $5 million downpayment in \nthe appropriations process, and we look forward to working with the \nappropriators to continue on the path toward the necessary level of \nfunding.\n\n[[Page S2649]]\n\n  This is a crucial investment in our country's future--and one that \nwill produce a great return. If we focus on making our children \nhealthy, we'll set the stage for a healthy citizenry 60 to 70 years \ninto the future.\n  This initiative will also promote greater coordination in children's \nhealth research. Today, there are some 20 Institutes and Centers and \nOffices within NIH that do something in the way of pediatrics. In my \nview, we need to bring some level of coordination and focus on these \nefforts.\n  In developing this initiative, I have made sure that it gives the \nDirector of NIH as much discretion as possible. The money has to be \nspent on outside research, so that the dollars flow out to the private \nsector--but it can go toward basic research or clinical research, at \nthe discretion of the Director.\n  This bill does not create a new Office, Center, or Institute. It \nproposes spending for research, not infrastructure.\n  This initiative has the support of the pediatric research community \nin children's hospitals and university pediatric departments all over \nthe country. It has been endorsed by the National Association of \nChildren's Hospitals, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the \nAssociation of Medical School Pediatric Department Chairmen, the \nAmerican Pediatric Society, Children's Hospitals and University Medical \nCenters, the Juvenile Diabetes Association, Advocates for Children With \nSpecial Conditions, Pediatric Academy Societies, Association of Ohio \nChildren's Hospitals, Children's Hospital Affiliates of the Missouri \nHospital Association, Children's Hospital Association of Texas, \nFederation of Children's With Special Health Care Needs, and Family \nVoices.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of Senator \nDeWine's effort to establish a pediatric research initiative within the \nOffice of the Director at the National Institutes of Health [NIH].\n  To achieve real progress in improving the health of our Nation's most \nvulnerable and valuable resource--our children--we must strengthen \npublic investments in pediatric research; enhance Federal coordination \namong the NIH Institutes to ensure quality multi-disciplinary research \nin areas of scientific progress; develop new incentives for investment \nin pediatric clinical trials; support new ways to treat children with \nspecial conditions; and develop information to promote safer and more \neffective use of prescription drugs for children.\n  The opportunity for scientific progress in combating and preventing \nillnesses and diseases affecting children has never been greater. To \nassist the NIH in strengthening its pediatric research efforts, I, \nalong with other members of the Labor, HHS, and Education \nAppropriations Subcommittee, successfully secured $5 million for the \nNIH Office of the Director to begin this new pediatric research \ninitiative last year.\n  Senator DeWine's legislation builds upon that down payment, and I \nlook forward to working with other Members of the Senate in ensuring \npassage of this effort.\n  Although health care spending for children is only a fraction of \ntotal health care spending, we must not turn our backs on the health \ncare needs of our children. Pediatric research offers potential savings \nin health care costs as well as substantial benefits to the well-being \nof children for a lifetime. Moreover, pediatric research contributes to \nnew insights and discoveries in preventing and treating illnesses and \ndiseases among our country's adult population.\n  Let me close by saying that this bill complements legislation I \nintroduced last week which will provide surveillance, research, and \nservices aimed at the prevention of birth defects, the No. 1 killer of \nbabies. We currently know the causes of about 30 percent of all birth \ndefects. With the enactment of a pediatric research initiative and the \nBirth Defects Prevention Act of 1997, we will shed new light on the \ncauses of birth defects as well as numerous other diseases, illnesses, \nand other health factors afflicting our Nation's children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. \n        Grassley, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Roberts and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 485. A bill to amend the Competitive, Special, and Facilities \nResearch Grant Act to provide increased emphasis on competitive grants \nto promote agricultural research projects regarding precision \nagriculture and to provide for the dissemination of the results of the \nresearch projects, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n    THE PRECISION AGRICULTURE RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND INFORMATION \n                       DISSEMINATION ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today several colleagues and I \nare introducing the Precision Agriculture Research, Education, and \nInformation Dissemination Act of 1997.\n  Earlier this month the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry began a series of hearings on reforming and reauthorizing \nagricultural research programs. It is our desire that as we move \nthrough this process this legislation will become part of the research \nreauthorization that is signed into law.\n  This legislation emphasizes research on precision agriculture \ntechnologies. These technologies are very exciting and will enable the \nUnited States to maintain and augment our competitive edge in global \nagricultural markets. The legislation amends the Competitive, Special \nand Facilities Research Grant Act of 1965 by modifying the National \nResearch Initiative [NRI] to give the Secretary of Agriculture \nauthority to provide research, extension, and education competitive \ngrants and programs that emphasize precision agriculture technologies \nand management practices.\n  This legislation represents a compromise between various interests. \nThe bill is supported by The Fertilizer Institute, National Center for \nResources Innovations, Experiment Station and Extension Service \nDirectors, Lockheed Martin, and a consortium of other high technology \ncompanies.\n  An identical bill H.R. 725 was introduced by Congressman Lewis and \nCongressman Crapo on February 12, 1997.\n  Precision agriculture technologies are rapidly advancing, and it is \ncrucial that the agricultural research community invest in this field \nof research so that all farmers will be able to benefit. This bill will \nnot only increase the investment in precision agriculture, but it will \nalso emphasize an educational process that will assist all farmers in \nadopting precision agriculture technologies and applications.\n  Emerging technologies in production agriculture are changing and \nimproving the way farmers produce food and fiber in this country. New \ntechnologies such as global positioning satellites field mapping, geo-\nreference information systems, grid soil sampling, variable rate \nseeding and input applications, portable electronic pest scouting, on-\nthe-go yield monitoring, and computerized field history and record \nkeeping are just a few of the next generation technological tools in \nuse today.\n  Today, these technologies can map these variables and data \ninstantaneously as an applicator or combine drives across the field. In \nshort, each farm field using precision technology becomes a research \npilot. And in the down months or winter season a farmer can collect the \ndata from the previous growing season and adjust dozens of important \nagronomic variables to maximize the efficient use of all the farmers \ninputs: time, fuel, commercial inputs, seed rate, irrigation--the list \ngoes on and on.\n\n  These precision farming tools are already proving to help farmers \nincrease field productivity, improve input efficiency, protect the \nenvironment, maximize farm profitability, and create computerized field \nhistories that may help increase land values. Collectively, these and \nother emerging technologies are being used in an integrated, site-\nspecific systems approach called ``Precision Agriculture.'' Progressive \nand production minded farmers are already using these technologies. In \na decade they may be as commonplace on the farm as air-conditioned \ntractor cabs and power steering.\n  Precision farming seems to offer great promise for improving \nproduction performance. Inherently, it sounds very appealing to be able \nto evaluate production conditions on an individual square foot, yard, \nor acre basis rather than that of a whole field. It would seem that we \nshould be able to treat\n\n[[Page S2650]]\n\nany situation more appropriately the smaller the plot we are \nconsidering. There have been great strides in predicting productivity \non the basis of smaller and smaller units on the ground than we have \never realistically envisioned in the past, measuring yields as we \nharvest, being able to collect soil samples on a very small pilot basis \nand prescribe corrective measures on the go. All of these things are \npossible. They are being done on an experimental basis in many \nlocations. Some producers have adopted the new technology and are using \nit.\n  Precision farming is, in its simplest form, a management system for \ncrop production that uses site-specific data to maximize yields and \nmore efficiently use inputs. The technology is quickly gaining \nacceptance and use by producers, farm suppliers, crop consultants, and \ncustom applicators.\n  Precision farming links the data-management abilities of computers \nwith sophisticated farm equipment that can vary applications rates and \nmonitor yields throughout a field.\n  Mr. President, the capabilities of precision agriculture technologies \nare rapidly increasing. The economic and environmental benefits of \nthese technologies have not been fully realized. Increasing the use of \nthese technologies and development of complementary new technologies \nwill benefit American agriculture, the U.S. economy and both domestic \nand global environmental concerns. In Kentucky this type of research \ncan help producers increase their yield while protecting environmental \nconcerns such as water quality. I believe these new high-technology \ntools can make agriculture better by boosting production, environmental \nquality and profits. \n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hagel and Mr. \n        Johnson):\n  S. 486. A bill to amend the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of \n1988 to clarify the limitation for accession to the GATT and the WTO of \nforeign countries that have state trading enterprises; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n               THE FAIRNESS IN STATE TRADING ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fairness \nin State Trading Act of 1997. This bill, which is cosponsored by \nSenators Grassley, Hagel, and Johnson, is a bipartisan approach to \naddressing the problem faced by U.S. exporters in countries in which \nstate trading enterprises [STE's] dominate the economy.\n\n  The Fairness in State Trading Act would subject the import activities \nof STE's to the jurisdiction of section 1106 of the 1988 Omnibus Trade \nand Competitiveness Act of 1988, (19 U.S.C. 2905). If this bill passes, \nthe President would have to determine whether the import activities of \nthe state trading enterprises of an applicant to the WTO impede, or are \nlikely to impede, U.S. exports to that country. If the President makes \nsuch a determination, the WTO Agreement cannot apply between the United \nStates and that nation until the latter agrees that its STE's will make \ndecisions based exclusively on commercial considerations.\n  The Brownback bill is designed to ensure that the WTO accession \nprotocol agreements of such countries as China, Russia, and the Ukraine \ninclude a provision in which these countries specifically agree that \ntheir STE's will make purchasing decisions based solely on commercial \nconsiderations. This provision is important because these WTO \napplicants have indicated that they intend to continue to purchase \ncommodities such as wheat, corn, rice, vegetable oils, and sugar \nexclusively or almost exclusively through STE's.\n  Without a strong commitment from these countries to depoliticize \ntheir import practices, the United States would only have recourse to \nGATT article XVII for questionable activities undertaken by China's \nSTE's. In 1995, the GAO determined that article XVII is an ineffective \nmechanism for policing the activities of STE's, and that the state \ntrading activities of China, Russia, and the Ukraine present problems \nthat article XVII is not capable of addressing.\n  Weak enforcement of STE activities would enable the STE's of new WTO \nmembers to continue to employ a politicized procurement process. Why \nshould the United States be more concerned about the state trading \nactivities of new members of the WTO rather than the activities of \ncurrent members? Because the state trading activities of current WTO \nmembers pale in comparison to the state trading activities of nations \nsuch as China, Russia, and the Ukraine.\n  Import decisions must be made on purely commercial considerations. \nGATT article XVII is not capable of effectively policing the state \ntrading activities of countries accustomed to a command-and-control \neconomic model. Before we apply the WTO Agreement between the United \nStates and these countries, we must ensure that they agree to \ndepoliticize their import practices.\n  Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, and States across the Nation \ngrow the best crops in the world. Exports of these and other U.S. \ncommodities have skyrocketed as tariff and nontariff barriers to these \ngoods have been reduced worldwide. We cannot allow state trading \nactivities to supplant tariff and other nontariff measures as the new \nbarriers to U.S. exports. Let's make sure that U.S. goods can compete \non a level playing field in the markets of new members of the WTO \nbefore we lock in reductions in our barriers to goods from these \ncountries. Please print statement and bill in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 486\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fairness in State Trading \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) State trading enterprises play a significant role in \n     the economies of several countries that have applied to the \n     World Trade Organization (referred to in this Act as the \n     ``WTO'').\n       (2) The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (referred to \n     in this Act as the ``GATT''), and especially GATT Article \n     XVII, does not adequately prevent countries from using state \n     trading enterprises as a disguised barrier to imports from \n     the United States.\n       (3) The United States economy will be adversely affected by \n     the accession to the WTO of foreign countries that have state \n     trading enterprises that make production or procurement \n     decisions based upon noncommercial considerations.\n       (4) State trading enterprises have a particularly negative \n     impact on United States farmers.\n\n     SEC. 3. ACCESSION OF COUNTRIES WITH STATE TRADING ENTERPRISES \n                   TO GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE OR \n                   WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION.\n\n       Section 1106 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act \n     of 1988 (19 U.S.C. 2905) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``major foreign country'' each place it \n     appears and inserting ``foreign country'';\n       (2) in subsection (a), by amending paragraph (1) to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(1) whether state trading enterprises produce or procure \n     a significant share of--\n       ``(A) the goods exported from such foreign country;\n       ``(B) the goods imported into such foreign country; or\n       ``(C) the goods produced domestically in such foreign \n     country; and''; and\n       (3) in subsection (b)(2)(A)--\n       (A) by amending clause (i) to read as follows:\n       ``(i) will make purchases and sales in international trade \n     based solely on commercial considerations (including price, \n     quality, availability, marketability, and transportation), \n     and''; and\n       (B) in clause (ii), by striking ``, in accordance with \n     customary practice,''.\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of \nthe legislation introduced by my distinguished colleague from Kansas, \nSenator Brownback. This bill is an important step toward opening \nforeign markets to American products--especially our agricultural \nproducts.\n  Several countries have State Trading Enterprises that control all \nimports of certain products. These trading enterprises create a \nbottleneck in trade--a bottleneck controlled by the Government, not by \nfree enterprise. The result is that foreign politics end up controlling \ntrade decisions, and American exporters get hurt.\n  This bill would require the United States to oppose membership in the \nWorld Trade Organization for any country that has a State Trading \nEnterprise that refuses to buy our products for reasons other than \nmarket conditions. Its purpose is simple: It\n\n[[Page S2651]]\n\ngives America leverage against countries that shut out our exporters \nfor political reasons.\n  This is important for all of America's exporters, who benefit from \nhaving a level playing field. It is especially important for American \nfarmers. This bill will give our negotiators an important new tool to \nuse as they oppose the unjustified actions of State trading enterprises \naround the world. It will help us get American dairy products into New \nZealand and American wheat into Canada.\n  But its most important effect will be in regard to China. China is an \nenormous and growing market. As China emerges economically, we must do \nall we can to bring China into the world trading system as a full \npartner. If we want our exporters to do business in China's emerging \nmarket, we need to ensure that China plays by all the rules of trade \nthat govern the rest of the world.\n  The discussions about China's accession to the World Trade \nOrganization are ongoing. I strongly believe China must accept all \nobligations that WTO membership entails. That includes letting the \nmarket, not the politicians, control its trading decisions. China must \ndismantle its remaining State Trading Enterprises--especially the \nenterprise that controls the import of wheat into the country.\n  American farmers--especially our wheat producers--need full and free \naccess to China's market. This bill gives our trade negotiators a small \nbut important tool to help ensure that will happen.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Inouye and \n        Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 487. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act with respect to \nemployment opportunities in the Department of Health and Human Services \nfor women who are scientists, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n           THE HHS WOMEN SCIENTIST EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY ACT\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I introduce the HHS Women \nScientist Employment Opportunity Act. What this bill does is quite \nsimple. It will require all agencies within the Department of Health \nand Human Services to establish policies to ensure employment \nopportunities for women scientists within the Department. It will \nensure a fair break for the many dedicated women scientists serving at \nthe National Institutes of Health, the Center for Disease Control and \nPrevention, the Food and Drug Administration, and other agencies or \noffices in the Department. Policies are to be reviewed regularly and \nrevised if necessary.\n  This bill is about the promoting equality. It is about supporting and \nadvancing the careers of women scientists. It is about our Government \nleading the way in setting an example for both academia and industry on \ncareer policies for women scientists.\n  In 1992, it came to my attention that women scientists at the \nNational Institutes of Health were not being treated fairly. Women \nscientists at NIH indicated that they were not being given research and \nconference assignments that would help advance their careers. They were \nnot being adequately recognized for their accomplishments. Publication \nopportunities were limited. Questions were raised about tenure and \ncomparability of pay with male colleagues.\n  Legislation was introduced in the 103d and 104th Congresses to \naddress these concerns. I am encouraged that NIH voluntarily adopted \nsome of the provisions outlined in these bills. But, this is only a \nstart. We must continue to address the equity issues and policies \nimpacting career advancement of our best and brightest women \nscientists. These issues deserve our utmost attention. That is why this \nbill is so important. It will ensure that the policies are in place to \npromote career opportunities for women scientists. And, it will ensure \nthat policies are reviewed regularly, that progress is monitored and \nthat policies are revised if necessary.\n  What I like about this bill is that it addresses a problem in our own \nbackyard. It says we in the Federal Government have a problem, and we \nare going to fix it. It ensures that our women scientists working at \nHHS are treated fairly. It serves as a model for the private sector by \nsetting the stage for equity among our career scientists. It shows that \nwe are very serious about equity and fair play in the scientific \ncommunity. I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting the HHS \nWomen Scientist Employment Opportunity Act. \n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL:\n  S. 488.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Crime Prevention Act \nof 1997. One of the most important responsibilities for the 105th \nCongress is to pass a tough comprehensive crime measure that will \nrestore law and order to America's streets. Reported crime may have \ndecreased slightly over the past few years, but the streets are still \ntoo dangerous. Too many Americans are afraid to go out for fear of \nbeing robbed, assaulted, or murdered. In fact, according to the Bureau \nof Justice Statistics report ``Highlights from 20 Years of Surveying \nCrime Victims,'' approximately 2 million people are injured a year as a \nresult of violent crime. Of those who are injured, more than half \nrequire some level of medical treatment and nearly a quarter receive \ntreatment in a hospital emergency room or require hospitalization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2651-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE CRIME CLOCK IS TICKING\n\n  The picture painted by crime statistics is frightening. According to \nthe Uniform Crime Reports released by the Department of Justice, in \n1995 there was: A violent crime every 18 seconds; a murder every 24 \nminutes; a forcible rape every 5 minutes; a robbery every 54 seconds; \nan aggravated assault every 29 seconds; a property crime every 3 \nseconds; a burglary every 12 seconds; and a motor vehicle theft every \n21 seconds.\n  In short, a crime index offense occurred every 2 seconds. And this is \njust reported crime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2651-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2651-S2654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               STATISTICS\n\n  Again, according to the Uniform Crime Reports in 1994, there were \n1,798,785 violent crimes reported to law enforcement, a rate of 684.6 \nviolent crimes per 100,000 inhabitants. The 1995 total was about 40 \npercent above that of 1985.\n  Additionally, in 1995 there were: 21,957 murders, a rate of 8.2 per \n100,000 inhabitants; 580,545 robberies, a rate of 220.9 per 100,000 \ninhabitants; 2,594,995 burglaries, a rate of 987.6 per 100,000 \ninhabitants; 1,099,179 aggravated assaults, a rate of 418.3 per 100,000 \ninhabitants; and 97,464 rapes, a rate of 37.1 per 100,000 inhabitants.\n  Further, juvenile crime is skyrocketing. According to statistics \ncompiled by the FBI, from 1985 to 1993 the number of homicides \ncommitted by males aged 18 to 24 increased 65 percent, and by males \naged 14 to 17 increased 165 percent. In addition, according to \nthe Department of Justice, during 1993, the youngest age group \nsurveyed--those 12 to 15 years old--had the greatest risk of being the \nvictims of violent crimes.\n\n\n                        THE HEAVY COST OF CRIME\n\n  Aside from the vicious personal toll exacted, crime also has a \ndevastating effect on the economy of our country. To fight crime, the \nUnited States spends about $90 billion a year on the entire criminal \njustice system. Crime is especially devastating to our cities, which \noften have crime rates several times higher than suburbs.\n  A Washington Post article detailed the work of Professors Mark Levitt \nand Mark Cohen in estimating the real cost of crime to society. \nAccording to the article, ``[i]nstead of merely toting up the haul in \narmed robberies or burglaries, Cohen tallied all of the costs \nassociated with various kinds of crime, from loss of income sustained \nby a murder victim's family to the cost of counseling a rape victim to \nthe diminished value of houses in high-burglary neighborhoods.'' These \n``quality of life'' costs raise the cost of crime considerably. Cohen \nand Levitt calculated that one murder costs society on average $2.7 \nmillion. A robbery nets the robber an average of $2,900 in actual cash, \nbut it produces $14,900 in ``quality of life'' expenses. And while the \nactual monetary loss caused by an assault is $1,800,\n\n[[Page S2652]]\n\nit produces $10,200 in ``quality of life'' expenses.\n\n\n                              LEGISLATION\n\n  Fighting crime must be a top priority. Few would dispute this. \nAccording to a poll conducted for Reuters by the New York-based John \nZogby Group that was released on January 31, 1997, voters rank crime as \nthe most important issue. Further, according to an article in the July \n19, 1995 Tucson Citizen, about 500 business, education, and government \nleaders in Tucson ranked crime as the number one issue in a survey \ncommissioned by the Greater Tucson Economic Council. Also, according to \na November 6, 1996 article in The Arizona Daily Star, Arizonans rank \ncrime as one of the most important issues.\n  Given the magnitude of the problem of crime in our society, I believe \nthat it is important to consider a comprehensive crime package. My bill \nhas solid reforms that should blunt the forecasted explosion in crime. \nI would like to take this opportunity to outline of the provisions \nincluded in the Crime Prevention Act of 1997.\n\n\n                  VICTIM RIGHTS AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE\n\n  Women are the victims of more than 4.5 million violent crimes a year, \nincluding half a million rapes or other sexual assaults, according to \nthe Department of Justice. The National Victim Center calculates that a \nwoman is battered every 15 seconds. A message must be sent to abusers \nthat their behavior is not a ``family matter.'' Society should treat \ndomestic violence as seriously as it does violence between strangers. \nMy bill will strengthen the rights of domestic violence victims in \nFederal court and, hopefully, set a standard for the individual States \nto emulate.\n  First, my bill authorizes the death penalty for cases in which a \nwoman is murdered by her husband or boyfriend. Courts will not, under \nthis bill, be able to exclude evidence of a defendant's violent \ndisposition toward the victim as impermissible ``character'' evidence. \nMy bill also provides that if a defendant presents negative character \nevidence concerning the victim, the government's rebuttal can include \nnegative character evidence concerning the defendant. It makes clear \nthat testimony regarding battered women's syndrome is admissible to \nexplain the behavior of victims of violence.\n  We must establish a higher standard of professional conduct for \nlawyers. My legislation prohibits harassing or dilatory tactics, \nknowingly presenting false evidence or discrediting truthful evidence, \nwillful ignorance of matters that could be learned from the client, and \nconcealment of information necessary to prevent sexual abuse or other \nviolent crimes.\n  Violence in our society leaves law-abiding citizens feeling \ndefenseless. It is time to level the playing field. Federal law \ncurrently gives the defense more chances than the prosecution to reject \na potential juror. My bill protects the right of victims to an \nimpartial jury by giving both sides the same number of peremptory \nchallenges.\n  The 1994 Crime Act included a provision requiring notice to State and \nlocal authorities concerning the release of Federal violent offenders. \nUnder the act, notice can only be used for law-enforcement purposes. \nThe Justice Department opposes this limitation because it disallows \nother legitimate uses of the information, such as warning potential \nvictims of the offender's return to the community. My bill would delete \nthis restriction.\n  It is our responsibility to continue to work to combat violent crime, \nwherever it occurs. Titles I and II take an important step toward \nprotecting the rights of crime victims, curbing domestic violence, and \nremoving violent offenders from our streets and communities.\n\n\n                                FIREARMS\n\n  Almost 30 percent of all violent crimes are committed through the use \nof a firearm, either to intimidate the victim into submission or to \ninjure the victim, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. And \n70 percent of all murders committed were accomplished through the use \nof a firearm. To help stop this violence the bill increases the \nmandatory minimum sentences for criminals who use firearms in the \ncommission of crimes. It imposes the following minimum penalties: 10 \nyears for using or carrying a firearm during the commission of a \nFederal crime of violence or drug trafficking crime; 20 years if the \nfirearm is discharged; incarceration for life or punishment by death if \ndeath a person results.\n\n\n                         THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE\n\n  To ensure that relevant evidence is not kept from juries, the bill \nextends the ``good faith'' exception to the exclusionary rule to non-\nwarrant cases, where the court determines that the circumstances \njustified an objectively reasonable belief by officers that their \nconduct was lawful.\n\n\n                           THE DEATH PENALTY\n\n  The vast majority of the American public supports the option of the \ndeath penalty. A Gallup poll conducted in April 1996 found that 79 \npercent of Americans support the death penalty, and an ABC News/\nWashington Post poll conducted in January 1995 found that 74 percent of \nAmericans favor the death penalty for persons convicted of murder.\n  To deter crime and to make a clear statement that the most vicious, \nevil behavior will not be tolerated in our society, the bill \nstrengthens Federal death penalty standards and procedures. It requires \ndefendant to give notice of mitigating factors that will be relied on \nin a capital sentencing hearing--just as the Government is now required \nto give notice of aggravating factors--adds use of a firearm in \ncommitting a killing as an aggravating factor that permits a jury to \nconsider the death penalty, and directs the jury to impose a capital \nsentence if aggravating factors outweigh mitigating factors.\n\n\n                             HABEAS CORPUS\n\n  To eliminate the abuse, delay, and repetitive litigation in the lower \nFederal courts title VI of this bill provides that the decisions of \nState courts will not be subject to review in the lower Federal courts, \nso long as there are adequate and effective remedies in the State \ncourts for testing the legality of a person's detention. This provision \nlimits the needless duplicative review in the lower Federal courts, and \nhelps put a stop to the endless appeals of convicted criminals. Judge \nRobert Bork has written a letter in support of this provision.\n\n                        ADMINISTRATIVE SUBPOENA\n\n  The bill allows high-ranking Secret Service agents to issue an \nadministrative subpoena for information in cases in which a person's \nlife is in danger. The Department of Agriculture, the Resolution Trust \nCorporation, and the Food and Drug Administration already have \nadministrative subpoena power. The Secret Service should have it to \nprotect the lives of American citizens.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n  The Kyl crime bill is an important effort in the fight against crime. \nWe can win this fight, if we have the conviction, and keep the pressure \non Congress to pass tough crime-control measures. It is time to stop \nkowtowing to prisoners, apologists for criminals, and the defense \nlawyers, and pass a strong crime bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 489. A bill to improve the criminal law relating to fraud against \nconsumers; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 the telemarketing fraud prevention act\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor to \nthe Telemarketing Fraud Prevention Act. Unfortunately, my State of \nNevada has the highest rate of bogus telemarketing operations in the \nNation. I have been involved over the last few years with uncovering \nthese scams. We held a hearing last year in the Special Aging Committee \nto call attention to this crime, which primarily targets seniors. At \nthe time of the hearing I called these scams electric muggings, and \nstated that Congress needs to treat these telephone thugs like \ncriminals on the street who attack and steal. This act aims to do just \nthat.\n  Nationwide these phone schemes cost consumers over $60 billion a \nyear. As I stated earlier, Nevada has the highest rate of fraudulent \ntelemarketing operations. But Kathryn Landreth, U.S. attorney for \nNevada, has been working with the Department of Justice to break up \nthese schemes. Last year they rounded up over 200 fraudulent operators \nin Las Vegas. Nevada AARP members served as decoys for the sting, and I \nagain commend them for doing so.\n\n[[Page S2653]]\n\n  Sadly, victims of telemarketing fraud are most often our senior \ncitizens. These white-collar thugs who cheat victims out of their hard-\nearned money, are swindlers who choose to satisfy their greed by \nbilking others instead of doing an honest day's work. These thugs not \nonly rob their victims of their financial security, but also of their \ndignity. Many older Americans live alone, may have just lost their \nspouse, and are particularly vulnerable to con-artists who act like \nthey are their friends. One of the telemarketers prosecuted by the U.S. \nattorney of Nevada's office collected obituaries from various \nnewspapers so that he could take advantage of recent widows and \nwidowers.\n  Typical schemes involve the telemarketer promising thousands of \ndollars, free vacations, or new cars if the victim buys a fur coat or \noverpriced vitamins, for example. If a victim receives anything at all \nin return for the money sent to the telemarketer, the items are \ngenerally worth far less than represented; in some cases they are no \nmore than worthless junk.\n  Not only do we need vigilant law enforcement and tough punishments, \nbut we need to inform people. We have to get the message out to people, \nespecially seniors, to be wary of offerings over the phone and hang up \nwhen asked for money. Further, they should report the incident to the \nU.S. attorney's office. Hopefully, strengthening the punishment for \nthese crimes will deter others from entering the arena, but it is \nextremely important to follow up on this act with enforcement and \ninformation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 490. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to adjust \nfor inflation the dollar limitations on the dependent care credit; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n         THE WORKING FAMILIES CHILD CARE TAX RELIEF ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation that I \nhave sponsored in the past two Congresses to provide a measure of tax \nrelief to working families throughout America. My bill would restore \nvalue to the child and dependent care credit by allowing an annual \nadjustment of the credit for inflation.\n  Mr. President, as the Federal Government and the states work to move \npeople from welfare to work, the problems faced by working Americans \nseeking affordable, quality child-care services for their children will \nlikely worsen. The availability and affordability of adequate child \ncare are the principal concerns expressed by an increasing number of \nmiddle-class working parents. Many parents are forced to patch together \na network of child care providers to secure care for their children.\n  The evidence in support of improving the child and dependent care \ncredit is clear. The number of single mothers working outside the home \nhas dramatically increased in recent years. More than 56 percent of all \nmothers with children under 6 years work outside the home, and over 70 \npercent of women with children over age 6 are in the labor market.\n  The percentage of Hawaii households in which both parents work \noutside the home is even higher than the national average. According to \nprojections developed by the Bank of Hawaii based on the 1990 Census, \n61.8 percent of all Hawaii families have both parents employed, and \n71.3 percent of all households have at least two individuals in the \nworkforce.\n  The increased participation of single mothers in the labor market and \nthe large number of two-parent families in which both parents work \noutside the home have made the dependent care credit one of the most \npopular and productive tax incentives ever enacted by Congress. \nUnfortunately, the value of the credit has declined significantly over \nthe years as inflation has slowly eaten away at the value of this \nbenefit. Measured in constant dollars, the maximum credit of $2,400 has \ndecreased in value by more than 45 percent since 1982.\n  In 1981, the flat credit for dependent care was replaced with a scale \nto give the greatest benefit of the credit to lower income working \nfamilies. Since that time, neither the adjusted gross income figures \nemployed in the scale, nor the limit on the amount of employment-\nrelated expenses used to calculate the credit, has been adjusted for \ninflation. My bill provides a measure of much needed relief to working \nAmerican families. It would index the child and dependent care credit \nand restore the full benefit of the credit.\n\n  The maximum amount of employment-related child care expenses allowed \nunder current law--$2,400 for a single child and $4,800 for two or more \nchildren--has simply failed to keep pace with escalating care costs. \nUnlike other tax credits and deductions provided taxpayers in the \nInternal Revenue Code, the dependent care credit is not adjusted for \ninflation.\n  Without an adjustment for inflation, we will continue to diminish the \npurpose of this credit to offset the expense of dependent and child \ncare services incurred by parents working outside the home. While the \ncost of quality child care has increased as demand exceeds supply, the \ndependent care credit has failed to keep up with the spiraling costs. \nMy legislation addresses this chronic problem by automatically \nadjusting the dependent and child care credit for inflation. Under this \nlegislation, both the dollar limit on the amount creditable and the \nlimitation on earned income would be adjusted annually.\n  Mr. President, the average cost for out of home child care exceeds \n$3,500 per child, per year. Child care or dependent care expenses can \nseriously strain a family's budget. This burden can become unbearable \nfor single parents, almost invariably single mothers, who must balance \nthe need to work with their parental responsibilities.\n  Middle-class Americans are working harder than ever to maintain their \nstandard of living. In many families, parents have been forced to work \nlonger hours, deplete their savings, and go deeper into debt. There is \nan urgent need to enact changes in our tax code that are pro-family and \npro-children. The Working Families Child Care Tax Relief Act meets both \nof these goals.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 490\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Working Families Child Care \n     Tax Relief Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. INFLATION ADJUSTMENT OF DEPENDENT CARE CREDIT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subsection (e) of section 21 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to expenses for \n     household and dependent care services necessary for gainful \n     employment) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(11) Inflation adjustment.--In the case of any taxable \n     year beginning in a calendar year after 1996, each dollar \n     amount contained in subsections (c) and (d)(2) shall be \n     increased by an amount equal to--\n       ``(A) such dollar amount, multiplied by\n       ``(B) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under \n     section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year in which the taxable \n     year begins, by substituting `calendar year 1995' for \n     `calendar year 1992' in subparagraph (B) thereof.''\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1996.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FORD:\n  S. 491. A bill to amend the National Wildlife Refuge System \nAdministration Act of 1966 to prohibit the United States Fish and \nWildlife Service from acquiring land to establish a refuge of the \nNational Wildlife Refuge System unless at least 50 percent of the \nowners of the land in the proposed refuge favor the acquisition; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\nthe national wildlife refuge system administration act amendment act of \n                                  1997\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, last month in western Kentucky, about 200 \ncitizens of Marshall County packed a junior high school auditorium, \ntaking time out from their busy schedules, to learn more about the \nproposed Clarks River Wildlife Refuge. So many people were there \nbecause it marked the first time they had an opportunity to voice their \nopinions on a refuge that would go, literally, through their backyards. \nBackers of the refuge had crafted a proposal and sought funding without \nany input from the people who owned the land.\n  I first called the Senate's attention to this refuge last year, \nduring consideration of the omnibus appropriations bill. I made it \nclear that I'm not necessarily opposed to the creation of a\n\n[[Page S2654]]\n\nwildlife refuge in western Kentucky. What concerned me then and \nconcerns me now is that those who farm about 7,000 acres within the \nproposed boundaries of the refuge haven't been heard on whether they \nsupport the refuge. As one farmer said to me in a letter last year, \n``no one seems to listen to what the majority of the landowners and \nfarmers, who are directly involved, are saying.''\n  Well, Mr. President, I'm listening. During last month's hearing, one \nfarmer asked for a show of hands, of the landowners present, who \nsupported the refuge. Three hands went up. When he asked how many \nlandowners opposed the refuge, about 60 hands went up. What's worse, \nwhen a farmer asked how many landowners had been contacted to determine \nsupport for the refuge, the Government officials admitted that not a \nsingle landowner had been contacted--despite the fact that the creation \nof the refuge will depend solely on the number of willing sellers.\n  Today I am introducing legislation to correct this practice. My bill \nwould require the Fish and Wildlife Service to contact for an \nindependent, non-biased survey of landowners within the boundaries of \nany proposed refuge. If the survey shows that a majority of the \nlandowners support the refuge, then the Service would be free to \nproceed with land acquisitions to create it. If not, then the Service \nwould be prohibited from taking additional steps.\n  Mr. President, my bill is simply common sense: Creating a wildlife \nrefuge depends on the willingness of landowners to sell their property \nto the Federal Government. We should first determine if there are \nenough landowners willing to sell enough land to actually create the \nrefuge before we begin to make purchases. It doesn't make sense to draw \nup plans for a wildlife refuge if there won't be enough land available \nto create it.\n  Mr. President, the people of western Kentucky have asked, repeatedly, \nfor their voices to be heard. My legislation will ensure that they will \nbe, and that future refuges respect the wishes of affected communities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 491\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend certain provisions of title 5, United States \nCode, in order to ensure equality between Federal firefighters and \nother employees in the civil service and other public sector \nfirefighters, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2651-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2654-S2706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE FIREFIGHER PAY FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nimprove the pay system used for Federal firefighters. This bill has \nthree broad purposes: First, to improve pay equality with municipal and \nother public section firefighters; second, to enhance recruitment and \nretention of firefighters in order to maintain the highest quality \nFederal fire service; and third, to encourage Federal firefighters to \npursue career advancement and training opportunities.\n  Fire protection is clearly a major concern at Federal facilities and \non Federal lands throughout the Nation. From fighting wildland fires in \nour national parks and forests to protecting military families from \nfires in their base housing, Federal firefighters play a vital role in \npreserving lives and property. One only needs to recall the terrible \ntragedies in Colorado two summers ago to understand the vital \nimportance of our Federal firefighters.\n  The Department of Agriculture, the Coast Guard, the Department of \nCommerce, the Department of Defense, the General Services \nAdministration, the Department of the Interior, and the Department of \nVeterans Affairs are among the Federal agencies which rely on Federal \nfire fighters to protect their vast holdings of land and structures. \nJust like their municipal counterparts, these firefighters are the \nfirst line of defense against threats to life and property.\n  Mr. President, the current system used to pay our Federal \nfirefighters is at best confusing and at worst unfair. These men and \nwomen work longer hours than any other public sector firefighters--yet \nare paid substantially less. The current pay system, which consists of \nthree tiers, is overly complex and, more importantly, is hurting \nFederal efforts to attract and retain top-quality employees.\n  Currently, most Federal firefighters work an average 72-hour week \nunder exceptionally demanding conditions. The typical workweek consists \nof a one-day-off schedule which results in three 24-hours shifts during \nthe remainder of each week. Despite this unusual schedule, firefighters \nare paid under a modified version of the same General Schedule pay \nsystem used for full-time, 40-hour-per-week Federal workers.\n  The result of the pay modification is that Federal firefighters make \nless per hour than any other Federal employee at their same grade \nlevel. For example: a firefighter who is a GS-5, Step 5 makes $7.21 per \nhour while other employees at the same grade and step earn $10.34 per \nhour. Some have tried to justify this by noting that part of a \nfirefighter's day is downtime. However, I must note that all \nfirefighters have substantial duties beyond those at the site of a \nfire. Adding to this discrepancy is the fact that the average municipal \nfirefighter makes $12.87 per hour.\n  Mr. President, this has caused the Federal fire service to become a \ntraining ground for young men and women who then leave for higher pay \nelsewhere in the public sector. Continually training new employees is, \nas my colleagues know, very expensive for any employer.\n  The Office of Personnel Management is well aware of these problems. \nIn fact, section 102 of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of \n1990 [FEPCA], title V of Public Law 101-509, authorizes the \nestablishment of special pay systems for certain Federal occupations. \nThe origin of this provision was a recognition that the current pay \nclassification system did not account for the unique and distinctive \nemployment conditions of Federal protective occupations including the \nFederal fire service.\n  In May 1991, I wrote to OPM urging the establishment of a separate \npay scale for firefighters under the authority provided for in FEPCA. \nSubsequently, OPM established an Advisory Committee on Law Enforcement \nand Protective Occupations consisting of agency personnel and \nrepresentatives from Federal fire and law enforcement organizations. \nBeginning in August of 1991, representatives from the Federal fire \ncommunity began working with OPM and other administration officials to \nidentify and address the problems of paying Federal firefighters under \nthe General Schedule. The committee completed its work in June of 1992 \nand in December of that year issued a staff report setting forth \nrecommendations to correct the most serious problems with the current \npay system.\n\n  Mr. President, I regret that since the release of the OPM \nrecommendations, there has been no effort to implement any of the \nproposals of the advisory task force. In fact, OPM has communicated \nquite clearly that it has no plans to pursue any solution to the \nserious pay deficiencies that have been so widely identified and \nacknowledged.\n\n[[Page S2655]]\n\n  It would not be necessary to introduce this legislation today had OPM \ntaken the corrective action that, in my view, is so clearly warranted. \nHowever, I have determined that legislation appears to be the only \nvehicle to achieve the necessary changes in the pay system for Federal \nfirefighters.\n  Mr. President, the Firefighter Pay Fairness Act would improve Federal \nfirefighter pay in several important and straightforward ways. Perhaps \nmost importantly, the bill draws from existing provisions in title V to \ncalculate a true hourly rate for firefighters. This would alleviate the \ncurrent problem of firefighters being paid considerably less than other \nGeneral Schedule employees at the same GS level. It would also account \nfor the varying length in the tour of duty for Federal firefighters \nstationed at different locations.\n  In addition, the bill would use this hourly rate to ensure that \nfirefighters receive true time and one-half overtime for hours worked \nover 106 in a bi-weekly pay period. This is designed to correct the \nproblem, under the current system, where the overtime rate is \ncalculated based on an hourly rate considerably less than base pay.\n  The Firefighter Pay Fairness Act would also extend these pay \nprovisions to so-called wildland firefighters when they are engaged in \nfirefighting duties. Currently, wildland firefighters are often not \ncompensated for all the time spent responding to a fire event. This \nlegislation would ensure that these protectors of our parks and forests \nwould be paid fairly for ensuring the safety of these invaluable \nnational resources.\n  It also ensures that firefighters promoted to supervisory positions \nwould be paid at a rate of pay at least equal to what they received \nbefore the promotion. This would address a situation, under the current \npay system, which discourages employees from accepting promotions \nbecause of the significant loss of pay which often accompanies a move \nto a supervisory position.\n  Similarly, the bill would encourage employees to get the necessary \ntraining in hazardous materials, emergency medicine, and other critical \nareas by ensuring they do not receive a pay cut while engaged in these \ntraining activities.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is based upon a bill I authorized in \nthe 103d Congress. A bipartisan group of more than 150 Members \ncosponsored the measure in the Senate and the House last year. The \nlegislation I am introducing today reflects several modifications that \nwere suggested to the bill following substantial discussions with \nvarious Members. However, it is identical to the so-called compromise \nmeasure that has been discussed with the authorizing as well as the \nappropriations committees in previous years and received widespread \nsupport.\n  To reduce initial costs and allow oversight of the effectiveness of \nthe legislation, the bill I am introducing today would implement the \nnew pay system and other provisions beginning October 1, 1997. However, \nthe new rate of pay would be phased in over a 4-year period ending \nOctober 1, 2002.\n  Mr. President, I consulted many of the affected groups in developing \nmy legislation. I am very pleased that this bill has been endorsed by \nthe American Federation of Government Employees, the International \nAssociation of Fire Chiefs, the International Association of Fire \nFighters, the National Association of Government Employees, and the \nNational Federation of Federal Employees.\n  As I have said before, Mr. President, fairness is the key word. There \nis no reason why Federal firefighters should be paid dramatically less \nthat their municipal counterparts. As a cochairman of the Congressional \nFire Services Caucus, I want to urge all members of the caucus and, \nindeed, all Members of the Senate to join in cosponsoring this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself and Mr. Gorton):\n  S. 493. A bill to amend section 1029 of title 18, United States Code, \nwith respect to cellular telephone cloning paraphernalia; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 the cellular telephone protection act\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Cellular Telephone \nProtection Act, which would improve the ability of law enforcement to \ninvestigate and prosecute individuals engaged in the activity of \ncloning cellular phones. Law enforcement officials and wireless \ncarriers support the bill as an important tool to stem this kind of \ntelecommunications fraud.\n  Cell phones are manufactured with an embedded electronic serial \nnumber [ESN], which is transmitted to gain access to the \ntelecommunications network. Those involved in cloning cell phones sit \nin parked cars outside of airports or along busy roadways to harvest \nESN's from legitimate cell phone users and, in a process known as \ncloning, use software and equipment to insert the stolen numbers into \nother cell phones, the clones. A single ESN can be implanted into \nseveral cloned phones. The cloned phones charge to the account of the \nlawful, unsuspecting user. Cellular phone carriers must absorb these \nlosses, which, according to the Cellular Telecommunication Industry \nAssociation, amounted to about $650 million in 1995, up from $480 \nmillion in 1994. The cellular industry is expanding by about 40 percent \na year; efforts to combat fraud are imperative to ensure the integrity \nof our communications network.\n  Cloning is more than an inconvenience to the 36 million Americans who \ncurrently use cellular phone services, and an expense to wireless \ncommunication companies who pay for the fraudulent calls. According to \nthe Secret Service, which is the primary Federal agency responsible for \ninvestigating telecommunications fraud, cloning abets organized \ncriminal enterprises that use cellular telephones as their preferred \nmethod of communication. Cloned phones are extremely popular among drug \ntraffickers and gang members, who oftentimes employ several cloned \nphones to evade detection by law enforcement. When not selling cloned \nphones to drug dealers and ruthless street gangs, cloners set up \ncorner-side calling shops where individuals pay a nominal fee to call \nanywhere in the world on a replicated phone, or simply purchase the \nillegal phone for a flat amount.\n  The cellular telephone protection bill clarifies that there is no \nlawful purpose to posses, produce or sell hardware, known as copycat \nboxes, or software used for cloning a cellular phone or its ESN. Such \nequipment and software are easy to obtainn--advertisements hawking \ncloning equipment appear in computer magazines and on the Internet. \nThere is no legitimate purpose for cloning software and equipment, save \nfor law enforcement and telecommunication service providers using it to \nimprove fraud detection. The bill strikes at the heart of the cloning \nparaphernalia market by eliminating the requirement for prosecutors to \nprove that the person selling copycat boxes or cloning software \nprograms intended to defraud. The bill retains an exception for law \nenforcement to possess otherwise unlawful cloning software, and adds a \nsimilar exception for telecommunications service providers.\n  Moreover, the Cellular Phone Protection Act expands the definition of \n``scanning receivers,'' equipment which, unlike cloning software and \ndevices, does have legitimate uses if not used to scan frequencies \nassigned to wireless communications. The bill clarifies that the \ndefinition of scanning receivers encompasses devices that can be used \nto intercept ESN's even if they are not capable of receiving the voice \nchannel. As mentioned above, criminals harvest ESN's by employing \nscanners near busy thoroughfares. The revised definition of scanning \nreceiver will ensure that these devices are unlawful when used with an \nintent to defraud just like scanners that intercept voice.\n\n  Finally, the bill increases penalties for those engaged in cloning. A \nnew paradigm is needed for penalizing cloning offenses. Currently, \npenalties for cloning crimes are based on the monetary loss a carrier \nsuffers, not the potential loss. First-time offenders oftentimes do not \nface any jail time, which makes these cases unattractive for \nprosecution. Carriers and law enforcement are forced to choose between \nkeeping the cloner on the telecommunications network to rack up high \nlosses to ensure jail time, or stemming the losses sooner only to have \nthe cloner back on the streets in days. The penalty scheme should be \nrevised to\n\n[[Page S2656]]\n\ntrack another indicator of cloning fraud--the number of electronic \nserial numbers stolen.\n  Cloning offenses are serious crimes, and the penalties should reflect \nthis. We know that cloned phones are used to facilitate other crimes--\nparticularly drug trafficking. Additionally, cloning offenses are \nserious economic crimes in themselves that threaten the integrity of \nthe public communications network. In August, two individuals in New \nYork were arrested for allegedly possessing 80,000 electronic serial \nnumbers. Each of the 80,000 ESN's could be implanted into several \ncloned phones. I look forward to working with the U.S. Sentencing \nCommission to achieve a more appropriate sentencing structure for \ncloning fraud.\n  The cellular phone protection initiative will help to reduce \ntelecommunications fraud. In the process, other criminal activity will \nbe made more difficult to conduct--cloned phones, now a staple of \ncriminal syndicates, would not be so readily available.

A bill to combat the overutilization of prison health care \nservices and control rising prisoner health care costs; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              The Federal Prison Health Care Copayment Act\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President. I introduce the Federal Prisoner Health Care \nCopayment Act, which would require Federal prisoners to pay a nominal \nfee when they initiate a visit for medical attention. The fee would be \ndeposited in the Federal Crime Victims' Fund. Each time a prisoner pays \nto heal himself, he will be paying to heal a victim.\n  Most working, law-abiding Americans are required to pay a copayment \nfee when they seek medical care. It is time to impose this requirement \non Federal prisoners.\n  To date, at least 20 States--including my home State of Arizona--have \nimplemented statewide prisoner health care copayment programs. In \naddition to Arizona, the following States have enacted this reform: \nCalifornia, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, \nLouisiana, Oklahoma, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, Hew \nHampshire, New Jersey, Utah, Virginia, Tennessee, and Wisconsin. \nSeveral other States are expected to soon institute a copayment system, \nincluding, Alaska, Connecticut, Maine, Montana, Michigan, North \nCarolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Washington, and Wyoming.\n  Moreover, according to the National Sheriffs' Association, at least \n25 States--some of which have not adopted medical copayment reform on a \nstatewide basis--have jail systems that impose a copayment.\n  In June, the National Commission on Correctional Health Care held a \nconference that examined the statewide fee-for-service programs. At the \nconference, Dr. Ron Waldron of the Federal Bureau of Prisons provided a \nsurvey of some of the States that have adopted inmate medical copayment \nprograms and concluded that ``Inmate user fees programs appear to \nreduce utilization, and do generate modest revenues.''\n  Dr. Waldron reported that prison copayment laws resulted in the \nreduction of medical utilization of: between 16 and 29 percent in \nFlorida; between 30 and 50 percent in Kansas; 40 percent in Maryland; \n50 percent in Nevada; and between 10 and 18 percent in Oklahoma. Terry \nStewart, director of the Arizona Department of Corrections, notes that, \n``Over the life of the [Arizona copayment] program, there has been an \noverall reduction of about 31 percent in the number of requests for \nhealth care services. This strongly suggests that inmates are being \nmore discreet about, and giving more considered thought to, their need \nfor medical attention.'' I will have his letter placed in the \nCongressional Record.\n  Reducing frivolous medical visits saves taxpayers money. A December \n28, 1996, New York Post editorial, ``Toward Healthier Prison Budgets,'' \nwhich I will also include in the Record, reported that the copayment \nlaw in New Jersey allowed the State to cut its prison health care \nbudget by $17 million.\n  As to generating revenue, Dr. Waldron reported that California \ncollects about $60,000 per month in prisoner-copayment fees. In my home \nState of Arizona, the State has collected about $400,000 since the \ninception of the program in October 1994.\n  Not only are inmate copayment plans working well on the statewide \nlevel, they are achieving success in jail systems across the United \nStates. In the January-February edition of Sheriff, the National \nSheriffs' Association President reported that copayment plans--which, \nas mentioned above, are operational in jail systems in at least 25 \nStates--have: First, discouraged overuse of service; and second, freed \nhealth care staff to provide better care to inmates who truly need \nmedical attention. Yavapai County sheriff, G.C. ``Buck'' Buchanan, in a \nletter that I will include in the Record, writes: ``Prior to the \ninstitution of [copayment reform], many inmates in custody were taking \nadvantage of the health care which, or course, must be provided to \nthem. This could be construed as frivolous requests if you will, and \ntook up the valuable time of our health care providers * * *. Since \nthis policy has been in effect, we have realized a reduction in inmate \nrequests for medical services between 45 to 50 percent.''\n\n[[Page S2657]]\n\n  The success of the prison and jail fee-for-service initiatives should \ncome as no surprise. Common sense says that inmates will be less likely \nto seek unnecessary medical attention if they are required to pick up \npart of the tab.\n  I believe that Congress should follow the lead of the States and \nprovide the Federal Bureau of Prisons with the authority to charge \nFederal inmates a nominal fee for elective health care visits. The \nFederal system is particularly ripe for reform. According to the 1996 \nCorrections Yearbook, the system spends more per inmate on health care \nthan any State except Vermont. Federal inmate health care totaled $327 \nmillion in fiscal year 1996, up from $138 million in fiscal year 1990. \nAverage cost per inmate has increased over 60 percent during this \nperiod, from $2,204 to $3,549.\n  The Prisoner Health Care Copayment Act provides that the Director of \nthe Bureau of Prisons shall assess and collect a fee of not less than \n$3 and not more than $5 for each qualified health care visit. The term \n``qualified health care visit'' does not include any health care visit \nthat is: Conducted during the intake process; an annual examination; \ninitiated by the health care staff of the Bureau of Prisons; the direct \nresult of a referral made by a prison official; or an emergency visit. \nPrisoners who are pregnant or determined to be seriously mentally ill \nare exempted from the copayment requirement altogether. No prisoner \nshall be denied treatment on the basis of insolvency.\n  The act also gives the Director of the Bureau of Prisons the \nauthority to set by regulation a reasonable fee, not to exceed $5, for \nprescriptions, emergency visits, and juvenile visits. And the \nlegislation permits the Director to charge an inmate's account for \nmedical treatment for injuries an inmate inflicts on himself or others.\n  As I mentioned above, all fees will be deposited in the Federal Crime \nVictims' Fund.\n  Before I conclude, I would like to thank the Arizona Department of \nCorrections for its assistance in helping me draft this reform. \nAdditionally, I appreciate the assistance that Sheriff Buchanan and his \noffice provided me.\n  I look forward to working with the Department of Justice, the Bureau \nof Prisons, and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, to implement \na fee-for-medical-services program--a sensible and overdue reform--for \nFederal prisoners.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 494\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Re: Inmate Health Care--Fee for Service\n       Dear Senator Kyl: On October 15, 1994, the Arizona \n     Department of Corrections began its fee for service program \n     for inmate health care. The program was intended to reduce \n     inmate abuse of the health care delivery system, to place on \n     the inmate some responsibility for his/her own health care, \n     and to offset the increasing costs of inmate health care. \n     This program has proven itself effective in accomplishing the \n     purposes intended.\n       There has been a noticeable decrease in the number of \n     requests for health care services. For example, upon \n     implementation of the program, and depending upon the \n     facility, we experienced an initial reduction of between 40% \n     and 60% in the number health care requests. Over the life of \n     the program, there has been an overall reduction of about 31% \n     in the number of requests for health care services. This \n     strongly suggests that inmates are being more discreet about, \n     and giving more considered thought to, their need for medical \n     attention.\n       The program has also proven a great benefit to Arizona's \n     taxpayers. From October 15, 1994 through December 31, 1996, \n     the Arizona Department of Corrections has collected \n     $392,843.59 for health care services provided to its inmates. \n     This money is returned to Arizona's general fund, where it \n     can be utilized to fund other State programs. This means that \n     fewer taxpayer dollars are required to fund State programs.\n       In light of the results achieved by this program in \n     Arizona, I highly recommend that similar programs be adopted \n     by prison and jail systems nationwide, and I support and \n     greatly appreciate your efforts to this end.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Terry L. Stewart,\n                                                         Director.\n\n[[Page S2658]]\n\n     \n                                                                    ____\n                              Yavapai County Sheriff's Office,\n\n                                      Prescott, AZ, March 4, 1997.\n     Senator Jon Kyl,\n     2240 Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: As you have requested, a copy of the \n     current Yavapai County Sheriff's Office Detention Services \n     Procedure Manual with respect to Inmate Health Care Co-\n     Payment policy, has been attached. This policy is sanctioned \n     under Arizona Revised Statute 31-151 and has been in \n     existence since November 1995.\n       Prior to the institution of this policy, many inmates in \n     custody were taking advantage of the health care which, of \n     course, must be provided to them. This could be construed as \n     frivolous requests if you will, and took up the valuable time \n     of our health care providers. Time was not being utilized to \n     full potential including any request for psychological \n     analysis and treatment.\n       Since this policy has been in effect, we have realized a \n     reduction in inmate requests for medical services between 45% \n     to 50%. Consequently, when an inmate is given the choice of \n     how to best spend his money, the preference is not for \n     unnecessary medical care. Those in custody have nothing \n     better to do than take advantage of the system for just a \n     change in the daily routine. This has ceased. There is no \n     denial of medical services, it just becomes a matter of \n     priority for the inmate.\n       Over the past eleven months, in the special account in \n     which the co-payment fee is retained, approximately $3500.00 \n     has been placed into deposit. Although this is not a large \n     amount of revenue, the savings which have been noticed are \n     that of a reduction in staff time and an increase in the \n     quality of care the physician provides for this service \n     delivery. One could only imagine the magnitude of budget \n     savings if a program such as this were initiated on the \n     federal inmate population.\n       In Yavapai County this policy has proven to be a success \n     and it is through this success that you have my full support \n     in this proposed legislation.\n       In matters of mutual concern I remain,\n                                           G.C. ``Buck'' Buchanan,\n     Yavapai County Sheriff.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Post, Dec. 28, 1996]\n\n                    Toward Healthier Prison Budgets\n\n       Since April, New Jersey has experienced a 60 percent drop \n     in the number of prison inmates seeking medical attention. \n     Have prisoners suddenly begun pursuing a healthier lifestyle? \n     Perhaps--but we prefer to think it has something to do with \n     the fact that inmates must now ante up $5 every time they \n     demand to see a doctor.\n       New Jersey prison officials are extremely pleased with the \n     new system. The fee deters prisoners with vague or minor \n     complaints or whose primary motivation appears to be simply, \n     to get out of their cells for a few hours.\n       Result: The state has been able to cut its prison health-\n     care budget by $17 million. Fewer inmates being escorted to \n     and from the infirmary also enhances security within prison \n     walls.\n       Predictably, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) \n     isn't pleased. It claims the $5 fee--equal to about two days' \n     prison wages--is preventing some chronically ill inmates from \n     seeking proper care. Naturally, a lawsuit has been filed. In \n     May, a judge ruled in favor of the prison system (the \n     decision is being appealed).\n       Charging prisoners a fee for medical services, however, is \n     nothing new, nor is it unique to New Jersey. Prisons and \n     jails in at least 18 states now charge for health care, up \n     from just nine in 1995. New Jersey has allowed such fees \n     since 1995. In fact, the Bergen County jail charges inmates \n     $10 per doctor visit.\n       State prison officials dismiss the ACLU's concerns as \n     ``highly speculative.'' Inmates diagnosed with chronic \n     illnesses, the officials point out, are not charged for all \n     visits. One diabetic inmate, interviewed by The New York \n     Times, complained that the fee was a ``burden'' because it \n     meant he could no longer buy ``toothpaste and stuff.'' He \n     admitted, however, that he'd had to pay only ``three or four \n     times'' since April 1.\n       This isn't exactly Black Hole of Calcutta stuff. New Jersey \n     appears to be making good use of a sound prison-management \n     technique.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Mack, Mr. \n        Coverdell, Mr. Helms, Mr. Shelby, and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 495.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States eliminated its stockpile of \n     biological weapons pursuant to the 1972 Biological Weapons \n     Convention and has pledged to destroy its entire inventory of \n     chemical weapons by 2004, independent of the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention entering into force;\n       (2) the use of chemical or biological weapons in \n     contravention of international law is abhorrent and should \n     trigger immediate and effective sanctions;\n       (3) United Nations Security Council Resolution 620, adopted \n     on August 26, 1988, states the intention of the Security \n     Council to consider immediately ``appropriate and effective'' \n     sanctions against any nation using chemical and biological \n     weapons in violation of international law;\n       (4) the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade recognizes \n     that national security concerns may serve as legitimate \n     grounds for limiting trade; title XXI of the General \n     Agreement on Tariffs and Trade states that ``nothing in this \n     Agreement shall be construed . . . to prevent any contracting \n     party from taking any action which it considers necessary for \n     the protection of its essential security interests. . .'';\n       (5) on September 30, 1993, the President declared by \n     Executive Order No. 12868 a national emergency to deal with \n     ``the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national \n     security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States'' \n     posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological and \n     chemical weapons, and of the means for delivering such \n     weapons;\n       (6) Russia has not implemented the 1990 United States-\n     Russian Bilateral Agreement on Destruction and Non-Production \n     of Chemical Weapons and on Measures to Facilitate the \n     Multilateral Convention on Banning Chemical Weapons, known as \n     the ``BDA'', nor has the United States and Russia resolved, \n     to the satisfaction of the United States, the outstanding \n     compliance issues under the Memorandum of Understanding \n     Between the United States of America and the Government of \n     the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Regarding a Bilateral \n     Verification Experiment and Data Exchange Related To \n     Prohibition on Chemical Weapons, known as the ``1989 Wyoming \n     MOU'';\n       (7) the Intelligence Community has stated that a number of \n     countries, among them China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North \n     Korea, Syria, and Russia, possess chemical and biological \n     weapons and the means to deliver them;\n       (8) four countries in the Middle East--Iran, Iraq, Libya, \n     and Syria--have, as a national policy, supported \n     international terrorism;\n       (9) chemical and biological weapons have been used by \n     states in the past for intimidation and military aggression, \n     most recently during the Iran-Iraq war and by Iraq against \n     its Kurdish minority;\n       (10) the grave new threat of chemical and biological \n     terrorism has been demonstrated by the 1995 nerve gas attack \n     on the Tokyo subway by the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo;\n       (11) the urgent need to improve domestic preparedness to \n     protect against chemical and\n\n[[Page S2659]]\n\n     biological threats was underscored by enactment of the 1997 \n     Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act;\n       (12) the Department of Defense, in light of growing \n     chemical and biological threats in regions of key concern, \n     including Northeast Asia, and the Middle East, has stated \n     that United States forces must be properly trained and \n     equipped for all missions, including those in which opponents \n     might threaten use of chemical or biological weapons; and\n       (13) Australia Group controls on the exports of chemical \n     and biological agents, and related equipment, and the Missile \n     Technology Control Regime, together provide an indispensable \n     foundation for international and national efforts to curb the \n     spread of chemical and biological weapons, and their delivery \n     means.\n\n     SEC. 3. POLICY.\n\n       It should be the policy of the United States to take all \n     appropriate measures to--\n       (1) prevent and deter the threat or use of chemical and \n     biological weapons against the citizens, Armed Forces, and \n     territory of the United States and its allies, and to protect \n     against, and manage the consequences of, such use should it \n     occur;\n       (2) discourage the proliferation of chemical and biological \n     weapons, their means of delivery, and related equipment, \n     material, and technology;\n       (3) prohibit within the United States the development, \n     production, acquisition, stockpiling, and transfer to third \n     parties of chemical or biological weapons, their precursors \n     and related technology; and\n       (4) impose unilateral sanctions, and seek immediately \n     international sanctions, against any nation using chemical \n     and biological weapons in violation of international law.\n\n     SEC. 4.

coalition \n     partners, including those countries where the United States \n     currently deploys forces, where United States forces would \n     likely operate during regional conflicts, or which would \n     provide civilians necessary to support United States military \n     operations, to determine what steps are necessary to ensure \n     that allied and coalition forces and other critical civilians \n     are adequately equipped and prepared to operate in chemically \n     and biologically contaminated environments.\n       (2) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the \n

reorganization of the \n     United States Army Chemical School should not disrupt or \n     diminish the training and readiness of the United States \n     Armed Forces to fight in a chemical-biological warfare \n     environment; and\n       (B) the Army should continue to operate the Chemical \n     Defense Training Facility at\n\n[[Page S2665]]\n\n     Fort McClellan until such

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na credit against income tax to individuals who rehabilitate historic \nhomes or who are the first purchasers of rehabilitated historic homes \nfor use as a principal residence; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               the historic homeownership assistance act\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, all across America, in the small towns and \ngreat cities of this country, our heritage as a nation--the physical \nevidence of our past--is at risk. In virtually every corner of this \nland, homes in which grandparents and parents grew up, communities and \nneighborhoods that nurtured vibrant families, schools that were good \nplaces to learn and churches and synagogues that were filled on days of \nprayer, have suffered the ravages of abandonment and decay.\n  In the decade from 1980 to 1990, Chicago lost 41,000 housing units \nthrough abandonment, Philadelphia 10,000, and\n\n[[Page S2666]]\n\nSt. Louis 7,000. The story in our older small communities has been the \nsame, and the trend continues. It is important to understand that it is \nnot just buildings that we are losing. It is the sense of our past, the \nvitality of our communities, and the shared values of those precious \nplaces.\n  We need not stand hopelessly by as passive witnesses to the loss of \nthese irreplaceable historic resources. We can act, and to that end I \nam introducing today the Historic Homeownership Assistance Act along \nwith my distinguished colleagues, Senator Graham of Florida and Senator \nJeffords.\n  This legislation is patterned after the existing historic \nrehabilitation investment tax credit. That legislation has been \nenormously successful in stimulating private investment in the \nrehabilitation of buildings of historic importance all across the \ncountry. Through its use we have been able to save and reuse a rich and \ndiverse array of historic buildings: landmarks such as Union Station \nright here in Washington, DC, the Fox River Mills, a mixed use project \nthat was once a derelict paper mill in Appleton, WI, and the Rosa True \nSchool, an eight-unit low- and moderate-income rental project in a \nhistoric school building in Portland, ME.\n  In my own State of Rhode Island, Federal tax incentives stimulated \nthe rehabilitation and commercial reuse of more than 300 historic \nproperties. The properties saved include the Hotel Manisses on Block \nIsland, the former Valley Falls Mills complex in Central Falls, and the \nHonan Block in Woonsocket.\n  The legislation that I am introducing builds on the familiar \nstructure of the existing tax credit, but with a different focus and \na more modest scope and cost. It is designed to empower the one major \nconstituency that has been barred from using the existing credit--\nhomeowners. Only those persons who rehabilitate or purchase a newly \nrehabilitated home and occupy it as their principal residence would be \nentitled to this new credit. There would be no passive losses, no tax \nshelters and no syndications under this bill.\n\n  Like the existing investment credit, the bill would provide a credit \nto homeowners equal to 20 percent of the qualified rehabilitation \nexpenditures made on an eligible building which is used as a principal \nresidence by the owner. Eligible buildings are those individually \nlisted on the National Register of Historic Places or on a nationally \ncertified State or local historic register, or are contributing \nbuildings in national, State or local historic districts. As is the \ncase with the existing credit, the rehabilitation work would have to be \nperformed in compliance with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards \nfor Rehabilitation, although the bill clarifies that such Standards \nshould be interpreted in a manner that takes into consideration \neconomic and technical feasibility.\n  The bill allows lower-income homebuyers, who may not have sufficient \nFederal income tax liability to use a tax credit, to convert the credit \nto mortgage assistance. The legislation would permit such persons to \nreceive an Historic Rehabilitation Mortgage Credit Certificate which \nthey can use with their bank to obtain a lower interest rate on their \nmortgage or to lower the amount of their downpayment.\n  The credit would be available to condominiums and co-ops, as well as \nsingle-family buildings. If a building is rehabilitated by a developer \nfor resale, the credit would pass through to the homeowner.\n  One goal of the bill is to provide incentives for middle- and upper-\nincome families to return to older towns and cities. Therefore, the \nbill does not limit the tax benefits on the basis of income. However, \nit does impose a cap of $50,000 on the amount of credit which may be \ntaken for a principal residence.\n  The Historic Homeownership Assistance Act will make ownership of a \nrehabilitated older home more affordable for homebuyers of modest \nincomes. It will encourage more affluent families to claim a stake in \nolder towns and neighborhoods. It affords fiscally stressed cities and \ntowns a way to put abandoned buildings back on the tax rolls, while \nstrengthening their income and sales tax bases. It offers developers, \nrealtors and homebuilders a new realm of economic opportunity in \nrevitalizing decaying buildings.\n  In addition to preserving our heritage, extending this credit will \nprovide an important supplemental benefit--it will boost the economy. \nEvery dollar of Federal investment in historic rehabilitation leverages \nmany more from the private sector. Rhode Island, for example, has used \nthe credit to leverage 252 million dollars in private investment. This \ninvestment has created more than 10,000 jobs and 187 million dollars in \nwages.\n  The American dream of owning one's own home is a powerful force. This \nbill can help it come true for those who are prepared to make a \npersonnel commitment to join in the rescue of our priceless heritage. \nBy their actions they can help to revitalize decaying resources of \nhistoric importance, create jobs and stimulate economic development, \nand restore to our older towns and cities a lost sense of purpose and \ncommunity.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 496\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

To provide homeownership incentives and \n     opportunities through the rehabilitation of older buildings \n     in historic districts. To stimulate the revival of decaying \n     neighborhoods and communities, and the preservation of \n     historic buildings and districts through homeownership.\n       Rate of Credit: Eligible Buildings. The existing Historic \n     Rehabilitation Tax Credit, which provides a credit of 20 \n     percent of qualified rehabilitation expenditures to investors \n     in commercial and rental buildings, is extended to homeowners \n     who rehabilitate or purchase a newly-rehabilitated eligible \n     home and occupy it as a principal residence. In the case of \n     buildings rehabilitated by developers and sold to homeowners, \n     the credit is passed through to the home purchaser. Eligible \n     buildings are those listed individually on the National \n     Register of Historic Places or on a nationally certified \n     state or local register, and contributing buildings in \n     national, state or local historic districts.\n       Both single-family and multifamily residences, through \n     condominiums and cooperatives, qualify for the credit. In the \n     case of buildings where one section of the structure is \n     slated for residential use and another for commercial use, \n     such as in two- or three-story buildings in downtown areas, \n     purchasers could utilize the historic homeowner tax credit \n     against the rehabilitation expenditures of the residential \n     portion, and the existing commercial rehabilitation tax \n     credit for the remaining portion.\n       Maximum Credit: Minimum Expenditures. The amount of the \n     homeownership credit is limited to $50,000 for each principal \n     residence. The amount of qualified rehabilitation \n     expenditures must exceed the greater of $5,000 or the \n     adjusted tax basis of the building (excluding the land) \n     within a 24-month period. For buildings in census tracts \n     targeted as distressed for Mortgage Revenue Bond purposes and \n     those in Enterprise and Empowerment Zones, the minimum \n     expenditure is $5,000. At least five percent of the qualified \n     rehabilitation expenditures must be spent on the exterior of \n     the building.\n       Pass-Through of Credit: Carry-Forward: Recapture. In the \n     event that the rehabilitation is performed by a developer, \n     the credit accrues to the homeowner. The credit cannot be \n     used to offset the developer's tax liability, but instead \n     must be passed through to the home purchaser. The entire \n     amount of the credit is available to reduce federal income \n     tax liability, subject to Alternative Minimum Tax \n     limitations. The credit is available in the year in which the \n     expenditures are made by the taxpayer or a rehabilitated \n     property is purchased by the homeowner. Any unused credit \n     would be carried forward until fully exhausted. In the event \n     the taxpayer fails to maintain the home as a principal \n     residence for five years, the credit is subject to recapture.\n       No ``Passive Loss''; No Income Limit. The credit is not \n     subject to the ``passive loss'' limitations. Further, since \n     the legislation is intended to promote economic diversity \n     among residents and increase local property, income and sales \n     tax revenues, taxpayers are eligible for the credit without \n     regard to income.\n       Standards for Historic Rehabilitation. To qualify for the \n     credit, the rehabilitation must be performed in accordance \n     with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for \n     Rehabilitation, which guide eligibility of expenditures under \n     the existing commercial rehabilitation tax credit. The intent \n     of the Standards is to assist the long-term preservation of a \n     property's significance through the preservation of historic \n     materials and features. The Standards are to be applied to \n     specific rehabilitation projects in a reasonable manner, \n     taking into consideration economic and technical feasibility. \n     The proposed legislation clarifies this directive.\n       State-Level Certifications. As under the existing \n     commercial rehabilitation tax credit program, State Historic \n     Preservation Officers and Certified Local Governments are \n     given the authority to certify the rehabilitation of \n     buildings within their respective jurisdictions. States are \n     given the authority to levy fees for processing applications \n     for certification of the rehabilitation expenditures, \n     provided that the proceeds of such fees are used solely to \n     defray expenses associated with processing the application.\n       Historic Rehabilitation Mortgage Credit Certificates. Lower \n     income taxpayers may not have sufficient income tax liability \n     to take full use of the credit. The legislation permits \n     anyone eligible for the income tax credit to convert it into \n     a mortgage credit certificate which could be used either to \n     reduce the interest rate on a home mortgage loan or to lower \n     the down payment required to purchase the property.\n       Under this option, the taxpayer transfers the certificate \n     to the mortgage lender in exchange for a reduced interest \n     rate on a home mortgage loan. The mortgage lender then uses \n     the credit to reduce its federal income tax liability, \n     subject to Alternative Minimum Tax limitations. The credit \n     claimed by the mortgage lender is not subject to recapture.\n       In many distressed neighborhoods, the cost of \n     rehabilitating a home and bringing it to market significantly \n     exceeds the value at which the property is appraised by the \n     mortgage lender. This gap imposes a significant burden on a \n     potential homeowner because the required downpayment exceeds \n     his or her means. The legislation permits the mortgage credit \n     certificate to be used to reduce the buyer's downpayment, \n     rather than to reduce the interest rate, in order to close \n     this gap. This provision is limited to historic districts \n     which qualify as targeted under the existing Mortgage Revenue \n     Bond program or are located in enterprise or empowerment \n     zones.\n       Although the right to receive an Historic Rehabilitation \n     Mortgage Credit Certificate is available to all persons \n     entitled to the tax credit, the certificate may not be used \n     by a person who would be precluded from using the income tax \n     credit because of the Alternative Minimum Tax limitation.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I join my colleague Senator Chafee \nin support of the Historic Homeownership Assistance Act. This bill \nwould spur growth and preservation of historic neighborhoods across the \ncountry by providing a limited tax credit for qualified rehabilitation \nexpenditures to historic homes.\n  An understanding of the history of the United States serves as one of \nthe cornerstones supporting this great nation. We find American history \nreflected not only in books, films, and stories, but also in physical \nstructures, including schools, churches, county courthouses, mills, \nfactories, and personal residences.\n  The bill that Senator Chafee and I are cosponsoring focuses on the \npreservation of historic residences. The bill will assist Americans who \nwant to safeguard, maintain, and reside in these homes which chronicle \nAmerica's past.\n  The Historic Homeownership Assistance Act will stimulate \nrehabilitation of historic homes while contributing to the \nrevitalization of urban communities. The Federal tax credit provided in \nthe legislation is modeled after the existing Federal commercial \nhistoric rehabilitation tax credit. Since 1981, this commercial tax \ncredit has facilitated the preservation of many historic structures \nacross this great land. For example in the last two decades, in my home \nState of Florida, $238 million in private capital was invested in over \n325 historic rehabilitation projects. These investments helped preserve \nYbor City in Tampa and the Springfield Historic District in \nJacksonville.\n  The tax credit, however, has never applied to personal residences. It \nis time to provide an incentive to individuals to restore and preserve \nhomes in America's historic communities.\n  The Historic Homeownership Assistance Act targets Americans at all \neconomic levels. The bill provides lower income Americans with the \noption to elect a Mortgage Credit Certificate in lieu of the tax \ncredit. This certificate allows Americans who cannot take advantage of \nthe tax credit to reduce the interest rate on their mortgage that \nsecures the purchase and rehabilitation of a historic home.\n  For example, if a lower-income family were to purchase a $35,000 home \nwhich included $25,000 worth of qualified rehabilitation expenditures, \nit would be entitled to a $5,000 Historic Rehabilitation Mortgage \nCredit Certificate which could be used to reduce interest payments on \nthe mortgage. This provision would enable families to obtain a home and \npreserve historic neighborhoods when they would be unable to do so \notherwise.\n  Mr. President, the time has come for Congress to get serious about \nurban renewal. For too long, we have sat on the sidelines watching idly \nas our citizens slowly abandoned entire homes and neighborhoods in \nurban settings, leaving cities like Miami in Florida and others around \nthe nation in financial jeopardy. For example, according to U.S. Census \ndata, in the decade from 1980 to 1990, Chicago lost 41,000 housing \nunits, Philadelphia 10,000, and St. Louis 7,000. The erosion of a sense \nof community and culture once shared by our urban neighborhoods and \ntowns further magnifies the loss.\n  By addressing years of neglect and a general decline in investment in \nour older neighborhoods, this bill will empower families and \nindividuals with the financial incentives needed to revitalize historic \nhousing in our urban communities.\n  Recognizing that the States can best administer laws affecting unique \ncommunities, the act gives power to the\n\n[[Page S2669]]\n\nSecretary of the Interior to work with states to implement a number of \nthe provisions.\n  The Historic Homeownership Assistance Act does not, however, reflect \nan untried proposal. In addition to the existing commercial historic \nrehabilitation credit, the proposed bill incorporates features from \nseveral state tax incentives for the preservation of historic homes. \nColorado, Maryland, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and Utah have \npioneered their own successful versions of a historic preservation tax \nincentive for homeownership.\n  At the Federal level, this legislation would promote historic home \npreservation nationwide, allowing future generations of Americans to \nvisit and reside in homes that tell the unique history of our \ncommunities. The Historic Homeownership Assistance Act will offer \nenormous potential for saving historic homes and bringing entire \nneighborhoods back to life.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill for the preservation of \nhistory.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COVERDELL (for himself and Mr. Faircloth):\n  S. 497. A bill to amend the National Labor Relations Act and the \nRailway Labor Act to repeal the provisions of the Acts that require \nemployees to pay union dues or fees as a condition of employment; to \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                 the national right to work act of 1997\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the \nCoverdell-Faircloth National Right to Work Act of 1997. As many of you \nknow, my esteemed colleague from North Carolina, Senator Lauch \nFaircloth, introduced this language last Congress and I commend Senator \nFaircloth for his outstanding leadership on this issue.\n  This bill does not add a single word to Federal law. Rather, it would \nrepeal those sections of the National Labor Relations Act and Railway \nLabor Act that authorize the imposition of forced-dues contracts on \nworking Americans. I believe that every worker must have the right to \njoin or support a labor union. This bill protects that right. But no \nworker should ever be forced to join a union.\n  I am happy to say that my own state, Georgia, is among one of the 21 \nstates that is a ``Right to Work'' state and has been since 1947. \nAccording to U.S. News and World Report, 7 of the strongest 10 State \neconomies in the nation have Right to Work laws. Workers who have the \nfreedom to choose whether or not to join a union have a higher standard \nof living than their counterparts in non-Right to Work States. \nAccording to Dr. James Bennett, an economist with the highly respected \neconomics department at George Mason University, on average, urban \nfamilies in Right to Work States have approximately $2,852 more annual \npurchasing power than urban families in non-Right to Work States when \nthe lower taxes, housing and food costs of Right to Work States are \ntaken into consideration.\n  According to a poll by the respected Marketing Research Institute, 77 \npercent of Americans support Right to Work, and over 50 percent of \nunion households believe workers should have the right to choose \nwhether or not to join or pay dues to a labor union. That should be no \nsurprise. Because what this is all about is freedom. And right to work \nexpands every working American's personal freedom.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that \nexpands the freedom of hard working Americans and gives them the \nfreedom to choose whether to accept or reject union representation and \nunion dues without facing coercion, violence, and work-place harassment \nby union officials.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, today I join with my good friend, \nSenator Coverdell to introduce the National Right to Work Act of 1997. \nThis is the same legislation that I introduced during the 104th \nCongress, and I am delighted to have Senator Coverdell as a partner in \nthis effort during the 105th Congress.\n  As I have said before, and continue to believe strongly, compulsory \nunionism violates the fundamental principle of individual liberty--the \nvery principle upon which this Nation was founded. Compulsory unionism \nbasically says that workers cannot and should not decide for themselves \nwhat is in their best interest. I can think of nothing more offensive \nto the core American principles of liberty and freedom.\n  The National Right to Work Act will address this most fundamental \nproblem of federal labor policy: does America believe that working men \nand women should be forced, as a condition of employment, to pay dues \nor fees to a labor union? I believe, as does my colleague, Senator \nCoverdell and many others, that no one should be forced to pay union \ndues just to get or keep a job.\n  The National Right to Work Act would not change a single word of \nFederal law. Rather, the measure would repeal those sections of the \nNational Labor Relations Act and Railway Labor Act that authorize the \nimposition of forced-dues contracts on working Americans. I believe \nthat every worker must have the right to join or support a labor union. \nThis bill protects that right. However, no worker should be forced to \njoin a union.\n  In 1965, Senator Everett Dirksen said of compulsory unionism, ``Is \nthere a more fundamental right than to make a living for one's family \nwithout being compelled to join a labor organization?'' I could not \nagree more.\n  Mr. President, again let me say that I am pleased to introduce today \nwith Senator Coverdell the National Right to Work Act of 1977.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 498. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow an \nemployee to elect to receive taxable cash compensation on lieu of \nnontaxable parking benefits, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n                    the commuter choice act of 1997\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, one of the greatest challenges facing \nmetropolitan areas in our Nation is finding a way to reduce traffic \ncongestion. Commuters in cities across the country spend countless \nhours on the road traveling to and from work. This traffic places \ntremendous pressure on our highway infrastructure and causes monumental \nenvironmental problems. More than 100 cities fail to meet today's clean \nair standards. The best way to clean up our air is to reduce the number \nof automobiles which are driven on a daily basis.\n  Unfortunately, our current tax laws actually encourage commuters to \ntravel to work in single occupant automobiles. Today, employers can \nprovide parking to their employees as a tax-free fringe benefit. As \npart of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, the value of parking that \nqualifies for this benefit is limited to $170 per month. By comparison, \ntax-free transit or van-pool benefits are limited to only $65 per \nmonth.\n  There is another aspect of this benefit that makes the tax-free \nparking an even greater incentive for employees to drive to work. The \nfringe benefit must be offered by employers on a take-it-or-leave-it \nbasis. In other words, the employee has the option of accepting the \nemployer-paid parking or nothing at all. The tax-exempt status of the \nemployer-provided parking is lost if employees are offered a choice \nbetween the parking fringe benefit and taxable salary.\n  Let me illustrate the problem this creates. Suppose an employer has \ntwo employees, Sally and Jim. Under current law, the employer can pay \nfor a parking space at a garage next door. This fringe benefit will not \nbe taxable to Sally and Jim so long as the cost does not exceed $170 \nper month. But, let's assume that Sally would prefer to receive cash \ninstead of a parking space, because she can commute to work with her \nhusband or take public transportation. The way the law is currently \nwritten, Sally's employer cannot offer her cash instead of the parking \nfringe benefit, because it would cause Jim's parking fringe benefit to \nbecome taxable.\n  The Commuter Choice Act of 1997, which I am introducing today along \nwith my colleague Senator Moynihan, corrects this bias in the Tax Code \nby allowing employers to offer their employees the choice of tax-free \nparking or taxable cash compensation. This proposal is completely \nvoluntary. Employers are not required to offer cash in lieu of parking. \nFurthermore, it has absolutely no affect on employees wishing to \ncontinue receiving tax-free parking. That fringe benefit would remain \nexempt from income and payroll taxes. However, my proposal would\n\n[[Page S2670]]\n\nallow employees not interested in the parking fringe benefit to opt \ninstead for taxable cash compensation.\n\n  Intuitively, I believe Voluntary Cash Out will have positive revenue \nconsequences for the Federal Government. Some individuals who currently \nreceive tax-free parking will instead opt for taxable cash \ncompensation. For example, trading in a parking space in many cities \ncould be worth almost $2,000 in pretax salary annually, a powerful \nincentive to consider alternative ways of getting to work. An \noverwhelming majority of employees receive tax-free parking from their \nemployers--95 percent who drive to work, according to the National \nPersonal Transportation Survey. So, even if only a small portion of \nthis population chooses the taxable cash it should lead to a \nsubstantial revenue windfall.\n  In 1992, the State of California enacted legislation that required \nemployers with 50 or more employees to offer cash in lieu of parking if \nthe employer subsidized commuter parking. A recent study of eight \nemployers who complied with this law provides some evidence of how \nbusinesses and their employees might react to Commuter Choice. For the \nnearly 1,700 employees of the eight firms, the solo driver share fell \nfrom 76 to 63 percent; to carpool share increased from 14 to 23 \npercent. More importantly, because many employees voluntarily chose \ntaxable cash over tax-exempt parking, State and Federal income tax \nrevenues increased by $56 per employee per year.\n  Finally, employer interest in programs like Commuter Choice will \nincrease as pressure builds to reduce traffic congestion and air \npollution in our Nation's cities. Many urban areas that are in \nnonattainment for national air quality standards have incorporated \nemployee commute option programs as part of their State implementation \nplans. These programs are hampered, however, by the current tax rules, \nwhich prohibit employees from trading in tax-free parking for cash and \nutilizing alternative commute options. The Commuter Choice Act removes \nthat prohibition.\n  I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation, which offers \ngreater flexibility to employers and employees, and which will have a \nsubstantial positive effect on our air quality.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 498\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Commuter Choice Act of \n     1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ELECTION TO RECEIVE TAXABLE CASH COMPENSATION IN LIEU \n                   OF NONTAXABLE PARKING BENEFITS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 132(f)(4) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to benefits not in lieu of \n     compensation) is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new sentence: ``This paragraph shall not apply to any \n     qualified parking provided in lieu of compensation which \n     otherwise would have been includible in gross income of the \n     employee.''\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to qualified parking provided after December 31, \n     1997.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Gregg):\n  S. 499. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nan election to exclude from the gross estate of a decedent the value of \ncertain land subject to a qualified conservation easement, and to make \ntechnical changes to alternative valuation rules; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n           the american farm and ranch protection act of 1997\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, a serious environmental problem facing the \ncountry today is the loss of open space to development. All across the \ncountry, farms, ranches, forests, and wetlands are forced to give way \nto the pressures for new office buildings, shopping malls, and housing \ndevelopments.\n  America is losing over 4 square miles of land to development every \nday. In Rhode Island, over 11 thousand acres of farmland have been lost \nto development since 1974. In many instances, this is simply the \nnatural outgrowth of urbanization of our society. Other times it is the \ndirect result of improper planning at the State and local levels.\n  But frequently, the pressure comes from the need to raise funds to \npay estate taxes. For those families where undeveloped land represents \na significant portion of the estate's total value, the need to pay the \ntax creates powerful pressure to develop or sell off part or all of the \nland or to liquidate the timber resources of the land. Because land is \nappraised by the Internal Revenue Service according to its highest and \nbest use, and such use is often its development value, the effect of \nthe tax is to make retention of undeveloped land impossible.\n  In addition, our current estate tax policy results in complicated \nvaluation disputes between the donor's estate and the Internal Revenue \nService. In many cases, the additional costs incurred as a result of \nthese disagreements cause a potential donor of a conservation easement \nto decide not to make the contribution.\n  These open spaces improve the quality of life for Americans \nthroughout this great Nation and provide important habitat for fish and \nwildlife. The question is how do we conserve our most valuable resource \nduring this time of significant budget constraints.\n  Mr. President, I think we need to restructure the Nation's estate tax \nlaws to remove the disincentive for private property owners to conserve \nenvironmentally significant land. The American Farm and Ranch \nProtection Act, which I am introducing today along with Senators Baucus \nand Gregg, will help to achieve this goal by providing an exemption \nfrom the estate tax for the value of land that is subject to a \nqualified, permanent conservation easement.\n  This bill is similar to legislation that we introduced during the \n104th Congress and was included in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. It \nexcludes land subject to a conservation easement from the estate and \ngift taxes. Development rights retained by the family--most frequently \nthe ability to use the property for a commercial purpose--remain \nsubject to the estate tax.\n  In order to target the incentives under this bill to those areas that \nare truly at risk for development, the bill is limited to land that \nfalls within a 50-mile radius of a metropolitan area, a national park \nor a national wilderness area, or an urban national forest.\n  Conservation easements, which are entirely voluntary, are agreements \nnegotiated by landowners in which a restriction upon the future use of \nland is imposed in order to conserve those aspects of the land that are \npublicly significant. To qualify for the estate tax exemption under \nthis bill, such easements must be perpetual and must be made to \npreserve open space, to protect the natural habitat of fish, wildlife, \nor plants, to meet a governmental conservation policy, or to preserve a \nhistorically important land area.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to save \nenvironmentally sensitive open spaces.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 499\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

These \n     safeguards include the following:\n       The easement must be perpetual and meet the requirements of \n     Code Section 170(h), governing deductions for charitable \n     contributions of easements;\n       Easements retaining the right to develop the property for \n     commercial recreational use would not be eligible, while \n     other retained development rights would be taxed;\n       Land excluded from the estate tax would receive a \n     carryover, rather than stepped-up, basis for purposes of \n     calculating gain on a subsequent sale;\n       The land must have been owned by the decedent or a member \n     of the decedent's family for at least three years immediately \n     prior to the decedent's death; and,\n       The easement must have been donated by the decedent or a \n     member of the decedent's family.\n       Under Section 170(h) easements will qualify only if they \n     are made to a federal, state or local governmental unit or \n     certain non-profit groups. In addition, they must be made: To \n     preserve land areas for outdoor recreation by the general \n     public; to protect the natural habitat of fish, wildlife, or \n     plants; or, to preserve open space (including farmland and \n     forest land).\n       The bill is effective for decedents dying, or gifts made, \n     after December 31, 1996.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Chafee in introducing the American Farm and Ranch Protection \nAct today. This bill represents a bipartisan effort to help protect the \nopen lands of our great country.\n  Montana is know as Big Sky country for a reason, our expansive open \nareas dedicated to farming, ranching, and forestry rather than building \nand development. Our open lands represent a way of life in Montana, \nthey are part of our environmental and cultural heritage. And they are \nrapidly disappearing as ranches and farms make way for houses and \nbuilding complexes.\n  America is losing over 4 square miles of land to development every \nday. In Montana alone, since 1987 over 560,000 acres of farmland have \nbeen taken out of farm use. Since 1974 the number of acres of land \ntaken our of farm use exceeds 2.5 million.\n  Frequently, the pressure to abandon the farm use of land comes from \nthe need to raise funds to pay estate taxes. For those families where \nundeveloped land represents a significant portion of the estate's total \nvalue, often the heirs must develop or sell off part or all of the land \nmerely in order to pay the tax. Because land is typically appraised by \nthe Internal Revenue Service according to its highest and best use, \nwhich usually assumes development on the property, retention of \nundeveloped land is very difficult.\n  I have attempted to resolve this problem through changes in the \nestate tax itself by my sponsorship of the bipartisan Estate Tax Relief \nfor the American Family Act of 1997. That bill will make it easier for \nall family-owned businesses, including farms and ranches, to be passed \non to succeeding generations. At the same time, however, I believe it \nis important to provide an incentive for the permanent preservation of \nenvironmentally significant land, so that our legacy to our children \nwill include Montana's open lands. The American Farm and Ranch \nProtection Act, which Senator Chafee and I are introducing today, will \nhelp to achieve this goal by providing an exemption from the estate tax \nfor the value of land that is subject to a qualified, permanent \nconservation easement.\n  Conservation easements, which are entirely voluntary, are agreements \nnegotiated by landowners in which a restriction upon the future use of \nland is imposed in order to conserve those aspects of the land that are \npublicly significant. To qualify for the estate tax exemption under \nthis bill, the easements must be perpetual and must be made to preserve \nopen space, to protect the natural habitat of fish, wildlife or plants, \nto meet a government conservation policy, or to preserve a important \nhistorical heritage area.\n  Title 5 of this bill represents an effort to clarify an area of the \nlaw that is of particular importance in Montana. Under current law, \nwhen mineral rights have been severed from the surface rights in a \npiece of property, and a qualified conservation easement is created by \nthe owner of the surface rights for the benefit of a nonprofit entity, \nthat owner is unable to take a charitable deduction unless two \nconditions are met: the probability of surface mining occurring on the \nproperty must be so remote as to be negligible, and the severance of \nthe mineral rights must have occurred before June 13, 1976. In Montana, \nseverance of mineral rights for many properties occurred many \ngenerations earlier, and they have often been disbursed to farflung \nrelatives in very small portions. So the probability that mining will \noccur is, indeed, very remote. The Internal Revenue Service, however, \nhas asserted that some uncertainty exists about the congressional \nintent behind the term ``ownership of the surface estate and mineral \ninterest first separated after June 12, 1976.''\n  I was the original authority of the language in question, and I have \ncommunicated with the IRS regarding my intention when the language was \ndrafted. However, IRS has been unwilling to issue a favorable letter \nruling which would clarify this issue, and as a consequence, it is \nimpossible for many Western landowners to make voluntary charitable \ncontributions of conservation easements in order to protect important \nWestern land. In light of the confusion that this date has caused, and \nbecause it has no policy justification, our legislation would eliminate \nthe 1976 date from the statute.\n  I believe this bill can be an important tool for America's farm and \nranch families to utilize in preserving their homesteads. At the same \ntime, it makes a significant contribution to the larger public good of \nconserving America's increasingly threatened rural lands. I urge my \ncolleagues to join on the bill as cosponsors, and encourage the \nadministration to support the legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 500. A bill to authorize emergency appropriations for cleanup and \nrepair of damages to facilities of Yosemite National Park and other \nCalifornia national parks caused by heavy rains and flooding in \nDecember 1996 and January 1997, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n        THE YOSEMITE EMERGENCY RESTORATION AND CONSTRUCTION ACT\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am today introducing a bill that will \nauthorize emergency appropriations for cleanup and repair of damages to \nfacilities of Yosemite National Park and other National Park Service \nareas in California caused by heavy rains and flooding in December 1996 \nand January 1997.\n  I expect most of the issues regarding emergency cleanup and repair \ndue to floods in California to be addressed through the appropriations \nprocess. I do not therefore expect this bill to be taken up by the \nappropriate Senate committee and passed by the Senate. The primary \npurpose of introducing this bill is to set a benchmark for recovery and \ncleanup efforts at Yosemite National Park.\n  My bill takes several steps beyond the bill that was introduced last \nmonth by Congressman Doolittle and Radanovich:\n  First, it authorizes emergency funding. Second, it authorizes a \nspecific amount--$200 million in emergency funds in fiscal year 1997. \nThird, it specifies that funds shall only be spent in a manner that is \nconsistent with the Yosemite general management plan, the concession \nservices plan, and when adopted, the Yosemite Valley housing plan, and \nthe valley implementation plan. Fourth, it specifies that funds spent \non repair and rebuilding of concessions facilities shall be recovered \nby the Secretary of the Interior to the greatest extent practicable \naccording to the Department of the Interior's contract with the \nconcessioner. Fifth, it authorizes emergency grants to satellite \ncommunities around Yosemite to provide mass transit visitor \ntransportation into the park during repair and restoration activities \non access roads. Sixth, it authorizes emergency appropriations for \nother California parks that suffered flood damage including Redwood \nNational Park, Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park, and others. Seventh, \nit authorizes $7 million to be appropriated in fiscal year 1998 and \nsuch sums as may be necessary for each fiscal year thereafter for a \nmass transit system for Yosemite.\n  Mr. President, the primary goal of the emergency restoration and \nconstruction activities authorized in this bill is to reopen Yosemite \nNational\n\n[[Page S2673]]\n\nPark and restore services to Park visitors as quickly and safely as \npossible.\n  The importance of emergency funding for Yosemite cannot be \noverstated. It is a unique national treasure, recognized all over the \nworld for its spectacular natural beauty. Over 1.4 million people visit \nthe park every year including tens of thousands of international \nvisitors who travel to California for the sole purpose of staying in \nthe park to experience nature. John Muir--one of our nation's founding \nleaders of environmental conservation--first encountered the majestic \nYosemite Valley in 1864 and immediately realized the importance of \npreserving its natural wonders. Muir's foresight and passion resulted \nin the establishment of Yosemite National Park in October 1890. At its \nonset, the park included 60,000 acres miles of scenic wild lands. \nToday, some 106 years later, the park embraces over 761,236 acres of \ngranite peaks, broad meadows, glacially carved domes, giant sequoias, \nsecluded tarns, and breathtaking waterfalls.\n\n  This winter, tropical storms with heavy rain caused serious flooding \nin the park. Yosemite's major rivers and tributaries flooded many park \nareas and caused severe damage to infrastructure. Over 350 damage \nassessments have been completed by engineers, architects, resource \nspecialists, and other technical experts. Their first damage assessment \nreport shows serious damage to the four main routes leading into the \npark, major electrical and sewer systems, 224 units of employee \nhousing, over 500 guest lodging units, over 350 campsites, 17 \nrestoration projects, and over 10 archeological sites.\n  According to the National Park Service, full recovery will take \nyears. We now begin the recovery period during which, interim solutions \nwill be put in place such as temporary housing and lodging while \npermanent construction is being completed.\n  The Yosemite Emergency Restoration and Reconstruction Act would \nauthorize $200 million in emergency funds to be appropriated to the \nSecretary of Interior for cleanup and repair of flood damages to the \nfacilities of Yosemite National Park caused by heavy rains and flooding \nin December 1996 and January 1997, and other national parks in the \nState of California. The funds are authorized to remain available until \nexpended.\n  The authorization requires that any emergency funds spent at Yosemite \nbe consistent with the Yosemite General Management Plan, the Concession \nServices Plan, and when adopted, the Yosemite Valley Housing Plan, and \nthe Valley Implementation Plan.\n  Funds are authorized to be spent on repair, restoration, and \nrelocation, where appropriate, of infrastructure vital to Yosemite \nNational Park operations, including but not limited to roads, trails, \nutilities, buildings, grounds--including campgrounds--natural \nresources, cultural resources, and lost and damaged property, both \nwithin the park boundaries and at the El Portal administrative site \nservicing the park.\n  Also, funds are authorized to repair and relocation of park employee \nhousing and the Resource Management Office; repair, maintenance, and \nopening of Tioga Pass Road within the boundaries of the park; and \nrepair and expeditious opening of highways 120, 140, and 41 within the \nboundaries of the park.\n  The bill requires that funds spent on repair and relocation of \nconcession-operated rental cabins, motel rooms, rental structures, and \nconcession employee housing and facilities be recovered by the \nDepartment of the Interior to the greatest extent practicable, within \nthe provisions of the concession contract between the Department of the \nInterior and the Yosemite Concession Services.\n  Mr. President, a key aspect to the bill is the authorization of $2.5 \nmillion in emergency grants to satellite communities around Yosemite \nNational Park for the purpose of providing mass transit visitor \ntransportation into the park during repair and restoration activities \non access roads to the park.\n  Other California parks suffered flood damage. My bill would authorize \nemergency funds for Redwood National Park, Sequoia-Kings Canyon \nNational Park, Lassen Volcanic National Park, Whiskeytown National \nRecreation Area, Devils Postpile National Monument, and Lava Beds \nNational Monument.\n  Last, Mr. President, my bill authorizes $7 million to be appropriated \nin fiscal year 1998 and such sums as may be necessary for each fiscal \nyear thereafter to the Secretary of Interior for the purpose of helping \nestablish a mass transit system for Yosemite National Park--\nspecifically for the purchase of electric buses and alternative-fueled \nbuses.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 500\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nall taxpayers with a 50-percent deduction for capital gains, to \nincrease the exclusion for gain on qualified small business stock, to \nindex the basis of certain capital assets, to allow the capital loss \ndeduction for losses on the sale or exchange of an individual's \nprincipal residence, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n             the return capital to the american people act\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, along \nwith Senator Shelby, which provides real cuts in the capital gains rate \nand indexes capital gains to account for inflation. As we work to \nachieve a balanced budget, it is our belief that a real reduction in \nthe capital gains rate is essential to ensure greater growth, \ninnovation, and prosperity. Accordingly, the legislation we have \nproposed offers the best elements of existing capital gains proposals.\n  Perhaps most importantly, this proposal ensures that homeowners, \nfamily farms, and small businesses are not penalized for inflationary--\nphantom--gains by providing for the indexation of capital gains. The \nimportance of indexation is made clear in the accompanying report \nrecently prepared by the Joint Economic Committee.\n  Additionally, our bill will offer a 50-percent rate reduction for \nindividuals and corporations, and allow the deduction for a loss on the \nsale of a principal residence.\n  Finally, this legislation encourages investment in small businesses \nby increasing the exclusion from gains for small business stock from 50 \nto 75 percent; reducing the requirement for holding stock from 5 to 3 \nyears; increasing the eligibility size to $100 million, and providing a \n60-day grace period for the rollover of stock between small businesses.\n  Again, I want to restate the importance of a reduced capital gains \nrate, which benefits all Americans by stimulating economic growth and \nprosperity and leading to innovation in biomedical research and other \nlife-enhancing technologies. I look forward to my colleagues joining me \nin this effort to ensure that a real capital gains rate reduction is \nincluded in any balanced budget package the Congress puts together in \nthe coming months.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Indexing Capital Gains\n\n                       (Prepared by Robert Stein)\n\n       The case for cutting the capital gains tax is simple and \n     straightforward: It is a win-win situation for all involved--\n     for taxpayers, workers and government revenue.\n       Everyone who invests would get more bang for their buck. \n     This includes people who start small businesses, workers who \n     have pension money in stocks and those who save for life's \n     goals, like a downpayment on a home, a college education or \n     retirement. More than 40% percent of families own stocks, \n     either directly or indirectly, including more than 25% of the \n     families making between $10,000 and $25,000 per year.\\1\\ And \n     contrary to conventional wisdom, cutting the capital gains \n     tax will increase government revenue, making it easier to \n     balance the budget.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       One way to cut the capital gains tax is to limit the tax to \n     real increases in the prices of assets, over and above \n     inflation. This is called indexing. Without indexing, \n     effective tax rates can be much higher than the government's \n     official rate. Consider a couple that buys $10,000 worth of \n     stocks in 1966, to help pay for their retirement. In 1996, \n     they would have about $79,000 worth of stocks.\\2\\ Cashing-in \n     these stocks could require a tax of about $19,000.\\3\\ But \n     much of their gain--the difference between their initial \n     investment and the $79,000 they end up with--was due to \n     inflation, not real increases in purchasing power. In fact, \n     the couple only had about $30,000 in real gains, over and \n     above inflation.\\4\\ And a tax of $19,000 or $30,000 in gains \n     is an effective tax rate of 63%.\n       Chart 1 shows a history of the difference between the top \n     official tax rate on capital gains and the top effective tax \n     rate, taking inflation into account.\\5\\ As Chart 1 shows, the \n     effective tax rate on capital gains can greatly exceed the \n     official rate, even going well above 100%. In fact, if an \n     investor sells an asset that increased in price, but which \n     didn't keep pace with inflation, she would have to pay taxes \n     without enjoying any real gain at all! It doesn't take much \n     of an imagination to see how the fear of such taxes could \n     deter investment.\n       (Chart not reproductible in Record.)\n       Would cutting taxes on capital gains reduce government \n     revenue, making it tougher to balance the budget? Certainly \n     not. In fact, cutting the effective tax rate on capital gains \n     should boost revenue. As the following table shows, \n     government revenue from the capital gains tax has grown much \n     more quickly when the effective tax rate has been low or \n     falling than when it's been high or rising.\n\n                  FIVE PHASES OF THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX                  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               Capital  \n                                                                gains   \n           Years                Effective tax rates (in      revenue \\6\\\n                                        percent)               (percent \n                                                              per year) \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1954-1967.................

Falling (61 to 50).............          +10\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Put simply, reducing the effective tax rate on capital \n     gains would kill two birds with one stone: It would both ease \n     the tax burden and make it easier to balance the budget. Case \n     in point: The last time the government cut the official tax \n     rate on capital gains, revenue from the capital gains tax \n     rose from $22 billion to $36 billion in only five years.\\9\\\n\n\n                         Questions and Answers\n\n       Q: Wouldn't indexation complicate the tax code, as \n     taxpayers would have to keep track of not only the cost of \n     their assets but also the inflation adjustment for each?\n       A: No. People would have the option of indexing, but could \n     still use the non-indexed cost of their assets when figuring \n     out the amount of their gains. This would mostly happen when \n     inflation was low and the asset wasn't held very long.\n       Q: If we index capital gains for inflation, don't we have \n     to index debts too? And since it's too difficult to index \n     debts for tax purposes, shouldn't we leave the system the way \n     it is?\n       A: No. This argument confuses key differences between \n     equity and debt. Theoretically, the tax code could let \n     lenders index their interest income, so they only have to pay \n     taxes on the interest they earn over and above inflation. But \n     for every $1 that lenders reduce their taxable income, \n     borrowers would have to reduce the amount of interest they \n     deduct. Overall, debt transactions would still feel the same \n     tax bite. Only the distribution of the taxes would change: \n     Lenders would pay less; borrowers would pay more. But lenders \n     and borrowers already apportion the tax burden between \n     themselves. It's factored into the interest rate. This \n     interest rate also reflects the inflation the two parties \n     expect, as well as the risk that inflation will differ in \n     either party's favor.\n       By contrast, bargaining over tax costs doesn't happen with \n     equity. Unlike with debts, nobody deducts capital gains as a \n     cost. Indexing gains would not simply shift the tax burden \n     from one party to another. It would reduce the total tax \n     burden placed on investments in equity, to reflect the \n     erosion of capital gains by inflation.\n\n\n                                endnotes\n\n     \\1\\ Family Finances in the U.S.: Recent Evidence from the \n     Survey of Consumer Finances, Federal Reserve Bulletin, \n     January 1997.

To \n     avoid a result where people get taxed on zero or negative \n     real gains (which implies a tax rate of infinity!) I assume \n     people earned a 5% real return per year. This method has the \n     added benefit of giving us a view of the expected capital \n     gain tax rate, as almost all people invest with the \n     expectation that they will get a positive return. The \n     expected tax rate should drive investment decisions more than \n     any other tax rate.\n     \\6\\ Changes in real revenue, with nominal revenue figures \n     adjusted by the consumer price index for urban workers.\n     \\7\\ This annual rate of changes does not include the huge \n     increase in government revenue in 1986, as people cashed in \n     their gains to avoid an oncoming tax hike in 1987. In other \n     words, as favorable as the data in the table looks for \n     keeping capital gains taxes low, it could have made the table \n     even more favorable, if 1986 were used as the end point. \n     Instead, the increase in gains during this era of lower taxes \n     is cut off in 1985, at a much lower point than the 1986 \n     point.\n     \\8\\ This calculation does not use the 1986 peak as the \n     starting point.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide post-eligibility treatment of certain payments received under a \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs pension or compensation program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                    state veterans' home legislation\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nwhich, when enacted, will modify the treatment of certain veterans \nbenefits received by veterans who reside in State veterans homes and \nwhose care\n\n[[Page S2675]]\n\nand treatment is paid for by the Medicaid program. I am joined in \nintroducing this bill by Senator Graham.\n  Veterans residing in State veterans homes, who are eligible for aid \nand attendance [AA] and unusual medical expense [UME] benefits, \nveterans benefits provided under title 38 of the United States Code, \nwho are also eligible for Medicaid, are the only veterans in nursing \nhomes who receive, and who are able to keep, the entire AA and UME \nbenefit amounts. This can be as much as $1,000 per month.\n  Other veterans, who reside in other types of nursing homes are \nreceiving Medicaid, and who are also eligible for AA/UME can receive \nonly 90 per month from the VA.\n  Yet, other veterans who reside in State veterans homes but who are \nnot eligible for the AA/UME benefits must contribute all but $90 of \ntheir income to the cost of their care.\n  So, even though veterans residing in State veterans homes who are \neligible for AA and UME benefits and who qualify for Medicaid have all \nof their treatment and living expense paid by the State Medicaid \nprogram, they nevertheless may keep as much as $1,000 per month of the \nAA and UME benefits.\n  It might be useful for me to review how this state of affairs came to \nbe.\n  In 1990, legislation was enacted, Public Law 101-508, November 5, \n1990, which modified title 38, the veterans benefits title of the \nUnited States Code, to stipulate that veterans with no dependents, on \ntitle XIX, residing in nursing homes, and eligible for AA and UME, \ncould receive only a $90 per month personal expense allowance from the \nVA, rather than the full UME and AA amounts.\n  State veterans homes were subsequently exempted from the definition \nof nursing homes which had been contained in those earlier provisions \nof Public Law 101-508 by legislation enacted in 1991, Public Law 102-\n40, May 7, 1991.\n  The result was that veterans on title XIX and residing in State \nnursing homes continued to receive UME and AA. Until recently, the \nState veterans homes followed a policy of requiring that all but $90 \nper month of these allowances be used to defray the cost of care in the \nHome.\n  Then, a series of Federal court decisions held that neither UME nor \nAA could be considered income. The court decisions appeared to focus on \nthe definition of income used in pre- and post-eligibility income \ndeterminations for Medicaid. The court decisions essentially held that \nUME and AA payments to veterans did not constitute income for the \npurpose of post-eligibility income determination. The reasoning was \nthat, since these monies typically were used by veterans to defray the \ncost of certain series they were receiving, the payments constituted a \n``wash'' for purposes of income gain by the veterans.\n  However, the frame of reference for the courts' decisions was not a \nnursing home environment in which a veteran receiving Medicaid benefits \nmight find himself or herself. In other words, the UME and AA payment \nreceived by a veteran on Medicaid are provided to a veteran for \nservices for which the State is already paying through the Medicaid \nprogram. The veteran is not paying for these services with their own \nincome. So, as a consequence of the court decisions, these payments to \nthe veteran in State veterans homes represent a net gain in income to \nthe veteran; they are not paid out by the veteran to defray the cost of \nservices the veteran is receiving.\n  VA does not pay AA or UME to veterans who are also on title XIX and \nresiding in non-State veterans home nursing homes. Those veterans get \nonly a $90 per month personal allowance.\n  And non-Medicaid eligible veterans who reside in State veterans homes \nmust pay for services with their own funds. If they get UME and AA \npayments, the State veterans homes will take all but $90 of those sums \nto help defray the cost of the nursing home care.\n  Although the written record does not document this, I believe that \nthe purpose of exempting the State veterans homes was to allow the \nHomes to continue to collect all but $90 of the UME and AA paid to the \neligible veteran so as to enable State veterans homes to provide \nservice to more veterans than they otherwise would be able to provide.\n  In any case, it seems highly unlikely that the purpose of exempting \nState veterans homes would have been to allow these veterans, and only \nthese among similarly situated veterans, to retain the entire UME and \nA amounts.\n  The legislation I am introducing today modifies section 1902(r)(1) of \nthe Social Security Act to stipulate that, for purposes of the post-\neligibility treatment of income of individuals who are \ninstitutionalized, and on title 19, the payments received under a \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs pension or compensation program, \nincluding aid and attendance and unusual medical expense payments, may \nbe taken into account.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NICKLES:\n  S. 503. A bill to prevent the transmission of the human \nimmunodeficiency virus (commonly known as HIV), and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                     the hiv prevention act of 1997\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the HIV \nPrevention Act of 1997. This legislation appropriately refocuses public \nhealth efforts on HIV prevention by using proven public health \ntechniques designed for communicable diseases. The public health \ninitiatives in this bill, which result in early detection of HIV \ninfection, are now more important than ever in light of the tremendous \nadvances that medical science has made.\n  This bill will balance the needs of HIV-infected patients with the \nprevention needs of those who are uninfected. The HIV Prevention Act of \n1997 establishes a confidential, national HIV reporting effort as \nalready exists for end stage HIV and AIDS; requires partner \nnotification; mandates testing for indicted sexual offenders; protects \nhealth care patients and professionals from inadvertent exposure to \nHIV; provides access to insurance-required HIV test results; and allows \nadoptive parents to learn the HIV status of a child. In addition, this \nlegislation includes Sense of the Senate language which expresses that \nthe States should criminalize the intentional transmission of HIV; and \nalso expresses the Sense of the Senate that strict confidentiality must \nbe observed at all times in carrying out all of the provisions of the \nact.\n  The Senate is on record supporting the provisions of this bill in a \n1990 amendment which was adopted by voice vote. The primary sponsors of \nthe amendment were Senators Kennedy and Mikulski. During debate on the \namendment, Senator Kennedy argued, ``In a case in which there is a \nclear and present danger, there is a duty to warn.'' That is the \npurpose of the HIV Prevention Act of 1997. The best ways to warn for \nthe prevention of further spread of HIV and AIDS are reporting and \npartner notification, methods which are currently in use and proven to \nbe effective.\n  This bill has received overwhelming support from groups including the \nIndependent Women's Forum, Americans for a Sound AIDS/HIV Policy, the \nFamily Research Council, Women Against Violence, the Christian \nCoalition, and the American Medical Association. I quote from a letter \nwritten by the AMA in support of this legislation:\n  ``These public health initiatives which result in early detection of \nHIV infection are now more important because of the tremendous advances \nthat medical science has made. Early intervention combined with \neffective treatments will enable those with HIV and AIDS to live \nlonger, healthier lives.''\n  The HIV Prevention Act adds HIV to 52 other notifiable contagious \ndiseases such as gonorrhea, hepatitis A, B, and C, syphilis, \ntuberculosis, and AIDS that must be reported to the Centers for Disease \nControl. In terms of partner notification, 26 states, including, I \nmight add, Oklahoma, already require notification. It is time that \nthese policies that are already in practice in some states are applied \naround the country in order to track and prevent further spread of HIV.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will greatly increase public health \nHIV prevention efforts that until now have focused only on AIDS. The \nHIV Prevention Act of 1997 is a sensible, common sense approach toward \ncontaining the spread of AIDS. By using proven, public health \ntechniques and sound medical practices, this bill will curtail the\n\n[[Page S2676]]\n\nspread of HIV. I thank the chair and encourage my colleagues to support \nthis commonsense legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 503\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``HIV Prevention Act of \n     1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) The States should recognize that the terms ``acquired \n     immune deficiency syndrome'' and ``AIDS'' are obsolete. In \n     the case of individuals who are infected with the human \n     immunodeficiency virus (commonly known as HIV), the more \n     important medical fact for the individuals and for the \n     protection of the public health is the fact of infection, and \n     not just the later development of AIDS (the stage at which \n     the infection causes symptoms). The term ``HIV disease'', \n     meaning infection with HIV regardless of whether the \n     infection has progressed to AIDS, more correctly defines the \n     medical condition.\n       (2) The medical, public health, political, and community \n     leadership must focus on the full course of HIV disease \n     rather than concentrating on later stages of the disease. \n     Continual focus on AIDS rather than the entire spectrum of \n     HIV disease has left our Nation unable to deal adequately \n     with the epidemic. Federal and State data collection efforts \n     should focus on obtaining data as early as possible after \n     infection occurs, while continuing to collect data on the \n     symptomatic stage of the disease.\n       (3) Recent medical breakthroughs may enable doctors to \n     treat HIV disease as a chronic disease rather than as a \n     terminal disease. Early intervention in the progression of \n     the infection is imperative to prolonging and improving the \n     lives of individuals with the disease.\n       (4) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has \n     recommended partner notification as a primary prevention \n     service. The health needs of the general public, and the care \n     and protection of those who do not have the disease, should \n     be balanced with the needs of individuals with the disease in \n     a manner that allows for the infected individuals to receive \n     optimal medical care and for public health services to \n     protect the uninfected.\n       (5) Individuals with HIV disease have an obligation to \n     protect others from being exposed to HIV by avoiding \n     behaviors that place others at risk of becoming infected. The \n     States should have in effect laws providing that \n     intentionally infecting others with HIV is a felony.\n\n     SEC. 3. PREVENTION OF TRANSMISSION OF HIV.\n\n       (a) Requirements for States.--A State shall demonstrate to \n     the satisfaction of the Secretary that the law or regulations \n     of the State are in accordance with the following:\n       (1) Reporting of cases.--The State requires that, in the \n     case of a health professional or other entity that provides \n     for the performance of a test for HIV on an individual, the \n     entity confidentially report positive test results to the \n     State public health officer, together with any additional \n     necessary information, in order to carry out the following \n     purposes:\n       (A) The performance of statistical and epidemiological \n     analyses of the incidence in the State of cases of such \n     disease.\n       (B) The performance of statistical and epidemiological \n     analyses of the demographic characteristics of the population \n     of individuals in the State who have the disease.\n       (C) The assessment of the adequacy of preventive services \n     in the State with respect to the disease.\n       (D) The performance of the functions required in paragraph \n     (2).\n       (2) Functions.--The functions described in this paragraph \n     are the following:\n       (A) Partner notification.--\n       (i) In general.--The State requires that the public health \n     officer of the State carry out a program of partner \n     notification to inform individuals that the individuals may \n     have been exposed to HIV.\n       (ii) Definition.--For purposes of this paragraph, the term \n     ``partner'' includes--\n\n       (I) the sexual partners of individuals with HIV disease;\n       (II) the partners of such individuals in the sharing of \n     hypodermic needles for the intravenous injection of drugs; \n     and\n       (III) the partners of such individuals in the sharing of \n     any drug-related paraphernalia determined by the Secretary to \n     place such partners at risk of HIV infection.\n\n       (B) Collection of information.--The State requires that any \n     information collected for purposes of partner notification be \n     sufficient for the following purposes:\n       (i) To provide the partners of the individual with HIV \n     disease with an appropriate opportunity to learn that the \n     partners have been exposed to HIV.\n       (ii) To provide the partners with counseling and testing \n     for HIV disease.\n       (iii) To provide the individual who has the disease with \n     information regarding therapeutic measures for preventing and \n     treating the deterioration of the immune system and \n     conditions arising from the disease, and to provide the \n     individual with other preventive information.\n       (iv) With respect to an individual who undergoes testing \n     for HIV disease but does not seek the results of the testing, \n     and who has positive test results for the disease, to recall \n     and provide the individual with counseling, therapeutic \n     information, and other information regarding preventative \n     health services appropriate for the individual.\n       (C) Cooperation in national program.--The State cooperates \n     with the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention in carrying out a national program of partner \n     notification, including the sharing of information between \n     the public health officers of the States.\n       (3) Testing of certain indicted individual.--With respect \n     to a defendant against whom an information or indictment is \n     presented for a crime in which by force or threat of force \n     the perpetrator compels the victim to engage in sexual \n     activity, the State requires the following:\n       (A) In general.--That the defendant be tested for HIV \n     disease if--\n       (i) the nature of the alleged crime is such that the sexual \n     activity would have placed the victim at risk of becoming \n     infected with HIV; or\n       (ii) the victim requests that the defendant be so tested.\n       (B) Timing.--That if the conditions specified in \n     subparagraph (A) are met, the defendant undergo the test not \n     later than 48 hours after the date on which the information \n     or indictment is presented, and that as soon thereafter as is \n     practicable the results of the test be made available to--\n       (i) the victim;\n       (ii) the defendant (or if the defendant is a minor, to the \n     legal guardian of the defendant);\n       (iii) the attorneys of the victim;\n       (iv) the attorneys of the defendant;\n       (v) the prosecuting attorneys;\n       (vi) the judge presiding at the trial, if any; and\n       (vii) the principal public health official for the local \n     governmental jurisdiction in which the crime is alleged to \n     have occurred.\n       (C) Follow-up testing.--That if the defendant has been \n     tested pursuant to subparagraph (B), the defendant, upon \n     request of the victim, undergo such follow-up tests for HIV \n     as may be medically appropriate, and that as soon as is \n     practicable after each such test the results of the test be \n     made available in accordance with subparagraph (B) (except \n     that this subparagraph applies only to the extent that the \n     individual involved continues to be a defendant in the \n     judicial proceedings involved, or is convicted in the \n     proceedings).\n       (D) Consideration of results.--That, if the results of a \n     test conducted pursuant to subparagraph (B) or (C) indicate \n     that the defendant has HIV disease, such fact may, as \n     relevant, be considered in the judicial proceedings conducted \n     with respect to the alleged crime.\n       (4) Testing of certain individuals.--\n       (A) Patients.--With respect to a patient who is to undergo \n     a medical procedure that would place the health professionals \n     involved at risk of becoming infected with HIV, the State--\n       (i) authorizes such health professionals in their \n     discretion to provide that the procedure will not be \n     performed unless the patient undergoes a test for HIV disease \n     and the health professionals are notified of the results of \n     the test; and\n       (ii) requires that, if such test is performed and the \n     patient has positive test results, the patient be informed of \n     the results.\n       (B) Funeral-related services.--The State authorizes \n     funeral-services practitioners in their discretion to provide \n     that funeral procedures will not be performed unless the body \n     involved undergoes a test for HIV disease and the \n     practitioners are notified of the results of the test.\n       (5) Informing of funeral-service practitioners.--The State \n     requires that, if a health care entity (including a hospital) \n     transfers a body to a funeral-services practitioner and such \n     entity knows that the body is infected with HIV, the entity \n     notify the funeral-services practitioner of such fact.\n       (6) Health insurance issuers.--\n       (A) In general.--The State requires that, if a health \n     insurance issuer requires an applicant for such insurance to \n     be tested for HIV disease as a condition of issuing such \n     insurance, the applicant be afforded an opportunity by the \n     health insurance issuer to be informed, upon request, of the \n     HIV status of the applicant.\n       (B) Definition.--For purposes of this paragraph, the term \n     ``health insurance issuer'' means an insurance company, \n     insurance service, or insurance organization (including a \n     health maintenance organization) which is licensed to engage \n     in the business of insurance in the State and which is \n     subject to State law which regulates insurance.\n       (C) Rule of construction.--This paragraph may not be \n     construed as affecting the provisions of section 514 of the \n     Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. \n     1154) with respect to group health plans.\n       (7) Adoption.--The State requires that, if an adoption \n     agency is giving significant consideration to approving an \n     individual as an adoptive parent of a child and the agency \n     knows whether the child has HIV disease,\n\n[[Page S2677]]\n\n     such prospective adoptive parent be afforded an opportunity \n     by the agency to be informed, upon request, of the HIV status \n     of the child.\n       (b) Sense of Congress Regarding Health Professionals With \n     HIV Disease.--It is the sense of Congress that, with respect \n     to health professionals who have HIV disease--\n       (1) the health professionals should notify their patients \n     that the health professionals have the disease in medical \n     circumstances that place the patients at risk of being \n     infected with HIV by the health professionals; and\n       (2) the States should encourage the medical profession to \n     develop guidelines to assist the health professionals in so \n     notifying patients.\n       (c) Applicability of Requirements.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), this \n     section shall apply to States upon the expiration of the 120-\n     day period beginning on the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (2) Delayed applicability for certain states.--In the case \n     of the State involved, if the Secretary determines that a \n     requirement established by subsection (a) cannot be \n     implemented in the State without the enactment of State \n     legislation, then such requirement applies to the State on \n     and after the first day of the first calendar quarter that \n     begins after the close of the first regular session of the \n     State legislature that begins after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act. For purposes of the preceding sentence, in the \n     case of a State that has a 2-year legislative session, each \n     year of such session is deemed to be a separate regular \n     session of the State legislature.\n       (d) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) HIV.--The term ``HIV'' means the human immunodeficiency \n     virus.\n       (2) HIV disease.--The term ``HIV disease'' means infection \n     with HIV and includes any condition arising from such \n     infection.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services.\n       (e) Rule of Construction.--Part D of title XXVI of the \n     Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300ff-71 et seq.) is \n     amended by inserting after section 2675 the following \n     section:\n\n     ``SEC. 2675A.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING INTENTIONAL TRANSMISSION \n                   OF HIV.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the States should have in \n     effect laws providing that, in the case of an individual who \n     knows that he or she has HIV disease, it is a felony for the \n     individual to infect another with HIV if the individual \n     engages in the behaviors involved with the intent of so \n     infecting the other individual.\n\n     SEC. 5. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING CONFIDENTIALITY.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that strict confidentiality \n     should be maintained in carrying out the provisions of \n     section 3 of the this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mrs. Boxer and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 504. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit the \nsale of personal information about children without their parent's \nconsent, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n THE CHILDREN'S PRIVACY PROTECITON AND PARENTAL EMPOWERMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to \nsupport this simple but strong legislation to protect our children.\n  This bill, sponsored by myself, Senator Boxer, and Senator Snowe, \nwould provide three simple protections:\n  First, the bill would prohibit list brokers from selling personal \ninformation about children under 16 to anyone, without first getting \nthe parent's consent.\n  All kinds of information about our children--more facts than most of \nus might think or hope for--is rapidly becoming available through these \nlist brokers. It is only a matter of time before this information \nbegins to fall into the wrong hands.\n  Last year, a reporter in Los Angeles was easily able to purchase \nparents' names, birth months and addresses for 5,500 children aged 1-12 \nin a particular neighborhood. The reporter used the name of a \nfictitious company, gave a non-working telephone number, had no credit \ncard or check, and identified herself as Richard Allen Davis, the \nnotorious murderer of Polly Klaas. When ordering the list, the company \nrepresentative simply told her ``Oh, you have a famous name,'' and sent \nher the information C.O.D. This is simply unacceptable.\n  Second, the bill would give parents the authority to demand \ninformation from the list brokers who traffic in the personal data of \ntheir children--brokers will be required to provide parents with a list \nof all those to whom they sold information about the child, and must \nalso tell the parent precisely what kind of information was sold.\n  If this personal information is out there, and brokers are buying and \nselling it back and forth, it is only reasonable that we allow parents \nto find out what information has been sold and to whom that information \nhas been given.\n  Finally, this bill would prohibit list brokers from using prison \nlabor to input personal information. This seems like common sense to \nmost of us, but unfortunately the use of prison labor is not currently \nprohibited.\n  Last year when I introduced this bill, I spoke of the plight of \nBeverly Dennis, an Ohio grandmother who filled out a detailed marketing \nquestionnaire about her buying habits for a mail in survey. She filled \nout the questionnaire when she was told that she might receive free \nproduct samples and helpful information. Rather than receiving product \ninformation, however, she soon began to receive sexually explicit, \nfact-specific letters from a convicted rapist serving time.\n  The rapist, writing from his prison cell, had learned the very \nprivate, intimate details about her life because he was keypunching her \npersonal questionnaire data into a computer for a subcontractor. Ms. \nDennis received letters with elaborate sexual fantasies, weaved around \npersonal facts provided by her in the questionnaire. This bill would \nhave prevented the situation from ever occurring.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this year I have included in the bill \nexemptions for sales to law enforcement organizations, the Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children, and to accredited colleges and \nuniversities. We received a great deal of input since we introduced the \nbill last June, and I believe we have addressed most of the concerns \nabout our bill with these exemptions.\n  Schools will be able to get information about prospective students, \nlaw enforcement will be able to get the lists to help them find missing \nkids, and the Center for Missing and Exploited Children will be able to \ndo likewise.\n  This bill is really very simple. Some marketing companies may be \nunhappy that the government is trying to legislate how they do \nbusiness, but we have to weigh the safety and well-being of our \nchildren against the small inconvenience of requiring parental consent \nin these cases. Given the rapidly changing nature of the marketing \nbusiness and the ways in which child molesters and other criminals \noperate, this bill is an important step in protecting our kids from \nthose who would do them harm.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 504\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Children's Privacy \n     Protection and Parental Empowerment Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION OF CERTAIN ACTIVITIES RELATING TO \n                   PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT CHILDREN.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 89 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 1822.

A bill to establish the United States Patent and Trademark \nOrganization as a Government corporation, to amend the provisions of \ntitle 35, United States Code, relating to procedures for patent \napplications, commercial use of patents, reexamination reform, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                     THE OMNIBUS PATENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, intellectual property is vitally important \nto sustaining the high level of creativity that America enjoys, which \nnot only adds to the fund of human knowledge and the progress of \nscience and technology, but also results in the more tangible benefits \nof a strong economy and a favorable balance of trade.\n  For example, in 1994, copyright-related industries contributed more \nthan $385 billion to the American economy, or more than 5 percent of \nthe total gross domestic product. This represents more than $50 billion \nin foreign sales, which exceeds every other leading industry sector \nexcept automotive and agriculture in contributions to a favorable trade \nbalance. From 1977 to 1994, these same industries grew at a rate that \nwas twice the rate of growth of the national economy, and the rate of \njob growth in these industries since 1987 has outpaced that of the \noverall economy by more than 100 percent.\n  Mr. President, this is impressive to say the least. And these figures \ndon't begin to take into account the contributions of other \nintellectual property sectors, including trade in patented technologies \nand the economic value of famous marks. Clearly intellectual property \nhas become one of our Nation's most valuable resources.\n  As you know, the Judiciary Committee, is charged with monitoring the \neffectiveness of our intellectual property laws and with proposing to \nthe Senate changes that are called for to meet new challenges. Because \nof the digital age and the global economy, we've had our hands full. \nLet me just go through a few highlights.\n  In the 104th Congress, we passed the Digital Performance Right in \nSound Recordings Act, which, as its name signifies, adjusts the \nexisting performance right in the Copyright Act to the demands of the \nnew digital media. I also introduced, with Senator Leahy, the National \nInformation Infrastructure (NII) Copyright Protection Act of 1995 to \nbegin to lay down the rules of the road for the information highway. \nThe Committee held two hearings on this bill, but not enough time was \nleft in the 104th to complete our deliberations.\n\n  In response to the challenges of the global economy, I introduced the \nCopyright Term Extension Act of 1995, along with Senator Thompson and \nSenator Feinstein, to give U.S. copyright owners parity of term in the \nEuropean Union. The EU has issued a directive to increase the minimum \nbasic copyright term from life-plus-50 years to life-plus-70. If we do \nnot follow suit, U.S. works in potentially all EU countries will \nreceive 20 years less protection than the works of the nationals of the \nhost country.\n  The Copyright Term Extension Act was approved by the Judiciary \nCommittee. I am confident that the bill would have been approved by the \nSenate as well with little or no opposition, but unfortunately this \nimportant legislation was held hostage by advocates of music licensing \nreform--a totally unrelated issue.\n  In patents, too, we were very active. The Biotechnology Process \nPatents Act was passed. Also, I introduced the Omnibus Patent Act of \n1996, which remade the Patent and Trademark Office into a government \ncorporation. The corporate form would allow the Patent and Trademark \nOffice to escape the micromanagement that it currently endures from the \nCommerce Department, although my bill preserved a policy link with the \nDepartment. The bill also made several very important substantive \nchanges to the Patent Act.\n  After some tough negotiations, the Clinton administration ended up \nsupporting the final version of the bill. The Judiciary Committee had a \nhearing on the bill, but Committee action was held hostage to yet \nanother, totally unrelated issue--judicial nominations.\n  In addition to improving the efficiency of the patent and trademark \nsystems, I have worked tirelessly for a number of years to rectify the \ninjustice of making American inventors bear a heavier burden in deficit \nreduction than the ordinary citizen through the withholding of patent \nsurcharge funds. Again last year I led an ultimately unsuccessful \neffort to ease this tax on American ingenuity.\n\n  Now no one has demonstrated more zeal for a balanced budget than I \nhave. As you know, Mr. President, I was on the Senate floor for 3 weeks \ntrying to get this body to discipline itself through the Balanced \nBudget Amendment. But I do not believe that inventors ought to pay a \nsurcharge on their patent applications only to see that surcharge used \nfor the general revenue rather than to improve the service they receive \nfrom the PTO. The PTO, after all, is a self-sustaining agency, not \nreceiving a penny from taxpayer dollars. What they charge, they ought \nto keep. I am currently looking at a legislative solution to this \nproblem.\n  I have also been looking into the special patent restoration rules \nthat apply to pharmaceutical products. In 1984, Congress enacted the \nDrug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act. Essentially, \nthis law--commonly known as, I am proud to say, the Hatch-Waxman Act--\nallowed generic drug manufacturers to rely on the costly safety and \nefficacy data of pioneer\n\n[[Page S2679]]\n\ndrug manufacturers and provided for partial patent restoration for \npioneer products to offset a portion of the patent term lost due to FDA \nregulatory review.\n  I know that many are interested in revisiting particular provisions \nof the Hatch-Waxman Act now that we have had a decade-plus experience \nunder the new system. In my view, to be successful, any Hatch-Waxman \nreform must be balanced in a manner that the American public, generic \ndrug firms, and the R manufacturers are all able to realize benefits. \nToward this end, my staff and I have been meeting with representatives \nof both segments of the pharmaceutical industry to identify areas of \nconcern.\n  It is my hope that these discussions will result in proposals to \ncreate new incentives in our intellectual property protection system \nand efficiency in our regulatory processes that will increase the long-\nterm strength of both segments of the industry. Our bottom line goal is \nclear: We want a climate that produces both innovative new medicines \nand lower-cost generic copies of off-patent products.\n\n  I do not guarantee success in this endeavor, I can only commit that I \nwill listen to all parties involved and see if we can work together to \nforge a compromise on Hatch-Waxman reform. I would like to do it if we \ncan, but I will not support any approach that is not balanced.\n  Let me just add that my willingness to work with all parties should \nnot be construed as giving a veto to any particular party. Ultimately, \nthe test I use will be: Will the American public be better off if a \nparticular legislative proposal is adopted? If, and only if, this test \ncan be met, will I ask others in this body to join me in moving \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, let me now turn to trademark legislation, an area in \nwhich we have had a lot of success. Both the Federal Trademark Dilution \nAct and the Anticounterfeiting Consumer Protection Act became law in \nthe 104th Congress. The Federal Trademark Dilution Act was significant \nin that it established the first-ever Federal anti-dilution statute to \nprovide nationwide protection against the whittling away of famous \nmarks. The Anticounterfeiting Consumer Protection Act brought our \nNation's anticounterfeiting laws up to speed with the quickly evolving \ncounterfeiting trade by providing stiffer civil and criminal penalties \nand increasing the tools available to law enforcement to give them the \nupper hand in this fight.\n  As you can see though, Mr. President, we have a lot of unfinished \nbusiness, so today I'm introducing two bills from the last Congress, \nthe Omnibus Patent Act, and the Copyright Term Extension Act. In \naddition, I'm introducing the Copyright Clarification Act, which is a \nseries of truly technical amendments to the Copyright Act. I am pleased \nthat Senator Leahy, the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator D'Amato, the distinguished junior Senator from New \nYork, Senator Abraham, the distinguished junior Senator from Michigan, \nand Senator Feinstein, the distinguished senior Senator from \nCalifornia, are joining me as cosponsors of the Copyright Term \nExtension Act of 1997.\n  Of course, Mr. President, these three bills do not comprise my entire \nintellectual property agenda. For example, at my request, the Copyright \nOffice is taking a look at sui generis protection of databases and at \namendments to the Satellite Home Viewer Act. The Copyright Office may \nvery well have recommendations for legislation in this area, and I may \nintroduce such legislation before the end of this session. However, \nbecause the three bills I am introducing today have widespread support \nand have been thoroughly discussed in the last Congress, it is \nappropriate that they be the first to be considered--old business \nbefore new business.\n\n\n                     The Omnibus Patent Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. President, the Omnibus Patent Act of 1997 is identical to the \nlatest version of a bill I introduced last Congress, S. 1961, except \nfor a few technical changes. Last Congress, S. 1961 gained bipartisan \nsupport in the Senate, its counterpart, H.R. 3460 gained bipartisan \nsupport in the House, and the Clinton administration also supported \nthis bill. Further, a large, broad coalition of representatives of the \npatent industry were strongly supportive of the bill. Additionally, the \nNational Treasury Employees Union and the AFL-CIO both supported the \nprovisions that affect their membership. I am fully confident that this \nfar-reaching, bipartisan support will continue this Congress.\n  I have no doubt that had a vote been taken on S. 1961, it would have \npassed the Senate by an overwhelming vote. Unfortunately, we did not \ntake up S. 1961 until later in the 104th Congress, and time ran out \nbefore we were able to reach a vote on this important measure.\n  In order to be certain that such a problem is not repeated, I am \nbeginning this process early in the 105th Congress. The House is \nalready acting to move through this important and needed measure \nwithout delay. The House counterpart to my bill, H.R. 400, was \nintroduced by Congressman Coble, the chairman of the House Judiciary \nSubcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property. Chairman Coble has \nheld a hearing on H.R. 400, and the bill was subsequently favorably \nreported by the subcommittee and the full House Judiciary Committee. I \nlook forward to the consideration of H.R. 400 by the full House of \nRepresentatives.\n\n  During the last Congress this bill was the subject of multiple \nhearings in both Houses of Congress. But, this is a new Congress, so I \nwould like to review, once again, the purposes and goals of the Omnibus \nPatent Act of 1997.\n  The purposes of this bill are: (1) to provide for more efficient \nadministration of the patent and trademark systems; (2) to discourage \n``gaming'' the patent system while ensuring against loss of patent term \nand theft of American inventiveness; (3) to protect the rights of prior \nusers of inventions which are later patented by another; (4) to \nincrease the reliability of patents by allowing third parties more \nmeaningful participation in the reexamination process; (5) to make \ncertain that American provisional applications are given the same \nweight as other countries' provisional applications in other countries' \ncourts; (6) to close a loophole in the plant patent provisions of the \nPatent Act; and (7) to allow for the filing of patent and trademark \ndocuments by electronic medium.\n\n\n             The United States Patent and Trademark Office\n\n  The United States leads the world in innovation. That leadership is a \ndirect result of our long-standing commitment to strong patent \nprotection. The strong protection of patents and trademarks are of \nvital importance not only to continued progress in science, but also to \nthe economy. A vast array of industries depend on patents. From the \nchemical, electrical, biotechnological, and manufacturing industries to \ncomputer software and hardware. And trademark is important to all \nbusinesses, period.\n  I believe that we must not only keep our intellectual property laws \ncurrent and strong, but we must do everything we can to make sure that \nthe offices responsible for the administration of those laws are \nproperly equipped and able to do their job as efficiently as possible.\n  Thus, the first provision of this bill makes the Patent and Trademark \nOffice a government corporation, called the U.S. Patent and Trademark \nOrganization. Basically, the effect of this provision is to separate \nthe administration of the patent and trademark systems from \nmicromanagement by the Department of Commerce, while maintaining a \npolicy link to that Department. The current PTO has been hampered by \nburdensome red tape regarding personnel matters, and the office has \nalso been held back from reaching its full potential by the repeated \nsiphoning off of its user fees for other, unrelated expenditures.\n  The government corporation proposal was the subject of much \ndiscussion last Congress. The Administration, various union \nrepresentatives, representatives of the users of the Patent and \nTrademark Office, and, of course, the officers of the PTO itself were \nall involved in helping me to craft this consensus legislation. I am \nconfident that the product of these negotiations will enhance the \nefficiency of the USPTO while protecting the interests of the Commerce \nDepartment and the employees of the USPTO.\n\n[[Page S2680]]\n\n  The structure of the USPTO under my bill vests primary responsibility \nfor patent and trademark policy in the head of the USPTO, the Director, \nand primary responsibility for administration of the patent and \ntrademark systems in the respective Commissioners of Patents and \nTrademarks. The corporate form of the USPTO inoculates the Patent and \nTrademark Offices as much as possible from the bureaucratic sclerosis \nthat infects many federal agencies. Further, by subdividing the \norganization into separate patent and trademark offices, the bill will \nhelp raise the prominence of trademarks, an important part of \nintellectual property but long seen as the poor step-child of the more \nprominent patent field.\n  The parties interested in patents and trademarks support having close \naccess to the President by having the chief intellectual policy advisor \ndirectly linked to a cabinet officer. The Secretary of Commerce is a \nlogical choice. As a result, while this bill would make the day-to-day \nfunctioning of the USPTO independent of the Commerce Department, the \npolicy portion of the new organization will still be under the policy \ndirection of the Secretary of Commerce. Further, as a government \ncorporation, as opposed to a private corporation, the USPTO will remain \nsubject to congressional oversight.\n\n  Mr. President, although the creation of the USPTO may be the most \ndramatic part of this bill, it also contains several important changes \nto substantive patent law that will, taken as a whole, dramatically \nimprove our patent system.\n  With the adoption of the GATT provisions in 1994, the United States \nchanged the manner in which it calculated the duration of patent terms. \nUnder the old rule, patents lasted for seventeen years after the grant \nof the patent. The new rule under the legislation implementing GATT is \nthat these patents last for twenty years from the time the patent \napplication is filed.\n  In addition to harmonizing American patent terms with those of our \nmajor trading partners, this change solved the problem of ``submarine \npatents''. A submarine patent is not a military secret. Rather, it is a \ncolloquial way to describe a legal but unscrupulous strategy to game \nthe system and unfairly extend a patent term.\n  Submarine patenting is when an applicant purposefully delays the \nfinal granting of his patent by filing a series of amendments and \ndelaying motions. Since, under the old system, the term did not start \nuntil the patent was granted, no patent term was lost. And since patent \napplications are secret in the United States until a patent is actually \ngranted, no one knows that the patent application is pending. Thus, \ncompetitors continued to spend precious research and development \ndollars on technology that has already been developed.\n  When a competitor finally did develop the same technology, the \nsubmarine applicant sprang his trap. He would cease delaying his \napplication and it would finally be approved. Then, he sued his \ncompetitor for infringing on his patent. Thus, he maximized his own \npatent term while tricking his competitors into wasting their money.\n  Mr. President, submarine patents are terribly inefficient. Because of \nthem, the availability of new technology is delayed and instead of \nmoving to new and better research, companies are fooled into throwing \naway time and money on technology that already exists.\n\n  By adopting GATT, and changing the manner in which we calculate the \npatent term to twenty years from filing, we eliminated the submarine \nproblem. Under the current rule, if an applicant delays his own \napplication, it simply shortens the time he will have after the actual \ngranting of the patent. Thus, we have eliminated this unscrupulous, \ninefficient practice by removing its benefits.\n  Unfortunately, the change in term calculation potentially creates a \nnew problem. Under the current law, if the Patent Office takes a long \ntime to approve a patent, the delay comes out of the patent term, thus \npunishing the patent holder for the PTO's delay. This is not right.\n  The question we face now, Mr. President, is how to fix this new \nproblem. Some have suggested combining the old seventeen years from \ngranting system with the new twenty years from filing and giving the \npatent holder whichever is longer. But that approach leads to \nuncertainty in the length of a patent term and even worse, resurrects \nthe submarine patent problem by giving benefits to an applicant who \npurposefully delays his own application. I believe that Titles II and \nIII of the Omnibus Patent Act of 1997 solve the administrative delay \ndilemma without recreating old problems.\n\n\n                           Early Publication\n\n  Title II of the bill provides for the early publication of patent \napplications. It would require the Patent Office to publish pending \napplications eighteen months after the application was filed. An \nexception to this rule is made for applications filed only in the \nUnited States. Those applications will be published 18 months after \nfiling or 3 months after the office issues its first response on the \napplication, whichever is later. By publishing early, competitors are \nput on notice that someone has already beaten them to the invention, \nthus allowing them to stop spending money researching that same art.\n\n  The claims that early publication will allow foreign competitors to \nsteal American technology are simply not true. To start with, between \n75 and 80 percent of patent applications filed in the United States are \nalso filed abroad where 18 month publication is already the rule. \nFurther, I have provided in my bill for delayed publication of \napplications only submitted in the United States to protect them from \ncompetitors. Additionally, once an application is published, Title II \ngrants the applicant ``provisional rights,'' that is, legal protection \nfor his invention. Thus, while it is true that someone could break the \nlaw and steal the invention, that is true under current law and will \nalways be true, and it will subject them to liability for their illegal \nactions.\n\n\n                        Patent Term Restoration\n\n  Title III deals directly with the administrative delay problem by \nrestoring to the patent holder any part of the term that is lost due to \nundue administrative delay. To prevent any possible confusion over what \nundue delay means, the bill sets specific deadlines for the Patent \nOffice to act. The office has fourteen months to issue a first office \naction and four months to respond to subsequent applicant filings. Any \ndelay beyond those deadlines is considered undue delay and will be \nrestored to the patent term. Thus, Title III solves the administrative \ndelay problem in a clear, predictable, and objective manner.\n\n\n                     Prior Domestic Commercial Use\n\n  Title IV deals with people who independently invent new art, and use \nit in commercial sale, but who never patent their invention. \nSpecifically, this title provides rights to a person who has \ncommercially sold an invention more than 1 year before another person \nfiles an application for a patent on the same subject matter. Anyone in \nthis situation will be permitted to continue to sell his product \nwithout being required to pay a royalty to the patent holder. This \nbasic fairness measure is aimed at protecting the innocent inventor who \nchooses to use trade secret protection instead of pursuing a patent and \nwho has expended enough time and money to begin commercial sale of the \ninvention. It also serves as an incentive for those who wish to seek a \npatent to seek it quickly, thus reducing the time during which others \nmay acquire prior user rights. The incentives of this title will \nimprove the efficiency of our patent system by protecting ongoing \nbusiness concerns and encouraging swift prosecution of patent \napplications.\n\n\n                      Patent Reexamination Reform\n\n  Title V provides for a greater role for third parties in patent re-\nexamination proceedings. Nothing is more basic to an effective system \nof patent protection than a reliable examination process. Without the \nhigh level of faith that the PTO has earned, respect for existing \npatents would fall away and innovation would be discouraged for fear of \na lack of protection for new inventions.\n  In the information age, however, it is increasingly difficult for the \nPTO to keep track of all the prior art that exists. The examiners do \nthe best job they can, but inevitably someone misses something and \ngrants a patent that should not be granted. This is the problem that \ntitle V addresses.\n  Title V amends the existing reexamination process to allow third-\nparties\n\n[[Page S2681]]\n\nto raise a challenge to an existing patent and to participate in the \nreexamination process in a meaningful way. Thus, the expertise of the \npatent examiner is supplemented by the knowledge and resources of \nthird-parties who may have information not known to the patent \nexaminer. Through this joint effort, we maximize the flow of \ninformation, increase the reliability of patents, and thereby increase \nthe strength of the American patent system.\n  There are also safeguards to prevent this process from being abused \nby those who merely seek to harass a patent-holder. First, if a third-\nparty requestor loses an appeal of his reexamination request, he may \nnot subsequently raise any issue he could have raised during the \nexamination proceeding in any forum. Second, a party that loses a civil \naction where that party failed to show the invalidity of the patent, \nthe party may not subsequently seek a reexamination of such patent on \nany grounds that could have been raised in the civil action. Third, the \nburden of reexamination on the patent-holder is minimized by the fact \nthat a reexamination is not like a court review, and that the patent \nholder need not submit any documentation in order to prevail.\n\n\n                  Provisional Applications for Patents\n\n  Title VI is comprised of miscellaneous provisions. First, it fixes a \nmatter of a rather technical nature. Some foreign courts have \ninterpreted American provisional applications in a way that would not \npreserve their filing priority. This title amends section 115 of Title \n35 of the U.S. Code to clarify that if a provisional application is \nconverted into a non-provisional application within 12 months of \nfiling, that it stands as a full patent application, with the date of \nfiling of the provisional application as the date of priority. If no \nrequest is made within 12 months, the provisional application is \nconsidered abandoned. This clarification will make certain that \nAmerican provisional applications are given the same weight as other \ncountries' provisional applications in other countries' courts.\n\n\n                             Plant Patents\n\n  Title VI also makes two corrections to the plant patent statute. \nFirst, the ban on tuber propagated plants is removed. This depression-\nera ban was included for fear of limiting the food supply. Obviously, \nthis is no longer a concern. Second, the plant patent statute is \namended to provide protection to parts of plants, as well as the whole \nplant. This closes a loophole that foreign growers have used to import \nthe fruit or flowers of patented plants without paying a royalty \nbecause the entire plant was not being sold.\n\n\n                           Electronic Filing\n\n  Lastly, this title also allows for the filing of patent and trademark \ndocuments by electronic medium. It is high time that the government \noffice that is, by definition, always on the cutting edge of \ntechnology, be permitting to enter the age of computers.\n  Mr. President, this bill is an important, and necessary measure that \nenjoys overwhelming support. I am confident that it will be enacted \ninto law this Congress.\n\n\n                The Copyright Term Extension Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. President, the purpose of the Copyright Term Extension Act of \n1997 is to ensure adequate copyright protection for American works \nabroad by extending the U.S. term of copyright protection for an \nadditional 20 years. It also includes a provision reversing the Ninth \nCircuit decision in La Cienega Music Co. v. ZZ Top that calls into \nquestion the copyrights of thousands of musical works first distributed \non sound recordings.\n  Except for the La Cienega provision, the substance of this bill is \nidentical to S. 483, the Copyright Term Extension Act, which was passed \nby the Judiciary Committee on May 23, 1996, with overwhelming \nbipartisan support. This legislation also has the strong support of the \nAdministration, as expressed by both the Commissioner of Patents and \nTrademarks, Bruce Lehman, and the Register of Copyrights, Marybeth \nPeters, in their testimony before the Judiciary Committee in the last \nCongress.\n  Twenty years ago, Mr. President, Congress fundamentally altered the \nway in which the U.S. calculates its term of copyright protection by \nabandoning a fixed-year term of protection and adopting a basic term of \nprotection based on the life of the author. In adopting the life-plus-\n50 term, Congress cited three primary justifications for the change. 1) \nthe need to conform the U.S. copyright term with the prevailing \nworldwide standard; 2) the insufficiency of the U.S. copyright term to \nprovide a fair economic return for authors and their dependents; and, \n3) the failure of the U.S. copyright term to keep pace with the \nsubstantially increased commercial life of copyrighted works resulting \nfrom the rapid growth in communications media.\n  Developments over the past 20 years have led to a widespread \nreconsideration of the adequacy of the life-plus-50-year term based on \nthese same reasons. Among the main developments is the effect of \ndemographic trends, such as increasing longevity and the trend toward \nrearing children later in life, on the effectiveness of the life-plus-\n50 term to provide adequate protection for American creators and their \nheirs. In addition, unprecedented growth in technology over the last 20 \nyears, including the advent of digital media and the development of the \nNational Information Infrastructure and the Internet, have dramatically \nenhanced the marketable lives of creative works. Most importantly, \nthough, is the growing international movement toward the adoption the \nlonger term of life-plus-70.\n  Thirty-five years ago, the Permanent Committee of the Berne Union \nbegan to reexamine the sufficiency of the life-plus-50-year term. Since \nthen, a growing consensus of the inadequacy of the life-plus-50 term to \nprotect creators in an increasingly competitive global marketplace has \nled to actions by several nations to increase the duration of \ncopyright. Of particular importance is the 1993 directive issued by the \nEuropean Union, which requires its member countries to implement a term \nof protection equal to the life of the author plus 70 years by July 1, \n1995.\n  According to the Copyright Office, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, \nGermany, Greece, Ireland, Spain, and Sweden have all notified their \nlaws to the European Commission and the Commission has found them to be \nin compliance with the EU Directive. Luxembourg, The Netherlands, \nPortugal, the United Kingdom, and Austria have each notified their \nimplementing laws to the Commission and are awaiting certification. \nOther countries are currently in the process of bringing their laws \ninto compliance. And, as the Register of Copyrights has stated, those \ncountries that are seeking to join the European Union, including \nPoland, Hungary, Turkey, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria, are likely \nto amend their copyright laws to conform with the life-plus-70 \nstandard.\n  The reason this is of such importance to the United States is that \nthe EU Directive also mandates the application of what is referred to \nas the rule of the shorter term. This rule may also be applied by \nadherents to the Berne Convention and the Universal Copyright \nConvention. In short, this rule permits those countries with longer \ncopyright terms to limit protection of foreign works to the shorter \nterm of protection granted in the country of origin. Thus, in those \ncountries that adopt the longer term of life-plus-70, American works \nwill forfeit 20 years of available protection and be protected instead \nfor only the duration of the life-plus-50 term afforded under U.S. law.\n  Mr. President, I've already cited some statistics about the \nimportance of copyright to our national economy. The fact is that \nAmerica exports more copyrighted intellectual property than any country \nin the world, a huge percentage of it to nations of the European Union. \nIn fact, intellectual property is our third largest export. And, \naccording to 1994 estimates, copyright industries account for some 5.7 \npercent of the total gross domestic product. Furthermore, copyright \nindustries are creating American jobs at twice the rate of other \nindustries, with the number of U.S. workers employed by core copyright \nindustries more than doubling between 1977 and 1994. Today, these \nindustries contribute more to the economy and employ more workers than \nany single manufacturing sector, accounting for nearly 5 percent of the \ntotal U.S. workforce. In fact, in 1994, the core copyright industries \nemployed more workers than the four leading noncopyright manufacturing \nsectors combined.\n  Clearly, Mr. President, America stands to lose a significant part of \nits\n\n[[Page S2682]]\n\ninternational trading advantage if our copyright laws do not keep pace \nwith emerging international standards. Given the mandated application \nof the rule of the shorter term under the EU Directive, American works \nwill fall into the public domain 20 years before those of our European \ntrading partners, undercutting our international trading position and \ndepriving copyright owners of two decades of income they might \notherwise have. Similar consequences will follow in those nations \noutside the EU that choose to exercise the rule of the shorter term \nunder the Berne Convention and the Universal Copyright Convention.\n  Mr. President, adoption of the Copyright Term Extension Act will \nensure fair compensation for the American creators whose efforts fuel \nthe intellectual property sector of our economy by allowing American \ncopyright owners to benefit to the fullest extent from foreign uses and \nwill, at the same time, ensure that our trading partners do not get a \nfree ride from their use of our intellectual property. And, as stated \nvery simply by the Register of Copyrights in her testimony before the \nJudiciary Committee in the last Congress: ``[i]t does appear that at \nsome point in the future the standard will be life plus 70. The \nquestion is at what point does the United States move to this term * * \n*. As a leading creator and exporter of copyrighted works, the United \nStates should not wait until it is forced to increase the term, rather \nit should set an example for other countries.''\n\n  Mr. President, this bill is of crucial importance to our Nation's \ncopyright owners and to our economy. It is also a balanced approach. It \ncontains a provision, allowing the actual creators of copyrighted works \nin certain circumstances to bargain for the extra 20 years, except in \nthe case of works made for hire. The libraries and archives, too, will \nbe pleased to see that the bill provides them with additional latitude \nto reproduce and distribute material during the extension term, and it \ndoes not extend the copyright term for certain works that were \nunpublished at the time of the effective date of the 1976 act. This \nlatter provision means that libraries and archives will be able to go \nforward with their plans to publish those unpublished works in 2003, \nthe year after the current guaranteed term for unpublished works \nexpires.\n\n\n                          La Cienega v. ZZ Top\n\n  Mr. President, the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1997 also includes \na provision to overturn the decision in La Cienega Music Co. v. ZZ Top, \n53 F.3d 950 (9th Cir. 1995), cert denied, 116 S. Ct. 331 (1995). In \ngeneral, La Cienega held that distributing a sound recording to the \npublic--for example by sale--is a ``publication'' of the music recorded \non it under the 1909 Copyright Act. Under the 1909 act, publication \nwithout copyright notice caused loss of copyright protection. Almost \nall music that was first published on recordings did not contain \ncopyright notice, because publishers believed that it was not \ntechnically a publication. The Copyright Office also considered these \nmusical compositions to be unpublished. The effect of La Cienega, \nhowever, is that virtually all music before 1978 that was first \ndistributed to the public on recordings has no copyright protection--at \nleast in the 9th Circuit.\n  By contrast, the Second Circuit in Rosette v. Rainbo Record \nManufacturing Corp., 546 F.2d 461 (2d Cir. 1975), aff'd per curiam, 546 \nF.2d 461 (2d Cir. 1976) has held the opposite--that public distribution \nof recordings was not a publication of the music contained on them. As \nI have noted, Rosette comports with the nearly universal understanding \nof the music and sound recording industries and of the Copyright \nOffice.\n  Since the Supreme Court has denied cert in La Cienega, whether one \nhas copyright in thousands of musical compositions depends on whether \nthe case is brought in the Second or Ninth Circuits. This situation is \nintolerable. Overturning the La Cienega decision will restore national \nuniformity on this important issue by confirming the wisdom of the \ncustom and usage of the affected industries and of the Copyright Office \nfor nearly 100 years. My bill, however, also contains a provision to \nensure that Congress' affirmation of this view will not retroactively \nupset the disposition of previously adjudicated or pending cases.\n\n\n                The Copyright Clarification Act of 1997\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, I am introducing the Copyright Clarification \nAct of 1997 to make a series of truly technical amendments to the \nCopyright Act. The need for these technical corrections was brought to \nmy attention in the last Congress by the Register of Copyrights, Ms. \nMarybeth Peters. This bill was passed by the House of Representatives \nin similar form in the 104th Congress. Unfortunately time ran short on \nour efforts to enact the same bill in the Senate. The version I am \nintroducing today is identical to H.R. 672, which passed the House \nunder suspension of the rules just yesterday. I hope the Senate will \nfollow suit and act expeditiously to make these important technical \namendments.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, each of the three bills I am introducing today is \ntremendously important. For the information of my colleagues I am \nsubmitting a brief summary of the Omnibus Patent Act of 1997, a \nsection-by-section analysis of the Copyright Term Extension Act of \n1997, and a summary of provisions of the Copyright Clarification Act of \n1997. I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record, along \nwith the text of the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1997 and the text \nof the Copyright Clarification Act of 1997.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 505\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Copyright Term Extension Act \n     of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

REPRODUCTION BY LIBRARIES AND ARCHIVES.\n\n       Section 108 of title 17, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsection (h) as subsection (i); and\n       (2) by inserting after subsection (g) the following:\n       ``(h)(1) For purposes of this section, during the last 20 \n     years of any term of copyright of a published work, a library \n     or archives, including a nonprofit educational institution \n     that functions as such, may reproduce, distribute, display, \n     or perform in facsimile or digital form a copy or phonorecord \n     of such work, or portions thereof, for purposes of \n     preservation, scholarship, or research, if such library or \n     archives has first determined, on the basis of a reasonable \n     investigation, that none of the conditions set forth in \n     subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of paragraph (2) apply.\n       ``(2) No reproduction, distribution, display, or \n     performance is authorized under this subsection if--\n       ``(A) the work is subject to normal commercial \n     exploitation;\n       ``(B) a copy or phonorecord of the work can be obtained at \n     a reasonable price; or\n       ``(C) the copyright owner or its agent provides notice \n     pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Register of \n     Copyrights that either of the conditions set forth in \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B) applies.\n       ``(3) The exemption provided in this subsection does not \n     apply to any subsequent uses by users other than such library \n     or archives.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

The \n     amendment made by section 4 shall not apply to any action \n     pending on the date of enactment in any court in which a \n     party, prior to the date of enactment, sought dismissal of, \n     judgment on, or declaratory relief regarding a claim of \n     infringement by arguing that the adverse party had no valid \n     copyright in a musical work by virtue of the distribution of \n     phonorecords embodying it.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n The Copyright Term Extension Act of 1997 (S. 505)--Section-by-Section \n                                Analysis\n\n\n                         section 1. short title\n\n       The proposed legislation is entitled the Copyright Term \n     Extension Act of 1997.\n\n\n              section 2. duration of copyright provisions\n\n          Section 2(a)--Preemption with Respect to Other Laws\n\n       This subsection amends Sec. 301(c) of the Copyright Act to \n     extend for an additional 20 years the application of common \n     law and state statutory protection for sound recordings fixed \n     before February 15, 1972. Under Sec. 301, the federal law \n     generally preempts all state and common law protection of \n     copyright with several exceptions, including one for sound \n     recordings fixed before February 15, 1972 (the effective date \n     of the statute extending federal copyright protection to \n     sound recordings). Because federal copyright protection \n     applies only to sound recordings fixed on or after that date, \n     federal preemption of state statutory and common law \n     protection of sound recordings fixed before February 15, \n     1972, would result in all of these works falling into the \n     public domain. The Sec. 301 exception was enacted to ensure a \n     75-year minimum term of copyright protection for these works. \n     By delaying the date of federal Copyright Act preemption of \n     state statutory and common law protection of pre-February 15, \n     1972, sound recordings until February 15, 2067, this \n     subsection extends the minimum term of protection for these \n     works by 20 years.\n\nSection 2(b)--Duration of Copyright: Works Created on or After January \n                                1, 1978\n\n       This subsection amends Sec. 302 of the Copyright Act to \n     extend the U.S. term of copyright protection by 20 years for \n     all works created on or after January 1, 1978. For works in \n     general, which currently enjoy protection for the life of the \n     author plus 50 additional years under Sec. 301(a), this \n     section creates a term equal to the life of the author plus \n     70 years. Likewise, for joint works under Sec. 302(b), this \n     section extends the current term of protection to the life of \n     the last surviving author plus 70 years. For anonymous works, \n     pseudonymous works, and works made for hire, which are \n     protected the shorter of 75 years from publication or 100 \n     years from creation under Sec. 302(c), this subsection \n     extends the term to the shorter of 95 years from publication \n     or 120 years from the date the work is created.\n       This subsection also amends Sec. 302(e) of the Copyright \n     Act to extend by 20 years the various dates relating to the \n     presumptive death of the author as a complete defense against \n     copyright infringement. Whereas current copyright protection \n     is generally tied to the life of the author, it is sometimes \n     not possible to ascertain whether the author of a work is \n     still living, or even to identify the year of death if the \n     author is deceased. Sec. 302(e) provides a complete defense \n     against copyright infringement when the work is used more \n     than 75 years after publication or 100 years after creation, \n     whichever is less, provided the user obtains a certificate \n     from the Copyright Office indicating that it has no record to \n     indicate whether that person is living or died less than 50 \n     years before. This subsection would extend protection of such \n     works for an additional 20 years--95 years from publication \n     and 120 years from creation--as well as base the presumptive \n     death of the author on certification by the Copyright Office \n     that is has no record to indicate whether the person is \n     living or died less than 70 years before, which is 20 years \n     longer than the 50 years currently provided for in \n     Sec. 302(e).\n\nSection 2(c)--Duration of Copyright: Works Created But Not Published or \n                   Copyrighted Before January 1, 1978\n\n       This subsection amends Sec. 303 of the Copyright Act to \n     extend the minimum term of copyright protection by 20 years \n     for works created but not copyrighted before January 1, 1978, \n     provided they are published prior to December 31, 2002. Prior \n     to 1978, unpublished works enjoyed perpetual copyright \n     protection. Beginning in 1978, however, copyright protection \n     for unpublished works was limited to the life of the author \n     plus 50 years, or 100 years from creation for anonymous \n     works, pseudonymous works, and works made for hire. Under \n     Sec. 303, however, works created but not published before \n     January 1, 1978, are guaranteed protection until at least \n     December 31, 2002. Works subsequently published before that \n     date are guaranteed further protection until December 31, \n     2027. This subsection provides an additional 20 years of \n     protection for these subsequently published works by ensuring \n     that copyright protection will not expire before December 31, \n     1047.\n\n Section 2(d)(1)(A)--Duration of Copyright: Copyrights in Their First \n                        Term on January 1, 1978\n\n       This subsection amends Sec. 304(a) of the Copyright Act to \n     extend the term of protection for works in their first term \n     on January 1, 1978, by extending the renewal term from 47 \n     years to 67 years. The effect of this amendment is to provide \n     a composite term of protection of 95 years from the date of \n     publication.\n\n Section 2(d)(1)(B)--Duration of Copyright: Copyright in Their Renewal \n         Term or Registered for Renewal Before January 1, 1978\n\n       This subsection amends Sec. 304(b) of the Copyright Act to \n     extend the copyright term of pre-1978 works currently in \n     their renewal term from 75 years to 95 years. As amended, \n     this section clarifies that the extension applies only to \n     works that are currently under copyright protection and is \n     not intended to restore copyright protection to works already \n     in the public domain.\n\n    Section 2(d)(1)(C) & (D)--Termination of Transfers and Licenses\n\n       These subsections amend Sec. 340(c) of the Copyright Act \n     and create a new subsection (d) to provide a revived power of \n     termination for individual authors whose right to terminate \n     prior transfers and licenses of copyright under Sec. 304(c) \n     has expired, provided the author has not previously exercised \n     that right. Under Sec. 304(c), an author may terminate a \n     prior transfer or license of copyright for any work, other \n     than a work made for hire, by serving advance written notice \n     upon the grantee or the grantee's successor at least 2, but \n     not more than 10, years prior to the effective date of the \n     termination. Such termination may be effected at any time \n     within 5 years beginning at the end of 56 years from the date \n     of publication. The purpose of this termination provision \n     was to afford the individual creator the opportunity to \n     bargain for the benefit of the 19-year extension provided \n     by the 1976 Copyright Act.\n\n[[Page S2684]]\n\n       For most individual creators, the existing power of \n     termination under Sec. 304(c) will allow them to terminate \n     prior transfers and to bargain for the benefit of both the \n     extension under the 1976 Copyright Act and the extension \n     under the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1997. For a much \n     smaller group of individuals, the five-year window in which \n     to terminate prior transfers under Sec. 304(c) has already \n     expired. Thus, these creators are denied the opportunity to \n     reap the benefits of the extended term, while the current \n     copyright owners are given a 20-year windfall. This \n     subsection amends the existing termination provisions under \n     Sec. 304(c) of Copyright Act to create a revived window, \n     beginning at the end of the current 75-year copyright term, \n     in which individual creators or their heirs who did not \n     terminate previous transfers or grants prior to the \n     expiration of their right of termination under Sec. 304(c) \n     may bargain for the benefit of the extended term.\n\n            Section 2(d)(2)--Copyright Renewal Act revisions\n\n       This subsection makes corresponding amendments to Sec. 102 \n     of the Copyright Renewal Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-307, 106 Stat. \n     266) to reflect the changes made by the Copyright Term \n     Extension Act.\n\n   Section 3--Clarification of Library Exemption of Exclusive Rights\n\n       This subsection amends Sec. 108 of the Copyright Act, \n     governing limited exemptions from copyright infringement for \n     libraries and archives, including nonprofit educational \n     institutions that function as such, by redesignating \n     subsection (h) as subsection (i) and inserting a new \n     subsection (h). The new subsection (h)(1) will allow \n     libraries, archives, and nonprofit educational institutions \n     to reproduce and distribute copies of works for preservation, \n     scholarship, or research during the last 20 years of \n     copyright, if the works are not being commercially exploited \n     and cannot be obtained at a reasonable price. The new \n     subsection (h)(2) provides that the limited exemption does \n     not apply where the copyright owner provides notice to the \n     Copyright Office that the conditions regarding commercial \n     exploitation and reasonable availability have not been met. \n     The new subsection (h)(3) provides that the exemption does \n     not apply to subsequent users other than the libraries or \n     archives.\n\n\n                section 4. distribution of phonorecords\n\n       Section 4 affirms the longstanding view that the public \n     distribution of phonorecords prior to 1978, did not \n     constitute publication of the musical composition embodied \n     therein under the 1909 Copyright Act. This section overturns \n     the decision in LaCienega Music Co. v. Z.Z. Top., 53 F.3d 950 \n     (9th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 116 S.Ct. 331 (1995), which \n     held that the sale of records constituted ``publication'' of \n     the musical composition under the 1909 Act, and implicitly \n     ruled that unless such a copy contained a copyright notice, \n     the composition entered the public domain immediately upon \n     the first sale. The result of such a view is that potentially \n     thousands of musical compositions will be stripped of their \n     presumed copyright protection as unpublished works under the \n     1909 Act. Section 13 adopts the view of the Second Circuit \n     that the pre-1978 sale or distribution of recordings to the \n     public did not constitute a publication for copyright \n     purposes. Rosette v. Rainbo Record Mfg. Corp., 354 F.Supp. \n     1183 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd per curiam, 546 F.2d 461 (2d. Cir. \n     1976). This same view is adopted by the Copyright Office, \n     which for years has refused to accept registrations for such \n     phonorecords as published works.\n\n\n                       section 5. effective date\n\n       Subsection (a) provides that this Act and the amendments \n     made thereby shall be effective on the date of enactment. \n     Subsection (b) provides, however, that the overturning of the \n     LaCienega decision will not retroactively upset the \n     disposition of previously adjudicated or pending cases.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad to be working with Senator Hatch \nas original cosponsors of this, the Copyright Term Extension Act of \n1997. We worked together on this matter last Congress to craft a bill \nthat was reported by the Judiciary Committee to the Senate by a vote of \n15 to 3.\n  I raised a number of questions and concerns during our Judiciary \nCommittee hearing on this issue back in September 1995. I spoke of a \nletter I had received from Prof. Karen Burke Lefevre of Vermont and the \nRensselaer Polytechnic Institute. She expressed reservations, as a \nresearcher and author, that Congress not extend the term for \nunpublished works beyond the term set by the 1976 Act. This category of \nmaterials is set to have its copyrights expire in 2002. They include \nanonymous works and unpublished works of interest to scholars. In \nsection 2(c) of the bill we introduce today, we accommodate these \ninterests and preserve the public availability of these materials in \n2003, if they remain unpublished on December 31, 2002.\n  I want to thank Marybeth Peters, our Register of Copyrights, for \nsupporting this improvement in the bill, and Senator Hatch for working \nwith me on it.\n  I am concerned about libraries, educational institutions and \nnonprofits being able to access materials and provide access in turn \nfor research, archival, preservation and other purposes. We have also \nmade progress in this area as reflected in section 3 of the bill. \nCopyright industry and library representatives have narrowed their \ndifferences. I ask for their continued help in crafting the best \nbalance possible to create public access for noncommercial purposes \nduring the extension period without undercutting the value of \ncopyrights.\n  At our hearing I also raised the notion of a new right of termination \nfor works where the period of termination in current law has already \npassed and the 20-year extension inures to the benefit of a copyright \ntransferee. This bill creates such a right of termination in section \n2(d) of the bill.\n  At our hearing, I was still considering whether there was sufficient \njustification for extending the copyright term for an additional 20 \nyears. At that time we were considering the European Union Directive to \nits member countries to provide copyright protection for a term of life \nplus 70 years by July 1, 1995. While many of our trading partners had \nnot extended their terms by July 1995, they have acted to do so in the \npast 2 years.\n  I received a letter from Bruce A. Lehman, the Assistant Secretary of \nCommerce and Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, in which he \nreported that Austria, Germany, Greece, France, Denmark, Belgium, \nIreland, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom had complied with the EU \nDirective on Copyright Term. Sweden, Portugal, Finland and the \nNetherlands were reported to have legislation to do so pending, as \nwell. With so many of our trading partners moving to the longer term \nbut preparing to recognize American works for only the shorter term, I \nbelieve it is time for us to act.\n  This bill also now includes a revised version of legislation that \npassed the House last Congress but was stalled in the Senate to clarify \nthe Copyright Act of 1909 with regard to whether the distribution of \nphonorecords may be held to be a divesting publication of the copyright \nin the musical composition embodied therein. The revision is intended \nto clarify the law while not affecting cases in which parties have \nlitigated or are litigating this issue.\n  Finally, I feel strongly that the extension of the copyright term \nshould include public benefit, such as the creation of new works or \nbenefit to public arts. Senator Dodd, Senator Kennedy, and I have been \nconcerned about finding an appropriate way to benefit the public from \nthis extension and continue to do so. Along these lines, the Copyright \nOffice is examining how the extension in this bill will benefit \ncopyright industries, authors and the public.\n  Given the changes made to meet the concerns that I raised with an \nearlier bill and in light of the international developments that are \ndisadvantaging American copyrighted works, I cosponsored the Committee \nsubstitute at our Judiciary Committee executive business session last \nCongress and pressed for its consideration by the Senate. \nUnfortunately, this bill was not considered by the Senate during the \n104th Congress.\n  Accordingly, I join with Senator Hatch to reintroduce this copyright \nterm extension legislation this Congress and look forward to working \nwith him to see to its enactment, without further delay.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to express my support for the \nCopyright Term Extension Act of 1997. I believe that extending the \nbasic term of copyright protection by 20 years is a step in the right \ndirection.\n  Perhaps the most compelling reason for this legislation is the need \nfor greater international reciprocity in honoring copyright terms. The \nEuropean Union has formally adopted a life plus 70 copyright term, and \ncountries currently awaiting admission to the Union will adopt this \nstandard in the future. Several countries outside of the European Union \nalso have turned to the life plus 70 term, and many expect it to become \nthe international standard.\n  By extending to life plus 70 years, Congress will help ensure that \nAmerican creators receive comparable protection in other countries. If \nwe do not act, other nations will not be required\n\n[[Page S2685]]\n\nto provide American authors and artists with any more protection than \nwe offer them at home.\n  And, before the United States is the world's leader in the production \nof intellectual property, and because the State of California is home \nto many of the leading copyright industries, this issue is of great \nimportance to me. We could be the net losers if we do not move toward \ngreater harmonization.\n  Intellectual property--the collective creative output of America's \nmakers of movies, music, art, and other works--is an enormous asset to \nthe Nation's economy and balance of trade.\n  The International Intellectual Property Alliance estimates that \ncopyright-related industries contributed more than $385 billion to the \nU.S. economy in 1994, with more than $50 billion in foreign sales.\n  Many other countries have preferred to appropriate and re-sell \nAmerican films, music, and computer programs--some of the great exports \nof my State of California--rather than license American works.\n  The United States suffers greatly from illegal duplication of our \nwork. Why, then, should we sit back and allow European companies to \nlegally profit from the use of our works, without paying us in return?\n  As Prof. Arthur Miller of Harvard Law School aptly, albeit bluntly, \nput it: ``Unless Congress matches the copyright extension adopted by \nthe European Union, we will lost 20 years of valuable protection \nagainst rip-off artists.'' Since America is the world's principal \nexporter of popular culture, extension of the basic copyright term is \nan important step in the right direction.\n  Reciprocity in copyright protection becomes even more necessary in \ntoday's global information society, where computer networks span the \ncontinents, and intellectual property is shuttled around the world in \nseconds.\n  The world has changed dramatically since 1976, when Congress \nestablished the present copyright terms. Many copyrighted works have a \nmuch longer commercial life than they used to have.\n  Videocassettes, cable television, and new satellite delivery systems \nhave extended the commercial life of movies and television series. New \ntechnologies not only have extended but also have expanded the market \nfor creative content. Cable television, which promises hundreds of \ndifferent channels, has vastly expanded this market. Networked \ncomputers add to the demand for content. Interactive television \npromises to do the same.\n  The Copyright Term Extension Act will go far to address the global \ndevelopments I have mentioned.\n  After introduction, I recommend that my colleagues and I further \ndevelop the language of the act to ensure that all contributors to the \ncreative process receive benefits from the extended copyright term.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n                                 S. 506\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The following is a \n     brief summary of its provisions.\n       Satellite Home Viewer Act Technical Amendments. Section 2 \n     makes technical corrections to the Satellite Home Viewer Act \n     of 1994 (SHVA), as recommended by the Copyright Office. \n     First, the bill corrects the dollar figures specified in the \n     Act for royalties to be paid by satellite carriers--the 1994 \n     SHVA amendments mistakenly reversed the rates set by \n     arbitration in 1992 for signals subject to FCC syndicated \n     exclusivity blackout rules vs. those that are not subject to \n     such rules. Second, the bill corrects errors in section \n     numbers and references resulting from the failure of the 1994 \n     SHVA amendments to account for changes made to Title 17 by \n     the Copyright Royalty Tribunal Act of 1993. Third, the bill \n     replaces references to ``the effective date of the Satellite \n     Home Viewer Act of 1988'' with the actual calendar date so as \n     to avoid confusion caused by the two Acts bearing the same \n     name.\n       Copyright Restoration. Section 3 clarifies ambiguities and \n     corrects drafting errors in the Copyright Restoration Act, \n     which was enacted as part of the 1994 Uruguay Round \n     Agreements Act to restore copyright protection in the U.S. \n     for certain works from WTO member countries that had fallen \n     into the public domain. First, the bill corrects a drafting \n     error that precludes U.S. creators of derivative works from \n     continuing to exploit those works if copyright protection in \n     the underlying foreign work is restored under GATT. Second, \n     the bill eliminates a duplicative reporting requirement. \n     Third, the bill clarifies Congress' intent that the effective \n     date of restoration is January 1, 1996 (not 1995 as \n     interpreted by some commentators). Fourth, the bill clarifies \n     the definition of ``eligible country'' as it pertains to \n     limited rights of continued exploitation for those who rely \n     on public domain works that were restored under GATT. An \n     ambiguous reference in the original bill left open the \n     possible interpretation that a party would not qualify as a \n     ``reliance party'' where reliance had not predated adherence \n     to the Berne Convention for the country of origin--a date \n     that goes as far back as 1886 for many countries.\n       Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings. Section 4 \n     ensures that the effective rates under the 1995 digital \n     performance rights bill will not lapse. That bill requires \n     new rates to be established during 2000, and the 1996 rates \n     are to expire at the end of 2000. In the case where the \n     copyright arbitration royalty panel (CARP) does not complete \n     its work by the end of the year, or where the Librarian of \n     Congress does not complete its review of the CARP's report by \n     the end of the year, this section provides that the 1996 \n     rates will continue beyond the December 31, 2000, expiration \n     date until 30 days after the Librarian publishes a decision \n     to adopt or reject the CARP's rate adjustment. This section \n     (as well as provisions in Section 5) also eliminates \n     authorization for a CARP to publish its report in the Federal \n     Register since only federal agencies are permitted to do so. \n     Instead, CARP decisions will be published by the Librarian. \n     Section 11 corrects a numbering mistake in the 1995 Digital \n     Performance Right bill.\n       Negotiated Jukebox License. Section 6 restores the \n     definitions of a ``jukebox'' and a ``jukebox operator'' to \n     Sec. 116A of Title 17. These definitions were mistakenly \n     eliminated from the old Sec. 116 jukebox compulsory license \n     when that section was replaced by the current Sec. 116A \n     negotiated jukebox license in the 1988 Berne Convention \n     implementing legislation. This section also clarifies that \n     all jukebox negotiated licenses that require arbitration are \n     CARP proceedings.\n       Advance Notice of Intent to Copyright Live Performances. \n     Section 7 changes the current 10-days advanced notice \n     requirement for a copyright owner who intends to copyright \n     the fixation of a live performance to a 48-hours advanced \n     notice requirement. The current provision has proven \n     unworkable for sporting events, in particular, where the \n     teams and times of the event may not be known 10 days in \n     advance.\n       Copyright Office Fees. Section 8 responds to ambiguities in \n     the Copyright Fees and Technical Amendments Act of 1989. That \n     bill allows the Copyright Office to increase fees in 1995, \n     and every fifth year thereafter to reflect changes in the \n     Consumer Price Index (CPI). The Copyright Office did not \n     raise its fees in 1995, because it determined that the costs \n     associated with the increase would be greater than the \n     resulting revenue. Uncertainty has arisen as to whether the \n     failure to increase fees in 1995 precludes the Copyright \n     Office from increasing its fees again until 2000 and whether \n     the increase in the CPI to be used in calculating the fee \n     increase is the increase since the last fee settlement (1990) \n     or only that since 1995. The bill clarifies that the \n     Copyright Office may increase its fees in any given year, \n     provided it has not done so within the last five years, and \n     that the fees may be increased up to the amount required to \n     cover the reasonable costs incurred by the Copyright Office \n     plus a reasonable inflation adjustment to account for future \n     increases in costs. The bill also allows the Register of \n     Copyrights to invest funds from the prepaid fees in interest \n     bearing securities in the U.S. Treasury and to use the income \n     from those investments for Copyright Office expenses. It is \n     expected that the proceeds will be used for the development \n     of the Copyright Office's new electronic registration, \n     recordation, and deposit system.\n       Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels (CARPs). Section 9 \n     clarifies administrative issues regarding the operation of \n     the CARPs. First, it gives the Librarian of Congress express \n     authority to pay panel members directly in ratemaking and \n     distribution proceedings and clarifies that these arbitrators \n     are independent contractors acting on behalf of the U.S. \n     (thus subject to laws governing the conduct of government \n     employees). Second, it clarifies that copyright owners and \n     users are responsible for equal shares of the costs of \n     ratemaking proceedings. Third, it clarifies by way of example \n     the procedural and evidentiary rulings the Librarian of \n     Congress can issue with respect to CARP proceedings. Fourth, \n     it clarifies that the 1997 ratemaking proceeding for the \n     satellite carrier compulsory license is a CARP proceeding.\n       Digital Audio Recording Devices. Section 10 provides added \n     flexibility for the Librarian of Congress in setting the \n     negotiation period for the distribution of digital audio \n     recording technology (DART) royalties, with the intention of \n     promoting settlements and timely distribution of royalties. \n     The current March 30 annual deadline for determining whether \n     there exist controversies among claimants has proven \n     unworkable and is eliminated by this section.\n       Miscellaneous Technical Amendments. Section 12 makes \n     various technical corrections, such as spelling, grammatical, \n     capitalization, and other corrections, to title 17.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                                 S. 507\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S2688]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

ELECTRONIC FILING.\n\n       Section 22 of title 35, United States Code, is amended by \n     striking ``printed or typewritten'' and inserting ``printed, \n     typewritten, or on an electronic medium'' .\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                  Omnibus Patent Act of 1997--Summary\n\n\n      title i--the united states patent and trademark organization\n\n       This title establishes the United States Patent and \n     Trademark Organization (USPTO) as a wholly owned government \n     corporation connected for policy-making purposes to the \n     Department of Commerce. Like the existing U.S. Patent and \n     Trademark Office, the USPTO is charged with patent and \n     trademark policy formulation and the administration of the \n     patent and trademark systems. But unlike the present \n     structure, the USPTO will be freed from a heavy-handed \n     federal bureaucracy, which inhibits the ability of the Patent \n     and Trademark Office to meet the demands of those who fully \n     sustain its operation through user fees. Heightened \n     efficiency is also achieved by separating the policymaking \n     functions from the day-to-day operating functions.\n       The USPTO is headed by a Director of the U.S. Patent and \n     Trademark Office, who is charged with advising the President \n     through the Secretary of Commerce regarding patent and \n     trademark policy. He or she is appointed by the President \n     with Senate confirmation, and he or she serves at the \n     pleasure of the President.\n       The USPTO has two autonomous subdivisions: the Patent \n     Office and the Trademark Office. Each office is responsible \n     for the administration of its own system. Each office \n     controls its own budget and its management structure and \n     procedures. Each office must generate its own revenue in \n     order to be self-sustaining and to provide for the Office of \n     the Director. The Patent Office and the Trademark Office are \n     headed by the Commissioner of Patents and the Commissioner of \n     Trademarks, respectively. The two Commissioners are appointed \n     by the Director and serve at his or her pleasure.\n\n\n                      title ii--early publication\n\n       Title II of the bill provides for the early publication of \n     patent applications. It would require the Patent Office to \n     publish pending applications eighteen months after the \n     application was filed. An exception of this rule is made for \n     applications filed only in the United States. Those \n     applications will be published eighteen months after filing \n     or three months after the office issues its first response on \n     the application, whichever is later. Additionally, once an \n     application is published, Title II grants the applicant \n     ``provisional rights,'' that is, legal protection for his or \n     her invention.\n\n\n                   title iii--patent term restoration\n\n       Title III deals with the problem of administrative delay in \n     the patent examination process by restoring to the patent \n     holder any part of the term that is lost due to undue \n     administrative delay. Title III gives clear deadlines in \n     which the Patent Office must act. The office has \n     fourteen months to issue a first office action and four \n     months to respond to subsequent applicant filings. Any \n     delay beyond those deadlines is considered undue delay and \n     will be restored to the patent term.\n\n\n                Title IV--Prior domestic Commercial Use\n\n       This title provides rights to a person who has commercially \n     sold an invention more than one year before the effective \n     filing date of a patent application by another person. Anyone \n     in this situation will be permitted to continue to sell his \n     or her product without being forced to pay a royalty to the \n     patent holder.\n\n\n                 Title V--Patent Re-examination Reform\n\n       Title V provides for a greater role for third parties in \n     patent re-examination proceedings by allowing third-parties \n     to raise a challenge to an existing patent and to participate \n     in the reexamination process in a meaningful way.\n\n\n                        Title VI--Miscellaneous\n\n     Provisional Applications for Patents\n       This title amends section 115 of Title 35 of the U.S. Code \n     to clarify that if a provisional application is converted \n     into a non-provisional application within twelve months of \n     filing, that it stands as a full patent application, with the \n     date of filing of the provisional application as the date of \n     priority. If no request is made within twelve months, the \n     provisional application is considered abandoned. This \n     clarification will make certain that American provisional \n     applications are given the same weight as other countries' \n     provisional applications in other countries' courts.\n     Plant Patents\n       Title VI also makes two corrections to the plant patent \n     statute. First, the ban on tuber propagated plants is \n     removed. This depression-era ban was included for fear of \n     limiting the food supply. This is no longer a concern. \n     Second, the plant patent statute is amended to include parts \n     of plants. This closes a loophole that foreign growers have \n     used to import the fruit or flowers of patented plants \n     without paying a royalty because the entire plant was not \n     being sold.\n     Electronic Filing\n       Lastly, this title also allows for the filing of patent and \n     trademark documents by electronic medium.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 508. A bill to provide Mai Hoa ``Jasmin'' Salehi permanent \nresidency; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                       private relief legislation\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this bill grants permanent residency \nstatus to Jasmin Salehi, a California constituent who is currently \nassisting the LA district attorney with the prosecution of her \nhusband's murderer.\n  Mai Hoa Jasmin Salehi is a Korean immigrant who was denied permanent \nresidency after her husband was violently murdered at a Denny's in \nReseda, CA, where he worked as manager. Local INS officials in Los \nAngeles denied Jasmin's application because the law requires legal \nimmigrants be married for 2 years before they become eligible for \npermanent resident status. Jasmin and Cyrus Salehi were newlyweds who \nhad been married only 11 months before the murder.\n  I have previously sought administrative relief for Jasmin by asking \nthe INS if any humanitarian exemptions could be made in Jasmin's case, \nbut the local INS officials in Los Angeles has told my staff that there \nis nothing they can do.\n  Jasmin met and married Cyrus Salehi, an American citizen, in March \n1995 and has completed all the paperwork necessary to obtain her green \ncard. But now, Jasmin has been told that she can stay in the United \nStates as long as the district attorney needs her to prosecute her \nhusband's murderer. Despite here assistance in the prosecution, Jasmin \nwould be deported once the investigation and subsequent trial are \ncompleted.\n  Jasmin has done everything right in order to become a permanent \nresident of this country--except for the tragedy of her husband's \nmurder 13 months before she could become a permanent resident. I hope \nyou support this bill so that we can help Jasmin begin to rebuild her \nlife in the United States.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the attached news \narticle and the bill be entered into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 508\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n       I. Permanent Residence:\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for purposes of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), \n     Mai Hoa ``Jasmin'' Salehi, shall be held and considered to \n     have been lawfully admitted to the United States for \n     permanent residence as of the date of the enactment of this \n     Act upon payment of the required visa fees.\n\n[[Page S2700]]\n\n     \n                                                                    ____\n                   [From the Los Angeles Daily News]\n\n                       Widow's Troubles Multiply\n\n                        (By Jeannette DeSantis)\n\n       Things have gotten worse instead of better for Jasmin \n     Salehi.\n       Alone in a new apartment, half of her belongings still \n     packed in moving boxes, Salehi, 32, surveys her new residence \n     and wonders how it came to this.\n       When the Korean widow first came to the United States more \n     than a year ago, her life was filled with promise. A loving \n     husband with a steady income, friends and a comfortable home \n     in Sherman Oaks were more that she could ask for.\n       Then life handed her more.\n       Her husband of 11 months, Cyrus Salehi, was slain earlier \n     this year. Soon after, the Immigration and Naturalization \n     Service notified Salehi she would be deported because she had \n     not been married to a U.S. citizen long enough to get her \n     green card.\n       And recently, she was evicted from the only home she has \n     known since arriving in the United States.\n       ``All these things happened at one time,'' Salehi said. \n     ``It is really hard for me, and I get depresses . . . \n     especially during the holidays.''\n       In the midst of her first holiday season as a widow, Salehi \n     can only dream of her husband, Cyrus Salehi, killed in \n     February after two robbers shot him during a holdup at the \n     Reseda Denny's restaurant he owned.\n       ``There are lots of memories of my husband . . . and our \n     Christmases together,'' she said. ``Now, every Christmas will \n     be a Christmas without him.''\n       But it won't be a holiday season without friends.\n       Francine and Ralph Myers, who informally adopted Salehi \n     since Cyrus's death, met her through a victim support group. \n     The Myers, whose son was slain, know well how those first \n     holiday seasons can affect a victim of crime.\n       ``It can be a real tough time,'' Francine Myers said. ``It \n     is different for everyone. Jasmin doesn't want to decorate. I \n     remember (after my son died) I would try to change every \n     tradition we had and make new ones.''\n       Myers said Salehi is a survivor, who stood up to the INS \n     and was allowed to stay in the country until her husband's \n     accused killer stands trial. Meanwhile, she has not let her \n     own grief stop her from helping others.\n       ``Although she needs help, she unselfishly helps others,'' \n     Myers said, adding that Salehi has accompanied her to the \n     trial of the person accused of murdering her own son. ``That \n     says something about her.''\n       Salehi contends that she is only returning the support the \n     Myers have given her. ``She is a victim too, and all that \n     time she is there for me,'' Salehi said.\n       Shellie Samuels, the deputy district attorney handling the \n     Cyrus Salehi murder case, said that although all victims of \n     crime are traumatized by a loved one's death, Salehi's ordeal \n     has been especially nightmarish.\n       ``Besides the emotional trauma she has gone through, the \n     U.S. has not done right by her,'' Samuels said. ``Her \n     American citizen husband gets killed and they treat her like \n     an illegal immigrant.''\n       Cyrus and Jasmin Salehi filed the paperwork for Salehi to \n     receive a green card in early 1995, soon after their March \n     nuptials.\n       But Salehi was deemed ineligible for residence status \n     because her husband was killed before they had been married \n     two years--an INS time requirement for a spouse sponsorship.\n       The INS has only offered Salehi a temporary reprieve, \n     allowing her to stay in the country for her husband's murder \n     trial.\n       As for Salehi, she fears if she is sent back to Korea, she \n     will be a stranger in her own country, a place where stigmas \n     are attached to orphans and widows, of which she is both.\n       Born Mai Hoa Joo in Seoul, Korea, in 1964, Salehi's parents \n     died within months of each other when she was 14. A college \n     graduate, Salehi visited the United States several times \n     before she immigrated.\n       During a 1993 visit, Salehi met her husband at a Denny's \n     restaurant in Los Angeles. They continued their relationship \n     even as Salehi returned to Korea.\n       Once married, Salehi received a work permit after she \n     applied for a green card and began working at a clothing \n     manufacturer in downtown Los Angeles, where she still puts in \n     10-hour days on a regular basis.\n       But her salary as a production manager was not enough to \n     cover the mortgage payment on the small house the couple \n     owned, even though she has inherited part ownership of the \n     Denny's restaurant where her husband was killed.\n       ``She has run into a lot of roadblocks, but she is a \n     survivor,'' said Francine Myers. ``She will do all right as \n     long as she feels like she has the support behind her.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS:\n  S. 509 A bill to provide for the return of certain program and \nactivity fund rejected by States to the Treasury to reduce the Federal \ndeficit, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Budget and the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs, jointly, pursuant to the order of \nAugust 4, 1977, as modified by the order of April 11, 1986, with \ninstructions that if one Committee reports, the other Committee have \nthirty days to report or be discharged.\n\n\n                 the fair and responsible fund use act\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Fair and \nResponsible Fund Use Act. It is a bill that will provide for the return \nof funds, rejected by a State, to the Treasury. These funds will then \nbe used specifically to reduce the Federal deficit.\n  Sometimes the Federal Government makes available to Montana, and \nother States, funds which are inconsistent with State priorities. \nUsually this money comes with strings attached. In other words, the \nFederal Government wants us to take X action to get Y dollars. \nSometimes, out of fiscal conservatism, or philosophical differences, \nStates will return that money to the Treasury. But what has been the \nreward for an individual State's refusal to grab the Federal carrot \nthat has been dangled in front of it? That money is returned to the \nprogram for use by other States.\n  That's just not right. California or New York should not be the \nbeneficiaries of Montana's restraint and good judgment. The good people \nof Montana have asked me to take action to stop this from happening and \nthat's why I am introducing this bill today. The Fair and Responsible \nFund Use Act will require that we take those funds returned by the \nStates and use them to pay down our national deficit.\n  Montana and 48 other States are required by law to balance their \nbudgets. While we came one vote short of making that the standard for \nthis Nation, most of us here in Washington are still determine to \nbalance our books. If a State has the courage and willingness to do \nwithout a quick Federal buck, then it's only right that the American \npeople, as a whole, should benefit from that action.\n  Whatever the States send back may seem like small potatoes to some \npeople, but as the late Senator Everett Dirksen once said, ``A billion \nhere, and a billion there, and pretty soon you're talking about real \nmoney.''\n  We face the very real danger of being crushed by our national \ndeficit. Some of our mindless spending in the past years has left us \nwith a debt of 5.34 trillion dollars-- ``trillion'' with a capital \n``T.'' And it's only going to get worse if we don't do something to \nhelp out.\n  This bill makes good common sense. We all must work together in order \nto pay off the huge national deficit and this is one step in the right \ndirection. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN:\n  S. 510. A bill to authorize the Architect of the Capitol to develop \nand implement a plan to improve the Capitol grounds through the \nelimination and modification of space allocated for parking; to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n        The Arc of Park Capitol Grounds Improvement Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, nearly 100 years ago, in March of 1901, \nthe Senate Committee on the District of Columbia was directed by Senate \nResolution to ``report to the Senate plans for the development and \nimprovement of the entire park system of the District of Columbia * * * \n(F)or the purpose of preparing such plans the committee * * * may \nsecure the services of such experts as may be necessary for a proper \nconsideration of the subject.''\n  And secure ``such experts'' the committee assuredly did. The \nCommittee formed what came to be known as the McMillan Commission, \nnamed for committee chairman Senator James McMillan of Michigan. The \nCommission's membership was a ``who's who'' of late 19th and 20th-\ncentury architecture, landscape design, and art: Daniel Burnham, \nFrederick Law Olmsted Jr., Charles F. McKim, and Augustus St. Gaudens. \nThe Commission traveled that summer to Rome, Venice, Vienna, Budapest, \nParis, and London, studying the landscapes, architecture, and public \nspaces of the grandest cities in the world. The McMillan Commission \nreturned and fashioned the city of Washington as we now know it.\n  We are particularly indebted today for the Commission's preservation \nof the Mall. When the members left for Europe, the Congress had just \ngiven the Pennsylvania Railroad a 400-foot wide swath of the Mall for a \nnew station and trackage. It is hard to imagine our city without the \nuninterrupted stretch of greenery from the Capitol to the Washington \nMonument, but such would have been the result. Fortunately, when in \nLondon, Daniel\n\n[[Page S2701]]\n\nBurnham was able to convince Pennsylvania Railroad president Alexander \nCassatt that a site on Massachusetts Avenue would provide a much \ngrander entrance to the city. President Cassatt assented and Daniel \nBurnham gave us Union Station.\n  But the focus of the Commission's work was the District's park \nsystem. The Commission noted in its report:\n\n       Aside from the pleasure and the positive benefits to health \n     that the people derive from public parks, in a capital city \n     like Washington there is a distinct use of public spaces \n     as the indispensable means of giving dignity to Government \n     buildings and of making suitable connections between the \n     great departments * * * [V]istas and axes; sites for \n     monuments and museums; parks and pleasure gardens; \n     fountains and canals; in a word all that goes to make a \n     city a magnificent and consistent work of art were \n     regarded as essential in the plans made by L'Enfant under \n     the direction of the first President and his Secretary of \n     State.\n\n  Washington and Jefferson might be disappointed at the affliction now \nimposed on much of the Capitol Grounds by the automobile.\n  Despite the ready and convenient availability of the city's Metrorail \nsystem, an extraordinary number of Capitol Hill employees drive to \nwork. No doubt many must. But must we provide free parking? If there is \none lesson learned from the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act of 1991, it is that free goods are always wasted. Free \nparking is a powerful incentive to drive to work when the alternative \nis to pay for public transportation. As we have created parking spaces \naround the Capitol, such as the scar of angle-parked cars at the foot \nof Pennsylvania Avenue made available ``temporarily'' during \nconstruction of the Thurgood Marshall Federal Judiciary Building, \ndemand has simply risen to meet the available supply. The result--the \nPennsylvania Avenue spaces have become permanent and a portion of the \nNation's main street remains an aesthetic disaster.\n  Today, I am reintroducing legislation to complete the beautification \nof the Capitol Grounds, as envisioned by the illustrious McMillan \nCommission in 1901, through the elimination of most surface parking and \nrestoration of the sites as public parks. The Arc of Park Capitol \nGrounds Improvement Act of 1997 would require the Architect of the \nCapitol to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to improve the \nCapitol Grounds through the creation of an ``arc of park,'' sweeping \nfrom Second Street, NE to the Capitol Reflecting Pool and back to First \nStreet, SE, with the Capitol Building as its approximate center. \nDelaware Avenue between Columbus Circle and Constitution Avenue would \nbe closed to traffic and rebuilt as a grand pedestrian walkway from \nUnion Station to the Capitol. The angled parking would be eliminated on \nPennsylvania Avenue between First and Third Streets, NW, and the \nPennsylvania Avenue tree line would be continued onto the Capitol \nGrounds.\n  There is, of course, the matter of parking. This legislation \nauthorizes the Architect of the Capitol to construct underground \nparking facilities, as needed. These facilities, which will undoubtedly \nbe expensive, will be financed simply by charging for the parking. A \nlegitimate user fee. In the matter of parking, this legislation is an \nappropriate companion to a bill that my colleague from Rhode Island, \nSenator Chafee, and I introduced earlier today, which will enable \nemployers to provide their employees with cash compensation in lieu of \na parking space. This bill, which was also included in the \nAdministration's ISTEA reauthorization proposal, will expand employee \noptions for commuting and reduce auto use.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n        DeWine, Mr. Dodd, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kerrey, and \n        Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 511. A bill to require that the health and safety of a child be \nconsidered in any foster care or adoption placement, to eliminate \nbarriers to the termination of parental rights in appropriate cases, to \npromote the adoption of children with special needs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             THE SAFE ADOPTIONS AND FAMILY ENVIRONMENTS ACT\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation to make some critical reforms to the child welfare system. \nThe goals of the legislation are twofold: to ensure that abused and \nneglected children are in safe settings, and to move children more \nrapidly out of the foster care system and into permanent placements.\n  While the goal of reunifying children with their biological families \nis laudable, we should not be encouraging States to return abused or \nneglected children to homes that are clearly unsafe; regrettably, this \nis occurring under current law.\n  Our legislation would clarify the primacy of safety and health in \ndecisions made about children who have been abused and neglected. The \nlegislation would also push States to identify and enact State laws to \naddress those circumstances in which the rights of the biological \nparent should be terminated expeditiously (for example, when the parent \nhas been found guilty of felony assault, chronic sexual abuse, or the \nmurder of a sibling).\n  The legislation also would provide incentives to move children into \npermanent placements, either by returning them home when reunification \nis the goal or by removing barriers to adoption.\n  I would like to thank those who have worked so hard to develop this \nlegislation. In particular, Senator Rockefeller, the lead Democratic \ncosponsor, with whom I have worked for many years on childrens' issues. \nI also want to thank Senator DeWine, who, as a former prosecutor, \nbrings a good deal of legal expertise and personal experience to this \nissue. We are also grateful for all Senator Jeffords has done in the \npast to lay the groundwork for this important legislation.\n  My sincere thanks also goes out to the many child advocacy \norganizations which were so helpful in the development of this \nlegislation.\n  Finally, it is encouraging that similar legislation has been \nintroduced in the House by Representatives Camp and Kennelly. While \nthere are minor differences between our bills, the overall goals of \nboth bills are the same.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act and the amendments made be this Act take effect on \n     October 1, 1997.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, children who are at risk of abuse and \nneglect are among the most vulnerable group in our society, and we have \na compelling obligation to do a better job in protecting such children. \nI am proud to join Senator Chafee and others in a bipartisan effort to \nimprove our federal child welfare programs.\n  Almost a decade ago, I had the opportunity and privilege to serve as \nthe Chairman of the bipartisan National Commission on Children. Our \ndiverse group spent several years traveling the country to meet with \nfamilies, officials and advocates to delve into the needs of children \nand families. We issued a unanimous report in 1991 with a comprehensive \nstrategy to help children and strengthen families. One of the chapters \nof our report was directed toward helping children at risk of abuse and \nneglect. Since the Children's Commission, I have been working to \nconvert our bipartisan recommendations into policy and programs.\n  The Children's Commission basic recommendations called for a more \ncomprehensive strategy for child protective services. The panel noted \nthe need for a range of services so that children and families could \nget what was needed on a case-by-case basis. Our report call for \nintensive family preservation services when appropriate. If children \nmust be removed from their homes, reunification services need to be \navailable to prepare children and parents for a safe return. There \nshould be better training for foster parents and child welfare staff. \nAdoption can be the best option for some children so adoption \nprocedures should be streamlined.\n  The SAFE Act--Safe Adoptions and Family Environments--follows through \non the Children's Commission recommendations. Our bill stresses that a \nchild's safety and a child's health must be a primary concern by \nclarifying current law known as ``reasonable efforts.'' It is designed \nto encourage states to move children into stable, permanent placements \nquickly. For some children, this will be adoption. For others, \nappropriate intervention and support services can enable children to \nreturn home safely. This bill will direct states to establish a \npermanency planning hearing for a child in foster care within 12 \nmonths, instead of the current 18 months which will cut by one-third \nthe amount of time a child is without a plan for a stable home. Our \nbill also offers states incentives to reduce the backlog of children \nwaiting for adoption.\n  I have fought for children and family programs throughout my career, \nand will continue to do so. Last Congress, I argued strongly that there \nis a fundamental difference between welfare reform and child welfare \nand foster care. I opposed a block grant approach to foster care \nbecause abused children should not be placed at further risk or face \ntime-limits. Ultimately, I voted for the block grant of welfare reform.\n  While I opposed attempts to convert child welfare and foster care \ninto a block grant last year, I acknowledged the problems in the system \nand pledged to work on ways to strengthen and improve programs for \nabused and neglected children outside the context of welfare reform. \nToday, we are delivering on that commitment and working in a bipartisan \nmanner to encourage reform.\n  Reform is desperately needed. Reports indicate that more than 1 \nmillion American children suffered some type of abuse and neglect. Over \n450,000 children are in foster care in our country. In my home state of \nWest Virginia, referrals to Child Protective Services are expected to \nincrease from 12,500 reports in 1991 to 17,000 this year. Foster care \nplacements in West Virginia has jumped to 3,113 children in January \n1997, up from 2,900 children in January 1996.\n  Clearly, we must work together with the states to address the \ncomplicated needs of abused and neglected children.\n  While our legislation may seem technical in nature, its goals are \nfocused on protecting children and ensuring that every child moves \nswiftly into a safe, permanent placement where they can grow up healthy \nand secure. To achieve such basic goals, we need to invest in a range \nof services--from prevention of abuse, family reunification, and \nadoptions.\n  Protecting children and helping families should be a bipartisan, \ncommunity based effort. We must forge partnerships with states and \nadvocates. This legislation reflects this spirit and commitment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Robb, Ms. Mosley-\n        Braun, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Feingold, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Akaka, Mr. \n        Bingaman, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S.J. Res. 24. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States relative to equal rights for women \nand men; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                       the equal rights amendment\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to introduce the equal \nrights amendment on behalf of myself and 14 other Senators. Two days \nbefore the 25th anniversary of the first congressional approval of the \nequal rights amendment, we reaffirm our strong commitment to making the \nERA part of the Constitution of the United States. We intend to do all \nwe can to see that it becomes part of the Constitution, which is where \nit belongs.\n  In a sense, action now is more important than ever. Women have \nachieved a great deal during the last two decades. But the statutory \nroute has not been as successful as we had hoped. Too many women and \ngirls still face unfair and discriminatory barriers in their education, \ncareers, sports, and other goals. The glass ceiling, the locked door, \nthe sticky floor, the wage gap, and the occupation gap are very real \nproblems.\n  Women still earn only 76 cents for each dollar earned by men. After a \nfull day's work, no woman should be forced to take home only three-\nquarters of a pay-check.\n  The vast majority of women are still clustered in a narrow range of \ntraditionally low-paying occupations. Too many women continue to be \nvictims of sexual harassment.\n  We must do more, much more, to guarantee fair treatment in the \nworkplace and in all aspects of society. Existing laws against sex \ndiscrimination in all its ugly forms can't get the job done. The need \nfor a constitutional guarantee of equal rights for women is compelling.\n  Susan B. Anthony said it best over a century ago. When the \nConstitution says, ``We the People,'' it should mean all the people. \nThose words speak to us across the years. And in 1997, we intend to see \nthat ``all'' means ``all''--and making ERA part of the Constitution is \nthe right way to do it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 24\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of \n     each House concurring therein), That the following article is \n     proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as \n     part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of \n     three-fourths of the several States:\n\n                              ``Article --\n\n       ``Section 1. Equality of rights under the law shall not be \n     denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on \n     account of sex.\n       ``Section 2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, \n     by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.\n       ``Section 3. This amendment shall take effect two years \n     after the date of ratification.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Con. Res. 15\n\n       Whereas the people of the United States and the people of \n     Taiwan have long enjoyed extensive ties;\n       Whereas Taiwan, a democracy of 21,000,000 people, is \n     currently the eighth largest trading partner of the United \n     States, and United States exports to Taiwan total more than \n     $18,000,000,000 annually, far exceeding the $12,000,000,000 \n     the United States exports to the People's Republic of China;\n       Whereas the current administration has committed publicly \n     to support Taiwan's bid to join the world Trade Organization \n     (referred to in this resolution as the ``WTO'') and has \n     declared that the United States will not oppose that bid \n     solely on the grounds that the People's Republic of China, \n     which also seeks WTO membership, is not yet eligible because \n     of the People's Republic of China's unacceptable trade \n     practices;\n       Whereas the United States and Taiwan have concluded \n     discussions on virtually all outstanding trade issues \n     necessary for Taiwan to be eligible to join the WTO;\n       Whereas reversion of control over Hong Kong to Beijing, \n     scheduled to occur on July 1, 1997, will, in most respects \n     afford the People's Republic of China WTO treatment for the \n     bulk of its trade goods, despite the fact that the people's \n     Republic of China's trade practices currently fall far short \n     of qualifying for WTO membership;\n       Whereas the American people's fundamental sense of fairness \n     warrants support by the United States Government for Taiwan's \n     bid for WTO membership, and\n       Whereas it is in the economic interests of United States \n     consumers and exporters for Taiwan to accede to the WTO at \n     the earliest possible moment: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that \n     negotiations between the United States and Taiwan be \n     concluded promptly and that the United States Government \n     publicly support the prompt accession of Taiwan to the WTO.\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, the months ahead will require a number \nof important decisions regarding the continuing evolution of U.S. \npolicy in the region of the Taiwan Straits.\n  Today, I am submitting a concurrent resolution to help clarify long-\nstanding U.S. commitments in this regard.\n  While the Clinton Administration and Congress attempt to improve \nrelations with the communist authorities in Beijing, it is important \nfor Congress to make clear the depth of the bipartisan commitment to \nthe burgeoning democratic forces on Taiwan. Any improvement in U.S. \nrelations with Taiwan, does not and should not come at the expense of \nour ties with the people of Taiwan.\n  The U.S. must renew our past commitments to the people of Taiwan. For \nexample, as a result of the Taiwan Policy Review throughout 1993 and \n1994 and the balance of 1994, the Clinton Administration publicly \npledged to support Taiwan's membership in appropriate international \norganizations. In this regard, few are as important as the World Trade \nOrganization.\n  Taiwan is currently the U.S.'s fifth largest trading partner and U.S. \nexports to Taiwan total more than $17 billion annually. This sum is \nalmost twice as much as U.S. exports to the P.R.C. Our trade with the \nPeople's Republic has produced a crushing $39 billion deficit last \nyear.\n  The Clinton Administration is publicly committed to supporting \nTaiwan's bid to join the World Trade Organization. It has already \ndeclared that the U.S. will not oppose the bid solely on the grounds \nthat the P.R.C., which is also seeking WTO membership, is not yet \neligible because of its unacceptable trade practices.\n  The U.S. and Taiwan have concluded discussions on virtually all \noutstanding trade issues necessary for Taiwan's W.T.O. eligibility. All \nthat is left is for the U.S. to make clear that it is prepared to \nsupport Taiwan's membership and for Taiwan and the U.S. to work out the \nfew remaining details governing trade in a few specific sectors.\n  In the weeks ahead, we will be called upon to vote to renew Most \nFavored Nation Status for China and analyzing China's actions as they \ntake control of Hong Kong. As we do all of this, we cannot forget about \nour commitments to the people of Taiwan.\n  Congress should reaffirm our support for Taiwan's bid to join the \nW.T.O. and make clear that our decision regarding Taiwan's bid will not \nbe held hostage to U.S. negotiations with Beijing.\n  Today, I am submitting a Sense of the Congress concurrent resolution \nwhich affirms our support for Taiwan's membership in the W.T.O.. I am \npleased that a similar concurrent resolution is being submitted with \nbi-partisan support in the other body.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2708-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2708-S2711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 16--SETTING FORTH THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET \n                         FOR THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Budget:\n\n                            S.

EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING POWERS.\n\n         The Congress adopts the provisions of this title--\n         (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such \n     they shall be considered as part of the rules of each House, \n     or of that House to which they specifically apply, and such \n     rules shall supersede other rules only to the extent that \n     they are inconsistent therewith; and\n         (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change those rules (so far as they relate to \n     that House) at any time, in the same manner, and to the same \n     extent as in the case of any other rule of that House.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as my friends on the other side of the \naisle like to point out, the Congressional Budget Act includes a \ntimetable for Congress to adopt a budget resolution that includes \nhaving the Senate Budget Committee report a budget resolution by April \n1--it used to be May but it was moved back to April 1--and the \nconference with the House is supposed to be completed by April 15. \nWhat, of course, is not being said is the simple fact that since 1987, \nwhen we moved the completion date from May 15 to April 15--only once in \nthose 11 years has the Congress ever met the April 15 deadline. Only \nthree times has the Senate Budget Committee itself met the April 1 \ndeadline.\n  Obviously, we have not been in charge of that committee most of those \nyears that the Democrat majority on the other side was in charge. \nNonetheless, this year the Senate Budget Committee received the \nPresident's budget on February 6. Incidentally, the President's budget \nwas delayed a few days this year also. Nevertheless, the committee has \nengaged in many hearings and meetings on the President's budget. And \nonly 17 days ago, on March 3, did the Congress receive the \nCongressional Budget Office's preliminary analysis of the President's \nbudget. The final analysis is yet to be completed. And we all know that \nthe Congressional Budget Office analysis of the President's budget set \nus back in our efforts to get this job done quickly. The President's \nplan did not achieve balance according to this preliminary report in \nthe year 2002 without relying on some awkward triggering mechanisms.\n  Yesterday, I, along with my fellow House Budget Committee Chairman \nand two ranking members, met with the President to discuss the budget \nbefore he left for Helsinki. We agreed that over the upcoming recess \nand early when we return we would work to identify and clarify our \ndifferences and attempt to seek some settlement of issues so that we \nmight return together a bipartisan budget blueprint that will get us to \nbalance in 2002 and keep us on a path to balance well into the next \ncentury.\n  Our hope is that these meetings which will take place in the next 2 \nweeks at the staff level to be followed by an intensive week of work on \nour return will yield a bipartisan budget blueprint with the President \nworking with the Congress. I am not saying to the Senate that I am \ncertain that will work, but I truly believe there is a probability that \nthis could work. There has been a lot of behind-the-scenes work, and I \nthink the issues are pretty well defined. Everybody wants to be rather \nspecific in the solutions and that will take a little bit of time.\n  As I expressed with the President yesterday, it is my fervent hope \nand I am committed to finding that common ground that will achieve the \ngoal not for anybody's political gain but for the country's economic \nfuture.\n  For today, however, it is obvious that the statutory deadline in the \nSenate will come while we are out on Easter recess and while staff is \nworking on this budget process during the recess. So today, in order to \nensure that the work of the Senate will go on, regardless of the \noutcome of these discussions, I am introducing two fully drafted budget \nresolutions that will be referred to the Budget Committee but will be \nautomatically discharged from the committee on April 1 and placed back \non the Senate Calendar. All of this occurs by statute which dictates \nthat procedure. This is not unprecedented and certainly not \nunreasonable. My former Democratic chairmen, Senators Chiles and \nSasser, routinely followed this process to provide that insurance the \nSenate needs that we would, indeed, be able to work our will even if \nthe committee failed to report a resolution.\n  So I want to make it clear that I do not intend that the Budget \nCommittee not report a budget resolution. That is clearly not my \nintention. I would not want to be vested with that result because we \nhave always been able to report a budget resolution out of the Budget \nCommittee for better or for worse. It has always met its \nresponsibilities, and I am certain we are going to do that again this \nyear. But in the event we could not, either of these resolutions which \nI introduced today could be called off the calendar by the leader and \nthe full Senate would then work its will on either of those as they are \ncalled up and made part of the Senate's ordinary business.\n  The first resolution I am submitting today is simply the President's \nbudget submitted back in February and reestimated by the Congressional \nBudget Office which we now know did not reach balance in the year 2002 \nbut resulted in a deficit of nearly $70 billion in that year. \nObviously, I do not support this resolution. I am doubtful whether it \nwould have much support of the Senate. And if it were called up by the \nBudget Committee in the Chamber, I would work to modify it \nsignificantly so that it did achieve balance and make these fundamental \nchanges required to truly address the fiscal concerns that lie beyond \n2002.\n  The second resolution I am introducing, I must say that I do not \nsupport it either and I do not think there would be a lot of Senators \nwho would like the medicine provided in that budget resolution but, \nreluctantly, would be forced to vote for this if progress is not made \nin the next few weeks to modify the President's proposal, and that \nmight be the case.\n  This is my own resolution. It is not necessarily a Republican \nresolution. It is simply my effort to point out to all what would be \nrequired to reach balance in 2002 without any changes to the \nPresident's limited entitlement savings. This second resolution, based \non the Congressional Budget Office benchmark used to analyze the \nPresident's budget, assumes the President's relatively low stated \nsavings over the next 5 years in Medicare of $100 billion and Medicaid \nof $9 billion.\n  This resolution assumes essentially the same defense spending pattern \nas the President had. The budget makes no assumptions about any changes \nto the Consumer Price Index and no changes to the Congressional Budget \nOffice assumptions. This alternative budget resolution assumes no net \ntax reductions over the next 5 years.\n  This resolution includes what might be thought of as a reverse \ntrigger. It is based on the Congressional Budget Office economic \nforecast which is more conservative than the administration's, but the \nresolution would allow for an adjustment to domestic spending and \npermit tax cuts, if the administration's more optimistic economic \nassumptions turn out to be right, more right than the Congressional \nBudget Office, and the targets toward a balanced budget are being met \non a specified timetable. Then there would be a trigger in instead of a \ntrigger out as the President proposed to make up for an unbalanced \nbudget.\n  Finally, to achieve balance in 2002 with these assumptions, that \nportion of the Federal Government that represents annually appropriated \naccounts for most domestic agencies will be reduced by $183 billion \nover the next 5 years--nearly three times the level that the President \nassumes in his budget. I estimate that these domestic spending programs \nwould see nearly a 20 percent reduction in the level of spending over \nthe next 5 years. And, of course, that is estimating that they all take \nthe same cut. To the extent that you cause some to increase others \nwould have to be reduced even more. There would be absolutely no room \nfor\n\n[[Page S2717]]\n\nany new initiatives and many existing programs would obviously have to \nbe terminated.\n  The message from this second resolution, if the goal is still to \nreach balance by 2002 using the conservative Congressional Budget \nOffice forecasts and unless the President is willing to do more than \nhis budget now envisions in mandatory programs or entitlement programs, \nnot only would we not be able to fund any new initiatives, there would \nbe significant reductions in programs such as education, environment, \ncrime fighting, transportation, housing and others and neither would \ntax cuts in the President's budget or the congressional budget be \npossible.\n  Again, this is not a preferred option on my part. I certainly am not \nrecommending this to anyone. I think we can do much better, and I think \nwe will. I think we can achieve balance and provide some relief, tax \nrelief, to hard-working American families. I believe we do not need to \ndevastate Government programs in the manner that I have just described.\n  But it will require courage in dealing with entitlement spending, and \nI am asking that the President join with us in a bipartisan way to \nexhibit that courage. I am dedicated to making sure neither of these \nresolutions I have introduced today will ever need to be considered \nwhen we return from this recess, for they will not be considered if we \nproduce a balanced budget in the committee and report it to the Senate, \nfor that will be the subject matter before the Senate at that time.\n  I believe that is entirely possible. If we cannot work something out \nwith the President, which I am still hoping and indicating today there \nis a probability that we could, then we will work it out in the \ncommittee. One way or another it will come out of there, in my opinion \nperhaps bipartisan. Work is underway and I remain hopeful that a solid \nbudget will be prepared that will enjoy the support of the President \nand the vast majority here in the Congress. I think we all understand \nthe significance of these events this year, and I must say that I \nbelieve the President understands the significance.\n  I mean, it seems to me that if, in fact, we do not reach some accord \nwith the President, he can look forward to a very frustrating couple of \nyears, achieving little or nothing, not moving toward a balanced budget \nwith any dispatch and any earnestness. And I am not sure that is good \nfor him.\n  For Republicans, I am quite positive that we do not want 2 or 4 years \nof just constant turmoil, working by ourselves, among ourselves as \nRepublicans, but rather should look forward to working this very \nimportant set of circumstances out in a bipartisan manner for the \nbenefit of everyone.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, my good friend, the distinguished chairman \nof the Budget Committee and the Senator from New Mexico, Senator \nDomenici, has just introduced and explained to the Senate two \nalternative budget resolutions.\n  He has, as a matter of courtesy, introduced the President's budget \nwithout change, but with the analysis and economic impacts that it will \ncost made by the Congressional Budget Office.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has also introduced a budget, a sparse \nand bare-bones budget, that he feels will be required as almost the \nonly responsible answer to the refusal of the President of the United \nStates seriously to consider entitlement reform in his budget.\n  In order to bring the budget of the United States in balance by the \nyear 2002, in order to get the huge fiscal dividend of more than $75 \nbillion that economists tell us will result from a balanced budget, in \norder to provide the economic opportunities and the increased income to \nAmericans across the country that a balanced budget will provide, in \norder to end the practice of spending money today and sending the bills \nto our children and grandchildren, the Senator from New Mexico has \nintroduced a budget that does no more and no less in the way of \nentitlement reform than the inadequate proposals of the President of \nthe United States, accepts the conservative projections of our economy \nmade by our own Congressional Budget Office and, therefore, includes no \nroom--and I emphasize no room, Mr. President--for overdue and deserved \ntax relief for the American people.\n  Even without any tax relief for the American people, this set of \ndecisions requires reductions in domestic discretionary spending that \nare extremely drastic, more than twice those that either the President \nor most of us, as Republicans on the Budget Committee, feel to be \nappropriate. In addition to leaving no room for any tax relief, this \nbudget has no room for any of the new initiatives proposed by the \nPresident himself.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has introduced this budget in this form \nto indicate precisely what the real world consequences of a failure to \nreform entitlement spending will be.\n  In addition, in order to end or to mute the debate with the President \nover whether the President's far more rosy projections of our economy \nare correct as against those of the Congressional Budget Office, the \nproposal of the Senator from New Mexico says if, in fact, the economy \noperates in a better fashion than is projected by the Congressional \nBudget Office, half of those additional revenues will be devoted to tax \nrelief and half to reducing the cuts in domestic discretionary \nspending. In other words, instead of the policies proposed by the \nPresident, which is ``spend now and then cut everything to ribbons if \nmy projections don't work out,'' this proposal says, ``take the more \nconservative projections now and spend and provide tax relief in the \nfuture if the President's projections show themselves to be correct in \nwhole or in part.''\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee did not present this proposal as \nhis preferred budget, nor is it mine, nor is it, I am sure, that of the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer at this point. It is simply what we are \nlikely to be forced to do if we cannot agree on significant reform in \nthe entitlement programs which are growing both so rapidly as to crowd \nout all other spending and all tax relief, but also so rapidly as to \nthreaten their own very existence.\n  What the Senator from New Mexico would prefer, what this Senator \nwould prefer, would be an engagement, a budget resolution reflecting a \nstrong bipartisan consensus in this body and the strong enthusiastic \nsupport and recommendations of the President of the United States \nhimself that will require us to deal with entitlements. It will require \nus to look into the accuracy, or lack of accuracy, in the Consumer \nPrice Index, because it is only if we have a more equitably distributed \nbudget that we can provide for tax relief and for necessary \ndiscretionary spending programs. Only then we can have a conversation \nwith the President and between the two parties on exactly what tax \nrelief should be granted to the American people and where additional \ndiscretionary funds may be spent.\n\n  As I began these remarks, there was on the floor the distinguished \nSenator from Rhode Island, Mr. Chafee, and there is now my friend from \nNorth Dakota, Senator Conrad. Each of them was a leader, one a \nRepublican and one a Democrat, in a bipartisan budget proposal which \nwas presented to this body almost a year ago on this floor. It \ncourageously dealt with each one of these issues, dealt with them in a \nbalanced fashion and dealt with them in a way that decisively would \nhave brought the budget into balance by the year 2002.\n  One of the curious elements of that budget, I may say, Mr. President, \nand I am sure my friend from North Dakota agrees with me, was that we \nhear today numerous favorable comments about it from those who did not \nvote for it. In fact, if we could try it again and put ourselves back \ninto April of last year, it looks like it might have gotten 70 votes \nrather than 46.\n  In any event, that time is past, that time is lost and because we \nlost it, the challenges we face are even more difficult today. But I \nknow that my friend from New Mexico, who has now returned to the floor, \nmeans the introduction of these two alternatives to be a trigger toward \nan agreement with the President and with many members of the Democratic \nParty on a budget that will realistically reach balance by the year \n2002 which will give needed tax relief to the American people, tax \nrelief that they deserve, that will allow us sufficient money for the \nimportant discretionary programs of this Government, whether they are \nthe building of an infrastructure or for education or for environmental \npurposes, and that will not only reform entitlement programs so that \nthese other goals can be\n\n[[Page S2718]]\n\nreached, but will reform them so that they are themselves secure and \nfinancially sound for the future, and so that what we do reflects the \nreal world and not an artificial set of statistics.\n  So I came to the floor this evening, Mr. President, to thank the \nSenator from New Mexico for his thoughtfulness and his tremendous \namount of work for the two resolutions that he has submitted, and to \nsimply try to emphasize that with him I hope not that either of these \nproposals passes and becomes a guideline for the U.S. Senate and for \nthe Congress, but that they help us reach a goal that is not a \nRepublican goal, not a Democratic goal, but a goal for all Americans.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator would.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First, let me note the presence of Senator Conrad on \nthe floor.\n  Might I just say, I do not think you heard any of my remarks since I \nreturned from a couple of hours at the White House yesterday. And I \nhave not had a chance to speak with the distinguished Senator. But we \nare busy, as of today, working on trying to reach our differences. \nThere will be a lot of work the next 2 weeks. We are very hopeful 1 \nweek after we return, with that week being spent by some of us getting \ndown to the final stages of negotiations, that we will have something \nvery constructive.\n  It is hard to say where it will all end up, but I can say the \nPresident approached it with a degree of not only earnestness, but a \nsense that we ought to go ahead and move and we ought to resolve some \ndifferences and get going. And I have expressed that here today, \nindicating that as these two budgets are only there in the event we \ncannot get a budget out of the Budget Committee, then we have to get \nsomething to work off of, and this is a rather normal way to do it: Put \na budget resolution in. Then the leader can call it up if we were to \nfail, and we have something to work on.\n  I simply think everybody knows there are a lot of possibilities of \nworking a budget together this year because there are many Republicans \nand Democrats who are looking seriously at ways to put something \ntogether that does do some difficult things, that is not just a \nskirting over the difficulties, and is saying, let us do some things \nthat have real long-term impact and as you, I say to the Senator, have \nso eloquently said, something we can all be proud of that really does \nthe job.\n  That is my goal. I will try as best I can in the next few weeks. And, \nagain, subject to the frailties of partisanship and things that can \nhappen that you know nothing about, I said I thought there was a \nprobability we could reach an agreement with the President, bipartisan, \nthat many Senators would like.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2711-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 18--RELATIVE TO BELARUS\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself and Mr. D'Amato) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 18\n\n       Whereas the seedlings of an independent and democratic \n     Belarus, for which generations of Belarusan patriots have \n     fought and died, are in danger of being swept away as a \n     result of the policies of Belarusan President Alaksandr \n     Lukashenka and the efforts of Russian nationalist leaders to \n     recreate the Soviet empire;\n       Whereas March 25th is the date that Belarusans throughout \n     the world salute the sacrifices and bravery of the members of \n     the Council of the Belarusan Democratic Republic, who in 1918 \n     liberated their country from czarist rule;\n       Whereas the Russian Duma in March 1996 voted to declare \n     void the 1991 agreement dissolving the Soviet Union;\n       Whereas the referendum adopted in November of 1996 expanded \n     President Lukashenka's already considerable powers in \n     violation of the Constitution of Belarus and basic democratic \n     principles;\n       Whereas on January 16, 1996, the Chairman-in-Office of the \n     Organization for the Security and Cooperation of Europe urged \n     the Government of Belarus ``to enter into dialogue with the \n     opposition and to ensure freedom of media and not restrict \n     access to the media for members of the opposition'';\n       Whereas on March 14, 1997, the United States Department of \n     State issued a statement that calls on President Lukashenka's \n     Government to exercise restraint and to observe the \n     international human rights agreements to which it is a party; \n     and\n       Whereas the Government of President Lukashenka has \n     monopolized the mass media, undermined the constitutional \n     foundation for the separation of powers, suppressed the \n     freedom of the press, undermined efforts to restore the \n     Belarusan language, and undercut the ground for all-Belarusan \n     unity: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that the \n     President should urge President Lukashenka and the Government \n     of Belarus to--\n       (1) abide by the provisions of--\n       (A) the Helsinki Final Act; and\n       (B) other agreements of the Organization for the Security \n     and Cooperation of Europe;\n       (2) guarantee human rights and fundamental freedoms, \n     including freedom of the press, assembly, and expression; and\n       (3) guarantee separation of powers.\n\n     SEC. 2. SUPPORT OF INDEPENDENCE.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to support the people \n     of Belarus in--\n       (1) maintaining independent statehood;\n       (2) promoting the rule of law, human rights, and \n     fundamental freedoms; and\n       (3) assuring that Belarus has the opportunity to survive as \n     an equal and full-fledged member-state among the sovereign \n     nations of the world.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am submitting a concurrent \nresolution regarding Belarus. I am pleased that Senator D'Amato is an \noriginal cosponsor of this concurrent resolution. Representative \nPallone has submitted a similar measure in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I am deeply concerned about events in Belarus and the effort by \nPresident Lukashenka to expand his already considerable powers at the \nexpense of basic democratic principles. I am deeply concerned by his \nproposal to unify Russia and Belarus. And, as the cochairman of the \nHelsinki Commission, I am dismayed by President Lukashenka's failure to \nabide by the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act and other OSCE \nagreements which guarantee respect for human rights and fundamental \nfreedoms.\n  The resolution recognizes March 25, 1997, as the anniversary of the \nproclamation of Belarusan independence. It calls on President \nLukashenka and the Government to abide by the provisions of the \nHelsinki Final Act and other agreements of the Organization for the \nSecurity and Cooperation of Europe; to guarantee human rights and \nfundamental freedoms, including freedom of the press, assembly, and \nexpression; and to guarantee separation of powers. The resolution \nstates that it is the policy of the United States to support the people \nof Belarus in achieving independent statehood, promoting the rule of \nlaw, human rights, and fundamental freedoms, and assuring that Belarus \nhas the opportunity to survive as an equal and full-fledged member-\nstate among sovereign nations of the world.\n  As we approach the anniversary of Belarus' 1918 declaration of \nindependence, we are reminded that Belarus is a nation with a proud \nhistory and traditions. It is appropriate that we remember the brave \nstruggle of Belarusan patriots in 1918. At the same time, we must \nrecognize that the struggle for national sovereignty and democratic \nfreedoms continues today and is greatly threatened by the actions of \nthe Lukashenka regime.\n  I urge my colleagues to approve this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2718-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2718-S2719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 66--COMMENDING THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA FOOTBALL \n                                  TEAM\n\n  Mr. MACK (for himself and Mr. Graham) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Res. 68\n\n       Whereas the United States has fought in many wars;\n       Whereas thousands of members of the Armed Forces of the \n     United States who served in such wars were captured by the \n     enemy and held as prisoners of war;\n       Whereas many prisoners of war were subjected to brutal and \n     inhumane treatment by their captors in violation of \n     international codes and customs for the treatment of \n     prisoners of war and died, or were disabled, as a result of \n     the treatment; and\n       Whereas the great sacrifices of the prisoners of war and \n     their families deserve national recognition: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 9, 1997, and April 9, 1998, as \n     ``National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day'' in honor \n     of the members of the Armed Forces of the United States who \n     have been held as prisoners of war; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States to commemorate \n     this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit a resolution which \nwould recognize the service and dedication of America's former \nprisoners of war [POW's]. The resolution would designate April 9, 1997, \nand April 9, 1998, as National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day. \nApril 9 is the anniversary of the fall of Bataan in 1942. On that day \nmore Americans became POW's than any other day in our history.\n  Every American who wears the uniform of our country makes a unique \ncommitment of service and duty to our country and to our fellow \ncitizens. Perhaps no American veterans have been called upon to honor \ntheir commitment to our country under circumstances more difficult than \nthose endured by our former POW's. For many, their experience was one \nof malnutrition, torture, and nonexistent medical care, combined with \nthe burden of watching comrades die under terrible conditions.\n  Even under the best possible conditions, the POW experience places \nAmerican service members in the position of being dependent upon our \nNation's enemies for every scrap of food, every bandage, every human \nneed. In such circumstances, the reward for treason, or even \ncooperation, is high. The penalty for resistance and loyalty is \nimmediate, frequently painful and sometimes fatal. This resolution \nrecognizes the sacrifice and loyalty of the POW's who maintained their \ncommitment of service to our country. In so doing, it helps fulfill the \nduty we have to former POW's, derived from their faithful discharge of \nduty to our nation.\n  Mr. President, this resolution commemorates the service of former \nPOW's who sustained their commitment to our country under circumstances \nthat few of us can imagine, and none would willingly endure. I ask this \nbody to honor the memory of those who have already died and express our \ngratitude to those still alive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2719-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S2720]]\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 MEXICO CERTIFICATION JOINT RESOLUTION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                COVERDELL (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 25\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL (Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Helms, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. McCain, \nMr. Domenici, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Dodd, Ms. Moseley-Braun, and Ms. Landrieu) \nproposed an amendment to the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 58) \ndisapproving the certification of the President under section 490(b) of \nthe Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 regarding foreign assistance for \nMexico during fiscal year 1997; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the resolving clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. REPORT REQUIREMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The abuse of illicit drugs in the United States results \n     in 14,000 deaths per year, has inordinate social consequences \n     for the United States, and exacts economic costs in excess of \n     $67,000,000,000 per year to the American people.\n       (2) An estimated 12,800,000 Americans, representing all \n     ethnic and socioeconomic groups, use illegal drugs, including \n     1,500,000 users of cocaine. Further, 10.9 percent of \n     Americans between 12 and 17 years of age use illegal drugs, \n     and one in American four children claim to have been offered \n     illegal drugs in the past year. Americans spend approximately \n     $49,000,000,000 per year on illegal drugs.\n       (3) There is a need to continue and intensify anti-drug \n     education efforts in the United States, particularly \n     education directed at the young.\n       (4) Significant quantities of heroin, methamphetamines, and \n     marijuana used in the United States are produced in Mexico, \n     and a major portion of the cocaine used in the United States \n     is imported into the United States through Mexico.\n       (5) These drugs are moved illegally across the border \n     between Mexico and the United States by major criminal \n     organizations, which operate on both sides of that border and \n     maintain the illegal flow of drugs into Mexico and the United \n     States.\n       (6) There is evidence of significant corruption affecting \n     institutions of the Government of Mexico (including the \n     police and military), including the arrest in February 1997 \n     of General Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, the head of the drug law \n     enforcement agency of Mexico, for accepting bribes from \n     senior leaders of the Mexican drug cartels. In 1996, the \n     Attorney General of Mexico dismissed more than 1,200 Mexico \n     federal law enforcement officers in an effort to eliminate \n     corruption, although some were rehired and none has been \n     successfully prosecuted for corruption. In the United States, \n     some law enforcement officials may also be affected by \n     corruption.\n       (7) The success of efforts to control illicit drug \n     trafficking depends on improved coordination and cooperation \n     between Mexico and United States drug law enforcement \n     agencies and other institutions responsible for activities \n     against illicit production, traffic and abuse of drugs, \n     particularly in the common border region.\n       (8) The Government of Mexico recognizes that it must \n     further develop the institutional financial regulatory and \n     enforcement capabilities necessary to prevent money \n     laundering in the banking and financial sectors of Mexico and \n     has sought United States assistance in these areas.\n       (9) The Government of Mexico has recently approved, but has \n     yet to implement fully, new and more effective legislation \n     against organized crime and money laundering.\n       (10) The Government of the United States and the Government \n     of Mexico are engaged in bilateral consideration of the \n     problems of illicit drug production, trafficking, and abuse \n     through the High Level Contact Group on Drug Control \n     established in 1996.\n       (11) The President of Mexico has declared that drug \n     trafficking is the number one threat to the national security \n     of Mexico.\n       (12) In December 1996, the Government of the United States \n     and the Government of Mexico joined with the governments of \n     other countries in the Western Hemisphere to seek to \n     eliminate all production, trafficking, and abuse of drugs and \n     to prevent money laundering.\n       (13) Section 101 of division C of the Omnibus Consolidated \n     Appropriations Act, 1997 (Public Law 104-208) requires the \n     Attorney General to increase the number of positions for \n     full-time, active-duty patrol agents within the Immigration \n     and Naturalization Service by 1,000 per year through the year \n     2001.\n       (14) The proposed budget of the President for fiscal year \n     1998 includes a request for 500 such agents.\n       (15) Drug cartels continue to operate with impunity in \n     Mexico, and effective action needs to be taken against \n     Mexican drug trafficking organizations, particularly the \n     Juarez and Tijuana cartels.\n       (16) While Mexico has begun to extradite its citizens for \n     the first time and has cooperated by expelling or deporting \n     major international drug criminals, United States requests \n     for extradition of Mexican nationals indicted in United \n     States courts on drug-related charges have not been granted \n     by the Government of Mexico.\n       (17) Cocaine seizures and arrests of drug traffickers in \n     Mexico have dropped since 1992.\n       (18) United States law enforcement agents operating in \n     Mexico along the United States border with Mexico must be \n     allowed adequate protection.\n       (b) Sense of Congress on Cooperation on Drugs by Countries \n     in the Western Hemisphere.--It is the sense of Congress to \n     urge the President, in his official visits in the Western \n     Hemisphere, to examine with leaders of governments of other \n     countries in the Western Hemisphere the effectiveness of \n     efforts to improve counterdrug activities in order to curtail \n     the production, traffic, and abuse of illicit drugs, and to \n     define plans for specific actions to improve cooperation on \n     such activities, including consideration of a coordinated \n     multilateral alliance.\n       (c) Sense of Congress of Progress in Halting Production and \n     Traffic of Drugs in Mexico.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     there has been ineffective and insufficient progress in \n     halting the production in and transit through Mexico of \n     illegal drugs.\n       (d) Report to Congress.--Not later than September 1, 1997, \n     the President shall submit to Congress a report describing \n     the following:\n       (1) The extent of any significant and demonstrable progress \n     made by the Government of the United States and the \n     Government of Mexico, respectively, during the period \n     beginning on March 1, 1997, and ending on the date of the \n     report in achieving the following objectives relating to \n     counterdrug cooperation:\n       (A) The investigation and dismantlement of the principal \n     organizations responsible for drug trafficking and related \n     crimes in both Mexico and the United States, including the \n     prevention and elimination of their activities, the \n     prosecution or extradition and incarceration of their \n     leaders, and the seizure of their assets.\n       (B) The development and strengthening of permanent working \n     relationships between the United States and Mexico law \n     enforcement agencies, with particular reference to law \n     enforcement directed against drug trafficking and related \n     crimes, including full funding and deployment of the \n     Binational Border Task Forces as agreed upon by both \n     governments.\n       (C) The strengthening of bilateral border enforcement, \n     including more effective screening for and seizure of \n     contraband.\n       (D) The denial of safe havens to persons and organizations \n     responsible for drug trafficking and related crimes and the \n     improvement of cooperation on extradition matters between \n     both countries.\n       (E) The simplification of evidentiary requirements for \n     narcotics crimes and related crimes and for violence against \n     law enforcement officers.\n       (F) The full implementation of effective laws and \n     regulations for banks and other financial institutions to \n     combat money laundering, including the enforcement of \n     penalties for non-compliance by such institutions, and the \n     prosecution of money launderers and seizure of their assets.\n       (G) The eradication of crops destined for illicit drug use \n     in Mexico and in the United States in order to minimize and \n     eventually eliminate the production of such crops.\n       (H) The establishment and implementation of a comprehensive \n     screening process to assess the suitability and financial and \n     criminal background of all law enforcement and other \n     officials involved in the fight against organized crime, \n     including narcotics trafficking.\n       (I) The rendering of support to Mexico in its efforts to \n     identify, remove, and prosecute corrupt officials at all \n     levels of government, including law enforcement and military \n     officials.\n       (J) The augmentation and strengthening of bilateral \n     cooperation.\n       (2) The extent of any significant and demonstrable progress \n     made by the Government of the United States during the period \n     beginning on March 1, 1997, and ending on the date of the \n     report in--\n       (A) implementing a comprehensive anti-drug education effort \n     in the United States targeted at reversing the rise in drug \n     use by America's youth;\n       (B) implementing a comprehensive international drug \n     interdiction and enforcement strategy; and\n       (C) deploying 1,000 additional active-duty, full-time \n     patrol agents within the Immigration and Naturalization \n     Service in fiscal year 1997 as required by section 101 of \n     division C of the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, \n     1997 (Public Law 104-208).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, on April 9, 1997, an important \nmilestone will be reached when the Lockheed Martin Corp. rolls out the \nF-22 in Marietta, GA. The F-22 is a powerful new aircraft that will \nensure complete and total air dominance for the United States in the \n21st century.\n  How do you measure success in air superiority. The best measure I \nknow is reflected in the fact that no U.S. soldier has been killed by \nan enemy aircraft in over 40 years. And that is why the F-22 is \ncritical at this time, for the F-22 ensures that impressive record of \nprotecting our forces continues unbroken.\n  There are some who fail to understand that the threat to our air \nforces is growing and that the world remains dangerous despite the end \nof the cold war. Throughout the world today there are a host of \nRussian-made surface-to-air missiles readily available on the open \nmarket to any nation with the money available to buy them. At the same \ntime, a new generation of tactical fighter is also being produced in \nRussia and elsewhere which can out perform and defeat our current air \nsuperiority fighter, the F-15C. All of these pose significant threats \nto our ability to maintain air superiority.\n  The F-22 will ensure that America maintains not just air superiority \nbut air dominance. And as the former Secretary of Defense William Perry \nonce said ``everything else we do depends on air dominance.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to note that the rollout on April 9 will \nmark the beginning of a new era for Air Force aviation. As a Texan, I \nam also proud of the role America's premier tactical fighter complex in \nFort Worth, TX played in building this revolutionary aircraft.\n  I hope my colleagues will take notice of the rollout in a year which \nmarks the 50th anniversary of our Air Force. I also hope my colleagues \nwill take this opportunity to reflect on the importance of our Air \nForce and the role they have played since their founding 50 years ago \nin maintaining peace and stability in a dangerous world.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe Greek people on the 176th anniversary of the beginning of their \nstruggle for independence. Since regaining their freedom and \nreaffirming their commitment to democratic principles, the Greek people \nhave built a modern-day republic that is a strong and positive presence \nin the Balkans and eastern Mediterranean.\n\n[[Page S2722]]\n\n  As the only member of the European Union from the region, Greece has \nplayed a stabilizing role in the area and helped advance its neighbors' \nprogress toward political and economic security. Greece's own efforts \nto continue the modernization of its economy and its steadfast defense \nof democratic governance are critical to the promotion of democracy and \nstability in neighboring lands.\n  On March 25, Greece will commemorate the beginning of its quest for \nindependence from four centuries of Ottoman rule. After nearly 10 years \nof struggle against tremendous odds, the Greek people secured liberty \nfor their homeland and reaffirmed the individual freedoms that are at \nthe heart of their tradition.\n  From the beginning of their revolution, the Greeks had the support--\nboth material and emotional--from a people who had only recently gained \nfreedom for themselves; the Americans. And since then, our two nations \nhave remained firmly united by shared beliefs in democratic principles \nand mutual understanding of the sacrifices entailed in establishing a \nrepublic.\n  As a nation whose founders were ardent students of the classics, \nAmerica has drawn its political convictions from the ancient Greek \nideals of liberty and citizenship. And just as we looked to the Greeks \nfor inspiration, Greek patriots looked to the American Revolution for \nstrength in the face of their own adversity.\n  Since their liberation, the Greek people have never taken their \nliberty for granted. In both World Wars, Greece never wavered from its \ncommitment to the United States and the other allied nations to resist \nthe forces of totalitarianism. Faced with a Communist uprising after \nWorld War II, Greece received support from President Truman and the \nAmerican people, who helped the Greeks rebuild their war-ravaged \nnation.\n  Along with our shared values and traditions, Greece and America share \na bond by virtue of those individuals who have remained devoted to the \nideals of both countries. The Greek-American community, which maintains \nan especially close relationship with Greece, also consistently makes \nsignificant contributions to American culture, business, and history. \nTruly, it is a community that enriches our life at home while \nstrengthening our ties abroad.\n  At this time last year, First Lady Hillary Clinton was in Greece. Her \nvisit was followed by a meeting here in Washington between Greek Prime \nMinister Kostandinos Simitis and President Clinton, which laid the \nfoundation for even stronger Greek-American relations in the future, \nand the broadening of existing ties into new arenas.\n  This year, I was proud to cosponsor Senate Resolution 56, designating \nMarch 25, 1997, as ``Greek Independence Day: A National Day of \nCelebration of Greek and American Democracy,'' and I was gratified to \nsee it approved by the Senate last week. Emotionally and \nphilosophically, Greece has remained near the hearts and minds of \nAmericans since this Nation was founded.\n  President James Monroe aptly summarized these feelings in 1822, \nobserving: ``The mention of Greece fills the mind with the most exalted \nsentiments and arouses in our bosom the best feelings of which our \nnature is susceptible.'' Mr. President, more than inspiration, Greece \ntoday has a very important and tangible role to play in the democratic \nprogress of its own region. I have no doubt that Greece is up to the \ntask.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2721-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FIRST NUTRITION \n                 PROGRAM UNDER THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, on Saturday, March 22, our Nation \nwill commemorate the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the \nnational nutrition programs for the elderly under the Older Americans \nAct. Since their inception, these programs have benefited thousands of \nour Nation's elderly by providing home-delivered and collective meals \nto those elderly facing serious challenges and limitations, including \neconomic hardship, physical and health limitations, and rural \nisolation.\n  The elderly's ability to obtain meals under the Older Americans Act \nwas originally limited to meal sites, where groups of elderly can \ncongregate for a meal during the day. Following several successful \nyears of service, nutrition programs expanded to serve the home-bound \nelderly. Also, the parameters of the Older Americans Act were extended \nto allow Area Agencies on Aging to inform the elderly on how to obtain \nnutrition education, counseling, and screening. Nutritional services \nhave proven to be critical for a significant population of the elderly \nwho can continue to maintain a healthy, independent lifestyle.\n  Through this program, Vermont's five Area Agencies on Aging contract \nwith various local nutrition service providers to expedite the delivery \nof meals to people's homes and continue to coordinate meals provided in \ncongregate settings. Federal grants provided for our country's \nnutrition programs fill resource gaps where non-profit and State \norganizations cannot.\n  Twenty-five years following the first meal served in the early \n1970's, 242 million meals have been provided to 3.5 million of our \nNation's elderly. Since taking office in the House of Representatives \nin 1975, I am proud to have been a steadfast supporter of these \nnutrition programs. They are a wonderful example of the Federal \nGovernment's successful contribution to improving the lives of our \nNation's senior citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2722-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2722-S2723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COST OF UNITED STATES INVOLVEMENT IN BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nescalating costs of the United States involvement in Bosnia.\n  Recently, I asked the administration representatives for a ballpark \nestimate of the expected cost to the United States taxpayer of the \nAmerican operation in Bosnia.\n  I was astonished to hear that administration estimates have been \nrevised to $6.5 billion.\n  Six-point-five billion dollars. To put that in perspective, we were \noriginally told that the Bosnia mission would cost the United States \ntaxpayer some $2 billion. Later, the estimate was revised to $3 \nbillion. Now, it has risen to a staggering $6.5 billion.\n  Mr. President, the cost has now risen more than threefold since the \noriginal estimates we were given. That is equal to just over half of \nthe entire foreign operation budget for fiscal 1997 which is about \n$12.2 billion.\n  Let me review what has happened here. In late 1995, when the \nadministration negotiated the United States troop commitment outlined \nby the Dayton accords, the administration came to the Congress with an \nestimate for United States troop participation in the NATO Peace \nImplementation Force in Bosnia, commonly referred to as IFOR. According \nto information provided to my office by the Office of the Secretary of \nDefense [OSD], this initial estimate of $2 billion was generated using \na force deployment model based on experience in Desert Storm and \nSomalia * * * [although] the types of forces, deployment schedules, \nfield conditions, and security situation had not been determined.'' \nOnce troops were deployed to Bosnia, new information about the field \nconditions became available and pushed the original estimate up by \nabout 50 percent.\n  As I understand it, unexpected and adverse weather conditions, \nincluding major floods, further complicated the operation--delaying the \nestablishment of land routes and altering placement of planned camp \nsites. According to the Defense Department, additional reserves were \nalso required to back fill for troops that had been deployed to the \nregion.\n  Further refinements of the cost estimate were again made in July \n1996, when the Defense Department recognized the need for additional \nmoneys--to the tune of almost $310 million--for pulling out heavy \narmored forces and replacing them with military police, as well as \nadditional communications requirements. A new total cost estimate of \n$3.2 million for operations through the end of 1996--that is, for \napproximately one full year--was provided to congressional staff in \nJuly.\n  The conditions that led to these refinements also helped throw the \ntime line for the 1-year mission out of whack. So, no one could have \nreally been surprised by the announcement\n\n[[Page S2723]]\n\nlast October--just as the Congress was preparing to take its long \nrecess--that the United States had decided to dispatch additional \ntroops to Bosnia. The new deployment of an additional 5,000 troops was \nto be part of a new mission--the one we now call SFOR, or NATO \nstabilization force--and would last 18 months, through June 1998.\n  The extension of the U.S. mission in the region, of course, required \na new cost estimate. Using actual costs to date, projected force levels \nfor fiscal year 1997 and for fiscal year 1998, and expected operating \ncosts, the Defense Department now says that total costs for the \noperation are expected to be $6,512,000,000.\n  Mr. President, when Congress was first consulted about the Bosnia \noperation back in 1995, I asked whether or not the United States would \nbe able to withdraw troops from IFOR in December 1996, as the \nadministration said then, even if the mission clearly had not been \nsuccessful. I had my doubts then that the stated goal--ending the \nfighting and raising an infrastructure capable of supporting a durable \npeace--would be achievable in 12 months' time. I foresaw a danger that \nconditions would remain so unsettled that it would then be argued that \nit would be folly--and waste--to withdraw on schedule.\n  My concerns and hesitations of October 1995 were only compounded by \nthe October 1996 announcement that additional troops were being \ndeployed to Bosnia, and compounded further in November 1996 when it \nbecame clear that the mission was being extended for an additional 18 \nmonths.\n  In my view, the handwriting has been on the wall for some time now.\n  As many in this Chamber will recall, I was one of the few Members of \nCongress, and the only Democrat, to vote against the initial deployment \nof troops in 1995. At that time, I questioned the projections regarding \nthe duration and cost of the mission.\n  What I feared then has happened. The United States continues to be \ndrawn deeper into a situation from which we appear unable to extricate \nourselves. The war in Vietnam was called a quagmire. We referred to \ncontinued United States troop deployment in Somalia as mission creep. I \nfear that the Bosnia operation presents the same dilemma. There will \ncontinue to reasons to encourage continued U.S. military presence on \nthe ground. Despite an original estimate of $2 billion, that presence \nis now moving closer and closer to $7 billion.\n  I recognize that the Bosnia mission has not been without some \npositive results. We can all be grateful that people are no longer \ndying en masse in Bosnia and that United States and troops from other \nnations are to be applauded for having largely succeeded in enforcing \nthe military aspects of the Dayton accords. But successive delays in \nholding municipal elections and the lasting, and at-large, presence of \nindicted war criminals are continuing signs that the progress of \nAmerican troop presence is transitory at best.\n  At the heart of the conflict is that the strategic political goals of \nthe warring factions remain unchanged. Peace in the region appears to \nbe achievable, unfortunately, only at the point of NATO arms.\n  Mr. President, I now fear that, come next June, when the SFOR mission \nis expected to end, and after we will have invested $6.5 billion, there \nis a real danger that we will be back at square one.\n  I hope that the lesson learned from Bosnia is that we should not make \ncommitments of United States resources, be they military, humanitarian, \nor otherwise, without a candid assessment of the likely level and \nduration of the commitment. While it is clear that there were sound, \nmilitary reasons for upping the financial projections for U.S. \nparticipation in both IFOR and SFOR, I can not believe that the \noriginal estimate was as candid of an assessment as we could have had, \neven that early in the process.\n  We are told that U.S. troops will finish their mission next June. But \nthat begs a question: What certainty is there that even this promise \nwill be kept? I fear, as I did when the United States first committed \n20,000 ground troops, that there is no easy way out of this situation. \nThe cost of U.S. involvement continues to rise. And troops, from my \nState and from throughout the Nation, continue to be deployed.\n  When will it end, Mr. President. When will it end?\n  At the very time we are straining hard to eliminate the Federal \ndeficit, the dollars continue to pour out of our Treasury. The cost of \nthis excursion goes on and on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2722-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         HATTIE H.

RICHEY\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I respectfully rise today and ask \nthat we pay tribute to Judge Charles R. Richey.\n  Today the flags in front of the Thurgood Marshall Judiciary Building \nfly at half-mast in mourning for Judge Richey. Charles Richey was a \ngreat man and a superlative judge. We join in the loss with his wife, \nMardelle, and his sons, Charles and William.\n  Judge Richey, despite his lofty status in the courts, always \nconsidered himself a man of the people and he consistently defied the \nlabels of conservative and liberal. His public career began when he \ncame to Washington as a legislative counsel to Representative Frances \nPayne Bolton from Ohio. Later he was appointed general counsel for the \nMaryland Public Service Commission during Spiro Agnew's last years as \nGovernor. He was appointed to the Federal bench by President Nixon in \n1971.\n  In 1979, the American Trial Lawyers Association voted Judge Richey \nOutstanding Federal Trial Judge. He was one of the busiest judges in \nthe Washington U.S. District Court and ran a tight ship in the \ncourtroom. He was a firm believer in swift justice and had the most up-\nto-date docket on the circuit.\n  Over the course of his career, Richey handed down many landmark \ndecisions, including one he loved to recount--his 1976 ruling that \ncalled in the California tuna ships for violation of the Marine Mammal \nProtection Act. In that same year he also became the first judge to \nhold that employees who are sexually harassed by their superiors can \nfile under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n  Ever willing to take on the Government on behalf of the little man, \nin 1981, Richey awarded $6 million in back pay and $10 million in \nfuture earnings for 324 women in the sex discrimination suit against \nthe Government Printing Office, then the largest amount ever\n\n[[Page S2724]]\n\nawarded in a sex discrimination case. Perhaps the case most indicative \nof his feeling for the citizens though was his dismissal of charges \nagainst people camped in protest in Lafayette ``Protest'' Park. He said \nthey were exercising their rights under the First Amendment.\n  Judge Richey's courtesy in the court was legendary. He used gender-\nneutral terms when discussing certain statutes mentioning only men. \nDespite his own strict Methodist upbringing, he gave witnesses options \non oaths containing no religious references and dispensing with the \nGideon Bible. One said of him, ``Judge Richey is tough as shoe leather, \nbut fair minded almost to a fault.''\n  We shall all miss this man. He leaves behind an unparalled judicial \nlegacy and record of public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2723-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, the American people are fed up with the IRS \nand its tactics. They are calling for change. Today I have taken a \nfirst step to help. I am joining as a cosponsor of S. 365, the Internal \nRevenue Service Accountability Act, which was introduced by my \ndistinguished colleague from Georgia, Senator Coverdell.\n  The IRS is in disarray from its top management all the way down to \nits field offices, and American taxpayers are paying the price for that \ndisarray--a price in inefficiency, in inconvenience, in intrusiveness, \nand even in harassment. It is not fair for American taxpayers to fund \nan agency that is wasting their money and time. It is time to clean up \nthe IRS. It is time for a change.\n  The IRS Accountability Act puts a tight rein on the IRS and its \nagents. It makes IRS agents personally accountable for their actions \nand subjects them to criminal prosecution if they abuse their authority \nby harassing taxpayers. The bill makes it a crime to release \ninformation from tax returns without proper authority. It restricts the \nability of the IRS to conduct audits. It ensures that the IRS will \nabide by court decisions against it. And it ensures that taxpayers have \na chance to correct any honest mistakes on their tax forms without \nincurring a penalty.\n  American taxpayers are honest, hard workers. They do not deserve an \noverzealous agency with its agents tormenting and harassing them. It is \ntime to make the IRS more accountable for its actions.\n  This bill is an important first step toward protecting Americans from \na Tax Code that is unfair, restrictive, punitive, and complicated. We \nneed to do more. We need to completely overhaul our Tax Code to make it \nflatter, fairer, and simpler. We need to look at all options as we \ntackle this issue, but we must make sure that a new Tax Code eases the \nburden for families and businesses and encourages, rather than \ninhibits, growth, investment, and savings. That should be our top \npriority.\n  That is our task for the coming months and years. But until we can \nsuccessfully meet that greater challenge, the very least we can do for \nthe American taxpayer is to get the IRS cleaned up and off the \ntaxpayers' backs.\n  The time has come for tax relief. The people of the United States \nhave had enough. They want less government, less regulation, and less \ntaxes. And they want less hassle and harassment from their Government. \nThe IRS Accountability Act is a good start. As we approach tax day, \nApril 15, it is only appropriate that we take a bold step toward fixing \nthe IRS.\n  The time for change is now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2724-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF CENTRALIA, IL, MINING DISASTER\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to memorialize 111 miners \nfrom the town of Centralia, IL, who died nearly 50 years ago on March \n25, 1947, in one of the worst coal mining disasters in U.S. history.\n  On that day, 142 men were working in mine No. 5 of the Centralia Coal \nCo. Only a few minutes remained before the end of their shift when \nthere was an explosion in the mine. The blast raced through the tunnels \nbeneath the town of Wamac on the southern edge of Centralia, leaving \ndebris and poisonous fumes in its wake.\n  Thirty-one men managed to escape, but 111 of their coworkers were \ntrapped 540 feet underground. For 4 days, rescuers worked to save them, \nbut they could not reach the miners in time. In a tragic discovery, the \nsearchers found notes next to some of the miners' bodies that they had \nwritten on scraps of paper and cardboard as they lay dying. ``Tell Dad \nto quit the mine and take care of Mom,'' wrote one miner. ``Tell baby \nand my loving boys good-bye and I am feeling weak. Lots of love.'' \nTogether, the men left behind 99 widows and 76 children under the age \nof 18.\n  But the real tragedy for Centralia was that the disaster could have \nbeen prevented. As early as 1942--and continuing right up to the time \nof the explosion--State and Federal inspectors warned about dangerous \nconditions at the mine. In fact, when the blast occurred, the latest \nState and Federal reports were thumbtacked to a bulletin board outside \nthe mine's wash house.\n  While the inspectors found numerous safety violations, they were \nparticularly concerned about the combustible coal dust which was so \nthick that it would collect in the miners' shoes as they worked. The \nminers themselves knew how dangerous the dust could be, and more than a \nyear before the disaster, four of them sent a letter to Illinois Gov. \nDwight H. Green warning that it might explode one day. ``This is a plea \nto you,'' they wrote, ``to please save our lives, to please make the \nDepartment of Mines and Minerals enforce the laws at the No. 5 mine, \nbefore we have a dust explosion.''\n  But neither the governor nor Federal officials nor the Centralia Coal \nCo. took any significant action. Investigators later determined that \none of the main causes of the explosion was the dust the miners had \nfeared.\n  Three days after the disaster, Governor Green ordered State \ninspectors to close all unsafe coal mines. In Washington, Congress held \nhearings and launched an investigation. But for Centralia, IL, it was \ntoo late.\n  As we near the 50th anniversary of this disaster, our thoughts are \nwith the people of Centralia and the families of those who lost their \nlives. We are reminded that too often, we react to disasters rather \nthan taking steps to prevent them.\n  The greatest tribute we can give to the Centralia mine explosion \nvictims is to ensure that critical worker safety and health protections \nare not weakened or destroyed. We must be vigilant in our efforts to \nmake sure workers don't risk their lives simply by going to \nwork.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2724-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      JUNETEENTH INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pledge my support \nfor the commemoration of June 19 as ``Juneteenth Independence Day.'' \nThis day marks a significant occurrence in American history, a day \nevery American should reflect upon and remember.\n  Mr. President, June 19 is a day when all African-Americans were \nfinally liberated from the bondage of slaveowners. Although President \nLincoln signed the revolutionary Emancipation Proclamation on January \n1, 1865, many slaves were still denied their lawful freedom. It was not \nuntil June 19, 1865, that all slaveowners officially recognized and \nabided by the dictates of the Emancipation Proclamation.\n  For too many years, African-Americans were denied basic rights and \nliberties that today all Americans enjoy. I stand here today, 132 years \nlater, to express my view that this shameful aspect of American history \nshould never be forgotten. For these reasons, I proudly endorse Senate \nResolution 11. This significant legislative endeavor reminds every \ncitizen of the unspeakable horrors to which many of our fellow \nAmericans were subjected. It is my hope that every June 19 from this \nyear forward will be celebrated as ``Juneteenth Independence Day.'' It \nalso is my hope that this day will serve as a reminder, of our past and \na bridge all of us can use to overcome our differences and unite as \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, I believe commemoration of ``Juneteenth Independence \nDay'' warrants support from all members of the U.S. Senate. As a \ncosponsor of Senate Resolution 11, I urge my colleagues to join me in \nofficially recognizing this important day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2724-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S2725]]\n\n\n\n              LET'S DEBATE THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to \nthose who have spoken about the need to bring the Chemical Weapons \nConvention [CWC] to the Senate floor for debate at the earliest \npossible date. As everyone in this body knows, the U.S. Senate must \nratify the CWC by April 29, 1997, in order for the United States to \nbecome an original party to the convention.\n  To date, 70 countries have ratified the CWC, and another 161 \ncountries are signatories. The United States has taken a leadership \nrole throughout the negotiations surrounding this treaty, and yet, with \ntime running out, the Senate has not voted on the document that so many \nAmericans have helped to craft.\n  Time is of the essence in this debate for several reasons. One reason \nis, of course, the April 29 deadline by which the U.S. Senate must \nratify this treaty so that the United States may be a full participant \nin the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW], the \ngoverning body that will have the responsibility for deciding the terms \nfor the implementation of the CWC.\n  A second reason is the constitutional responsibility of the Senate to \nprovide its advice and consent on all treaties signed by the President. \nThis treaty was signed by President Bush in January 1993, and was \nsubmitted to the Senate by President Clinton in November of that year. \nUnfortunately, the Senate has not yet fulfilled its responsibility with \nrespect to this treaty.\n  A third reason, and what I believe is one of the most important, is \nthe need for adequate time for debate of this treaty and its \nimplications for the United States prior to the April 29 deadline for \nratification. Many have expressed concern over various provisions in \nthe CWC. Senators should have the opportunity to debate these concerns, \nand the American people deserve the chance to hear them. Senators will \nalso have the opportunity to voice their concerns during debate of the \ntreaty's implementing legislation, which will most likely be discussed \nin conjunction with the treaty itself.\n  As a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I have had \nthe opportunity to participate in hearings on this issue. In all the \nhearings and deliberations over the efficacy of this treaty, two things \nhave been made crystal clear: First, the CWC is not perfect, and \nsecond, the CWC is the best avenue available for beginning down the \nroad to the eventual elimination of chemical weapons.\n  There are real flaws, as we all recognize, with the verifiability of \nthe CWC. There will be cheating and evasions and attempts to obey the \nletter but not the spirit of the treaty. But most of the responsible \nplayers on the international stage will recognize that through the CWC \nthe world has spoken, and firmly rejected chemical weapons.\n  The CWC was laboriously crafted over three decades to meet the \nsecurity and economic interests of states parties. The United States \nwas at the forefront of that effort; the treaty reflects U.S. needs and \nhas the blessing and enthusiastic support of our defense and business \ncommunities.\n  Can the treaty be improved? Of course. But the CWC has a provision \nfor amendment after it comes into force. I would hope that the United \nStates would be again at the head of efforts to make the treaty more \neffective after a period to test its utility. We have the technological \nmeans and economic weight to make it so. But only if we are a party to \nthe treaty. And to become a party to the treaty, the U.S. Senate must \nperform its constitutionally mandated function of debate and \nratification before April 29.\n  Mr. President, it is unfortunate that the Chemical Weapons Convention \nis being held hostage to other, unrelated, matters. Time is of the \nessence, Mr. President, and time is running out.\n  In closing, this treaty should be fully and carefully debated by the \nU.S. Senate at the earliest possible date, not at the 11 hour when the \nclock is ticking on our ability to ensure that the United States is an \nactive participant in future revisions to the CWC. The American people \ndeserve no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2725-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ``ANOTHER BAD ONE''\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy \nof the attached editorial from the Vermont newspaper The Time Argus, \ntitled ``Another Bad One,'' and dated March 19, 1997, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n                            Another Bad One\n\n       The arguments against amending the U.S. Constitution over \n     campaign financing are the same as the arguments against a \n     balanced budget amendment or a prohibition amendment. It is a \n     waste of effort to target specific evils by way of the \n     Constitution.\n       The U.S. Senate wisely rejected a campaign finance \n     amendment by a wide margin on Tuesday.\n       States which have encumbered their constitutions with \n     numerous amendments have found their documents have become \n     just that: encumbrances.\n       A constitutional amendment will not stop candidates from \n     getting money, and it will not stop people who want to \n     influence candidates from using their money to promote that \n     influence. You might as well have an amendment that said: \n     ``Candidates for public office shall not spend money in their \n     quest for the office.''\n       Then there would be a court case to argue whether a \n     candidate who filled his automobile gas tank while on the way \n     to a campaign forum had ``spent money in his quest'' for the \n     office.\n       A constitutional amendment against bank robbery would not \n     stop the number of bank robberies that occur. There is a law \n     against bank robbery, and in fact Congress finally got the \n     federal government into the investigations by making it \n     possible for the FBI to enter bank robbery cases immediately.\n       And something similar relating to campaign financing would \n     be the proper course of action, instead of an amendment to \n     the Constitution. A congressional statute putting greater \n     controls over campaigns would have the same effect as an \n     amendment without the permanent encumbrance of the amendment \n     on matters unforeseen.\n       In some cases the courts have ruled that specific laws \n     limiting contribution limits infringe on free speech. It \n     ought to be possible for a congressional statute to impose \n     some sort of constraint on money without interfering with \n     speech.\n       The huge sums spent on campaigns may very well be \n     considered immoral, but history has given ample illustrations \n     of the futility of trying to legislate morality. Prohibition \n     is a relatively recent example. Did it stop people from \n     consuming alcohol? No. In fact, it helped increase the power \n     of law-breaking organizations geared to providing illicit \n     substances, a baneful influence that is still with us.\n       The present spotlight in Washington on campaign \n     contributions and the methods of solicitation for such funds \n     makes it easy for people to think an amendment to the \n     Constitution would be an appropriate response. But however \n     tawdry such actions have been--and they certainly are \n     tawdry--there will be no change merely by passing an \n     amendment that says, in effect: ``Thou shalt not be tawdry. \n     Thou shalt not be greedy.''\n       The existing amendments to the U.S. Constitution that come \n     closest to addressing a specific subject are the 13th and \n     14th, which after the Civil War abolished slavery and \n     codified equal protection under the law. But even they were \n     not so specific that they can't be applied to races other \n     than African-Americans, and questions of equal protection \n     arise even today.\n       Efforts for a balanced budget amendment are an abdication \n     of congressional responsibility. Efforts for an amendment on \n     campaign financing constitute a similar abdication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2725-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2725-S2726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          EXPRESSING CONCERNS ABOUT AIRPORT IMPROVEMENT BUDGET\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to express my concern with \nthe President's proposal for the budget of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration. We all know how important aviation is to our economy, \ncontributing more than $770 billion in direct and indirect benefits. In \nSouth Carolina, travel and tourism is the No. 2 industry, accounting \nfor almost 100,000 jobs. The industry is fueled by the aviation \nindustry.\n  The President has talked a lot about a bridge to the 21st century. \nBridges and highway projects are critical parts of our Nation's \ninfrastructure. But so are airports. I have an airport in almost every \ncounty of my State. We have a strong airport system, but one that needs \nmoney to rebuild and expand. The $1 billion proposal falls far short of \nwhat is needed. It is a shortsighted approach to meeting our country's \nneeds. It also undoes a deal that we had last year with the \nadministration. I am certain that the new Secretary wants to make sure \nthat our Nation's infrastructure needs are addressed, and I want to \nwork with him on ways to meet those needs.\n  The President has proposed a $1 billion airport improvement program. \nThe airport community claims that nationwide it needs almost $10 \nbillion per\n\n[[Page S2726]]\n\nyear. In my State alone, money for airports is critically needed for \nsmall and large projects. Without adequate funding, these airports \ncannot expand and cannot begin to attract new businesses. I can cite \nmany examples of this, but one that comes to mind is the Greenville-\nSpartanburg Airport project. Without an AIP grant, the runway would not \nhave been lengthened. It helped BMW decide to locate in South Carolina. \nAirport grants mean business opportunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2725-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       YALE PUBLIC SERVICE AWARDS\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN.

Mr. President, the Speaker of the other body made a \nremarkable statement earlier this week. He argued that Congress should \nwait on cutting taxes, and instead make balancing the budget our \nhighest priority. This is a significant and extremely positive \ndevelopment in the fight for a balanced Federal budget, and I \ncongratulate the Speaker for making that statement in the face of \nsignificant opposition within his own party.\n  Mr. President, the Speaker's comments are indeed welcome. They follow \nthe comments made this weekend by the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee [Mr. Domenici], who informally offered a no-tax cut, no new \nspending programs outline of a possible budget agreement. Mr. \nPresident, I cannot emphasize enough how important the comments of the \nchairman were. They came after several days of highly partisan comments \non the budget, from both parties and in both houses. Often, without \nleadership, it is the nature of some to retreat to the security of \npartisan politics--an easy path that leads us further and further \napart. To his great credit, Chairman Domenici rejected the considerable \nforces of partisanship, and offered an alternative path. Mr. President, \nhis path offers us a real chance for a bipartisan budget agreement, and \nI want to take this occasion to commend my chairman for his courage. I \nam pleased to serve on the Budget Committee, and deeply honored to \nserve with the senior Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. President, the Speaker is of course absolutely right on the mark. \nAs dearly as many of us would like to support tax cuts, our first \npriority must be to balance the budget. This is a position I took when \nI first ran for the Senate, and one I hold today.\n  Major tax cuts undercut our ability to craft a politically \nsustainable balanced budget plan, as was so clearly demonstrated during \nthe 104th Congress. As I have noted before, both parties are at fault. \nWe cannot afford either the President's tax cuts or the Congressional \nRepublican tax cuts.\n  In November of 1994, I faulted the so-called Contract With America \ntax cuts--called the crown jewel of the Contract With America at the \ntime. A month later, the day after the President proposed his own set \nof tax cuts, I took his proposal to task as well.\n  Mr. President, we dodged a bullet during the 104th Congress. Despite \nformal support for a tax cut in some form from both the White House and \nthe majority party in Congress, we escaped without doing serious damage \nto the progress we made in reducing the deficit. Regretfully, we did \nnot build significantly on the work accomplished in the 103d Congress \nto reduce the deficit. Though we made some modest strides, the bulk of \nthe work that remained at the end of 1994 must still be done.\n  Mr. President, major tax cuts make the difficult task of enacting a \nbalanced budget impossible. Most obviously, major tax cuts dig the hole \neven deeper before we begin. But major tax cuts also pose a significant \nand very real political problem, and the Speaker's comments about how \nincluding tax cuts leaves a balanced budget plan open to criticism are \nabsolutely correct. There is no painless solution to the deficit.\n  The fundamental premise of any plan to balance the budget rests on \nthe willingness of the Nation to sacrifice, but we cannot expect the \nNation to embrace a plan which calls for some to sacrifice while \nproviding tax cuts for others. Such a plan would not be sustainable, as \nwas demonstrated so clearly during the 104th Congress. We can enact a \nbalance budget plan if that plan is seen broadly as spreading sacrifice \nfairly. Mr. President, no partisan plan has any hope of rallying \nbroadbased public support.\n  The only way we will enact a balanced budget plan, and sustain it \nthrough the several years it will take to achieve balance, is through a \ntruly bipartisan effort. Thanks to the leadership of Chairman Domenici, \nand with the support of the Speaker, we have a chance to build such a \nplan. I hope my colleagues will not squander the opportunity they have \ngiven us at some personal political cost to themselves.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Domenici on the Budget \nCommittee to fashion the beginning of a budget agreement. As I have \nindicated to him in the committee, there are several budget issues that \nare especially important to me, but I remain flexible on all aspects of \nthe budget in trying to reach a bipartisan agreement. Mr. President, I \napplaud the Speaker for change of heart, and especially commend \nChairman Domenici for his courage and leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2726-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2726-S2727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JACK G. JUSTUS\n\n Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nfellow Arkansan who is soon to retire after a long and distinguished \ncareer in Arkansas agriculture.\n  Jack G. Justus has devoted 44 years of service to Arkansas \nagriculture as a county agricultural agent and as a staff member of the \nArkansas Farm Bureau. Under Jack's leadership as executive vice \npresident for the past 15 years, the Arkansas Farm Bureau has nearly \ndoubled in size to more than 200,000 members.\n  ``Progressive Farmer'' honored Jack Justus as its 1996 Man of the \nYear in Service to Agriculture. Throughout his career, Jack has served \non numerous boards and commissions, including the Future Farmers of \nAmerica Foundation, the 4-H Club Foundation, Arkansas State Fair, and \nother groups committed to the improvement of life for farm youth and \nthe rural community.\n  Mr. President, on June 1, 1997, Jack Justus will retire from his \nadministrative duties at the Farm Bureau. This native Arkansan, life-\nlong resident, product of our State's educational system, and dedicated \npublic servant is certainly deserving of a long and satisfying \nretirement.\n  Our State has benefited greatly from Jack Justus' stewardship and I \nknow I\n\n[[Page S2727]]\n\njoin literally thousands from all across our State who join me in \nsaying thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2726-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CITY OF HACKENSACK\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to inform the \nSenate that Americans are still committed to economic progress and that \nlocal government is not powerless in the face of economic challenges. \nIn my home State of New Jersey, the city of Hackensack has shown that \ndedication to solving long-term economic problems can be accomplished \nwith practical leadership utilizing innovative solutions.\n  Over the past few years, the city of Hackensack had seen its downtown \npopulation decrease and its economic stability put at risk. The people \nof Hackensack were not to be deterred from making their city the best \nit could be. So, instead of accepting an unsatisfying economic fate, \nHackensack's mayor and city council called together local business \nleaders to establish the Hackensack Economic Development Commission. \nThis pioneering commission set out to study the city's economic climate \nand propose steps toward its continuing development.\n  This study, conducted by the Eagleton Institute's Center for Public \nInterest Polling at Rutgers University, is the first of its kind by a \nmunicipality in our State. The city's initiative and creativity in \nutilizing these research tools should be commended. Hackensack's \nclimate study is unique in that it reached a broad range of people, \nover 5,000 residents and workers of the Hackensack area. The wide scope \nand depth of the study is a model for similarly situated cities in New \nJersey.\n  Yet, more than a model for New Jersey, the efforts of the commission \nserve as a model for the entire country to prove that with solid \ncommunity commitment, ongoing economic growth can be a reality. Thus, I \nask that you join me in recognizing the city of Hackensack in its \ndevotion to be an improved economic development and commend its \nforesight and planning to other cities across the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2727-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2727-S2728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL AGRICULTURE DAY--MARCH 20, 1997\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nAmerica's farm families and those involved, both directly and \nindirectly, in production agriculture.\n  Today, is National Agriculture Day. It is an opportunity for all of \nAmerica to pause, reflect, and be thankful that we enjoy the safest and \nmost abundant food supply in the world. But, this doesn't happen by \naccident.\n  Every day, 77,000 farm families in Illinois go about the business of \nproducing the food and fiber that our State and our Nation needs to \nsurvive. To them I say, thank you.\n  Mr. President, I am honored to represent the State of Illinois. It is \nthe home of some of the most productive farm land in the world. \nIllinois farms produce corn, soybeans, pork, beef, wheat, dairy \nproducts, and many specialty crops. Our agribusiness community is \nvibrant. And, our researchers help provide answers to some of the most \ncommon as well as the most complex agricultural questions we know.\n  Over the last few months, I've traveled my home State and talked to \nfarmers and others involved in production agriculture. The message from \nmy fellow Illinoisans has been clear--health insurance affordability \nand economic opportunity are priority issues.\n  I believe that a 100-percent tax deduction for health insurance \npremiums is one of the most basic issues to farm families across this \ncountry. Because of the high cost of health insurance, especially \nindividually purchased insurance, lack of affordability is a growing \nproblem. Health insurance is particularly important to those involved \nin production agriculture because farming is one of the more dangerous \noccupations. Therefore, it is essential that farmers have access to \nquality health care and that they be covered by health insurance.\n  To help with affordability of health insurance, I plan to introduce \nlegislation that would allow farmers and other self-employed \nindividuals to pay for their health insurance premiums with pretax \ndollars. When it comes to health insurance, farmers and small business \nowners deserve to be treated the same as corporations. Corporations are \nallowed to take an income tax deduction for the full cost of the health \ninsurance premiums that they pay.\n  The self-employed, including farmers, can only deduct 40 percent of \ntheir premiums this year. My bill would allow farmers to deduct 100 \npercent of their health insurance premiums from their taxable income \nthis year and every year thereafter. A 100-percent deduction for health \ninsurance premiums can reduce the net cost of health insurance for a \nfarm family by as much as $500 to $1,000 annually. This savings can \nmake the difference between whether health insurance is affordable or \nprice-prohibitive. The affordability of quality health insurance is \nvitally important to Illinois' and America's farm families.\n  Mr. President, another important issue for rural America is finding \nnew or alternative uses for our agricultural products to help ensure \neconomic opportunity for farm families. Ethanol, a renewable fuel made \nfrom corn, is one of the best alternative use opportunities that exists \ntoday.\n  Last week the Government Accounting Office released a report, Alcohol \nFuels: Tax Incentives Have Had Little Effect on Air Quality or Energy \nSecurity.'' Unfortunately, this report misses the point. That point is \nsimple: Ethanol has a significant economic, environmental, and energy \nsecurity impact in this country; one that past GAO reports have clearly \nrecognized. The effect on air quality and energy security would be \nlarger if more of our Nation s gasoline contained ethanol.\n  Ethanol should not be a poster child for Government handouts or \ncorporate welfare. The primary incentive--a 5.4-cents-per-gallon \nreduction in the gasoline excise tax for 10 percent ethanol blends--is \nnot claimed by major ethanol-producing corporations. The incentive is \nclaimed by thousands of gasoline marketers--mostly independent, small \nbusinesses--that sell ethanol blends all across the country. In other \nwords, the incentive is claimed at corner gas stations, not in \ncorporate boardrooms.\n  On a day like today, it is important to point out the benefits of \nethanol. The industry is responsible, both directly and indirectly, for \nmore than 40,000 American jobs. Ethanol contributes more than $5.6 \nbillion annually to our economy. Five percent of our Nation's corn crop \ngoes to ethanol production. Corn growers have seen their incomes \nincreased by more than $1.2 billion because of ethanol. This year over \n1.4 billion gallons of ethanol will be produced. Thanks to the \nreformulated gasoline program, toxic air pollutants like benzene and \ncarbon monoxide have fallen substantially. And, ethanol contributes \nover $2 billion annually to the U.S. trade balance.\n  Finally, Mr. President, in order for our country to continue to have \na safe and abundant food supply we must support agricultural research. \nThis year, we have an opportunity to reauthorize the research title of \nthe farm bill. Congressional reauthorization will establish national \npolicy for important agricultural research into the 21st century. In \nthese times of constrained Federal budgets, it is vitally important to \nmaintain an effective system for agricultural research.\n  Agriculture-related research in this country is currently conducted \nat over 100 ARS labs, including Peoria, IL, and over 70 land grant \ninstitutions, including the University of Illinois. Unfortunately, the \nUnited State ranks behind Japan, the United Kingdom, France, and \nGermany in the percentage of total research and development funding \nthat is dedicated to agriculture. From soybean diseases to water \nquality to biotechnology, agricultural research plays an important part \nin the safety and quality of our food and fiber system.\n  Mr. President, last year Congress passed a comprehensive \nreauthorization of most farm programs. This year we need to continue \nthat commitment by ensuring affordable health care and deductibility of \npremiums for farmers and the self-employed, promoting the use of \nalternative agricultural products like ethanol, and modernizing our \nagriculture system by continuing a strong and active investment in \nresearch.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle\n\n[[Page S2728]]\n\nand from rural and urban areas to ensure that American agriculture \nremains a model of quality and efficiency for all nations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2727-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF MERRICK GARLAND\n\n Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, yesterday I voted ``no'' on the \nnomination of Merrick Garland to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit.\n  In so voting, I take no position on the personal qualifications of \nMr. Garland to be a Federal appeals court judge. What I do take a \nposition on is that the vacant 12th seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the District of Columbia Circuit does not need to be filled. \nSenator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's \nSubcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, has examined \nthis issue thoroughly, and has determined that the court's workload \ndoes not justify the existence of the 12th seat. Last Congress, Senator \nGrassley introduced legislation to abolish this unneeded seat. By \nproceeding to renominate Mr. Garland, President Clinton has flatly \nignored this uncontradicted factual record.\n  I commend Senator Grassley for his important work on this matter, as \nwell as Senator Jeff Sessions, who has also emphasized the importance \nof this matter. With the Federal deficit at an all time high, we should \nalways be vigilant in looking for all opportunities to cut wasteful \ngovernment spending; this is one such opportunity. After all, each \nunnecessary circuit judge and his or her staff cost the taxpayer at \nleast $1 million a year.\n  Lastly, our vote yesterday is an important precedent, since it marks \nthe beginning of the Senate's new commitment to hold rollcall votes on \nall judicial nominees. This is a policy change which I had urged on my \nRepublican colleagues by letter of January 8, 1997, to the Republican \nConference. Voting on Federal judges, who serve for life and who exert \ndramatic--mostly unchecked--influence over society, should be one of \nthe most important aspects of serving as a U.S. Senator. Rollcall votes \nwill, I believe, impress upon the individual judge, the individual \nSenator, and the public the importance of just what we are voting on. I \nhope that my colleagues will regard this vote, and every vote they take \non a Federal judge, as being among the most important votes they will \never take.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2728-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO PROF. ROBERT J. LAMPMAN\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to offer tribute to Dr. \nRobert J. Lampman, economist, University of Wisconsin-Madison professor \nand noted researcher on poverty, who passed away March 4 at his home in \nMadison.\n  Mr. President, Dr. Lampman spent much of his distinguished \nprofessional career studying and writing about poverty and working to \ndevelop strategies to achieve its end. In 1966, he became the founding \ndirector of the Institute for Research on Poverty, a nonpartisan center \nfor research into the causes and consequences of poverty and social \ninequality in America, on the UW-Madison campus, which established the \nuniversity as a leader of research in that field. A colleague at the \nUniversity of Wisconsin, Dr. Lee Hansen, called Dr. Lampman ``a true \nscholar in that he was always asking questions to get a better \nunderstanding of the issues.''\n  Despite his standing in his profession, Dr. Lampman was known as a \nprofessor who regarded his students as colleagues. One news report \ndescribing his career included a recollection by Dr. Thomas Corbett, \nonce a graduate student studying with Dr. Lampman and now a University \nof Wisconsin professor of social work and acting director of the IRP. \nDr. Corbett recalled Dr. Lampman's stopping by his office and saying he \nwanted ``to pick my brain.'' ``In a world where egos can become \noverwhelming, he was a guy who never lost his perspective,'' Dr. \nCorbett said.\n  In 1962, he joined the staff of President John Kennedy's Council of \nEconomic Advisors, where he prophetically warned that economic growth, \nalone, would not eliminate poverty. He was later a key author of the \nhistoric chapter on poverty contained in Lyndon Johnson's ``Economic \nReport of the President'' in 1964 that helped call America's attention \nto poverty.\n  Dr. Lampman became, in the words of Nobel laureate economist James \nTobin, ``the intellectual architect of the War on Poverty,'' and he \nemphasized the importance of economic growth, income maintenance, and \nopportunities for education and jobs for those mired in poverty.\n  In 1964, as the War on Poverty was getting underway, he predicted to \na group of University of Wisconsin-Madison graduate students that, \nwithin 20 years, ``by present standards, no one will be poor.''\n  Mr. President, it turned out that Professor Lampman was overly \noptimistic. Poverty was not eliminated in 20 years, but the War on \nPoverty had an impact. In 1964, before the War on Poverty was up and \nrunning, 19 percent of Americans were poor. Within 5 years, programs \ncreated by the Federal Government and a broadly expanding economy had \ncombined to bring that number down to 12.1 percent. By 1973, the \npoverty rate was down to 11.1 percent.\n  That progress stalled, for many reasons. Census Bureau estimates for \n1995, the most recent year for which data are available, tell us 13.8 \npercent of our Nation's population was poor, and, in the wealthiest \nnation in history, one American child in five lived in poverty.\n  Mr. President, Dr. Lampman's dedication, his intellectual energy, and \nhis commitment to solving one of the most difficult, complex, and \npersistent social challenges we face should inform and inspire us. We \nshould apply, as Dr. Lampman did, our best efforts to ridding our world \nof the plague of poverty and finally establishing social justice. That \nwould be the most fitting tribute we could pay to this man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2728-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              RURAL HEALTH\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pledge my support \nto the Rural Health Improvement Act of 1997. In my home State of \nMichigan and across the Nation, this legislation would improve the \nstandard of health care for millions of Americans who live in rural \nareas.\n  Mr. President, I am very aware of the problems inherent in caring for \ncitizens who live far away from major cities. Too often, these \nhardworking taxpayers and their children are not given easy access to \nthe quality emergency and primary care services they deserve. There \nhave, however, been two recent efforts that have been extremely \nsuccessful in providing such care while also controlling costs -- the \nMontana Medical Assistance Facility demonstration project and the \nEssential Access Community Hospital and Rural Primary Care Hospital \ndemonstration program.\n  Mr. President, the bill that I endorse today would extend these \nsuccessful initiatives to all 50 States. It would also ease Federal \nregulations for small hospitals that wish to be designated as \n``critical access'' institutions. The aim of the bill is to allow these \nfacilities greater flexibility in tailoring their services to the needs \nof patients in their particular communities. In short, I believe this \nlaw would improve care and save lives. A study of these programs by the \nGeneral Accounting Office, in fact, has found that these initiatives \nactually decreased Medicare costs while maintaining a high standard of \ncare.\n  In my view, Michigan and the rest of the Nation must receive the most \naffordable high quality care available. I believe this legislation is \nan important step in that direction. For these reasons, I am proud to \ncosponsor this legislation and urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2728-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2728-S2729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SAFE ADOPTIONS AND FAMILIES ENVIRONMENTS ACT\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong \nsupport for the Chafee-Rockefeller Safe Adoptions and Families \nEnvironments Act [SAFE]. What's more, I commend each of them for their \ntireless and bipartisan efforts on behalf of this issue.\n  As I come to the floor today, it is difficult for me to imagine a \nmore outrageous and disgraceful form of violence than child abuse.\n  However, while national attention to the problems of abuse are \nincreasing, regrettably, so too are incidents of child abuse and \nneglect.\n  In fact, the number of abused and neglected children nearly doubled \nfrom\n\n[[Page S2729]]\n\n1.4 million in 1986 to over 2.8 million in 1993. During that period the \nnumber of children who were seriously injured quadrupled--from about \n143,000 to nearly 570,000.\n  In my own State of Connecticut incidents of child abuse and neglect \nincreased 118 percent from 1984 to 1994. In fact, between 1993 and 1994 \nalone there was a 43-percent increase.\n  Unfortunately, many child welfare agencies lack the resources to \neffectively deal with the increase in child abuse cases or efficiently \nplace children in safe, permanent, and loving homes.\n  Legislation introduced today by Senators Chafee and Rockefeller, of \nwhich I am an original cosponsor, would do more to not only protect \nthese abused children but also ensure that they are not returned to \nenvironments where they will be abused or neglected.\n  First, it would work to ensure that abused and neglected children are \nplaced in safe and protected settings.\n  Second, it would more rapidly move children out of the foster system \nand into permanent homes.\n  If there is one thing that all of us can agree upon it is the \nimportance of assuring the safety and well-being of our Nation's \nchildren. This bill would improve our child welfare system and help \nensure that every child is given the opportunity to grow up in a safe \nand healthy home.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join me in a bipartisan manner, and \nsupport this critically important legislation for our children's \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2728-4", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2729-S2730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE NATIONAL ENTERPRISE\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the extraordinary lifestyle, \nsecurity and standard of living Americans have enjoyed since the end of \nthe Second World War is one of our most notable achievements in recent \nhistory. We are wealthier, healthier, and safer than any people before \nus. We have built an economy whose resilience, ingenuity, and potential \nare truly the envy of the world. We have become the standard by which \nall other nations are measured. The century in which we have survived \neconomic collapse and two world wars only to become stronger bears our \nname, the ``American Century.''\n  This unparalleled achievement is not a product of chance or fate, \nluck or serendipity, or even good timing. It is the product of an \nextraordinary effort on the part of the American people and the \ninstitutions we have built and strengthened. It is the product of the \nAmerican spirit and work ethic which, in our first 100 years, propelled \nus from the periphery of a colonial empire to an independent nation a \ncontinent wide. It has allowed us, in our second century, to defeat \nchallenges under which other nations withered.\n  Since the end of the Second World War, we have witnessed and enjoyed \nprogress and growth unparalleled in our own history. That unparalleled \nprogress is the product of a unique effort that helped us win the cold \nwar and, among other notable achievements, put Americans on the moon. \nThe effort is best described as a National Enterprise: a strong \nfoundation built upon a shared responsibility and a common vision for \nour country's success.\n  The common vision that helped define our National Enterprise was \nshared by three basic pillars of our society: our Government, our \nacademic institutions, and our private industries. The cementing agent \nis a sense of singular mission, embodied largely, but not exclusively, \nin the cold war effort, our love of freedom, and our free markets. Its \nmedium and fuel are an ingenious, compassionate, optimistic, hard \nworking, and resolute people.\n  The National Enterprise has now reached a crossroads, and we are \nfacing one of the greatest but understated challenges of our history. \nWith the advent of two historical trends, we face a challenge more \ndaunting than any enemy: a potential loss of our own resolve.\n  First, growing Federal entitlements have created a fiscal crisis in \nthe Federal Government, with 28 consecutive years of deficit spending, \na $5.3 trillion debt, and shrinking discretionary spending. The money \nwe allocate to research and development faces increasing competition \nfrom other worthwhile endeavors such as environment, education, \nnational parks, infrastructure, and defense. All are competing for a \nsmaller and smaller slice of the Federal spending pie.\n  Second, the end of the cold war era has left America with what some \nmight call a diluted sense of mission or common interest. The National \nEnterprise cannot be defined in a single dimension, but for better or \nfor worse, the cold war's unifying power and the birth of America as a \nsuperpower was the single greatest motive driving the Enterprise and \nthe yardstick of its success.\n  With the launch of Sputnik in 1957, we witnessed a technologically- \nadvanced, symbolic challenge from our would-be enemy. It was the crack \nof the starter pistol in a race that would bear both frightening \nmilitary capabilities and extraordinary peaceful dividends. For the \nfirst time, we were sobered in our celebration of post-war-era wealth \nand security and were challenged to push ourselves to the limit. The \nSputnik era has ended, and with it has ended the series of punctuated \nevents that presented a clear road map for our progress and cold war \nvictory. What will be the new road map for our National Enterprise?\n  I was heartened to hear the President recognize the importance of the \nNational Enterprise during his State of the Union Address. Without his \nleadership, any efforts in Congress, industry or education are unlikely \nto be successful. However, the President addressed only broad themes \nand small remedies for a few specific problems. In the President's \nbudget, funding for Federal research and development remains \nessentially unchanged in a gradual downward trend, with the prognosis \nfor coming years being a point of great concern. The President's \nemphasis on education is also a positive initiative, but his proposals \nseem to disproportionately favor higher education over all other \nlevels. The President has presented a budget which seems to recognize \nsome of the problems, but does not clearly articulate the full spectrum \nof challenges before us.\n  In addition to addressing the funding challenges that our National \nEnterprise faces, we must also embolden the Federal Government with a \nnew understanding of mission and role within the Enterprise. This \nunderstanding is the critical difference between developing a strategy \nlike the one that won the Cold War, and one that is simply a triage of \nfederal spending programs. We must forge a sense of mission and seek a \nnew understanding, for we may never have another Sputnik to awaken our \nschools, government and industries to the essence of the National \nEnterprise.\n\n  The challenges of the coming century will be as great or greater than \nthose we have met thus far, but we do have the benefit of learning from \nour past successes. We can base our inquiry and guide our decisions on \na set of simple truths we have learned from that experience. These \nsimple truths make the link between spending and results, and highlight \nthe need to make those links as clear, as direct, and as strong as \npossible.\n  Truth number one: research and development, science, and education \nbring advancements and innovation.\n  Truth number two: innovation has been the basis of our competitive \nedge--peaceful and defensive--and of our extraordinary lifestyle; it is \nthe cornucopia of modern America and the envy of the world.\n  Truth number three: federal funding of research, and creating an \nenvironment that encourages private research and innovation, is the \nbedrock upon which the National Enterprise has been founded.\n  These fruits of our labor are not obscure laboratory innovations, but \nintegral parts of our lives and economy. The Internet, computer chips, \nsatellites, super-sonic aircraft, higher education and research \nuniversities, and strong civilian and defense-related basic research \nare a few compelling examples.\n  Therefore, the question is not whether federal research and \ndevelopment spending is the taproot of our innovation and economic \ngrowth--it clearly is. The questions we face are, What is the right \nformula for the federal government in this National Enterprise? What \nare the actual mechanisms by which that combination of spending and \nAmerican ingenuity translate into\n\n[[Page S2730]]\n\nadvancements? And how do we make them as strong and as sharp as \npossible?\n  We have some initial ideas here in Congress, but I do not believe \nthis body as a whole is prepared to answer those questions--the most \nimportant of our time. But it is my sincere hope that we have begun \nthis necessary dialogue.\n  In our pursuit of these answers, we have a simple, yet profound, \njustification: research and development spending and strong science and \ntechnology are the essential base elements of our competitive edge, our \nstandard of living, and our defense. To hone and preserve that edge, \nCongress must work closely with the traditional partners in this \neffort: universities, government agencies and their labs, and private \nindustry. These partnerships have been a key to America s strength and \ntheir whole is seemingly greater than the sum of its respective parts.\n  Along with several representatives of the national research, \ndevelopment and education effort in government, universities, and \nindustry, several Senators of both parties have begun to explore the \nissues and open a dialogue addressing the questions of great national \nimportance, as illustrated by the formation of the Senate's bipartisan \nScience and Technology Caucus. The full Senate understands the \nchallenges of maintaining a vibrant National Enterprise, but the \ngravity of the challenge has not been fully articulated, even as we \nface greater competition from other countries and ever greater pressure \non federal and private funding of all research and development.\n  This venture will require understanding, sympathy, discipline and \ndedication. Already, the initial dialogue has realized some immediate \nsuccess: it exposed common ground and initiated the critical dialogue. \nWe have begun to identify issues and areas on which Congress can begin \nto pursue an agenda and strategy:\n  Partnerships among industry, government, and universities are the \nstrong basis of our preeminence in science and technology and in \nresearch and development, and are the essential whet stone of our \ncompetitive edge. We must find the best ways to shorten the time it \ntakes to bring basic research to market, clinic, the armed forces, or \nindustry.\n  Education is the seed-corn of the advancements we enjoy. We must \ncontinue to cultivate human capital, for that seed-corn cannot be \nplanted too early. To fail to provide our institutions of higher \nlearning with qualified students will ultimately be the most damaging \nblow to the National Enterprise. It is a problem that cannot be \ncorrected in a single budget or simply through new laws and higher \nfederal spending levels. Today, nearly one-third of incoming American \ncollege students are compelled to enter remedial courses because they \nare ill-prepared for much of the basic curriculum. The erosion of \nstandards and performance in our elementary and secondary school \nsystems is an erosion of the basis of the National Enterprise itself \nand a threat to its very existence.\n  Consistent and stable commitments to funding are essential for \nplanning. Planning, in turn, is an essential ingredient in long term \nstrategies and the ability for individuals, companies and institutions \nto commit to the long term and basic research.\n  A commitment to basic research is the foundation upon which all other \ndiscoveries and technical advancements are dependent. Here, the federal \nrole is particularly important. Universities and labs cannot \nrealistically undertake such high-risk and long-term research on their \nown. And industries cannot necessarily commit to a venture that may not \nenjoy a market return during the lifetime of the company.\n  Do not think I'm speaking of simply a more-informed and sophisticated \ntriage. The overall budget projections on research and development \nspending are a point of great concern--some say a threat to our \nnational security, our quality of life and our sharp competitive edge.\n  In this delicate operation of redefining our National Enterprise, we \nmust be extremely careful, for clean incisions are not easy, and the \ndistinctions between excesses and successes are not always clear. We \nmust note that in trying to solve our budget crisis, some of the issue \nhave been muddled, where the fine distinctions between basic and \napplied research, and between research and development, are lost or \nmisjudged. However, should we gain a new sense of mission and consensus \nof goals through dialogue, such distinctions become less and less \ndifficult with time, and we can better focus the energies and money of \nthe United States.\n  We also face the danger that any such dialogue could be characterized \npolitically and split by misconceptions of conservative versus liberal, \nof big government versus streamlined government, or even command \neconomy versus the free market. We should be clear from the outset that \nthis discussion is none of these, and it is certainly not a Republican \nversus Democrat issue, as the recent bipartisan efforts illustrate.\n  We must be mindful that the dialogue must also focus on education and \nthe creation of human capital to fuel and guide our National \nEnterprise. A National Enterprise with all financial means at its \ndisposal is impotent and adrift without knowhow and wisdom. Our \neconomy's resilience, ingenuity, and potential are sure to fade without \nan unwavering commitment to education.\n  On these issues we must be prepared to deliberate, to make difficult \ndecisions, and to lead. Congress must use its experience, knowledge and \nauthority to move dialogue, keep it from folly, and define priorities \nand goals in the interests of the American people--a very tall order.\n  We must begin to study these issues and join the effort, beginning \nwith the appreciation that this dialogue is the extraordinary luxury of \nan accomplished, enterprising and open-minded people. As Chairman of \nthe Science, Technology and Space Subcommittee, as a founding member of \nthe Science and Technology Caucus, and as a medical scientist and \nphysician, I will actively pursue this dialogue and seek answers to \nthese critical questions.\n  The Nation's approach to these challenges must be broadened in scope \nand increased in level of participation. It must move away from an \nannual piecemeal approach, confined to specific programs' and agencies' \nfunding within our own appropriations process. It must also gain the \nlevel of honesty and earnestness realized during the Cold War Era and \nin the wake of Sputnik. This nascent dialogue and recent legislative \ninitiatives are encouraging first steps, but the challenge must expand \nto include more of the Congress, the Administration and the public.\n  Congress must answer the critical questions to determine the role of \nthe federal government, and then see that our laws and spending reflect \nthe correct answers and clearly define our national interests. We must \nset out to understand our mission and to define our goals.\n  America cannot afford to wait for another Sputnik to shake us from \nour complacency and to define our interests for us. Congress has a \ngreat challenge ahead, and we must act now to restore and preserve our \ncompetitive edge and standard of living--so much depends on the \ndecisions Congress makes and on the sincerity, depth, and sobriety of \nthe dialogue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2729-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2730-S2731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE REUNIFICATION OF JERUSALEM\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. I rise today to speak about the city of \nJerusalem, a subject I have spoken about at some length and on numerous \noccasions during my tenure in the United States Senate. In the not too \ndistant future, the people of Israel will celebrate the thirtieth \nanniversary of the reunification of their Capital. It is altogether \nfitting and proper that the United States Congress should mark this \nanniversary with an appropriate resolution.\n  For 3,000 years Jerusalem has been the focal point of Jewish \nreligious devotion. Although there had been a continuous Jewish \npresence in Jerusalem for three millennia--and a Jewish majority in the \ncity since the 1840's--the once thriving Jewish population of the \nhistoric Old City of Jerusalem was driven out by force during the 1948 \nArab-Israeli War. From 1948 to 1967 Jerusalem was divided by concrete, \nbarbed wire, and cinder block. Israelis of all faiths and Jews of all \nnationalities were denied access to holy sites in the area controlled \nby Jordan.\n  Jerusalem was finally reunited by Israel in 1967 during the conflict \nknown\n\n[[Page S2731]]\n\nas the Six Day War. Since then, Jerusalem has been a united city in \nwhich the rights of all faiths have been respected and protected, and \npersons of all religious faiths have been guaranteed full access to \nholy sites within the city.\n  In 1990, I sponsored Senate Concurrent Resolution 106, which was \noverwhelmingly adopted by the United States Senate, while a similar \nresolution (H. Con. Res. 290) was adopted by the House of \nRepresentatives. These resolutions declared that Jerusalem, the capital \nof Israel, ``must remain an undivided city'' and called on the Israelis \nand the Palestinians to undertake negotiations to resolve their \ndifferences. The late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin credited S. Con. \nRes. 106 with ``[helping] our neighbors reach the negotiating table'' \nto produce the historic Declaration of Principles signed in Washington \non September 13, 1993.\n  In the fall of 1995, I joined with Senator Dole to introduce ``The \nJerusalem Embassy Act of 1995'' (Public Law 104-45) which states as a \nmatter of United States policy that Jerusalem should remain the \nundivided capital of Israel. I firmly believe that Jerusalem must \nremain an undivided city in which the rights of every ethnic and \nreligious group are protected, as they have been by Israel during the \npast thirty years.\n  I congratulate the people of Israel on the approaching thirtieth \nanniversary of the reunification of their historic capital. When the \nSenate reconvenes next month, I will introduce a resolution to \ncommemorate this event, as I have done on previous \nanniversaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2730-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2731-S2732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, high-level nuclear waste and \nhighly radioactive used nuclear fuel is piling up at 80 sites in 41 \nStates. It is stored in populated areas, near neighborhoods and \nschools, in the backyards of people across America.\n  An example is the Palisades Plant in Michigan, which is within 100 \nfeet of Lake Michigan. Another is the Haddam Neck Plant, in \nConnecticut. A U.S. Senator has observed that he can see it from his \nhouse.\n  Without objection, I would like to place in the Record an editorial \nfrom today's Hartford Courant that observes that ``with the closing of \nthe Connecticut Yankee Plant at Haddam Neck, the issue of what to do \nwith the State's high-level nuclear waste has moved from the \ntheoretical to the here and now. . . . Experts say Connecticut Yankee's \nspent fuel could be stored at Haddam Neck for another 30 years if \nCongress fails to approve a temporary facility. Unfortunately, the \nhands of the clock can't be turned back to a time when nuclear waste \ndidn't exist. In terms of its disposal, a remote desert site in Nevada \nis the lesser of two evils.''\n  The waste was supposed to be taken by the Federal Government for \nsafer, central storage by 1998. Will that happen? The answer is ``no.''\n  Even though $12 billion has been collected from Americans to pay for \nstorage--and even though a Federal court reaffirmed the Government's \nlegal obligation to take the waste by 1998--there is no plan for \naction.\n  By 1998, 23 reactors in 14 States will be full. By 2010, 65 reactors \nin 29 States will be full.\n  A conservative estimate is that 25 percent of our nuclear plants will \nnot be able to build onsite storage and will be forced to shut down. \nThat would mean the loss of over 5 percent of our Nation's total \nelectricity generating capacity.\n  But Yucca Mountain won't be ready until at least 2015. Therefore, the \nNation needs a temporary solution.\n  That solution--S. 104--passed the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee with a solid, bipartisan vote (15-5). Almost half the \nminority members and all majority members voted in favor of the bill.\n  Americans have waited too long for a solution to this environmental \nand public safety challenge--we must not wait any longer. There is a \ncritical need to construct a safe, central storage facility to \neliminate the growing threat to the environment and to the American \npeople.\n  I have worked with Members on both sides of the aisle to solve any \nproblems they have with this bill. We accepted several amendments from \nthe democrat side.\n  We continue to meet with Democrat Members and the administration to \nresolve remaining concerns. We will continue to work with new Secretary \nPena and his staff at the Energy Department, now that the Secretary has \nthe portfolio to resolve this pressing problem.\n  Over the recess, committee staff will be available to work on \nproposed compromises which can be considered in April. Senator Bingaman \nhas been very constructive in this regard.\n  Much of what he is proposing appears acceptable. However, the bottom \nline is the need for a predictable path to interim and permanent waste \nstorage. We simply cannot leave trap doors that allow central storage \nto be delayed for decades.\n  We now have an opportunity for bipartisan action. Let's seize that \nopportunity.\n  It is no secret both Nevada Senators will do what they feel they need \nto to derail this important bill. They consider it a political \nnecessity to oppose it.\n  There will be allegations that the science is bad and try to scare us \nwith references to mobile chernobyl. They will imply that if this bill \ndoesn't pass, nuclear waste will not be transported through this \ncountry. That is not true. The fact is that there have been 2,500 \nshipments of used fuel across this country in the last 20 years.\n  This is not just history--it is happening today. Doe is transporting \nspent fuel from nuclear reactors all over the world into the United \nStates, virtually as we speak--by truck, by train, by barge, by boat.\n  If the Nevada Senators do not tell you about this, there's a reason. \nIts because these shipments have been, and will continue to be, \ncompletely uneventful. In short, these spent fuel shipments are safe, \nand they aren't news.\n  At our hearing in February, all four members of the Nevada delegation \nadmitted there was no process and no level of scientific proof that \nwould decrease their opposition. This is about politics, and little \nabout science.\n  Senator Bryan was once in favor of sending high-level materials to \nthe Nevada test site. As a State legislator, he voted for A.J.R 15, \nwhich was signed by the Nevada Governor in May 1975, which asked the \nFederal Government to do just that.\n  I think he was right the first time. It is safer, smarter, and \ncheaper to contain these materials at one location in the remote nevada \ndesert.\n  The Nevada test site was used for decades to explode nuclear bombs. \nIt helped win the cold war--now it can help us win the war on \nradioactive waste disposal. High-level nuclear waste is our legacy: Now \nit's our obligation to dispose of it.\n  It is irresponsible to let this situation continue. It is unsafe to \nlet dangerous radioactive materials pile up at 80 sites in 41 States. \nIt is unwise to block safe storage in a remote area when the \nalternative is to simply leave it in 41 States. This is a national \nproblem that requires a national solution. We need to pass S. 104.\n  So far, the administration's attitude toward nuclear waste storage \nhas been to simply ignore the problem and disregard the Governments \ncontractual obligation to take this waste. The American people deserve \nbetter.\n  Safe nuclear storage should not be a political issue. It is a \nscientific and an environmental issue--and we need a solution now. \nSadly, the administration has turned a blind eye and a deaf ear. In \naddition to threats to the environment and safety, 22 percent of our \nelectric capacity is at risk--22 percent.\n  Starting in January 1998, taxpayers may have to pay billions of \ndollars in liability payments because the Government has not met its \nobligation to take waste. Estimates of taxpayers' liability under a \nrecent lawsuit brought by States run as high as $80 billion. That's as \nmuch as $1,300 per American family. Here's how the damages break down:\n  Cost of storage of spent nuclear fuel: $19.6 billion.\n  Return of nuclear waste fees: $8.5 billion.\n  Interest on nuclear waste fees: $15 to $27.8 billion (depending on \nthe interest rate used).\n  Consequential damages for shutdown of 25 percent of nuclear plants \ndue to insufficient storage (power replacement cost): $24 billion.\n\n[[Page S2732]]\n\n  Inaction is not an option. Inaction is irresponsible.\n  Many of the opponents claims are also irresponsible: Interim storage \nat the Nevada test site will not delay construction of Yucca Mountain. \nA viability assessment will occur before the interim site is built. The \nPresident will have a choice of interim sites after the viability \nassessment.\n  This Nation faces a major decision: either continue storing high-\nlevel radioactive materials at 80 locations in 41 States indefinitely, \nor more safely contain them at one, centralized facility.\n  The option is clear--it's safer and cheaper. The time for action is \nnow.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n               [From the Hartford Courant, Mar. 20, 1997]\n\n                        The Lesser of Two Evils\n\n       With the closing of the Connecticut Yankee plant at Haddam \n     Neck, the issue of what to do with the state's high-level \n     nuclear waste has moved from the theoretical to the here and \n     now.\n       The dilemma for Connecticut--and for other states that are \n     home to any of 109 nuclear reactors--is whether to continue \n     to store the spent nuclear rods on site or. . . . Or What?\n       Or begin shipping the radioactive waste to a temporary \n     repository in the Nevada desert, but only if Congress \n     approves such a facility. Senate action is expected shortly.\n       Already, utility ratepayers have contributed $13 billion \n     nationally, and $500 million in Connecticut, for the purpose \n     of disposing spent nuclear fuel at a central repository. But \n     the federal government is more than a dozen years behind in \n     developing a permanent underground vault at Yucca Mountain, \n     Nev., thus heightening the need for a temporary holding \n     place.\n       To be sure, concerns about transporting 85,000 tons of \n     waste in 15,000 shipments over 30 years should in no way be \n     minimized. Any leak, accident or terrorist attack would have \n     disastrous consequences for the 75 percent of the nation's \n     population who live along the designated truck and rail \n     routes.\n       But nuclear engineers have done everything humanly possible \n     to ensure the integrity of the operation. The casks that \n     contain the radioactive material have been dropped 30 feet \n     onto hard surfaces, engulfed in 1,475-degree fires, submerged \n     under three feet of water and crashed at 80 mph into a 700-\n     ton concrete wall. In every test, the casks survived intact. \n     In the seven transportation accidents that have occurred, no \n     radioactivity was ever released.\n       Although the risk will never be eliminated, the alternative \n     is unacceptable. High-level nuclear waste cannot continue to \n     be stockpiled at the 73 existing sites. Many reactor sites \n     either have been decommissioned or are running out of room. \n     Experts say Connecticut Yankee's spent fuel could be stored \n     at Haddam Heck for another 30 years if Congress fails to \n     approve a temporary facility.\n       Unfortunately, the hands of the clock can't be turned back \n     to a time when nuclear waste didn't exist. In terms of its \n     disposal, a remote desert site in Nevada is the lesser of two \n     evils.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2731-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate is \nnow prepared to take up the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. It is \ntime that this Congress clarify its intentions for the disposal of \nspent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste. It is for this reason that I \nintroduced the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1996, which passed \nsuccessfully in this body last year, and it is why I am a sponsor of S. \n104 this year. We must resolve the problem that this Nation faces with \ndisposing of nuclear material. Congress must recognize its \nresponsibility to set a clear and definitive nuclear disposal policy. \nWith the passage of this legislation in the last Congress, the Senate \nexpressed its will that Government fulfill its responsibilities.\n  One major provision of this legislation directs that an interim \nstorage facility be constructed at Area 25 at the Nevada Test Site and \nthat the interim facility be prepared to accept materials by November \n30, 1999. The first phase of this two-phase facility will be of a \nsufficient size to accept spent fuel from commercial reactors, shut \ndown reactors and the Department of Energy.\n  As reported out of Committee, S. 104 includes a provision which I \nintroduced. This provision clarifies Congress' intent to provide for \nthe timely removal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive \nwaste from the Government's national laboratories and defense programs. \nUnder this provision, the Department of Energy is required to remove \nGovernment nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel from our national \nlaboratory sites in an amount equal to at least 5 percent of the total \nwaste DOE accepts into the interim storage facility every year.\n  In addition to the billions of dollars that utility ratepayers have \ncontributed to the disposal fund, taxpayers have contributed hundreds \nof millions of dollars to the disposal program for the removal of spent \nfuel and nuclear waste from the Nation's national laboratory sites. The \nprovision I have sponsored makes good on the Government's commitment to \nclean up these sites and shows a return on the taxpayer money committed \nto this disposal program.\n  This provision assures that the spent fuel from the U.S. Navy \nreactors currently stored at the Idaho National Engineering and \nEnvironmental Laboratory will begin to be sent to the interim storage \nfacility beginning in 1999. This is good news for both the DOE and for \nIdaho. Spent nuclear fuel will be moved out of Idaho well before the \nagreed date of 2035 called for in the agreement between Idaho Governor \nBatt, the DOE and the Navy. The fuel that is now temporarily stored in \nIdaho will be at the designated facility designed for long term \ndisposal.\n  In my opinion, this legislation is important because it closes off \nthe ``escape routes'' that exist in past legislation on this issue and \nhave stymied the opening of a facility that actually accepts spent \nnuclear fuel and stores or disposes of it at a permanent facility. S. \n104 closes these escape routes by specifying an interim facility \nlocation and a date for the opening of that facility.\n  Congress must own up to its responsibilities for the disposal of \nnuclear materials that it assumed through statute in 1982; a \nresponsibility that 40 utilities and other organizations from 23 States \nare suing the Federal Government right now in the U.S. Court of Appeals \nto fulfill. The passage of S. 104 will take a major step in that \ndirection and stem the Government's potential liability for failure to \nfulfill its contractual commitments--a potential hemorrhage of billions \nof dollars in judgments against the Department of Energy. By this \naction, spent nuclear fuel that is currently stored at nearly 100 \ndifferent sites around the country--sites that were never designed for \nlong-term storage--will be move to one central location: A location \nthat is specially designed for such storage.\n  In the course of this debate, we will hear a lot of discussion from \nthose on both sides of this issue about transportation. Those who don't \nwant to address the nuclear waste issue are likely to raise the specter \nof a ``mobile Chernobyl.'' This scaremongering is simply not supported \nby the facts.\n  The fact is that there have been over 2,500 commercial shipments of \nspent fuel in the United States, and that there has not been a single \ndeath or injury from the radioactive nature of the cargo. Let me add to \nthese statistics by noting that in my State there have been over 600 \nshipments of Navy fuel and over 4,000 other shipments of radioactive \nmaterial. Again, there have been no injuries related to the radioactive \nnature of these shipments. This is an exemplary safety record--a \nproduct of the care and rigorous attention with which these materials \nare transported.\n  I know that many people would prefer not to address the problem of \nspent nuclear fuel disposal. But for this Congress not to address the \nproblem would be irresponsible. As the legislative body that sets \npolicy for the Nation, Congress cannot sit by and watch while a key \ncomponent of the energy security of this Nation, and the source of 20 \npercent of our country's electricity, nuclear power, drowns in its own \nwaste.\n  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997 will do what neither the 1982 \nnor the 1987 act accomplished, and that is to definitively resolve the \nquestion of what to do with spent nuclear fuel in a timely manner. I \nlook forward to its successful passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/20/senate-section/article/S2732-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               APPOINTMENTS BY THE PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 66) commending the University of \n     Florida Football Team for winning the 1996 Division 1 \n     Collegiate Football National Championship.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \nsaluting the University of Florida football team on winning the 1996 \nNational Football Championship.\n  As a proud alumnus of the University of Florida, I join with all \nthose who have worn the Orange and Blue--both on and off the field--in \nhonoring Coach Steve Spurrier, his staff and the football team for this \noutstanding accomplishment.\n  From its humble beginnings in 1906 to the present, the University of \nFlorida's football program has had a rich and proud history. But 1996 \nwill be forever known in the hearts and minds of the Gator faithful as \n``The Year of the Gator.''\n  From the season opener in ``The Swamp'' to the national championship \ntitle game in the Sugar Bowl, the Gator faithful knew that with Steve \nSpurrier as their coach and Danny Wuerffel as the team's quarterback, \nfield leader and spiritual leader, the 1996 season would indeed be one \nto remember.\n  The 1996 football team compiled a record of 12 wins and 1 loss and \noutscored their opponents 611 to 221 points in winning its fourth \nconsecutive SEC championship and its first-ever national football \nchampionship.\n  For this achievement, the University of Florida was recognized by the \nAssociated Press and major college football coaches as the 1996 \nnational champions.\n  This season will also be remembered because for the first time in the \nhistory of the Heisman Trophy, an award which is presented annually to \ncollege football's most outstanding player, the winner played under a \nhead coach who also had won the Heisman Trophy. Coach Steve Spurrier \nand Danny Wuerffel should be commended for this high honor.\n  It is also important to note that for the first time since the NCAA \nhas been keeping records, two division I college football teams from \nthe same State have played each other for college football's national \nchampionship.\n  I also want to take this moment to honor Coach Bobby Bowden and the \nFlorida State University football team for their outstanding season and \nfor reaching the national championship game. While they didn't win the \ngame, the Seminoles and their fans should be proud of their \nachievements and commended for an outstanding season.\n  The State of Florida is indeed fortunate to be home to three of the \nfinest college football teams in the Nation: The University of Florida, \nFlorida State University, and the University of Miami. Together these \nthree teams combined have won six college football national \nchampionships.\n  But in 1996, the national football championship was won by the \nUniversity of Florida. Not only is this a special accomplishment that \nwill long be remembered by the coaches and players, but it is also a \nmoment to savor for Gator fans. After 90 years of ups and downs, great \nvictories and frustration, the Fightin' Gators are finally the national \nchampions of college football. All the loyal sons and daughters of the \nUniversity of Florida--wherever they may be--join me today in \ncongratulating Coach Steve Spurrier, his staff, and the 1996 Fightin' \nGator football team on winning the 1996 college football's national \nchampionship.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the \nnames of the Gator players, coaches, and staff along with their season \nrecord and the final polls with the Florida Gators in the top position \nas the national champions.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         University of Florida 1996 National Football Champions\n\n     Players\n     Tremayne Allen\n     Reidel Anthony\n     Ernie Badeaux\n     Tyrone Baker\n     James Bates\n     Ronnie Battle\n     Tim Beauchamp\n     Cheston Blackshear\n     Noah Brindise\n     Teako Brown\n     Pat Browning\n     Scott Bryan\n     Zuri Buchanan\n     Jayme Campbell\n     Cooper Carlisle\n     Derrick Chambers\n     Ed Chester\n     Willie Cohens\n     Mo Collins\n     Collins Cooper\n     Keith Council\n     Camerson Davis\n     Reggie Davis\n     Jason Dean\n     Ernie Dubose\n     Craig Dudley\n     Dwight Edge\n     Bart Edmiston\n     Jerome Evans\n     McDonald Ferguson\n     Rod Frazier\n     Tony George\n     Rod Graddy\n     Jacquez Green\n     Buck Gurley\n     Fred Hagberg\n     Mike Harris\n     Thomas Hewitt\n     Ike Hilliard\n     Todd Holland\n     Al Jackson\n     Denise Stevens\n     Tom Williams\n     Demetric Jackson\n     Terry Jackson\n     Doug Johnson\n     Ryan Kalich\n     Nafis Karim\n     Jevon Kearse\n     Trey Killingsworth\n     Erron Kinney\n     Sean Ladd\n     Demetrius Lewis\n     Anthone Lott\n     Eugene McCaslin\n     Xavier McCray\n     Reggie McGrew\n     Travis McGriff\n     Anthony Mitchell\n     Jeff Mitchell\n     Dwayne Mobley\n     Mike Moten\n     David Nabavi\n     Shawn Nunn\n     Daryl Owens\n     Alonza Pendergrass\n     Jason Perry\n     Mike Peterson\n     Zach Piller\n     Dock Pollard\n     Alan Rhine\n     Jamie Richardson\n     Larry Richart\n     Wyley Ritch\n     Willie Rodgers\n     Taras Ross\n     Johnny Rutledge\n     Brian Schottenheimer\n     Nick Schiralli\n     Shea Showers\n     Teddy Sims\n     Ian Skinner\n     Robby Stevenson\n     Deac Story\n     Fred Taylor\n     Matt Teague\n     Dwayne Thomas\n     Kavin Walton\n     Cedric Warren\n     Fred Weary\n     Elijah Williams\n     Scott Wise\n     Lawrence Wright\n     Danny Wuerffel\n     Jon Xynidis\n     Correy Yarbrough\n     Billy Young\n     Donnie Young\n     Michael Younkins\n     Zac Zedalis\n\n     President: Dr. John Lombardi\n\n     Director of Athletics: Jeremy Foley\n     Coaching Staff\n     Head Coach Steve Spurrier\n     Rod Broadway\n     Jim Collins\n     Dwayne Dixon\n     Carl Franks\n     Lawson Holland\n     Bob Sanders\n     Jimmy Ray Stephens\n     Bob Stoops\n\n[[Page S2734]]\n\n     Barry Wilson\n     Steve Spurrier, Jr.\n     Aubrey Hill\n     Strength & Conditioning\n     Jerry Schmidt\n     Rob Glass\n     Patt Moorer\n     Randy Popple\n     Support Staff\n     Norm Carlson\n     Dr. Keith Carodine\n     Bud Fernandez\n     Dave Houts\n     John Humenik\n     Dr. Pete Indelicato\n     Jeff Kamis\n     Betty Ling\n     Greg McGarity\n     Chris Partick\n     Nancy Sain\n     Tim Sain\n     Dr. Dick Shaara\n     Danny Sheldon\n     Jamie Speronis\n     Mike Wasik\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                              1996 SCHEDULE                             \n                                                                        \nAugust 31st...................

Mr. President, I rise today with my distinguished \ncolleague and fellow Florida Gator, Senator Connie Mack, to \ncongratulate this year's national champions and one of the top football \nprograms in the history of the Southeastern Conference, the University \nof Florida Gators. The Gators clinched their first national \nchampionship in football on January 2, 1997 when they defeated the \nFlorida State University Seminoles in the Louisiana Superdome in New \nOrleans. This year's triumph is indeed special and came on the heels of \na perfect nine win season in the Southeastern Conference, which is, as \nmy colleagues know, one of the toughest leagues in college football.\n  The Gators defeated the Florida State football team by a score of 52-\n20 in the Sugar Bowl on January 2nd. It was truly an impressive and \nmemorable display of leadership, dedication and teamwork by a college \nfootball team. This historic victory by the Gators not only brought \nwith it the team's first national championship, but the Gators also set \nan unprecedented number of bowl records including the largest margin of \nvictory against a No. 1 ranked team and the most points scored in a \nSugar Bowl game.\n  I would also like to commend Florida State's Head Coach, Bobby Bowden \nand his fine team of football players for their magnificent season and \nfor earning the right to play in the national championship. Although \nFlorida State didn't win the game on January 2nd, they had a great \nseason and they and their fans should be proud of their \naccomplishments.\n  The Gators managed to play its full complement of players during the \nseason and devastated their opponents by averaging: 46.6 points per \ngame, 333.9 yards passing per game and 503.9 yards total offense per \ngame. Among their numerous record breaking achievements on the football \nfield, the Gators' players also managed to bring home the Heisman \nTrophy, the Maxwell Award, the Unitas Award, the Davey O'Brien Award \nand the Thorpe Award to name just a few.\n  Under the extraordinary tutelage and superior leadership of Head \nCoach Steve Spurrier, the University of Florida football program rose \nabove all others on the field in 1996. Prior to his arrival in 1990, no \nFlorida Gator football team had captured an official Southeastern \nConference championship in 56 years even though the university was a \ncharter member of the league.\n  That trend changed in 1990, and Coach Spurrier's Gators have won at \nleast nine games in each season since his arrival. The 1996 Florida \nGators have the distinct honor of winning an unprecedented fourth \nconsecutive Southeastern Conference championship and their fifth since \nCoach Spurrier's arrival. Over the past seven seasons, Coach Spurrier \nand his talented staff of assistants have posted a remarkable record of \n73 wins on the football field, and in the always tough, Southeastern \nConference, the Gators have achieved a remarkable record of 53 wins. \nDuring his tenure, the Gators have lost exactly two games at Ben Hill \nGriffin Stadium, an 80,000 seat fortress that Spurrier has dubbed ``the \nswamp.''\n  It is clear that the University of Florida Gators have been winners \non the football field, but their winning doesn't stop there. \nAcademically, the Gators have excelled equally as well. They have \nachieved a tremendous graduation rate for an NCAA Division I football \nprogram, and 16 members of this year's team were named to the \nSoutheastern Conference's Academic Honor Roll. In addition to their \nawards for athletic achievement, Lawrence Wright and Danny Wuerffel \nboth received Scholar-Athlete Awards from the College Football \nAssociation.\n  Their achievements don't stop on the football field, however. The \nGators have also been major contributors to the greater Gainesville \ncommunity where they volunteer countless hours in support of worthy \ncauses like a literacy program, an international youth education \nprogram and support students with disabilities.\n  As a Gator and a graduate of the University of Florida, I am \nextremely proud of the 1996 Florida Gators and Head Coach Steve \nSpurrier for their outstanding achievements both on and off of the \nfootball field.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I take some pride in that my brother \ngraduated from the University of Florida. So I will join in those \ncongratulations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the resolution appear at this point \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 66) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 66\n\n       Whereas the University of Florida can trace its beginnings \n     to 1853 but was formally established by the State of Florida \n     when Florida Agricultural College merged with East Florida \n     Seminary, South Florida Military College, and St. Petersburg \n     Normal & Industrial School in 1905\n       Whereas the University of Florida adopted the colors of \n     orange and blue for its athletic team in 1905 and the \n     alligator as the school's mascot in 1908;\n       Whereas the origins of intercollegiate football at the \n     University of Florida can be\n\n[[Page S2735]]\n\n     traced back to 1901, when Dr. T.H.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 67 submitted earlier \ntoday by Senators Craig and Reid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 67) authorizing the printing of the \n     history manuscript of the Republican and Democratic Policy \n     Committees in Commemoration of their 50th Anniversaries.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to speak on ``A History of the \nSenate Republican Policy Committee, 1947-1997.''\n  Fifty years ago, the Senate established the Republican and Democratic \npolicy committees. At the end of the Second World War and at the \nbeginning of the cold war, U.S. Senators had concluded that this \nvenerable old institution needed modernization to enable it to handle \nthe increasingly complex foreign and domestic issues on its agenda, and \nto hold its own against an expanding presidential influence.\n  From 1945 to 1946, a joint committee chaired by Senator Robert M. \nLaFollette, Jr., a Republican from Wisconsin, and Representative Mike \nMonroney, an Oklahoma Democrat, investigated ways to reform the \nlegislative branch. The joint committee proposed creation of \nprofessional staffs for each standing committee and allowing Senators \nand Representatives to appoint administrative assistants. It also \nrecommended expansion of the Legislative Reference Service, now known \nas the Congressional Research Service. Those reforms were incorporated \ninto the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946.\n  One proposal that was not included in the act was the joint \ncommittee's recommendation that the Senate and House establish policy \ncommittees to assist the parties in promoting their legislative agenda. \nHouse Speaker Sam Rayburn feared that such policy committees \nmight threaten his authority and refused to support them. Although the \nidea was dropped from the Legislative Reorganization Act, it was \nshortly thereafter incorporated in an appropriations bill but \nauthorized policy committees for the Senate alone. Some time later the \nHouse also established policy committees.\n\n  Chief credit for the policy committees belongs to Ohio Republican \nSenator Robert A. Taft. As chairman of the Republican Steering \nCommittee, from 1944 to 1946, Taft firmly believed in thorough \npreparation and expertise. Although Republicans were then in the \nminority, Taft used the Steering Committee to plan and coordinate the \nparty's legislative program, rather that wait to react defensively \nagainst the initiatives of the President and the majority party. Under \nTaft the Steering Committee helped Republican Senators become better \ninformed on pending issues. His staff ran evening meetings that some \ncalled a night school for Senators. The Republican Steering Committee \nbecame the model for the proposed policy committees. Indeed, when the \npolicy committees were written into law, the Republican Conference \nsimply redesignated its Steering Committee as the Republican Policy \nCommittee. Chairman Taft and all of the other members of the Steering \nCommittee become the first members of the Policy Committee.\n  The Republican Policy Committee came into existence at the beginning \nof the 80th Congress, just as Republicans resumed the majority in the \nSenate and House. The 50th anniversary finds Republicans back in the \nmajority in both Houses of Congress. Over the years the Policy \nCommittee's services and functions have expanded considerably. Since \n1947, it has produced the very useful Record Vote Analyses. Since 1956, \nit has hosted working lunches each week for Republican Senators. Since \n1987, it has operated an in-house bulletin-board cable information \nchannel to keep Senators and their staffs apprised of Senate floor \nactivities and the upcoming agenda. In 1995, the Policy Committee stood \namong the first Senate offices to develop a home page on the Internet's \nWorld Wide Web, to provide information inside and outside the Senate on \nits publications, and to share information on key Republican policies.\n  The Policy Committee staff prepares both brief and indepth reports on \nthe major issues facing the Senate. The Policy Committee conducts \nseminars for new legislative staff members, and holds issue forums and \nroundtable discussions for Senators. It also hosts regular meetings for \nstaff directors, legislative directors, and press secretaries.\n  During its first 50 years, the Republican Policy Committee grew into \na thriving operation staffed by a variety of experts. Working directly \nwith the\n\n[[Page S2736]]\n\nSenators, and educating the journalists who report on them, the Policy \nCommittee has assisted Republican Senators in setting policy, enacting \nlegislation, and getting their message out. That is an accomplishment \nentirely consistent with the goals that Robert Taft set in founding the \nRepublican Policy Committee. The story of how those goals were achieved \nis contained in the history of the Policy Committee that was prepared \nby the Senate Historical Office, and will now be available for \nSenators, staff, students, and the general public.\n  I understand that the Democratic Policy Committee is considering a \ncompanion publication, and I would like to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate its chairman, Senator Tom Daschle, and cochairman, Senator \nHarry Reid, on our mutual 50th anniversary.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the resolution appear at \nthis point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
