Mr. President, Senator Coverdell may well come to the \nfloor during this period. I hope he does. I will be happy to defer, and \nyield parts of my time to him as well.\n  Mr. President, 1 week ago I joined with Senator Coverdell and Senator \nHelms to introduce resolutions of disapproval, to overturn the \nPresident's decision to certify Mexico for antidrug cooperation.\n  Last week I went home and I read the State Department's Statement of \nExplanation, which is just 1\\1/2\\ pages.\n  I must say, I read this document with disbelief. At best, this \ndocument--which purports to make the case for Mexico's certification--\nis a fairy tale. At worst, it is a complete whitewash. Today, I would \nlike to take some time and go over parts of it, and indicate my \nthoughts on some of the subjects mentioned and refute some of the \nclaims.\n  Let me begin by saying that section 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act \nrequires the President to certify that Mexico has ``cooperated fully \nwith the United States, or taken adequate steps on its own'' to combat \ndrug trafficking. Despite the best intentions of President Zedillo and \nthe best efforts of the State Department to put a pretty face on the \nsituation, the Department's Statement of Explanation, I believe, defies \ncredibility.\n  The State Department claims that ``The Government of Mexico's 1996 \ncounterdrug effort produced encouraging results and notable progress in \nbilateral cooperation.'' The facts tell a different story.\n  Let me begin with drug seizures:\n  The State Department's Statement of Explanation indicates that ``Drug \nseizures and arrests increased in 1996.''\n\n[[Page S2036]]\n\n While this is technically true--yes, there was a slight increase in \n1996 in both drug seizures and arrests of drug traffickers--that is \nonly because the 1995 levels were so dismal. A larger look of Mexico's \nrecord of drug seizures, going back just a few years to 1992, gives a \nvery different perspective.\n  The 23.6 metric tons of cocaine seized by Mexico, while slightly \nhigher than in 1995, is just about half of what was seized in 1993. So, \nyou see, in 1993 they seized 46.2 metric tons of cocaine. Look how it \nhas dropped off and leveled off since then.\n  Second, drug arrests did increase modestly in 1996 over 1995. But \nlook back a few years and it tells a more compelling picture. In 1992 \nyou had 27,369 drug arrests. In 1996 you had 11,038. That is not a \nstepped-up effort, it is a stepped-down effort. So, after a precipitous \ndrop, by more than 50 percent, a barely discernible 5- or 10-percent \nincrease, in my view, is not improvement. They are not encouraging \nresults and there is not notable progress.\n  Today, Mexico is the transit station for 70 percent of the cocaine, a \nquarter of the heroin, 80 percent of the marijuana, and 90 percent of \nthe ephedrine used to make methamphetamine, entering the United States.\n  These statistics reflect, I believe, more drugs flowing into our \ncities and our communities. How do we know this now? Just look at some \nof the street prices.\n  According to the California Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement, in 1993, \nwhen Mexican cocaine seizures were near their peak, a kilo of cocaine \nsold on the streets of Los Angeles for $21,000. Today, that same kilo \nof cocaine averages $16,500, and I am told that in places you can get \nit for $14,000 a kilo.\n  You can see how these prices have dropped. The drop is even more \ndramatic if you look at black tar heroin, which the DEA says is nearly \nthe exclusive province of Mexican family-operated cartels, based in \nMichoacan. The price per ounce has dropped from $1,200 in 1993 to $400 \ntoday.\n  So today, the street price of black tar heroin has dropped to one-\nthird of its price 4 years ago.\n  Unfortunately, demand remains high, so when the prices drop, the \nobvious conclusion is that you have more supply. The falling price can \nbe attributed to increases in the amounts of cocaine and heroin flowing \nacross our southern border. I hardly consider this to be evidence of \n``encouraging results and notable progress.''\n  When the street prices begin to climb, then I, for one, will begin to \nbelieve that the supply is being cut.\n  So street prices are dropping despite the fact that stepped up \nenforcement on the U.S. side of the border has resulted in increased \nseizures.\n  U.S. border agents at the McAllen, TX, border station seized 176,000 \npounds of marijuana in 1996, 20 percent more than in 1993. But the \nburden of combating the increased drug shipments falls \ndisproportionately on United States border agents because Mexico does \nlittle to enforce the border.\n  United States Customs and Border Patrol officials have said publicly \nthat Mexican traffickers are today going to extraordinary lengths to \nmove their products. They are constructing secret compartments in 18-\nwheelers. They are saturating areas with hundreds of mules carrying \nbackpacks with 40 kilos of marijuana each, and even sacrificing large \nloads of marijuana at the border to allow more valuable shipments of \ncocaine and heroin to slip through behind them. And they have begun to \nuse sea lanes in much greater proportion.\n  For the State Department to state that there has been improved \nperformance by Mexico in intercepting drugs at the border is \nincomprehensible to me. Low seizure figures, low arrest figures, \nfalling street prices in our cities--these are hardly indications of \nfull cooperation by Mexican authorities in combating drug trafficking.\n  Let me speak about the cartels in Mexico. The State Department's \nStatement of Explanation touts the arrests of ``several major drug \ntraffickers,'' including Juan Garcia Abrego, leader of the Gulf cartel, \nJose Luis Pereira Salas, linked to the Juarez and Colombian Cali \ncartel, and Manuel Rodriguez Lopez, linked to a minor operation called \nthe Castrillon maritime smuggling organization.\n  But who the Mexicans fail to capture tells a much more important \nstory. In fact, the State Department admits as much when it says, ``the \nstrongest groups, such as the Juarez and Tijuana cartels, have yet to \nbe effectively confronted.''\n  Let me repeat that: ``the strongest groups * * * have yet to be \neffectively confronted.''\n  So here is the State Department explaining to us that Mexico has \nfully cooperated with the United States, and yet telling us in the same \nbreath that Mexico has taken no serious action against the \norganizations and individuals most responsible for the bulk of the drug \ntrafficking.\n  This is also not how United States drug enforcement officials \ndescribe the efforts in Mexico. Let me share with my colleagues what \nour own drug enforcement officials say about how fully Mexico is \ncooperating in antidrug efforts.\n  DEA administrator, Thomas Constantine, has described the Mexican drug \ncartels, in a statement he made to a House committee the week before \nlast, as ``the leading organized crime organizations in the Western \nHemisphere, and for some reason,'' he continues, ``they seem to be \noperating with impunity.''\n  His testimony is a chilling account of the extensive operations of \nthe major Mexican drug cartels and how corruption within Mexican law \nenforcement agencies has allowed the cartels to conduct their deadly \ntrade with virtual impunity. He also described how the Mexican drug \ncartels are expanding their criminal reach into the United States.\n  As we debate whether or not to disapprove of Mexico's certification, \nI hope all of my colleagues will take the time to read Mr. \nConstantine's testimony. It makes the case better than anything I have \nseen that Mexico's efforts have, in fact, not met the standard for \ncertification.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Constantine's \ntestimony be printed in the Record after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I understand the Government Printing \nOffice estimates that it will cost $1,152 to print this testimony in \nthe Record. I also ask unanimous consent that the Government Printing \nOffice estimate be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I do this, Mr. President, because I think this is \ntestimony that is crucial to a decision that will shortly be before the \nSenate. This is our No. 1 drug enforcement agency in the United States, \nand I think it is important that the testimony of the head of that \nagency be read by Members considering this issue.\n  Perhaps the most powerful of all cartels today is the Amado Carrillo-\nFuentes organization, also known as the Juarez cartel. This \norganization operates out of Rancho Hacienda de la Natividad today, \nnear Cuernavaca, Morelos, outside of Mexico City. It runs multi-ton \nquantities of Colombian cocaine toward Mexican distribution sites and \nthen into the United States.\n  The organization runs these drug trafficking operations in Chihuahua, \nMexico City, Mayarit, Nuevo Leon, Oaxaca, Sinaloa, Sonora, Jalisco, \nBaja, CA, Tamulipas, Veracruz, and Zacatecas, among others.\n  Despite the ``encouraging results and notable progress'' cited by the \nState Department, the Juarez cartel is today as strong as it has ever \nbeen. Worse, it is spreading its tentacles into the United States, and \nthis concerns me deeply. One law enforcement official told me it \ncontrols a majority of the cocaine in Los Angeles.\n  Operations linked to the Amado Carrillo-Fuentes organization have \ntoday been identified in the Texas cities of El Paso, Houston, McAllen, \nMidland, Odessa and San Antonio, and in California's major cities such \nas Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento; also, in Nevada's major city, \nLas Vegas; Illinois' major city, Chicago; the major city in the State \nof New York, New York City; and Florida's major city, Miami.\n  Do we know who the leaders of this cartel are? Yes, we do, and so do \nthe\n\n[[Page S2037]]\n\nMexican authorities. Amado Carrillo-Fuentes heads the organization and \ncontrols the cocaine, marijuana and heroin transportation to the United \nStates. His brother, Vincente Carrillo-Fuentes, is primarily \nresponsible for the group's marijuana trafficking operation.\n  These men are considered by President Zedillo to be Mexico's primary \nnational security threat. Amado Carrillo-Fuentes has been indicted in \nFlorida and in Texas on heroin and cocaine charges. Yet, he has never \nbeen tried in Mexico, nor has an extradition request for crimes \ncommitted in the United States been honored.\n  Have the Mexican authorities taken any action whatsoever that has \nhampered the operations of the Amado Carrillo-Fuentes organization? The \nanswer to date is no. In fact, there is ample evidence to show that the \nCarrillo-Fuentes organization has federal police and government \nofficials on their payroll, including the former head of the \ncounternarcotics effort in Mexico, General Gutierrez, who was arrested \n3 weeks ago.\n\n  Just a few days ago, Mexico did try to arrest Mr. Carrillo-Fuentes. \nLet me read from the Los Angeles Times, dated Saturday, March 8:\n\n       In an apparently stepped-up search for alleged drug lord \n     Amado Carrillo Fuentes, more than 100 troops backed by light \n     tanks commandeered a luxury hotel in Guadalajara late \n     Thursday night. . . .\n       Carlton Hotel manager Carlos Hodria said Friday that about \n     150 soldiers arrived unannounced in trucks and tanks and that \n     the operation lasted about 40 minutes, jarring most of the \n     hotel's personnel and 296 guests. He quoted military officers \n     as saying they were ``searching for a person.''\n\n  Obviously, when you roll tanks up to a hotel, whomever you are \nlooking for is going to know that and be long gone. To my knowledge, no \narrests were made.\n  The other major cartel at work in Mexico is the Arellano-Felix \norganization, also known as the Tijuana cartel. This organization \ntransports multiton quantities of cocaine and marijuana and large \nquantities of heroin and methamphetamine into the United States where \nit is distributed by agents employed by the cartel in this country.\n  The cartel has its base of operations in Tijuana, but it is active in \nSinaloa, Jalisco, Michoacan, Chiapas, Baja California Norte and Baja \nCalifornia Sur. It is of particular concern to me because Southern \nCalifornia is the primary entry point of most of the drugs trafficked \nby this organization.\n  The Arellano-Felix organization has spread its influence deep inside \nAmerican cities, often recruiting street gangs to do its distribution \nand enforcement work. Orders are given to these agents in U.S. cities \ndirectly from Tijuana through sophisticated telecommunications \nnetworks.\n  Do we know who the leaders of the Arellano-Felix organization are? \nAgain, we do, and so do the Mexican authorities.\n  Alberto Benjamin Arellano-Felix is the leader of the organization and \nhas overall responsibility for management of the cartel's drug-\ntrafficking operations.\n  His brother, Ramon Eduardo Arellano-Felix, is responsible for the \ngroup's security operations, which include well-trained paramilitary-\nstyle forces who assassinate rivals and traitors.\n  Has any action been taken by the Mexican authorities to rein in the \noperations of the Arellano-Felix organization? Have there been any \narrests of its senior leaders?\n  No, the State Department informs us. This cartel has ``yet to be \neffectively confronted.'' Is this an example of the ``encouraging \nresults and notable progress'' cited by the State Department?\n  The Amado Carrillo-Fuentes cartel and the Arellano-Felix cartel, to \nthe best of my knowledge, are operating with absolute impunity. But \neven the smaller cartels are hardly touched by Mexican authorities.\n  I think two recent incidents illustrate just what sort of cooperation \nthe United States is receiving from Mexico with respect to the cartels.\n  On February 26 of this year, the Washington Post published an hour-\nlong interview--hour-long interview--with Miguel Angel Caro Quintero, \nleader of the Sonora cartel, who is under indictment in the United \nStates for crimes committed in the United States and for whom the \nUnited States has requested extradition.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as he told the Post:\n\n       I go to the banks, offices, just like any Mexican. Every \n     day I pass by roadblocks, police, soldiers, and there are no \n     problems. I'm in the streets all the time. How can they not \n     find me? Because they're not looking for me.\n  According to law enforcement, the Sonora cartel cultivates, smuggles, \nand distributes heroin and marijuana to the United States, as well as \ntransporting Colombian cocaine. It has operations reaching into \nArizona, Texas, New Mexico, California, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, \nNebraska, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Louisiana.\n  The Washington Post found him, but the Mexican police, up to the last \nfew days, were not even looking for him. Perhaps the State Department \nwould explain how this qualifies as ``full cooperation'' with the \nUnited States. I do not see it.\n  The other incident was a typical February story. I sometimes wish \nFebruary would last all year round because the pressure of the March 1 \ncertification decision seems to produce all kinds of results that we \nare unable to get the rest of the year, but on March 2, frequently it \nis business as usual.\n  Just hours before the President's decision on certification was to be \nmade public, the Mexican Government announced with great fanfare the \narrest of Humberto Garcia Abrego, a leader of the Gulf cartel.\n  Leave aside the question of why Mexican authorities were unable to \narrest this man the rest of the year but miraculously found him on \nFebruary 27. What happened next is critical to the integrity of the \neffort.\n  Only hours after the decision to certify Mexico was announced, \nHumberto Garcia Abrego simply walked out of custody. The Mexican \nAttorney General's office called his release ``inexplicable.'' You \ncould not write a script that would illustrate our problem with \nMexico's inability to deal with the cartels any better than this \nincident.\n  Yet, the State Department assures us that there have been \n``encouraging results and notable progress.'' Not with respect to the \ncartels. I sincerely do not believe that the cartels' operations have \nbeen altered, reduced or impeded at all.\n  Those officials whom the cartels cannot buy they kill.\n  The cartels have unleashed a reign of terror on honest Mexican law \nenforcement officials. The DEA reports that 12 prosecutors and law \nenforcement officers have been assassinated in Mexico in just the last \nyear alone, most of them in connection with the Tijuana cartel.\n  Let's start with an incident on February 22, 1996, just about a year \nago. Approximately 40 Juarez municipal police opened fire on agents \nfrom the Mexican Attorney General's office, resulting in the death of \none commandante and one agent. DEA suspects the local police were \nproviding protection for drug traffickers.\n  On February 23, 1996, Sergio Armanda Silva, a former operations chief \nof the Baja federal police, was assassinated.\n  On April 17, 1996, Mexico City's previous top prosecutor, Arturo \nOchoa Palacios, was gunned down while jogging.\n  May 1996, Mexico City's top prosecutor, Sergio Moreno Perez, was \nkidnapped with his adult son in Michoacan state. Their bodies were \nlater discovered in a car in Mexico City's suburbs.\n  June 27, 1996, drug agency commandante Daniel Beruben-Jaime was \nassassinated in Jalisco.\n  July 19, 1996, Isaac Sanchez Perez, the former Baja federal police \ncommander, was shot in the back of the head and killed in Mexico City.\n  August 17, 1996, Tijuana prosecutor Jesus Romero Magana was gunned \ndown outside his home. He was investigating the Arellano-Felix \norganization.\n  September 14, 1996, Baja federal police commander Ernesto Ibarra \nSantes, two of his bodyguards and a cab driver were machine-gunned down \nin Mexico city.\n\n[[Page S2038]]\n\n  Ibarra had vowed to go after the Arellano Felix brothers and to purge \nthe federal police ranks of any corrupt federal agents who stood in his \nway. He held his post for 28 days.\n  September 21, the body of Hector Gonzalez-Baecenas, assistant to \nGarcia Vargas, was found in the trunk of another car. Also tortured.\n  September 23, 1996, the body of 43-year-old Jorge Garcia Vargas, \nTijuana district chief of the Federal antinarcotics agency was found in \nthe trunk of a car along with the body of Miguel Angel Silva Caballero, \na former Federal police commander. Both showed signs of torture.\n  November 3, 1996, a former prosecutor named Martin Ramirez-Alvarez \nwas murdered in Tijuana. His wife reported that an unknown number of \nindividuals stopped them in a vehicle utilizing red and blue police \nstrobe lights. They dragged Ramirez-Alvarez out of the vehicle and shot \nhim point blank six times. It is believed the Arellano-Felix \norganization is responsible for the assassination.\n  On January 3, 1997, 27-year-old State Prosecutor Hodin Gutierrez-Rico \nwas assassinated in front of his wife and children at his residence in \nTijuana. Gutierrez-Rico was investigating the murder of a Tijuana \nmunicipal police chief and Presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. \nMore than 120 spent shells were found on the ground, and his body was \ndeliberately run over several times by a van.\n  And so it goes. These murders are, to me, the most compelling because \ntheir message is undeniable: ``Get too close, and you are dead.'' And \nnot one of these cases has been solved to date. This is why the \ncorruption of the military general placed in charge of the \ncounternarcotics effort is so paralyzing. The question remains: If the \nhighest military man can be corrupted, then who is left?\n  But Mexico's failure to combat the cartels effectively is having an \nalarming spillover effect into American cities. Robert Walsh, special \nagent in charge of the San Diego office of the FBI told my office that \nall of the major Mexican cartels have members of United States gangs \nworking for them.\n  These agents distribute the drugs shipped in by the cartels and ship \nthe cash generated from drug sales back to Mexico. They also carry out \nrevenge murders on orders from Tijuana or Juarez.\n  Prof. Peter Lupsha of the University of New Mexico, who has studied \nthe cartels for decades, says, ``I don't believe anyone in La Cosa \nNostra could order a murder 2,000 miles away and expect it to be \ncarried out. Carillo-Fuentes can do that and much more.''\n  That is why the State Department's utter denial that the problem is \ngetting worse is so dangerous. As much as these cartels are destroying \nMexico, their reach is expanding. They have agents in many of our large \nand mid-size cities. Their drugs are reaching our children. The gangs \nthey hire kill ruthlessly to protect their turf in our cities.\n  It is no exaggeration to say that the lives of hundreds, if not \nthousands, of Americans are literally at stake in the war against the \ncartels. And the State Department's refusal to face up to facts does \nnot protect a single child from the bullets of a drug-running gang or a \ndriveby shooter.\n  Let me speak about money laundering.\n  The next item of progress in the State Department's statement of \nexplanation is that ``the Mexican Congress passed two critical pieces \nof legislation which have armed the Government of Mexico with a whole \nnew arsenal of weapons to use to combat money laundering, chemical \ndiversion, and organized crime.''\n  Let us see how good the new money-laundering law is.\n  It is true that in May 1996, the Mexican Congress adopted a law that \nfor the first time specifically identified money laundering as a \ncriminal act. At that time, Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz Martinez \ncommitted to develop the regulations that would implement this law by \nJanuary 1997.\n  The draft of these regulations, which would require banks and other \ninstitutions to report suspicious transactions of currency, were due in \nJanuary. Well, it is now March and the regulations have not been \nforthcoming.\n  No doubt, the implementation date of these regulations, now scheduled \nfor June 1997, will slide, as will the issuance of a second set of \nregulations, governing the reporting of large-scale transactions.\n  These regulations are essential to combating money laundering. \nReporting requirements discourage would-be money launderers, tip off \nlaw enforcement officials to unlawful activity, and create a paper \ntrail that can be a powerful investigative tool.\n  But until Finance Minister Ortiz issues the regulations and they are \nimplemented, it is business as usual. To date, not a single Mexican \nbank or exchange house has been forced to alter its operations.\n  And until the regulations have been issued, we have no real way of \nevaluating the impact of the law. Any law is only as good as its \nimplementation. It is a giant leap of faith by the State Department to \ncite the passage of a money-laundering law as a sign of major progress \nwhen, to date, it has been neither implemented nor enforced.\n  There are some key questions that must be answered:\n\n  Will the regulations prevent bank employees or ministry staff from \ntipping off drug cartels about investigations?\n  Second, will the regulations provide immunity for employees who \nreport a suspicious transaction and are acting in good faith? If not, \nthey may be reluctant to report transactions as required, or killed if \nthey do.\n  Third, will the regulations contain exemptions for any industries? \nThey should not.\n  In addition, there is a major weakness in the new law in that it does \nnot provide for sanctions against banks and financial institutions that \nfail to comply with reporting requirements. Without such sanctions, \nMexico's money-laundering laws will remain woefully inadequate.\n  Now, there is a report today in the Financial Times of London that \nMexico will introduce its antilaundering regulations this week. We \nshall see. Those regulations will need to be evaluated. But why has it \ntaken Mexico until mid-March, and a crisis over certification, to get \nto this point? That is not a sign of a fully cooperating country.\n\n  Meanwhile, massive money laundering continues in Mexico unabated. And \nit is spilling across the southwest border.\n  California State Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement Chief George Doane \ntestified last March that ``at a money counting and shipping house in \nthe Los Angeles area, agents located $6 million in cash and financial \nrecords in a residence occupied by three Hispanic nationals, indicating \nthat $75 million had been counted, packaged, and shipped from the \nresidence via a commercial bus company to Mexico.''\n  An analysis done by the DEA of all transactions between the San \nAntonio Federal Reserve and area depository institutions showed a \ncurrency surplus of $2.96 billion in 1995--a clear sign that cartels \nhave successfully laundered money to their final destination in Mexico.\n  The DEA's Donnie Marshall told Congress in September that a DEA \ninvestigation known as Zorro II in the Los Angeles area ``resulted in \nthe arrests of 156 people, the seizure of approximately 5,600 kilograms \nof cocaine, and over $17 million in U.S. currency. The majority of this \n$17 million was seized as it was being prepared for shipment to Mexico \nor seized from vehicles that were en route to Mexico.''\n  Marshall also described cambios, or exchange houses outside the \nbanking system, located along the borders of Texas and California, \nwhich are a significant factor in the laundering of drug proceeds where \nMexican traffickers intermingle cash derived from drug sales with \nlegitimate exchange business. My staff recently visited 22 of these \nexchange houses.\n  So the State Department sees encouraging results and notable progress \nin the area of money laundering as well. I say that today there is no \neffective effort to deter the laundering of drug money anywhere in \nMexico.\n\n\n                               Corruption\n\n  The State Department's statement of explanation sees progress even \nwhere--by its own admission--none exists. This is how the Department \ndescribes Mexico's so-called progress on combating corruption:\n\n\n[[Page S2039]]\n\n\n       In an effort to confront widespread corruption within the \n     nation's law enforcement agencies, former Attorney General \n     Lozano dismissed over 1,250 federal police officers and \n     technical personnel for corruption or incompetence, although \n     some have been rehired, and the Government of Mexico indicted \n     two former senior Government officials and a current \n     Undersecretary of Tourism.\n\n  Now, the sentence, in a sense, refutes itself. When you say that some \nhave been rehired, of course, if they were innocent, we would want them \nto be rehired. But if they were guilty, we would want them to be \nprosecuted. So let's look and see what happened.\n  According to the DEA, of the 1,250 officers dismissed for corruption, \nnot a single one was successfully prosecuted--not one.\n  The rash of murders of prosecutors and law enforcement officers in \nTijuana is a case in point. These assassinations have been made \npossible in large part because the Tijuana police have been so \nthoroughly corrupted by the Arellano-Felix organization.\n  According to the Los Angeles Times on March 3, 1997, court papers \nrecently filed in United States district court by the Mexican \nGovernment in an extradition case contain testimony to the effect \nthat--and let me remind you that this is from court papers submitted by \nthe Mexican Government--``the state attorney general and almost 90 \npercent of the law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges in \nTijuana and the State of Baja California . . . are on the payroll'' of \nthe Arellano-Felix organization.\n  In the same San Diego court documents, a former presidential guard, \narmy lieutenant Gerardo Cruz Pacheco, told how he recruited soldiers to \nunload drug shipments and helped Tijuana cartel gunmen assassinate Baja \nfederal police commander Ernesto Ibarra Santes in September.\n  The Federal judicial police have been so corrupted by the cartels \nthat it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between them and the \ncriminals. That is why some were encouraged by the prospect of \nincreased participation of the Mexican military, which has not been so \ntainted by corruption, in the anti-drug effort.\n  But that's why the startling revelation about Gen. Jesus Gutierrez \nRebollo, the head of the National Institute to Combat Drugs--Mexico's \ntop counternarcotics official--who is a 42-year veteran of the armed \nforces, has cast grave doubts upon that hope.\n  When the Mexican Army planned a raid of the wedding of the sister of \nAmado Carrillo-Fuentes, the drug lord had been tipped off in advance, \nsome say by General Gutierrez himself. As a result, he escaped arrest \nby leaving early or not attending. But Mexican troops found federal \npolice providing protection for drug traffickers at the wedding.\n  And most concering to me is that corruption is spreading rapidly \nacross the border into the United States. For example:\n  In Calexico, CA, former INS inspector Richard Felix admitted to FBI \nagents that he pocketed up to $500,000 in bribes for permitting loads \nof cocaine and marijuana to pass uninspected through his port of entry \nlane.\n  In El Paso, former Customs and INS inspector Jose Trinidad Carrillo \ngave drug traffickers a price list for his help in getting drugs \nthrough his border-entry lane: $10,000 per car, or $40 per pound of \nmarijuana and $250 per pound of cocaine.\n  Stories of officials of U.S. border towns being bribed are now \nsurfacing. Some of this I heard myself in the testimony of a border \nrancher to the Judiciary Committee last year.\n  President Zedillo appears to be trying his best to fight drug \ntrafficking, and he has honest people on his side, like Elvira Ruiz, \none of the few female police chiefs in Baja, whose life has been \nconsistently threatened by the cartels.\n  But the efforts of these people are unfortunately being completely \noverwhelmed by the uncontrollable tide of corruption.\n  The arrest of General Gutierrez has been cited by the administration \nas evidence of the Mexican Government's commitment to fight corruption. \nBut the way in which this situation was handled raises serious \nquestions about Mexico's willingness to cooperate with the United \nStates.\n  On February 6 of this year, Defense Secretary Enrique Cervantes \nAguirre confronted General Gutierrez, asking him to explain how he came \nto live in an apartment that was beyond the means of his salary. The \ngeneral began suffering a heart attack and was placed in the hospital. \nAfter 12 days of investigating, on February 18, Defense Secretary \nCervantes had Gutierrez placed under arrest for accepting bribes from \nthe Carrillo-Fuentes cartel.\n  Yet during that entire 12-day period, the Mexican Government gave no \nindication to the United States that it suspected that its top drug \nofficial was corrupt. In that time, U.S. officials continued regular \ncontacts with Gutierrez' National Institute to Combat Drugs, not \nknowing that its operations were directed by a man in the pocket of \ndrug kingpins.\n  General Gutierrez had been in Washington shortly before he was first \nquestioned about his spending habits. He met with our drug czar, Gen. \nBarry McCaffrey, who called him a man of absolute, unquestioned \nintegrity. Why would Mexico allow Gutierrez to visit Washington when he \nwas suspected of corruption, and why--at the least--would they not \nalert the United States side?\n  Our own drug enforcement officials have been forced to conduct damage \nassessments to determine how much and what kind of intelligence was \nprovided to the general, and perhaps passed right onto the Amado \nCarrillo-Fuentes. We are left to worry that the lives of our agents in \nthe field and our informants have been placed in jeopardy.\n  So we can praise the Mexican Government for arresting Gutierrez, but \ntheir delay in notifying the United States of their suspicions about \nthe general begs an important question: Is this a sign of the full \ncooperation for which Mexico has just been certified?\n\n\n                 Cooperation with U.S. Law Enforcement\n\n  The State Department's statement of explanation then goes on to \ndescribe the extensive cooperation that has taken place between the \nMexican and United States Governments:\n\n       The United States and Mexico established the High-Level \n     Contact Group on Narcotics Control (HLCG) to explore joint \n     solutions to the shared drug threat and to coordinate \n     bilateral anti-drug efforts. The HLCG met three times during \n     1996 and its technical working groups met throughout the \n     year. Under the aegis of the HLCG, the two governments \n     developed a joint assessment of the narcotics threat posed to \n     both countries which will be used as the basis for a joint \n     counter-drug strategy.\n\n  All the high-level meetings in the world don't amount to a hill of \nbeans unless there is cooperation and coordination on the ground \nbetween law enforcement agencies of the two sides.\n  Once again, the State Department's assertion that these meetings are \na sign of real progress misses the point. Whether or not our leaders \ncan work together is less important than whether our cops can work \ntogether.\n  And plainly, at the moment, they cannot. Given the staggering level \nof corruption in the Mexican police, it is no wonder that DEA \nAdministrator Constantine told the House Committee last week: ``In \nshort, there is not one single law enforcement institution in Mexico \nwith whom DEA has an entirely trusting relationship.''\n  That statement by itself should call into question Mexico's \nqualification to be certified. It is echoed by law enforcement agents \non the ground:\n  On March 7, 1997, Ed Ladd, president of the California Narcotics \nOfficers' Association, issued a statement in which he announced that \nthe association's board had voted unanimously to support congressional \nefforts to overturn the decision to certify Mexico. This vote, Mr. Ladd \nsaid, ``is based on our longstanding experience with the widespread \ncorruption and lack of cooperation shown by the Mexican government.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text the \nstatement of Ed Ladd, president of the California Narcotic Officers' \nAssociation, be included in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, is it so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 4.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. T.J. Bonner, president of the National Border Patrol \nCouncil, the union which represents nearly 5,000 Border Patrol agents, \ntold my staff on March 4, 1997:\n\n       The level of trust for Mexican authorities is almost non-\n     existent. He said that ``the lack of cooperation includes \n     failure to provide assistance, aiding and abetting criminal\n\n[[Page S2040]]\n\n     activity, and even acts of aggression against Border Patrol \n     Agents.'' He described U.S. agents observing Mexican officers \n     who were clearly escorting aliens and drug smugglers.\n\n  The police chief of El Centro, CA, Harold Carter, told my staff that \nhis officers are very leery of who they can trust in Mexico.\n  These are the views of our law enforcement officers. But the question \nof whether Mexico is fully cooperating with the United States can also \nbe easily answered by looking at Mexico's policies on working with DEA \nagents. In this area, there have been three significant failings.\n  One was the failure of the Mexican Government--the same one that has \njust been certified as fully cooperating--to adequately fund and staff \nthe binational border task forces that had been agreed upon by the high \nlevel contact group.\n  What good are high-level meetings that produce agreements on \ncooperation if one side then fails to live up to its end of the \nagreement?\n  Second, Mexico has hampered the ability of the United States military \nto contribute to interdiction efforts. Mexico refuses to allow United \nStates Navy ships on patrol for drug smugglers in the Pacific to put \ninto Mexican ports to refuel without 30 days notice--and without paying \ncash. As the cartels increasingly turn to sea-routes to smuggle their \ndrugs, this policy seriously hampers our ability to stop them.\n  Also, overflights by U.S. reconnaissance aircraft are still under \nnegotiation. These flights would enhance the ability of both sides to \nfind and disrupt drug shipments.\n  The third major failing has been Mexico's refusal to allow United \nStates drug enforcement agents to carry sidearms to protect themselves \nwhile on the Mexican side of the border. As a result, Mr. Constantine \nhad no choice but to suspend operations in which DEA agents cross the \nborder, because they cannot protect themselves.\n  In the last several days, there has been a flurry of meetings between \nAmerican and Mexican officials. Did the United States gain any \nconcessions? Well, Mexican officials were quoted as saying that ``the \nrules have stayed exactly where they are''--which means no sidearms. \nThere you have it. Full cooperation.\n\n\n                              Extraditions\n\n  The State Department's statement of explanation makes another \nastonishing claim on the subject of extraditions. It says:\n\n       The Government of Mexico established the important \n     precedent of extraditing Mexican nationals to the United \n     States under the provision of Mexico's extradition law \n     permitting this in ``exceptional circumstances.''\n\n  Here is my understanding of the actual facts:\n  First, Mexico says it has changed its policy to allow the extradition \nof Mexican nationals to the United States. Of course, we are talking \nabout Mexican nationals who are wanted for crimes committed here in the \nUnited States.\n  Second, to my knowledge, the Mexican government has sent three \nMexican nationals to the United States. One was Juan Garcia Abrego, \nhead of the gulf cartel, but he was expelled, not extradited, because \nhe held American as well as Mexican citizenship. The other two were for \nmurder and sexual abuse, not for drug charges.\n  Third, to date, Mexico has never--never--extradited a single Mexican \nnational to the United States on drug-related charges. That, I believe, \nis a fact.\n  Now the Mexican Government says, and the State Department apparently \nbelieves, that Mexico is prepared to extradite Mexican nationals on \ndrug charges in ``special circumstances.''\n  If this is truly a change of policy on the part of Mexico, let us see \nresults. There are 52 outstanding extradition requests for Mexican \nnationals wanted on drug charges. Mexico should honor these requests \nnow.\n  It should be pointed out that these extradition requests are for \ncrimes committed in this country. How can a good friend, ally, and \nneighbor deny extradition of 52 people wanted for drug-related crimes \ncommitted here, and the statement still be made that they are fully \ncooperating in our antidrug efforts?\n  A good place for Mexico to start would be with Francisco Arellano-\nFelix of the Tijuana cartel, who is currently in custody in a Mexican \nprison and wanted on narcotics charges here in the United States. \nAnother good start would be Miguel Caro Quintero, who walks the streets \nof Sonora without fear of arrest and grants interviews with the \nWashington Post. He has four indictments pending against him in the \nUnited States.\n  Mexican nationals wanted on drug charges is clearly the highest \npriority. These include many of the drug kingpins. But there are other \nsensitive cases as well that need to be resolved.\n  John Riley Henrique was indicted by a Federal grand jury in the \neastern district of California for trafficking at least 150 kilograms \nof cocaine from Mexico to the United States. Henrique, an American \ncitizen, is thought to be connected with Miguel Angel Felix Guillardo, \nthe mastermind of the 1985 murder of DEA Agent Enrique Camarena.\n  Law enforcement sources told my office that John Riley Henrique was \ndetained by Mexican law enforcement and then suddenly released without \nwarning. He is still believed to be in Mexico. The Mexican authorities \nshould find him, apprehend him, and extradite him.\n  T.J. Bonner of the National Border Patrol Council testified before \nthe Senate Banking Committee on March 28, 1996, about the tragic fatal \nshooting on January 19, 1996, of a Border Patrol agent, our agent, \nJefferson Barr. Agent Barr was killed while intercepting a group of \nmarijuana smugglers along the border near Eagle Pass, TX.\n  Before he died, Agent Barr wounded one of his assailants. The FBI \ninterviewed the suspect, a Mexican national, in a Mexican hospital, and \nthe United States later charged him with murder and sought his \nextradition. The Government of Mexico sentenced the individual to 10 \nyears in prison on a narcotics-related charge but has refused to \nextradite him.\n  For the State Department to say that Mexico is fully cooperating on \nthe issue of extraditions under these circumstances dishonors the \nmemory of Agent Jefferson Barr.\n  America's law enforcement officers know how serious the problem is. I \nwould like to quote from a March 2, 1997, press release put out by the \nNational Border Patrol Council, local 1613, of San Diego. It reads:\n\n       The certification of Mexico is a clear blow to the efforts \n     of U.S. Border Patrol agents in their daily efforts at \n     thwarting the massive amounts of illegal drugs entering the \n     country every day. Additionally, this certification is a \n     disgrace to the memory of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Jefferson \n     Barr.\n\n\n                      The Need to Waive Sanctions\n\n  Some worry that decertifying Mexico will harm our relationship with \nan important friend and ally. Others worry that it will make Mexico's \ndrug problem worse.\n  Mexico is a friend and an ally, but I ask my colleagues: Do we do \nMexico any favors by turning a blind eye to the depth of the problem? \nDo we do Mexico any favors by suggesting that the status quo is good \nenough? Will Mexico take the steps necessary to combat the flow of \ndrugs if the United States keeps telling them year after year after \nyear that they are doing enough and that they are fully cooperating?\n  The truth is that failure to decertify Mexico makes a mockery of the \nentire certification process. Columbia is decertified. Mexico is not. \nAnd today, the drugs coming from Mexico are the greatest threat. It \nmakes no sense.\n  I know of few Members of this body, if any, who want to impose \nsanctions on Mexico. Senate Joint Resolution 21, which the Senator from \nGeorgia and I introduced last week, decertifies Mexico but authorizes \nthe President to waive all sanctions if it is in the vital national \ninterest, and we will give testimony to that resolution in the Foreign \nRelations Committee the day after tomorrow.\n  The same is true of House Joint Resolution 58, which passed the House \nInternational Relations Committee by a vote of 27 to 5 last Thursday \nand will likely pass the full House by a large margin later this week.\n  I believe that we do have vital national interests in Mexico that \nrequire us not to impose sanctions at this point. All we are asking for \nis an honest, accurate assessment of whether Mexico has fully \ncooperated with us in the war on drugs, and to send the message that \nthis cooperation must improve rapidly or Mexico will be fully \ndecertified next year. This is what the law provides, and the facts, I \nbelieve,\n\n[[Page S2041]]\n\nspeak for themselves. Mexico has not met the test of full cooperation \nrequired for certification.\n\n\n                      Steps Toward Recertification\n\n  I realize that the administration has been working feverishly to \nnegotiate agreements with Mexico which will show that progress is being \nmade, and I hope they can do that. But it is too late to improve \nMexico's performance in 1996. The year is gone. But let me lay out some \nof the steps I believe Mexico needs to take in order to be eligible to \nbe recertified, if she is decertified.\n  First, effective action to dismantle the major drug cartels and \narrest their leaders.\n  Second, full and ongoing implementation of effective money-laundering \nlegislation and rigorously enforced bank regulations with penalties for \nthose who do not comply.\n  Third, compliance with all outstanding extradition requests by the \nUnited States so that cartel leaders and major traffickers can be \nbrought to justice.\n  Fourth, help at the border. Mexico, as a friend, an ally, and a \nneighbor, should help enforce the border and prevent the flow of \ncontraband. It is not enough to see this as simply America's problem. \nAnd this goes for the seas as well. Not to permit United States \nmilitary ships to refuel in Mexican ports without 30 days notice is \nunacceptable from a friend.\n  Fifth, improved cooperation with U.S. law enforcement officials, \nincluding allowing United States law enforcement agents to resume \ncarrying weapons on the Mexican side of the border, and for Mexico to \npay their share of the effort and be fully supportive of United States \nhelp.\n  Any legitimate American law enforcement officer detailed to Mexico \nand working drugs should be permitted to carry a sidearm --or they \nshould not go.\n  Sixth, implementation of a comprehensive program to identify, to weed \nout, and to prosecute corrupt officials at all levels of the Mexican \nGovernment, police, and military.\n  If Mexico takes these steps, I would support recertification even \nduring the current year, which the law allows if there is significant \nprogress in a decertified country.\n  Mr. President, I believe I have laid out a strong case that Mexico \ndid not earn certification as fully cooperating on counternarcotics in \n1996. Have there been instances of cooperation? Of course. But can \nanyone credibly say that Mexico has fully cooperated with the United \nStates? It is not even close.\n  It is important for us to be honest with ourselves about this issue. \nIf we are not honest with ourselves, we unreasonably lower our guard \nagainst the incredible danger that Mexican drug trafficking poses to \nour children, our schools, and our communities.\n  If we are not honest with ourselves, we dishonor the dedication of \nthousands of DEA and Border Patrol agents who put their lives on the \nline every single day to try to keep drugs from reaching our streets. I \nbelieve today those agents have every right to feel betrayed.\n  Senator Coverdell, Senator Helms, myself, and others will continue \ntrying to disapprove the Mexico certification and enact a vital \nnational interest waiver. Similar legislation is moving through the \nHouse. We will make our best effort.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Coverdell and Senator Hutchinson of Arkansas be \npermitted to speak during morning business charged to the time under my \ncontrol.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n   Remarks by Thomas A. Constantine, Administrator, Drug Enforcement \n   Administration, Before the House Government Reform and Oversight \n   Committee, National Security, International Affairs, and Criminal \n                          Justice Subcommittee\n\n       Mr. Chairman, Members of the Subcommittee: I appreciate \n     this opportunity to appear before the Subcommittee today on \n     the subject of Mexico and the Southwest Border Initiative. My \n     comments today will be limited to an objective assessment of \n     the law enforcement issues involving organized crime and drug \n     trafficking problems with specific attention on Mexico and \n     the Southwest border. This hearing is extremely timely, and \n     during my testimony I will provide the subcommittee with a \n     full picture of how organized crime groups from Mexico \n     operate and affect so many aspects of life in America today. \n     I am not exaggerating when I say that these sophisticated \n     drug syndicate groups from Mexico have eclipsed organized \n     crime groups from Colombia as the premier law enforcement \n     threat facing the United States today.\n       Many phrases have been used to describe the complex and \n     sophisticated international drug trafficking groups operating \n     out of Colombia and Mexico, and frankly, the somewhat \n     respectable titles of ``cartel'' or ``federation'' mask the \n     true identity of these vicious, destructive entities. The \n     Cali organization, and the four largest drug trafficking \n     organizations in Mexico--operating out of Juarez, Tijuana, \n     Sonora and the Gulf region--are simply organized crime groups \n     whose leaders are not in Brooklyn or Queens, but are safely \n     ensconced on foreign soil. They are not legitimate \n     businessmen as the word ``cartel'' implies, nor are they \n     ``federated'' into a legitimate conglomerate. These syndicate \n     leaders--the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers in Colombia to Amado \n     Carrillo-Fuentes, Juan Garcia-Abrego, Miguel Caro-Quintero, \n     and the Arellano-Felix Brothers--are simply the 1990's \n     versions of the mob leaders U.S. law enforcement has fought \n     since shortly after the turn of this century.\n       But these organized crime leaders are far more dangerous, \n     far more influential and have a great deal more impact on our \n     day to day lives than their domestic predecessors. While \n     organized crime in the United States during the \n     1950's through the 1970's affected certain aspects of \n     American life, their influence pales in comparison to the \n     violence, corruption and power that today's drug \n     syndicates wield. These individuals, from their \n     headquarters locations, absolutely influence the choices \n     that too many Americans make about where to live, when to \n     venture out of their homes, or where they send their \n     children to school. The drugs--and the attendant violence \n     which accompanies the drug trade--have reached into every \n     American community and have robbed many Americans of the \n     dreams they once cherished.\n       Organized crime in the United States was addressed over \n     time, but only after Americans recognized the dangers that \n     organized crime posed to our way of life. But it did not \n     happen overnight. American organized crime was exposed to the \n     light of day systematically, stripping away the pretense that \n     mob leaders were anonymous businessmen. The Appalachian raid \n     of 1957 forced law enforcement to acknowledge that these \n     organized syndicates did indeed exist, and strong measures \n     were taken to go after the top leadership, a strategy used \n     effectively throughout our national campaign against the mob. \n     During the 1960's, Attorney General Bobby Kennedy was \n     unequivocal in his approach to ending the reign of organized \n     crime in America, and consistent law enforcement policies \n     were enacted which resulted in real gains. Today, traditional \n     organized crime, as we knew it in the United States, has been \n     eviscerated, a fragment of what it once was.\n       At the height of its power, organized crime in this nation \n     was consolidated in the hands of few major families whose key \n     players live in this nation, and were within reach of our \n     criminal justice system. All decisions made by organized \n     crime were made within the United States. Orders were carried \n     out on U.S. soil. While it was not easy to build cases \n     against the mob leaders, law enforcement knew that once a \n     good case was made against a boss, he could be located within \n     the U.S., arrested and sent to jail.\n       That is not the case with today's organized criminal \n     groups. They are strong, sophisticated and destructive \n     organizations operating on a global scale. Their decisions \n     are made in sanctuaries in Cali, Colombia, and Guadalajara, \n     Mexico, even day-to-day operational decisions such as where \n     to ship cocaine, which cars their workers in the United \n     States should rent, which apartments should be leased, which \n     markings should be on each cocaine package, which contract \n     murders should be ordered, which official should be bribed, \n     and how much. They are shadowy figures whose armies of \n     workers in Colombia, Mexico and the United States answer to \n     them via daily faxes, cellular phone, or pagers. Their armies \n     carry out killings within the United States--one day an \n     outspoken journalist, one day a courier who had lost a load, \n     the next an innocent bystander caught in the line of fire--on \n     orders of the top leadership. They operate from the safety of \n     protected locations and are free to come and go as they \n     please within their home countries. These syndicate bosses \n     have at their disposal airplanes, boats, vehicles, radar, \n     communications equipment and weapons in quantities which \n     rival the capabilities of some legitimate governments. \n     Whereas previous organized crime leaders were millionaires, \n     the Cali drug traffickers and their counterparts from Mexico \n     are billionaires.\n       It is difficult--sometimes nearly impossible--for U.S. law \n     enforcement to locate and arrest these leaders without the \n     assistance of law enforcement in other countries. Their \n     communications are coded. they are protected by corrupt law \n     enforcement officials, despite pledges from the Government of \n     Mexico to apprehend the syndicate leaders, law enforcement \n     authorities have been unable to locate them and even if they \n     are located, the government is not obligated to extradite \n     them to the U.S. to stand trial.\n       In Mexico, as is the case wherever organized crime \n     flourishes, corruption and intimidation allow the leaders to \n     maintain\n\n[[Page S2042]]\n\n     control. These sophisticated criminal groups cannot thrive \n     unless law enforcement officials have been paid bribes, and \n     witnesses fear for their lives. Later in my testimony I will \n     discuss some of these problems in greater detail.\n       It is frustrating for all of us in law enforcement that the \n     leaders of these criminal organizations, although well known \n     and indicted repeatedly, have not been located, arrested or \n     prosecuted.\n\n\n               the cali group and traffickers from mexico\n\n       We cannot discuss the situation in Mexico today without \n     looking at the evolution of the groups from Colombia--how \n     they began, what their status is today, and how the groups \n     from Mexico have learned important lessions from them, \n     becoming major trafficking organizations in their own right.\n       During the late 1980's the Cali group assumed greater and \n     greater power as their predecessors from the Medellin cartel \n     was brash and publicly violent in their activities, the \n     criminals, who ran their organization from Cali, labored \n     behind the pretense of legitimacy, posing as businessmen, \n     just carrying out their professional obligations. The Cali \n     leaders-the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, Santa Cruz Londono, \n     Pacho Herrera--amassed fortunes and ran their multi-billion \n     dollar cocaine businesses from high-rises and ranches in \n     Colombia, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela and his associates \n     composed what was until then, the most powerful international \n     organized crime group in history, employed 727 aircraft to \n     ferry drugs to Mexico, from where they were smuggled into the \n     United States, and then return to Colombia with the money \n     from U.S. drug sales. Using landing areas in Mexico, they \n     were able to evade U.S. law enforcement officials and make \n     important alliances with transportation and distribution \n     experts in Mexico.\n       With intense law enforcement pressure focused on the Cali \n     leadership by brave men and women in the Colombian National \n     Police during 1995 and 1996, all of the top leadership of the \n     Cali syndicate are either in jail, or dead. The fine work \n     done by General Serrano, who appeared before your \n     subcommittee only two weeks ago, and other CNP officers is a \n     testament to the commitment and dedication of Colombia's law \n     enforcement officials in the face of great personal danger \n     and a government whose leadership is riddled with drug \n     corruption.\n       Since the Cali leaders' imprisonment on sentences which \n     were ridiculously short and inadequate, traffickers from \n     Mexico took on greater prominence. The alliance between the \n     Colombian traffickers and the organizations from Mexico had \n     benefits for both sides. Traditionally, the traffickers from \n     Mexico have long been involved in smuggling marijuana, \n     heroin, cocaine into the United States, and had established \n     solid distribution routes throughout the nation. Because the \n     Cali syndicate was concerned about the security of their \n     loads, they brokered a commercial deal with the traffickers \n     from Mexico, which reduced their potential losses.\n       This agreement entailed the Colombians moving cocaine from \n     the Andean region to the Mexican organizations, who then \n     assumed the responsibility of delivering the cocaine into the \n     United States. In 1989, U.S. law enforcement officials seized \n     21 metric tons of cocaine in Sylmar, California; this record \n     seizure demonstrated the extent and magnitude of the Mexican \n     groups' capabilities to transport Colombian-produced cocaine \n     into the United States. This huge shipment was driven across \n     the Mexican/U.S. border in small shipments and stored in the \n     warehouse until all transportation fees had been paid by the \n     Calif and Medellin cartels, to the transporters from Mexico \n     are routinely paid in multi-ton quantities of cocaine, making \n     them formidable cocaine traffickers in their own right.\n       The majority of cocaine entering the United States \n     continues to come from Colombia through Mexico and across \n     U.S. border points of entry. Most of the cocaine enters the \n     United States in privately owned vehicles and commercial \n     trucks. There is a new evidence that indicates traffickers in \n     Mexico have gone directly to sources of cocaine in Bolivia \n     and Peru in order to circumvent Colombian middlemen. In \n     addition to the inexhaustible supply of cocaine entering the \n     U.S., trafficking organizations from Mexico are responsible \n     for producing and trafficking thousands of pounds of \n     methamphetamine, and have been major distributors of heroin \n     and marijuana in the W.S. since the 1970's.\n\n\n                     Major Traffickers from Mexico\n\n       A number of major trafficking organizations represent the \n     highest echelons of organized crime in Mexico. Their leaders \n     are under indictment in the United States on numerous \n     charges. The Department of Justice has submitted Provisional \n     Warrants for many of their arrests to the Government of \n     Mexico, and only one, Juan Garcia Agrego, because he was a \n     U.S. citizen has been sent to the U.S. to face justice. The \n     other leaders are living freely in Mexico, and have so far \n     escaped apprehension by Mexican law enforcement, and have \n     suffered little, if any inconvenience resulting from their \n     notorious status, I believe that in order to fully expose \n     these syndicate leaders, it is more beneficial to refer to \n     them by their personal names than by the names of their \n     organizations.\n\n                         Amado Carrillo-Fuentes\n\n       The most powerful drug trafficker in Mexico at the current \n     time is Amado Carrillo-Fuentes, who, as recently reported, \n     allegedly has ties to the former Commissioner of the INCD, \n     Gutierrez-Rebollo. His organized crime group, based in \n     Juarez, is associated with the Rodriguez-Orejuela \n     organization and the Ochoa brothers, from Medellin, as \n     well. This organization, which is also involved in heroin \n     and marijuana trafficking, handles large cocaine shipments \n     from Columbia. Their regional bases in Guadalajara, \n     Hermosillo and Torreon serve as storage locations where \n     later, the drugs are moved closer to the border for \n     eventual shipment into the United States.\n       The scope of the Carrillo-Fuentes' network is staggering; \n     he reportedly forwards $20-$30 million to Colombia for each \n     major operation, and his illegal activities generate ten's of \n     millions per week. He was a pioneer in the use of large \n     aircraft to transport cocaine from Colombia to Mexico and \n     became known as ``Lord of the Skies.'' Carillo-Fuentes \n     reportedly owns a fleet of aircraft and has major real estate \n     holdings.\n       Like his Colombian counterparts, Carillo-Fuentes is \n     sophisticated in the use of technology and counter \n     surveillance methods. His network employs state of the art \n     communications devices to conduct business. His organization \n     has become so powerful he is even seeking to expand his \n     markets into traditional Colombian strongholds on the east \n     coast of the United States.\n       Presently, Carrillo-Fuentes is attempting to consolidate \n     control over drug trafficking along the entire Mexican \n     northern border, and he plans to continue to bribe border \n     officials to ensure that his attempts are successful. \n     Carrillo-Fuentes, who is the subject of numerous separate \n     U.S. law enforcement investigations has been indicted in \n     Florida and Texas and remains a fugitive on heroin and \n     cocaine charges.\n\n                          Miguel Caro-Quintero\n\n       Miguel Caro-Quintero's organization is based in Sonora, \n     Mexico and focuses its attention on trafficking cocaine and \n     marijuana. His brother, Rafael, is in prison in Mexico for \n     his role in killing DEA Special Agent Kiki Camarena in 1985.\n       Miguel, along with two of his other brothers--Jorge and \n     Genaro--run the organization. Miguel himself was arrested in \n     1992, and the USG and GOM cooperated in a bilateral \n     prosecution. Unfortunately, that effort was thwarted when \n     Miguel was able to use a combination of threats and bribes to \n     have his charges dismissed by a federal judge in Hermosillo. \n     He has operated freely since that time.\n       The Caro-Quintero organization specializes primarily in the \n     cultivation, production and distribution of marijuana, a \n     major cash-crop for drug groups from Mexico. The organization \n     is believed to own many ranches in the northern border state \n     of Sonora, where drugs are stored, and from which drug \n     operations into the United States are staged. Despite its \n     specialization in marijuana cultivation and distribution, \n     like the other major drug organizations in Mexico, this group \n     is polydrug in nature, also transporting and distributing \n     cocaine and methamphetamine.\n       Miguel Caro-Quintero is the subject of several indictments \n     in the United States and is currently the subject of \n     provisional arrest warrants issued by the United States \n     government, yet in an act of astonishing arrogance he called \n     a radio station in Hermosillo, Mexico last May indicating \n     that he was bothered by statements I had made that he was an \n     innocent rancher and charges made against him by DEA were \n     untrue. He then had the audacity to give his address and \n     invite law enforcement officials from Mexico and the United \n     States to visit him--yet he remains at large.\n\n                      The Arellano-Felix Brothers\n\n       The Arellano-Felix Organization (AFO), often referred to as \n     the Tijuana Cartel, is one of the most powerful and \n     aggressive drug trafficking organizations operating from \n     Mexico; it is undeniably the most violent. More than any \n     other major trafficking organization from Mexico, it extends \n     its tentacles directly from high-echelon figures in the law \n     enforcement and judicial systems in Mexico, to street-level \n     individuals in the United States. The AFO is responsible for \n     the transportation, importation and distribution of multi-ton \n     quantities of cocaine, marijuana, as well as large quantities \n     of heroin and methamphetamine, into the United States from \n     Mexico. The AFO operates primarily in the Mexican states of \n     Sinaloa (their birth place), Jalisco, Michoacan, Chiapas, and \n     Baja California South and North. From Baja, the drugs enter \n     California, the primary point of embarkation into the \n     United States distribution network.\n       The AFO does not operate without the complicity of Mexican \n     law enforcement officials and their subordinates. According \n     to extradition documents submitted by the Government of \n     Mexico in San Diego, California, key family members \n     reportedly dispense an estimated one million dollars weekly \n     in bribes to Mexican federal, state and local officials, who \n     assure that the movement of drugs continues to flow unimpeded \n     to the gateway cities along the southwestern border of the \n     United States.\n       The Arellano family, composed of seven brothers and four \n     sisters, inherited the organization from Miguel Angel Felix-\n     Gallardo upon his incarceration in Mexico in 1989 for his \n     complicity in the murder of DEA Special Agent Enrique \n     Camarena. Alberto Benjamin Arellano-Felix assumed leadership \n     of the family structured criminal enterprise and provides a \n     businessman's approach to the management of drug trafficking \n     operations.\n       Ramon Eduardo Arellano-Felix, considered the most violent \n     brother, organizes and coordinates protection details over \n     which he\n\n[[Page S2043]]\n\n     exerts absolute control. The AFO maintains well-armed and \n     well-trained security forces, described by Mexican \n     enforcement officials as paramilitary in nature, which \n     include international mercenaries as advisors, trainers and \n     members. Ramon Arellano's responsibilities consist of the \n     planning of murders of rival drug leaders and those Mexican \n     law enforcement officials not on their payroll. Also targeted \n     for assassination are those AFO members who fall out of favor \n     with the AFO leadership or simply are suspected of \n     collaborating with law enforcement officials. Enforcers are \n     often hired from violent street gangs in cities and towns in \n     both Mexico and the United States in the belief that these \n     gang members are expendable. They are dispatched to \n     assassinate targeted individuals and to send a clear message \n     to those who attempt to utilize the Mexicali/Tijuana corridor \n     without paying the area transit tax demanded by the AFO \n     trafficking domain.\n       The AFO also maintains complex communications centers in \n     several major cities in Mexico to conduct electronic \n     espionage and counter-surveillance measures against law \n     enforcement entities. The organization employs radio scanners \n     and equipment capable of intercepting both hard line and \n     cellular phones to ensure the security of AFO operators. In \n     addition to technical equipment, the AFO maintains caches of \n     sophisticated automatic weaponry secured from a variety of \n     international sources.\n       A Joint Task Force composed of the Drug Enforcement \n     Administration and the Federal Bureau of Investigation has \n     been established in San Diego, California, to target the AFO; \n     the Task Force is investigating AFO operations in Southern \n     California and related regional investigations which track \n     drug transportation, distribution and money laundering \n     activities of the AFO throughout the United States.\n\n                             Jesus Amezcua\n\n       The Amezcua-Contreras brothers operating out of \n     Guadalajara, Mexico head up a methamphetamine production and \n     trafficking organization with global dimensions. Directed by \n     Jesus Amezcua, and supported by his brothers, Adan and Luis, \n     the Amezcua drug trafficking organization today is probably \n     the world's largest smuggler of ephedrine and clandestine \n     producer of methamphetamine. With a growing methamphetamine \n     abuse problem in the United States, this organization's \n     activities impact on a number of the major population centers \n     in the U.S. The Amezcua organization obtains large quantities \n     of the precursor ephedrine, utilizing contacts in Thailand \n     and India, which they supply to methamphetamine labs in \n     Mexico and the United States. This organization has placed \n     trusted associates in the United States to move ephedrine to \n     Mexican methamphetamine traffickers operating in the U.S. \n     Jose Osorio-Cabrera, a fugitive from a Los Angeles \n     investigation until his arrest in Bangkok, was a major \n     ephedrine purchaser for the Amezcua organization.\n\n                          Joaquin Guzman-Loera\n\n       Joaquin Guzman-Loera began to make a name for himself as a \n     trafficker and air logistics expert for the powerful Miguel \n     Felix-Gallardo organization. Guzman-Loera broke away from \n     Felix-Gallardo and rose to patron level among the major \n     Mexican trafficking organizations. Presently, he is \n     incarcerated in Mexico; however, Mexican and United States \n     authorities still consider him to be a major international \n     drug trafficker. The organization has not been dismantled \n     or seriously affected by Guzman-Loera's imprisonment \n     because his brother, Arturo Guzman-Loera, has assumed the \n     leadership role. The Guzman-Loera organization transports \n     cocaine from Colombia through Mexico to the United States \n     for the Medellin and Cali organizations and is also \n     involved in the movement, storage, and distribution of \n     marijuana, and Mexican and Southeast Asian heroin. This \n     organization controlled the drug smuggling tunnel between \n     Agua Prieta, Sonora, Mexico and Douglas, Arizona through \n     which tons of cocaine were smuggled.\n       Guzman-Loera, who has been named in several U.S. \n     indictments, was arrested on June 9, 1993 in Talisman, Mexico \n     for narcotics, homicide, and cocaine trafficking and is \n     presently incarcerated at the Almoloya de Juarez Maximum \n     Security Prison in Toluca, Mexico.\n\n\n           Effect of Mexican Organized Crime on United States\n\n       Unfortunately, the violence that is attendant to the drug \n     trade in Mexico is spilling over the border into U.S. towns, \n     like San Diego, California and Eagle Pass, Texas. Last \n     summer, ranchers along the Texas/Mexico Border reported they \n     were besieged by drug organizations smuggling cocaine and \n     marijuana across their property--fences were torn down, \n     livestock butchered and shots were fired at the ranchers \n     homes at night. Ranchers reported seeing armed patrols in \n     Mexico with night vision equipment, hand-held radios and \n     assault rifles that protected a steady stream of smugglers \n     back packing marijuana and cocaine into the United States. \n     The problem became so acute that the State of Texas and the \n     Federal government sent support in the form of additional \n     U.S. Border Patrol Agents, DEA Special Agents, Officers from \n     the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Texas National \n     Guard. Life has returned somewhat to normal in that area, as \n     the drug gangs reacted to law enforcement pressure and have \n     moved their operations elsewhere.\n       DEA information supports widely reported press accounts \n     that the Arellano-Felix organization relies on a San Diego, \n     California gang known as ``Logan Heights Calle 30'' to carry \n     out executions and conduct security for their distribution \n     operations. Six members of ``Calle 30'' were arrested by \n     DEA's violent crime task force and the San Diego Police \n     Department for the murder of a man and his son in San Diego. \n     Since that time 49 members of ``Calle 30'' have been arrested \n     by the Narcotics Task Force in San Diego on a variety of \n     charges from trafficking to violent crimes.\n       On December 11, 1996, Fernando Jesus-Gutierrez was shot \n     five times in the face during rush hour in the then exclusive \n     neighborhood, the Silver Strand, in Coronado, California, \n     after his death was ordered by the Arellano-Felix \n     organization. In 1993, a turf battle over the methamphetamine \n     market between rival drug gangs from Mexico resulted in 26 \n     individuals being murdered in one summer in the San Diego \n     area.\n\n\n     U.S. law enforcement strategy versus organized crime in mexico\n\n       The Southwest Border Initiative (SWBI) is Federal law \n     enforcement's joint response to the substantial threat posed \n     by Mexican groups operating along the Southwest Border. The \n     SWBI, now in its third year of operation, is an integrated, \n     coordinated strategy that focuses the resources of DEA, FBI, \n     the United States Attorney's Office, the Criminal Division, \n     the U.S. Border Patrol, the U.S. Customs Service and state \n     and local authorities on the sophisticated Mexican drug \n     trafficking organizations operating on both sides of the \n     U.S./Mexican border.\n       Through this initiative we have identified the \n     sophisticated Mexican drug trafficking organizations \n     operating along the entire U.S. border. These groups are \n     transporting multi-ton shipments of cocaine for the Colombia \n     groups, as well as heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana. \n     Imitating the Colombian groups, the Mexican organizations are \n     highly compartmentalized, using numerous workers to \n     accomplish very specific tasks, such as driving load cars, \n     renting houses for storage sites, distributing cocaine, and \n     collecting profits. Through the compartmentalization process \n     each worker performs a distinct task and has no knowledge of \n     the other members of the organization.\n       We are attacking the organizations by targeting the \n     communication systems of their command and control centers. \n     Working in concert, DEA, FBI, U.S. Customs Service and the \n     U.S. Attorneys offices around the country conduct wiretaps \n     that ultimately identify their U.S. based organization from \n     top to bottom. This strategy allows us to track the seamless \n     continuum of cocaine traffic as it flows from Colombia \n     through Mexico, to its eventual street distribution in the \n     United States. However, even though this strategy is \n     extremely effective in dismantling the U.S. based portions \n     of the organizations, we are frustrated by not being able \n     to use this same information to reach the organization's \n     bosses in Mexico and their current counterparts in \n     Colombia. Criminals, such as Carillo-Fuentes and Arellano-\n     Felix, personally direct their organizations from safe \n     havens in Mexico and until we garner the complete \n     cooperation of law enforcement officials in Mexico, we \n     will never be truly effective in stopping the flow of \n     drugs from their country.\n       The Southwest Border Strategy is anchored in our belief \n     that the only way of successfully attacking any organized \n     crime syndicate is to build strong cases on the leadership \n     and their command and control functions. The long-term \n     incarceration of key members of these organization's command \n     and control will cause a steady degradation of their ability \n     conduct business in the United States and with the assistance \n     of foreign governments, the long-term incarceration of the \n     leadership will leave the entire organizations in disarray. \n     The Cali syndicate once controlled cocaine traffic in the \n     world from a highly organized corporate structure, with the \n     incarceration of the Cali leaders we see the cocaine trade in \n     Colombia has become far less monolithic and several \n     independent unrelated organizations are controlling the \n     exportation of cocaine to the U.S. and Mexico. This change is \n     a direct result of the incarceration of the Cali leaders and \n     their inability to fully control their organizations from \n     prison.\n       We spoke to you last year about the successes of Zorro II, \n     conducted under the auspices of the SWBI, during which both a \n     Colombian distribution organization and a Mexican smuggling \n     organization were dismantled and the infrastructure of both \n     organizations were destroyed. Ninety court authorized wire \n     taps resulted in the arrest of 156 people and the seizure of \n     $17 million dollars and 5,600 kilograms of cocaine. Most \n     importantly, neither the Colombian or Mexican organizations \n     have been able to reconstitute these distribution \n     organizations. Zorro II confirmed our belief that cocaine \n     distribution in the United States is controlled by the \n     foreign syndicates located in Colombia and Mexico.\n       Since Zorro II, we have continued to focus on the command \n     and control function of other transportation and distribution \n     cells operating along the Southwest Border and throughout the \n     U.S. These investigations are time and resource intensive, \n     but yield significant results. Additional investigations, of \n     similar significance and importance as Zorro II, have been \n     developed since that time, however due to the sensitive \n     nature of the investigations. I am precluded from discussing \n     them at this time.\n\n[[Page S2044]]\n\n            corruption and intimidation: tools of the trade\n\n       Traditionally, organized crime has depended on the \n     corruption of officials, and the intimidation of potential or \n     actual witnesses, as well as violence against anyone who \n     stands in the way of business. The Medellin and Cali \n     traffickers were masters of corruption, intimidation and \n     violence, and used these tools effectively to silence and \n     coerce.\n       Organized crime figures in Mexico routinely use these tools \n     as well. The recent arrest of the Commissioner of the INCD in \n     Mexico last week is the latest illustration of how deeply \n     rooted corruption is in Mexican anti-narcotics organizations. \n     A good illustration of the extent of corruption in Mexico was \n     revealed when officials, seeking the extradition of two of \n     Arellano-Felix's contract killers, who are currently \n     incarcerated in the United States, submitted papers \n     indicating that the State Attorney General and almost 90 \n     percent of the law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and \n     judges in Tijuana and the State of Baja California have been \n     compromised and are on the payroll of the Arellano-Felix \n     brothers. In addition, several high ranking police officers \n     regularly provide the names of witnesses who give statements \n     against the Arellano-Felixes and have even provided \n     information that assisted in locating targets for \n     assassination. Just recently, the Federal Police in Baja \n     California Norte were replaced with military troops, a tacit \n     admission of the level of corruption in that area. Yet, as we \n     observed with the arrest of Gutierrez-Rebollo, the military \n     is not immune from corruption either.\n       Historically, corruption has been a central problem in \n     DEA's relationship with Mexican counterparts. In short, there \n     is not one single law enforcement institution in Mexico with \n     whom DEA has an entirely trusting relationship. Such a \n     relationship is absolutely essential to the conduct of \n     business in that, or any other nation where organized crime \n     syndicates traffic in narcotics.\n       In the brief time we have allotted to us today, I would \n     like to provide you with some recent examples of the \n     corruption which we encounter all too frequently in Mexico.\n       This January, the Mexican Army raided the wedding party of \n     Amado Carillo-Fuentes' sister. When they arrived at the \n     scene. Mexican Federal Judicial Police were guarding the \n     party. The MFJP had alerted Carillo-Fuentes about the planned \n     raid, and he was able to escape.\n       The Arellano-Felix organization routinely bribes government \n     officials to obtain information from prosecutors' offices \n     including information on potential witnesses.\n       Despite the firing of over 1,200 government officials for \n     corruption charges by President Zedillo, no successful \n     prosecutions of these individuals has taken place.\n       In March 1996, DEA Task Force Agents arrested two \n     individuals who identified themselves as police officers from \n     Sonora, Mexico. Eleven hundred pounds of marijuana were found \n     on the scene, and the police admitted they worked at the \n     stash house.\n       In July a Mexican Army Division arrested nine Mexican \n     Federal Judicial Police Officers and seized 50 kilograms of \n     cocaine and $578,000 in U.S. currency. The defendants were \n     acting under the direction of the Commandante for Culiacan, \n     Sinalon at the time.\n       While a great deal of the corruption plagues the law \n     enforcement agencies in Mexico, the Mexican military and \n     other institutions are also vulnerable to the corrupting \n     influences of the narcotics trade. The Mexican Government has \n     replaced police with military officials, who are not fully \n     trained in all of the aspects of narcotics investigations. \n     This situation is far from ideal. Political officials are \n     also not immune to narcotics corruption: DEA has documented \n     instances where public officials have allowed drug \n     traffickers to freely operate in areas under their control. \n     Corruption is the most serious, most pervasive obstacle to \n     progress in addressing the drug trade in Mexico.\n       In addition to the serious corruption problems plaguing \n     anti-narcotics enforcement efforts in Mexico, murders and \n     violence are commonplace methods of silencing witnesses or \n     rivals. Since 1993, twenty-three major drug-related \n     assassinations have taken place in Mexico. Virtually all of \n     these murders remain unsolved. Many of them have occurred in \n     Tijuana or have involved victims from Tijuana. In the last \n     year, 12 law enforcement officials or former officials have \n     been gunned down in Tijuana and the vast majority of the 200 \n     murders in that city are believed to have been drug-related.\n       A number of these incidents involving law enforcement \n     officials are a serious indication of the depth and breadth \n     of the power of the traffickers in Mexico.\n       The Arellano-Felix organization was responsible for setting \n     off a bomb at the Camino Real Hotel in Guadalajara, where \n     they intended to kill a rival trafficker, hosting a party for \n     his daughter. Two men were killed and fifteen people wounded.\n       In September 1996, Jorge Garcia-Vargas, Sub-Director of the \n     Tijuana office of the Institute for the Combat of Drugs \n     (INCD) and former Commandante Miguel Angel Silva-Caballero \n     were found shot to death in their car in Mexico City. The \n     bodies showed signs of torture, similar to those on the \n     bodies of Hector Gonzalez-Baecenas. Garcia-Vargas' assistant \n     in Tijuana, and three body guards who were tortured and \n     killed five days earlier in Mexico City. Garcia-Vargas' death \n     came only one year after he took the job in Tijuana.\n       Ernest Ibarra-Santes, the Director of Federal Police Force \n     in Tijuana, and two police officers were executed by machine-\n     gun fire as they drove along a main street in Mexico City. \n     Ibarra-Santes was executed just 29 days after he became \n     Director and two days after he reprimanded his own force \n     stating ``The Police had become so corrupt they weren't just \n     friends with the traffickers, they were their servants.'' A \n     Mexican Army officer has been implicated in this murder.\n       Baja State Prosecutor Godin Gutierrez-Rico was assassinated \n     in front of his residence in Tijuana on January 3, 1997. \n     Guiterrez a supervisory state attorney and former head of a \n     special enforcement unit that investigated high profile \n     homicides in Tijuana, had assisted DEA in identifying several \n     assassins for the Arellano-Felix organization. Information \n     strongly links the Arellano-Felix's to this murder which was \n     particularly vicious; Guiterrez-Rico was shot over 100 times, \n     after which his body was repeatedly run over by an \n     automobile.\n       It is hard to imagine that in our own nation, we would \n     stand for such killings and for government inaction in \n     solving the murders. The assassinations in Mexico are akin to \n     three Assistant United States Attorneys, the Special Agent in \n     Charge of the DEA office in San Diego, the Special Agent in \n     Charge of the FBI office in Houston and the Chief of Police \n     in San Diego being murdered callously by drug dealers. \n     Americans would not accept these murders going unsolved and \n     no arrests being made. For any country's law enforcement \n     agencies to be viable partners in the international law \n     enforcement arena, they must apprehend and incarcerate \n     those criminals who murder with such impunity.\n\n\n                        cooperation with mexico\n\n       The primary program for cooperative law enforcement efforts \n     with the Government of Mexico is a proposed series of \n     Bilateral Task Forces (BTF's). The U.S. and Mexico signed a \n     memorandum of understanding in 1996, outlining the framework \n     for the United States Government and the government of Mexico \n     to conduct joint investigations against targeted drug \n     organizations. These Bilateral Task Forces (BTF's) were \n     established in Juarez, Tijuana and Monterrey. The task forces \n     in Tijuana and Juarez have been limited in their ability to \n     collect intelligence and seize drugs and they have not met \n     their most important objectives of arresting the leaders of \n     the major syndicates and dismantling their organizations.\n       During bilateral plenary meetings, Mexican officials \n     promised they would allocate $2.4 million from seized assets \n     the U.S. had shared with Mexico towards the financing of the \n     BTF's; however, Francisco Molina Ruiz, the former head of the \n     INCD, advised DEA that he had been unable to obtain the \n     financial support necessary to make these Task Forces \n     operational. The BTF's for the most part are staffed with \n     enthusiastic young officers, however, they have neither \n     received the training nor the equipment necessary to build \n     cases on and arrest these sophisticated and wealthy drug \n     traffickers.\n       The most significant shortcoming of the B.T.F.'s however, \n     lies in its leadership. On at least two occasions, after \n     having been advised of pending enforcement actions by their \n     subordinates, corrupt command officers in Mexico City \n     compromised the investigations. One involved the attempted \n     seizure of sixteen tons of cocaine belonging to the Arellano-\n     Felix family. To be successful in Mexico, we must be able to \n     share intelligence with the B.T.F.'s with the confidence that \n     it will be promptly acted on and not be compromised by \n     corrupt officials that is not the condition that we are \n     currently faced with in our relationship with the bi-lateral \n     groups.\n       Unfortunately, I was recently forced to limit DEA \n     participation in these B.T.F.'s, because of a decision by the \n     Government of Mexico that would no longer allow us to \n     guarantee the safety of our Special Agents while they were \n     working in Mexico. The atmosphere in Mexico is volatile and \n     threats against DEA Special Agents, along the border, have \n     increased substantially; therefore I have rescinded travel \n     authority for all DEA Special Agents to Mexico, to \n     participate in counter-drug investigations, until they are \n     provided appropriate protection, that is commensurate with \n     the risks inherent in these dangerous assignments.\n\n\n                         prospects for progress\n\n       Since coming to office, President Zedillo has promised that \n     he would take action against organized criminal groups in \n     Mexico. In that time period he has moved to make significant \n     changes to the law enforcement process by sponsoring the \n     Organized Crime Bill to provide the tools needed to \n     successfully attack the criminal synidates and formed the \n     Organized Crime Task Force and the Bilateral Task Forces. \n     However, even with the improved process, the infrastructure \n     of the mechanism, itself, is so decimated by corruption that \n     short term results are very doubtful.\n       The real test is in the mid- and long-term. Unless some \n     meaningful reforms are made in the law enforcement systems \n     responsible for targeting and apprehending major organized \n     crime figures in Mexico, that nation, and unfortunately our \n     own, will continue to fight an uphill battle as drugs will \n     continue to flow into cities and towns across the United \n     States. To date, our inability to successfully attack the \n     major organized crime groups in Mexico, as we have the United \n     States and Colombia, is a direct result of our inability to \n     arrest the leadership of these groups.\n\n[[Page S2045]]\n\n       President Zedillo has acted against corrupt officials, and \n     has stated that he is committed to professionalizing Mexican \n     law enforcement. Yet the bottom line remains; until the major \n     organized crime figures operating in Mexico are aggressively \n     targeted, investigated, arrested, sentenced appropriately and \n     jailed, both Mexico and the United States are in grave \n     danger.\n       What law enforcement steps are necessary for long-lasting \n     progress against organized crime leaders in Mexico? We faced \n     the same questions in our mutual struggle against the \n     Colombian organized groups during the past decade. What it \n     took was an all-out effort by the Colombian National \n     Police to target and incarcerate the top leaders in Cali. \n     Until the Government of Colombia was put on notice that \n     their lack of commitment to this goal was unacceptable, \n     the CNP did not have the moral backing it needed to move \n     out aggressively. In Mexico's case, it appears that the \n     political will to rid the country of the its narco-\n     trafficking reputation is there; however, what is lacking \n     are clean, committed law enforcement agencies willing to \n     take on the most powerful and influential organized crime \n     figures operating on a global scale.\n       We hope that efforts towards this end will bear fruit. In \n     November, 1996, the Government of Mexico passed an Organized \n     Crime Law which provides Law Enforcement officials with many \n     of the tools needed to successfully attack the sophisticated \n     drug syndicates in their country. Included as part of the Law \n     were: authorization to conduct electronic surveillance, a \n     witness protection program; plea bargaining; conspiracy laws; \n     undercover operations; the use of informants by police.\n       For these new law enforcement tools to be utilized \n     effectively, the new law mandated the Government of Mexico to \n     form Organized Crime Units to conduct the investigations and \n     further stipulated that the laws could not be enforced until \n     the unit was formed and properly trained. The Organized Crime \n     Units are now in place and consist of 60 officers to \n     investigate crimes specified under the law. The Government of \n     Mexico has agreed to insure the integrity of the Organized \n     Crime Unit through the use of polygraphs and regular \n     background investigations. However, like the Bilateral Task \n     Forces, these units will not be successful and DEA might not \n     be able to share sensitive information with them as long as \n     their supervisors or managers are corrupt.\n       It is important to remember that law enforcement in the \n     United States did not have wiretap authority and wide ranging \n     organized crime laws such as RICO and Continuing Criminal \n     Enterprise until the late 1960's. The Government of Mexico is \n     effectively 35 years behind us in establishing laws that were \n     critical in our successful dismantling of organized criminal \n     syndicates. If they work properly, the Bilateral task forces \n     and our Southwest Border Initiative can be favorably compared \n     to the Strike Forces established by Bobby Kennedy in the \n     1960's. This 1990's version of the Strike Force is \n     international in scope and pools the resources, expertise and \n     laws of several federal and state institutions in the United \n     States with those in Mexico.\n       It is absolutely essential that the Organized Crime Units \n     and the Bilateral Task Forces have integrity insurance \n     programs as part of their charter. Unless these units are \n     trustworthy, informants who cooperate will not be safe, \n     undercover investigations will be compromised and \n     intelligence sharing process will not function at all. As we \n     have seen recently, both the military and law enforcement \n     have been grievously compromised by these criminal groups and \n     this brings into question the ability of any program in \n     Mexico to remain corruption free. However, last week we saw \n     in the arrest of General Gutierrez-Rebollo, that some \n     trustworthy units do exist and can work without compromise.\n       The problems of establishing a corruption-free law \n     enforcement infrastructure are not insurmountable. However, \n     to become credible in the law enforcement arena the \n     Government of Mexico must ensure the integrity of the units \n     that have the responsibility of tracking down and arresting \n     the syndicate leaders, insuring these individuals are either \n     prosecuted in Mexico and receive meaningful sentence \n     commensurate with their crimes or agree to extradite them to \n     the United States where they will receive punishment similar \n     to that of Juan Garcia-Abrego.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                  U.S. Government Printing Office,\n\n\n                                 Office of the Public Printer,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 10, 1997.\n     Hon.

If you \n     still desire to have this matter published in the Record, \n     permission must again be requested of the Senate for its \n     inclusion and the probable cost should then be announced and \n     this estimate attached to the manuscript sent to the Official \n     Reporters.\n           Sincerely,\n     Charles C. Cook, Sr.\n       Superintendent, Congressional Printing Management Division.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 26, 1997]\n\n           Alleged Kingpin of Sonora Cartel Untouched by Law\n\n                        (By John Ward Anderson)\n\n       Caborca, Mexico.--Miguel Angel Caro Quintero, identified by \n     U.S. officials as one of Mexico's drug smuggling kingpins, \n     arrived in a pickup truck at his modest horse and cattle \n     ranch here and described life in this small desert town 60 \n     miles south of the U.S. border.\n       ``I go to the banks, offices, just like any Mexican,'' said \n     Caro Quintero, who has four indictments pending against him \n     in the United States on charges involving cocaine, marijuana, \n     money laundering and racketeering. ``Every day I pass by \n     roadblocks, police, soldiers, and there are no problems.''\n       ``I'm in the streets all the time. Howe can they not find \n     me?'' he asked at the end of a rare, hour-long interview. \n     ``Because they're not looking for me.''\n       Caro Quintero, 33, is identified by U.S. law enforcement \n     officials as the head of the Sonora cartel, which they \n     describe as one of Mexico's main drug mafias. Although \n     arrested here in 1992 on tax charges, he has never been \n     convicted of any crime, and Mexican authorities have never \n     charged him with any drug violation.\n       U.S. officials see Caro Quintero as a prime example of how \n     weak Mexican laws and an intricate web of corruption have \n     permitted some alleged drug kingpins to operate their \n     syndicates with impunity and live without fear of arrest, \n     conviction or extradition to the United States. At the same \n     time, high-ranking politicians, government officials, judges, \n     prosecutors, and military and police officers have enriched \n     themselves by protecting the syndicates, and they are rarely \n     prosecuted or investigated.\n       After Caro Quintero's 1992 tax arrest, for instance, the \n     United States and Mexico launched a joint prosecution effort. \n     ``But it was thwarted when Miguel used a combination of \n     threats and bribes to have the charges dismissed by a federal \n     judge in Hermosillo [capital of his home state, Sonora], and \n     he's operated freely since that time,'' said an official of \n     the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).\n       Similar allegations of high-level corruption are aired \n     almost daily here, depicting decay in Mexico's justice system \n     and some of its other institutions, including the military.\n       The recent revelations have prompted a more thorough debate \n     among U.S. officials over whether President Clinton should \n     certify by Saturday that Mexico is a reliable ally in the \n     international war on drugs.\n       ``I don't know if `collapse' is the correct term'' for \n     what's happening to the justice system, Attorney General \n     Jorge Madrazo Cuellar said in a recent interview. ``But it's \n     the gravest crisis Mexico has faced in the modern age.'' On \n     Tuesday, Madrazo announced a ``top-to-bottom'' reform of his \n     office to address the crisis--the latest in a number of such \n     reforms announced in recent years.\n       The New York Times reported Sunday that two state \n     governors--Manlio Fabio Beltrones Rivera of Sonora and Jorge \n     Carrillo Olea of Morelos--have aided Amado Carrillo Fuentes, \n     head of a Juarez-based smuggling cartel. Despite numerous \n     U.S. intelligence reports detailing their drug ties, the \n     Times reported, ``both [governors] seem to enjoy a tacit \n     immunity from concerted criminal investigation in Mexico and \n     the United States.''\n       A spokesman for Attorney General Madrazo said neither \n     governor is under investigation for ties to drug smuggling.\n       At the same time, some of Mexico's top alleged kingpins--\n     including Carrillo Fuentes, Caro Quintero and brothers Jesus \n     and Luis Amezcua, who are considered among the world's \n     biggest traffickers of methamphetamine--have no drug charges \n     pending in Mexico. Despite indictments against each of these \n     men in the United States, U.S. officials say they face little \n     threat of being apprehended and extradited for trial in the \n     United States because of tough restrictions against \n     extradition in Mexico's constitution.\n       Until last year, only two Mexican citizens had been sent to \n     the United States for trial under a 1978 extradition treaty \n     between the\n\n[[Page S2046]]\n\n     two countries. But new laws permit Mexico's foreign minister \n     to find ``an exception'' permitting extradition. Last year, \n     four Mexican citizens were sent to the United States, \n     including two accused drug dealers.\n       Juan Garcia Abrego, the head of the Gulf cartel who was \n     recently sentenced to life in prison in a drug trial in \n     Houston, was not extradited but deported to the United States \n     because he held dual citizenship.\n       Mexican anti-drug officials said Carillo Fuentes has \n     weapons and conspiracy charges pending against him. If \n     arrested, they said, he would be held while drug trafficking \n     charges were filed and officials considered a pending U.S. \n     request for extradition.\n       Authorities thought they would nab Carillo Fuentes at his \n     sister's wedding in early January, when private planes \n     ferrying guests in and out of local airports led drug \n     investigators to believe that he would make an appearance at \n     the ceremony. But the Juarez cartel chief never showed up, \n     and officials say he may have been tipped off by Gen. Jesus \n     Gutierrez Rebollo, the anti-drug czar who was arrested last \n     week after officials charged he had been an informant for \n     Carrillo Fuentes for years. A federal judge indicted \n     Gutierrez yesterday on charges of aiding and protecting \n     cocaine shipments, the Associated Press reported.\n       While drug investigations here have been severely hampered \n     by corruption, U.S. and Mexican officials said, until \n     recently they were also crippled by a legal system that did \n     not permit the use of evidence gathered by wiretaps or paid \n     confidential informants. In November, however, Mexico's \n     Congress approved an organized crime bill that legalizes such \n     tactics and institutes a witness protection program.\n       ``We didn't have any legal way to introduce into evidence \n     taped conversations--wiretaps--or to protect witnesses who \n     enter into plea bargains in return for evidence that can be \n     used against kingpins,'' said Juan Rebolledo Jout, a top \n     Foreign Ministry official. Without such tools, he said, \n     ``these people are powerful, they are corrupt, and they are \n     difficult to catch.''\n       However, Mexican officials conceded, a critical problem \n     still remains. Because U.S. cases are often built with \n     confidential informants and wiretaps, it is unclear whether \n     Mexican judges will allow extraditions to move forward if \n     they are based on U.S. cases that used wiretaps and \n     confidential informants before they became legal in Mexico.\n       U.S. officials said they are beginning a major extradition \n     push for Caro Quintero because there are no charges against \n     him in Mexico. Mexican officials said he is under \n     investigation.\n       ``The problem is, we don't know why he doesn't have charges \n     against him,'' said the Foreign Ministry's Rebolledo. ``We \n     are reviewing how decisions are made and investigations are \n     being carried out.''\n       Caro Quintero denied being involved in any way in drug \n     trafficking. He said he and his family are the victims of a \n     vendetta by U.S. drug agents seeking revenge for the 1985 \n     murder in Guadalajara of DEA agent Enrique Camarena.\n       Miguel's brother Rafael, co-founder of the infamous \n     Guadalajara drug cartel, was convicted in Camarena's slaying, \n     which U.S. officials frequently cite as the event that opened \n     their eyes to the growing power and menace of Mexico's drug \n     mafias.\n       With his brother's imprisonment, ``Miguel Caro Quintero now \n     runs the organization,'' DEA chief Thomas Constantine told \n     the Senate two years ago. It is one of ``the four major \n     [Mexican] drug trafficking organizations that work closely \n     with the Cali [Colombia] mafia'' to smuggle cocaine into the \n     United States, Constantine said.\n       Caro Quintero called the charges ``fabrications'' and held \n     up his relatively peaceful lifestyle as proof he is not \n     wanted by the law. He added that he does not believe his \n     brother killed Camarena.\n       Tall, with jet-black hair and a thick mustache, wearing \n     bluejean pants and jacket with a plain shirt and a white \n     cowboy hat, Caro Quintero looks like he stepped out of a \n     cigarette ad. He said his family--he has three brothers and \n     six sisters--grew up in the neighboring state of Sinaloa, \n     where his father, who died five years ago, owned a cattle \n     farm. He is married and has two sons, ages 7 and 12.\n       Caro Quintero said his family came to Sonora about 15 years \n     ago. He denied reports that his family owns hotels, movie \n     theaters and huge amounts of land in and around Caborca, \n     which is about 75 miles southwest of the border city of \n     Nogales, in a remote desert region known as a haven for \n     traffickers and clandestine airstrips.\n       A 1994 indictment in Arizona charged that Caro Quintero \n     negotiated with an undercover DEA agent to set up a series of \n     such clandestine landing strips to smuggle cocaine into the \n     United States.\n       Caro Quintero said he and his family own only a ranch where \n     they raise cattle and a farm where they grow honeydews and \n     watermelons for export to the United States. He said the \n     family's land holdings total about 25 acres.\n       ``If I had a cartel, I'd have a lot of money and my brother \n     wouldn't be there [in jail],'' he said.\n\n\n     Statement of President Ed Ladd, California Narcotics Officers \n                              Association\n\n       The Board of the California Narcotics Officers' Association \n     voted today to unanimously support Senator Dianne Feinstein \n     and Senator Paul Coverdell in their efforts to overturn the \n     President's decision to certify Mexico. The California \n     Narcotics Officers' Association Board, representing over \n     7,000 law enforcement agents and prosecutors, is the second \n     largest professional law enforcement association in the \n     nation. Today's vote to join with Senator Feinstein on the \n     decertification issue is based on our longstanding experience \n     with the widespread corruption and lack of cooperation shown \n     by the Mexican government.\n       It is no secret that drugs are a huge problem in \n     California. What may not be widely known is the alarming rate \n     in which narcotics spill over the California border from \n     Mexico. It is estimated that 50% to 70% of the cocaine, up to \n     80% of the marijuana and 20% to 30% of the heroin are \n     imported in the United States from Mexico. Without the \n     cooperation of the Mexican government in the war against \n     drugs, we cannot put up a fair fight. We strongly urge \n     Congress to overturn the President's decision to certify \n     Mexico.\n       The impact drugs have on our communities exemplifies the \n     need for the United States to demand full cooperation from \n     the Mexican government in their efforts to stem the flow of \n     drugs into our country. As law enforcement agents and \n     prosecutors, we have witnessed the effects drugs have on our \n     cities and communities first hand. Dangerous drugs are \n     becoming more prevalent on our streets. For example, the \n     supply of black tar heroin brought into California from \n     Mexico is growing at such an incredible rate that the price \n     per ounce has been cut in half in just two years--from $800 \n     per ounce to $400 an ounce. By certifying Mexico again this \n     year, President Clinton is allowing the drug flow to continue \n     unchecked.\n       The corruption and violence created by the Mexican drug \n     cartels will not be lessened until a strong message is sent \n     that Mexico must improve their anti-drug efforts. The \n     President's decision to certify does not send this message. \n     We simply cannot stand by this decision and we strongly urge \n     Congress to overturn it.\n       The members of the California Narcotics Officers' \n     Association are happy to support Senators Feinstein and \n     Coverdell and other members of Congress and take whatever \n     steps are necessary to see that full cooperation occurs.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the State \nDepartment's statement of explanation on certification be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 28, 1997.\n\n\n                 MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE\n\n     Subject: Certification for major narcotics producing and \n         transit countries.\n       By virtue of the authority vested in me by section \n     490(b)(1)(A) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as \n     amended, (``the Act''), I hereby determine and certify that \n     the following major drug producing and/or major drug transit \n     countries/dependent territories have cooperated fully with \n     the United States, or taken adequate steps on their own, to \n     achieve full compliance with the goals and objectives of the \n     1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in \n     Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances: Aruba, The \n     Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Cambodia, China, Dominican \n     Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Hong Kong, India, \n     Jamaica, Laos, Malaysia, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, \n     Taiwan, Thailand, Venezuela, and Vietnam.\n       By virtue of the authority vested in me by section \n     490(b)(1)(B) of the Act, I hereby determine that it is in the \n     vital national interests of the United States to certify the \n     following major illicit drug producing and/or transit \n     countries: Belize, Lebanon, and Pakistan.\n       Analysis of the relevant U.S. vital national interests, as \n     required under section 490(b)(3) of the Act, is attached. I \n     have determined that the following major illicit drug \n     producing and/or major transit countries do not meet the \n     standards set forth in section 490(b) for certification: \n     Afghanistan, Burma, Colombia, Iran, Nigeria, and Syria.\n       In making these determinations, I have considered the \n     factors set forth in section 490 of the Act, based on the \n     information contained in the International Narcotics Control \n     Strategy Report of 1997. Because the performance of each of \n     these countries/dependent territories has differed, I have \n     attached an explanatory statement for each of the countries/\n     dependent territories subject to this determination.\n       You are hereby authorized and directed to report this \n     determination to the Congress immediately and to published it \n     in the Federal Register.\n                                               William J. Clinton.\n\n               State Department Statement of Explanation\n\n\n                                 mexico\n\n       The Government of Mexico's (GOM) 1996 counter-drug effort \n     produced encouraging resulting and notable progress in \n     bilateral cooperation. President Zedillo has declared the \n     major drug trafficking organizations, and the corruption they \n     foster within governmental structures, to be Mexico's \n     principal national security threat. He has intensified the \n     country's counter-drug effort, in keeping with international \n     human rights norms, both through legal reforms and \n     operationally, through the expanded participation of the \n     nation's military services.\n\n[[Page S2047]]\n\n       Drug seizures and arrests increased in 1996. Mexican \n     authorities seized 23.8 mt of cocaine, 383 kgs of heroin, \n     1015 mt of marijuana, 171.7 kgs of methamphetamine and 6.7 mt \n     of ephedrine (its chemical precursor), and destroyed 20 drug \n     labs. Police arrested 11,283 suspects on drug-related \n     charges. Authorities arrested several major traffickers: Juan \n     Garcia Abrego, Gulf cartel leader and one of the FBI's ``Ten \n     Most Wanted'' fugitives; Jose Luis Pereira Salas, linked to \n     the Cali and Juarez cartels; and Manuel Rodriguez Lopez, \n     linked to the Castrillon maritime smuggling organization.\n       The Mexican Congress passed two critical pieces of \n     legislation which have armed the GOM with a whole new arsenal \n     of weapons to use to combat money laundering, chemical \n     diversion and organized crime. The GOM established organized \n     crime task forces in key locations in northern and western \n     Mexico in cooperation with U.S. law enforcement. In an effort \n     to confront widespread corruption within the nation's law \n     enforcement agencies, former Attorney General Lozano \n     dismissed over 1250 federal police officers and technical \n     personnel for corruption or incompetence, although some have \n     been rehired, and the GOM indicated two former senior GOM \n     officials and a current Undersecretary of Tourism. He also \n     sought to expand cooperation with the United States and other \n     governments.\n       The United States and Mexico established the High-Level \n     Contact Group on Narcotics Control (HLCG) to explore joint \n     solutions to the shared drug threat and to coordinate \n     bilateral anti-drug efforts. The HLCG met three times during \n     1996 and its technical working groups met throughout the \n     year. Under the aegis of the HLCG, the two governments \n     developed a joint assessment of the narcotics threat posed to \n     both countries which will be used as the basis for a joint \n     counter-drug strategy.\n       U.S.-Mexican bilateral cooperation on drug law enforcement \n     continued to improve in 1996, particularly in the areas of \n     money laundering, mutual legal assistance, and criminal \n     investigations. The USG provided training, technical, and \n     material support to personnel of the Office of the Mexican \n     Attorney General (PGR), the National Institute to Combat \n     Drugs (INCD), the Mexican Treasury, and the Mexican armed \n     forces. The Government of Mexico established the important \n     precedent of extraditing Mexican nationals to the United \n     States under the provision of Mexico's extradition law \n     permitting this in ``exceptional circumstances.'' This paves \n     the way for further advances in bringing fugitives to \n     justice. Both governments returned record numbers of \n     fugitives in 1996.\n       Even with positive results, and good cooperation with the \n     U.S. and other governments, the problems which Mexico faces \n     remain daunting. The Zedillo Administration has taken \n     important beginning steps against the major drug cartels in \n     Mexico, and towards more effective cooperation with the \n     United States and other international partners, but the \n     strongest groups, such as the Juarez and Tijuana cartels, \n     have yet to be effectively confronted. The level of narcotics \n     corruption is very serious, reaching into the very senior \n     levels of Mexico's drug law enforcement forces, as witnessed \n     by the February 1997 arrest of the recently-appointed \n     national counternarcotics coordinator. President Zedillo \n     acted courageously to remove him as soon as the internal \n     Mexican investigation revealed the problem, but this has been \n     a set-back for Mexico's anti-drug effort, and for bilateral \n     cooperation.\n       Mexican police, military personnel, prosecutors, and the \n     courts need additional resources, training and other support \n     to perform the important and dangerous tasks ahead of them. \n     Progress in establishing controls on money laundering and \n     chemical diversion must be further enhanced and implemented. \n     New capabilities need to be institutionalized. Above all, the \n     GOM will have to take system-wide action against corruption \n     and other abuses of official authority through enhanced \n     screening of personnel in sensitive positions and putting \n     into place ongoing integrity controls.\n       While there are still serious problems, and a number of \n     areas in which the USG would like to see further progress, \n     the two governments have agreed on the parameters of a joint \n     approach to combat the narcotics threat, and are at work on \n     developing this strategy. The drug issue will remain one of \n     the top issues in the bilateral agenda and will be one of the \n     main issues discussed during President Clinton's planned \n     visit to Mexico in April.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina [Mr. Hollings], has asked to cosponsor Senate Joint Resolution \n19, Senate Joint Resolution 20, and Senate Joint Resolution 21, and has \nalso asked for time, which I would ask be charged to my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia. She has, as usual, done her homework and, her persuasive \narguments at last Thursday's caucus where she debated General McCaffrey \nchanged my mind. I had hesitated endorsing her initiative. They taught \nus in the Army years ago, no matter how well the gunners aimed, if the \nrecoil is going to kill the gun crew, you do not fire it.\n\n  I had to question myself on the recoil here, from this particular \ninitiative. What good was it going to do? Would it do more harm than \ngood? It was easily determined, after listening to Senator Feinstein, \nthat it was definitely going to do more good because, in line with the \nlimited time, you find exactly what I have learned through hard \nexperience, in the most recent issue of the London Economist, on page \n43:\n\n       The Americans' uncritical support of Mexico may have helped \n     to spread drug corruption in that country over the past \n     decade.\n\n  I will never forget, a good 15 years ago or so, when Senator Howard \nBaker, Senator Paul Laxalt, Senator Simpson from Wyoming, and myself, \nwe were down in Mexico. We had a briefing at that time by President de \nla Madrid. At that time everything was just peaches and cream. We were \ngetting along fine. We were moving forward on then the drug program and \nenforcement. I had gone downstairs and forgotten my jacket, raced back \nup to get it, and President de la Madrid at the time was briefing the \nMexican press. My consulate there was interpreting for me. He was \ngiving us unshirted dickens. He said, ``We told those gringos from the \nnorth that we weren't going to stand for this, we weren't going to do \nthis,'' that was a report of a totally different meeting than which we \nhad.\n  My point is they have constantly used the United States against their \nparticular opposition, time and again, in order to maintain office. In \nthat light, I want to say again what I said at the hearing with \nSecretary Madeleine Albright at the subcommittee for State, Justice, \nCommerce on last Thursday afternoon, whereby I was counseling Secretary \nAlbright, immediately after her statement about Mexico and the great \nprogress we were making in the drug effort. I said I didn't want to \nsound as an upstart, I certainly did not want to sound impudent in any \nway, but what I had just heard from the Secretary was State Department \nboilerplate.\n  Why did I say it was State Department boilerplate? I read, back in \nthe record, the statement made by Warren Christopher 4 years ago. It \nwas almost word for word just exactly what Secretary Albright was \nsaying. You can go back to Secretary of State Baker's statement and I \nwill show you it is almost the same thing. From hard experience, I have \nlearned that Senator Feinstein is on target and doing this Nation a \nwonderful service. As she points out this influx of drugs is a cancer \nthat is spreading into small towns and communities all over the Nation. \nIt is going to take some harsh action of some kind. We have to break \nthis notion that we are neighbors and can't speak freely about our \nproblems. The situation in Mexico is spinning out of control. The head \nof the drug effort down there in Mexico, turns out to be an associate \nof the drug cartels. Yet we had him here for 12 days of meetings.\n  The problem in Mexico was highlighted in the Dallas Morning News:\n\n       ``The intelligence on corruption, especially of drug \n     traffickers, has always been there,'' said Phil Jordan, who \n     headed DEA's Dallas office from 1984 to 1994, ``but we were \n     under instructions not to say anything negative about Mexico. \n     It was a no-no, since NAFTA was a hot political football.''\n\n  Well, there you are. What we are doing is following a policy to \nprotect our financial interests; our Wall Street, or our economic \ninterests, which of course has not worked out. But that is the \nmotivation. That is the influence, and not really getting to the drugs \nand the gangs and the corruption and the law enforcement and crime \nproblem that we have in this country.\n  So, where I indicated I would withhold because I thought it would \ncause too much damage and I didn't have enough to work with, I went to \nGeneral McCaffrey's statement. This was in an open session not--a \nsecure briefing. When asked, ``If this decertification initiative \npassed here and Mexico was decertified, what would happen,'' he said--I \nalmost quote it word for word--``we would not be able to work with our \nfriends on drugs.''\n\n  The conclusion of this Senator is we have the wrong friends. We have \nthe wrong friends. We have been going through, as Bob Dole says: Same \nact, same scene, been there, done that, again and again and again. \nUntil we take up something like the Feinstein\n\n[[Page S2048]]\n\ninitiative, here, we are not going to get any results.\n  Immediately, there is the overreaction. The Senator from New Mexico, \nSenator Domenici, was at the hearing. He said, ``Oh, I differ with \nSenator Hollings absolutely. We don't want to overthrow President \nZedillo.''\n  I don't want to overthrow President Zedillo. I know from the politics \nof Mexico that is the best chance that he stays on, if the United \nStates jumps him; then he is secure in office politically. That is not \nthe intent. I think the man is honest. I think he is working hard at \nit. But I think it is too great a problem for him. And I think there \nare going to have to be some changes down there. I don't see how a \ndecertification initiative of this kind, with the evidence at hand, \nshould upset or overthrow.\n  I was called by the Albuquerque paper over the weekend, that I \nsuggested we overthrow Zedillo. That is how things can get that far out \nof hand. That is nonsense. If he is that weak that a decertification \ninitiative here, with the facts at hand, would cause him to lose \noffice, then he is very weak and I think maybe that is the problem.\n  I think it would be a problem for me, you, or anyone else down there. \nThis thing has grown bigger than us all and it is going to take this \nkind of approach to bring ourselves to any kind of results and stop \nthis. Because it has been going on year in and year out and we have \ngiven way to our economic interests in order to continue. As the London \nEconomist says, ``The American's uncritical support of Mexico may have \nhelped to spread drug corruption in that country over the past \ndecade.''\n  I agree with that statement. That is an editorial, lost in a news \ncolumn. We ought to take heed and I am delighted, at this time, to join \nin, and I thank Senator Feinstein for enlisting me as a cosponsor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I stand here today in full support of \nHouse Joint Resolution 58 and Senate Joint Resolution 21, resolutions \nexpressing Congress' disapproval of the President's certification to \nCongress that Mexico has fully cooperated with United States \nantinarcotics efforts during the last year.\n  Section 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act dutifully permits Congress \nto disapprove Presidential certifications made under this section if it \nenacts a joint resolution to that effect.\n  The importance of Mexico's full cooperation with United States \nantinarcotic efforts cannot be overstated. Drug use among American \nteenagers has nearly doubled in the last 5 years. Most importantly, \nmore than 70 percent of illegal narcotics entering the United States \ncomes from the Nation of Mexico.\n  Mr. President, as we all know, on February 28, the Clinton \nadministration certified that Mexico cooperated fully with United \nStates efforts to combat international narcotics trafficking during \n1996. However, on February 27, 1 day before the President issued the \ncertification, the day before the administration received a bipartisan \nletter from 39 Senators, myself included, urging our Government to deny \ncertification to Mexico, the facts unequivocally show that Mexico has \nnot fully cooperated with the United States.\n  Seventy percent of the illicit drugs that enter the United States \nstill enter through Mexico. There has been no change in those figures \nor on that front.\n  The DEA says that Mexican drug traffickers are manufacturing massive \nand unprecedented quantities of high purity meth and supplying it to \ndistribution networks here in the United States which are destroying \nour youth and creating a new front in the drug war.\n  Not 1 Mexican national out of the 100 or more the United States wants \ncurrently for trial here in the United States on serious drug charges \nhas been extradited to the United States, despite the numerous requests \nthat our Government has issued to the Mexican Government.\n  Our own DEA Administrator, Thomas Constantine, has recently said:\n\n       There has been little or no effective action taken against \n     the major Mexican-based cartels. . . . The Mexicans are now \n     the single most powerful trafficking group--worse [even] than \n     the Colombian cartels.\n\n  Mexico's counternarcotics effort is plagued by corruption in the \nGovernment and in the national police. Among the evidence are that \neight Mexican prosecutors and law enforcement officials have been \nmurdered in Tijuana in recent months. The revelation that Gen. Jesus \nGutierrez Rebollo, Mexico's top counternarcotics official and a 42-year \nveteran of the armed forces, had accepted bribes from the cartels casts \ngrave doubts upon Mexico's ability to curb corruption at the highest \nlevels of its own Government.\n  While there have been increases in the amount of heroin and marijuana \nseized by Mexican authorities, cocaine seizures remain low. The 1996 \nlevels are half those seized in 1993. And the same holds true on drug-\nrelated arrests; they are half the figure of the 1992 level.\n  Lastly, on the eve of full certification to Mexico, the Mexican \npolice released a notorious money launderer linked to a major drug \ndealer, and the United States was informed of this fact only after \ncertification was announced. The Mexican police officers who released \nthe individual are now under investigation as a result of this early \nrelease.\n  In the face of these substantive facts, President Clinton still \ncertified that Mexico was fully cooperating with our antidrug efforts. \nAs a father of three, I cannot in good faith be witness to the \ncorruption of the well-being of America's children.\n  Mr. President, the resolutions before us are simple. Mexico has \nfailed with regard to antidrug cooperation; however, the President has \ncertified giving them a passing grade.\n  I say to Members of the Senate, both of these resolutions contain a \nwaiver provision that would permit the President to continue both \nbilateral assistance and multinational development assistance for \nMexico. By adopting these resolutions we are declaring that Mexico has \nnot fully cooperated and therefore should not receive the United States \ncertification.\n  Mr. President, based on the facts, including the national interest \nwaiver, we must send a message to the Nation of Mexico that the \nadministration made the wrong decision and that these resolutions will \nset that record straight while preserving stability in our relationship \nwith Mexico.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge the adoption of both House Joint Resolution \n58 and S.J. Res. 21 for the good of the Nation and for the good of our \nchildren.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after my \ncolleague is done speaking that I have 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Senator very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/10/senate-section/article/S2035-6", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2048-S2053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE ROAD AHEAD IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer some reflections to \nexpress some concerns about the direction of the implementation of the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996.\n  It has been over a year since this landmark legislation was enacted. \nTo my dismay, and I think to the dismay of some others, some of the \nconcerns that I and others expressed a year ago are now concerns that \nare more real than when we expressed them.\n  As the dust begins to settle after the major titans in the \ntelecommunications industry battled for advantage under this act, the \nconsumers, unfortunately, appear perhaps to be the losers.\n\n[[Page S2049]]\n\n I hope that will not be the case in the long run, but I am concerned \nit shapes up to be the case now unless the course is altered.\n  Some of this is directly related to the deregulation of the cable \ntelevision and the media ownership rules under the act. Cable rates, \nfor example, have risen almost three times faster than the rate of \ninflation, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Consumers are \nalso now getting hit by some preemptive rate increases on local \ntelephone rates.\n  Finally, the concerns about the direction being taken by the Federal \nCommunications Commission raise the prospect of future increases in \ntelephone rates if the FCC in its universal service proceeding does not \nimplement the Telecommunications Act as we wrote it a year ago.\n  When the Senate, Mr. President, passed its version of the \nTelecommunications Act in June 1996, I voted against it for a couple of \nreasons. First, I feared that the Senate measure would do more to \npromote concentration in media and telecommunications markets than it \nwould to break up monopolies and to instill competitive markets. \nSecond, in my judgment, the bill put the cart before the horse by \nderegulating monopoly carriers before the presence of competition.\n  Despite the fact that it was sold widely on the floor of the Senate \nas a bill to promote competition in the telecommunications industry, I \nbelieved that it would do more to foster and facilitate concentration \nin the telecommunications industry, producing exactly the opposite of \nwhat competition would deliver to consumers.\n  The Senate version deregulated broadcast ownership rules, and it \nwould have prohibited the Justice Department from evaluating the \ncompetitive consequences of the entry into long-distance services by \nthe Bell companies. The conference report then came back and made some \nimprovements in these areas, and I voted for the conference report on \nfinal passage with some reservations.\n  But I remained concerned enough about the issue of media \nconcentration as a result of this act that I introduced legislation to \nrepeal the changes made in the new law on the very same day that the \nconference report was approved.\n  I also cited some concerns about increases in rates in the \ntelecommunications services, especially cable services, as a potential \nproblem that Congress is going to have to be concerned about and have \nto deal with.\n  Under the Telecommunications Act, the rate regulations of some cable \ncompanies were immediately deregulated before the emergence of \ncompetition. As a consequence, I am told that some 20 percent of all \ncable subscribers were left to the mercy of whatever a monopoly might \nwant to do with them upon the date of that enactment.\n  Now that the new law has been enacted for over a year, let us look at \nwhat has happened and see what it means and what might lie ahead. \nLooking back, at least it seems to me the road ahead may be \ntroublesome.\n  Let me first talk about local phone rates.\n  While the local competition rules are currently in abeyance, stayed \nby a Federal circuit court because of a lawsuit filed by local exchange \ntelephone carriers and by the States, many of the Telecommunications \nAct's most important provisions have yet to be implemented. But before \nlocal competition emerges in any significant way, some local phone \ncompanies are already jumping the gun and saying that they want to \nraise local rates. Last April, most local phone companies filed \ncomments at the FCC indicating that to them deregulation of the local \nprice caps would allow something they called rebalancing of local \ntelephone rates.\n  Now, the FCC did not follow their recommendations, but several local \nphone companies have taken their rebalancing efforts to the States, \nseeking permission to increase local residential telephone rates.\n  A number of regional Bell operating companies, for instance, are \nseeking legislation before State legislative assemblies to repeal price \ncap regulations, which most say will lead to an increase in local phone \nrates on residential customers. That was not what was contemplated by \nthe Telecommunications Act.\n  This deregulation they now seek is unnecessary. They say that they \nwant to be deregulated to balance rates with cost. They say that is a \nnecessity for a competitive environment. ``Rebalancing'' means doubling \nresidential phone rates over the next 4 years for some local phone \nservice customers in my State of North Dakota. North Dakotans are being \ntold that local phone rate increases are necessary ``in order to \nimplement the Federal law in a competitively fair manner,'' in the \nwords of the company seeking deregulation.\n  I was a hesitant supporter of the final version of the \nTelecommunications Act that came out of the conference. I did not vote \nfor that legislation nor do I think did my colleagues vote for that \nlegislation to allow an increase in residential telephone rates in this \ncountry. Any suggestion by an incumbent local telephone monopoly that \nthe Federal law requires or even contemplates deregulation of local \nphone rates before there is any real competition for local phone \nservice is, in my judgment, a gross misrepresentation of both the \nletter of the law as well as the intent of Congress. I simply do not \nunderstand the rationale that local rates must go up because of \ncompetition when, in fact, most consumers have not seen the benefits of \ncompetition. Local competition, in my State and in most States, does \nnot yet exist.\n  In the 1 year since the Telecommunications Act was enacted, there has \nbeen little change in the actual presence of local competition for \ntelephone service. It seems that the prospect of future competition, \nnot actual competition today, is driving up prices. That is not a \nderivative of this act, that is an aberration of this act. I do not \nbelieve there is one person who would have stood up on the floor of \nthis Senate and said, ``We want to pass a Telecommunications Act \nbecause we want local phone service charges to go up.'' This makes no \nsense and has no justification in law or in the act that we passed.\n  In fact, the conference committee specifically rejected language that \nwould have mandated that we deregulate price caps under the \nTelecommunications Act. Instead, the Federal legislation correctly \nfocused on promoting competition and establishing adequate universal \nservice support systems that would prevent the necessity of any \ndramatic local phone rate increases.\n  When the Telecommunications Act was being developed, a number of us \nfrom rural States who sat on the Senate Commerce Committee created \nsomething called the ``Farm Team.'' We went to great lengths to \nstrengthen the bill's universal service provisions. Beginning with the \nHollings-Danforth legislation of the 103d Congress, which was S. 1822, \nand through the entire legislative process in the 104th Congress, a \nnumber of us labored very, very hard to structure the legislation to \nmake sure that consumers would not experience significant rate \nincreases for telephone rates. Under the act, Congress mandated that \nuniversal service support mechanisms be sufficient and that rates be \naffordable.\n  To the extent that competition, actual competition, imposes changes \nin the traditional revenue streams that have historically been \navailable under regulated environments for local phone companies, this \nact provides that universal service support mechanisms must be in place \nto ensure that rates remain affordable.\n  The Telecommunications Act once again does not sanction dramatic rate \nincreases. There is no relationship between this Federal law that was \npassed last year and legislation before my home State legislature and \nothers that seek to deregulate local monopoly phone service before \nthere is any real price competition. It seems to me if there are \ncircumstances in which local phone monopolies are being pinched on \nrevenues, the debate should be about how to address that problem \nthrough the universal service support mechanisms, not through rate \nincreases on captive customers.\n\n  I happen to think that the Bell system that serves our State of North \nDakota, U S West, is an excellent company. They do a good job. They are \na good strong company. I understand that their mission is to their \nstockholders. But where there is not effective competition, where a \nlocal provider has monopoly service, then there\n\n[[Page S2050]]\n\nmust be good and effective regulation by Government regulators and \noversight by State authorities. That is what this issue is, not just to \nNorth Dakota, but to many other States, as well.\n  The Telecommunications Act anticipated a strong role for State \nlegislatures and regulators, but the act does not anticipate that the \nStates would exercise their authority in a manner that would leave \nconsumers unprotected in the face of monopoly service. The objective of \nthe Telecommunications Act is to foster competition and to encourage \ninfrastructure investment. But as we know in rural States like North \nDakota and others, competition can be a double-edged sword. In densely \npopulated urban areas, competition can drive down consumer prices to \ncreate greater access to advanced telecommunications services. But in \nrural, less-populated areas, they may never see the benefits of \ncompetition, and we do not want to see monopolies extracting higher \nprices from captive consumers to subsidize services in markets where \nthe carrier faces competition.\n  We do not want to see the same result in telecommunication services \nthat we see in deregulation of the airlines, or for that matter, \nderegulation of railroads. We are served in my State with one jet \nservice and one railroad, and in both cases we are paying higher rates \nthan are justified. We pay higher rates in airline service following \nderegulation despite its promise of benefits for everyone. In our part \nof the country, we pay anywhere from 20 to 30 to 40 percent more for \nairline tickets because we do not have competition for jet service. In \nfact, I can get on a jet in Washington, DC, and fly twice as far and \npay half of the cost. If I get on a jet here in Washington, DC, to fly \nto a city in North Dakota as opposed to flying all the way to the west \ncoast, Los Angeles, I will pay twice as much to fly half as far. Why \ndoes it cost that much to fly to a State like North Dakota? Because \nthere is no effective real competition. That is the experience we have \nhad in deregulation of the airline industry.\n  The railroads, if you put a cargo of wheat on a railroad train in \nBismarck and ship it to Minneapolis you pay $2,300 to ship the carload. \nPut the same carload of wheat on a hopper car in Minneapolis and ship \nit to Chicago, you do not pay $2,300, you pay $1,000. Why do we get \nmore than double the price in North Dakota? Because between Minneapolis \nand Chicago there are several railroads competing to haul the wheat, \nand in North Dakota to Minneapolis there is one. We have long suffered \nas a result of deregulation, with less service and higher prices.\n  No one anticipated passing a Telecommunications Act in which the \nCongress, the regulatory authority, or States would decide that they \nwill deregulate and provide new pricing authority from monopolies to \nprovide local telephone service. Everyone in this room, everyone in \nthis room who played a role in the Telecommunications Act, if this \ncontinues, will be required to respond to constituents who are going to \nask them, why did you pass a piece of legislation that resulted in \nincreasing local phone service telephone rates all across this country?\n  In North Dakota, the dominant local service carrier says that they \nneed to rebalance, which means changing rates and means residential \nrate increases because they are not otherwise going to be able to \ninvest in States in which they provide local phone services. But this \ncompany, like most others, has plenty of capital to invest in other \nthings. This particular company purchased a cable company for about $11 \nbillion--the largest cable acquisition in 1996. They also bought a \ncouple of other cable companies for over $1 billion, and they will \nspend up to $300 million this year alone to upgrade those cable systems \noutside their local phone company region. That company in North Dakota, \nwhich is a dominant local service carrier, has 15 million access lines \nin its local phone region, and 250,000 of those are in North Dakota. \nBut, it has more cable subscribers in their foreign and domestic \nsystems than it has in local phone subscribers.\n\n  The point I am making is that there is nothing wrong with a dominant \nlocal phone service carrier having investments outside their region. \nThere is nothing wrong with them asking for the authority to extract \nmore revenue. But there is something wrong with deregulating prices for \na monopoly providing telephone service in a region.\n  As I said, every Member of the Senate will have to answer to that if \nlocal telephone rates go up, and we are told that local phone rates \nhave increased throughout most of this country because Congress passed \na Telecommunications Act. Every Member of Congress will have to respond \nto that. The response today is for me to say that there is nothing in \nthis act that would allow the implementation of this act in a manner \nnow described by some of the monopoly carriers and now described by \nsome of the State authorities. The Telecommunication Act was not passed \nor was not enacted in order to provide 50 percent increases or double \nthe price of local telephone service around this country.\n  Now, one other point about this. The Federal Communications \nCommission is in the process of developing final rules to implement a \nportion of the Telecommunications Act on universal service. Some of \nthis is very dull and boring and hard to understand. But it will play a \nvery important role in determining how much you pay for local telephone \nservice. If the FCC makes the wrong decision--and I am concerned that \nthey are about to do that--they will guarantee that the universal \nservice fund doesn't work to protect consumers and phone rate users in \nrural areas.\n  I come from a county with 3,000 people. My hometown is 300 people. \nThe county seat is 1,200 people. I saw a cost model that described what \nit would cost to build an infrastructure to serve Fargo, ND, with \n80,000 to 100,000 people, versus Mott, ND, with 1,200 people. If you \nare to build an infrastructure to service phones in Mott, a small town, \nversus Fargo, a fairly large town, the estimate was $210 per phone for \nthe infrastructure to provide phone service in Mott, ND, and $19 per \nphone to provide service to Fargo, ND. Why don't we price telephone \nservice that way and say to the folks living in small rural areas, \n``We're sorry, but it cost more to get the phone service out to you, so \nyour bill is $210 a month\"? Why don't we do that? It is because we \ndecide that phone service should be universal. It doesn't matter where \nyou live; the presence of one phone advantages any other phone. The \nfact that someone in Mott, ND, has a phone makes every phone in New \nYork City more valuable because they can call that phone. That is the \nnotion of universal service.\n  All of that has been funded and developed by the present universal \nservice system. In some areas, they provide some additional resources \nto support other areas. The result is that the price affordable and \nreasonably low phone service is maintained across the country. The FCC \nis now in the middle of a decision about how to restructure that \nuniversal service, as required under the act. If they make the wrong \ndecision--and they are inching in that way, regrettably--they will \ndecide, in my judgment, to erode the foundation of universal service.\n  Last week, for example, the Chairman of the Federal Communications \nCommission announced that the Commission is considering excluding \nintrastate revenue streams from the Federal universal service support \nmechanisms. That means only interstate revenue streams will be \navailable for those support mechanisms. That, in my judgment, doesn't \ncomport at all with the act that we passed.\n  It is imperative that the FCC, as well as local authorities, comply \nwith not only the letter but the spirit of the Telecommunications Act \nthat was passed by Congress. The Telecommunications Act is clear on \nthis issue, and Congress never intended for each State to be on its own \nto ensure that services in rural or high-cost areas must be \n``reasonably comparable to those services provided in urban areas and \nthat are available at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates \ncharged for similar services in urban areas.'' That is what Congress \naffirmatively desired. We never intended for each State to be left to \nits own devices to ensure national universal service. We want this to \nbe a universal telephone system that is universally affordable.\n  I hope the FCC will reject this distinction that has been referenced \nnow by the Chairman of the Commission.\n\n[[Page S2051]]\n\n To do otherwise, in my judgment, will contradict the intent and the \nletter of the law in the Telecommunications Act. But the FCC still has \nample opportunity to address this concern, and others, under the time \nframe provided by this act. I was among the group of 25 Senators who \nsent a letter to the Chairman of the FCC last week highlighting some of \nthe concerns we have about the FCC's deliberations. We have, between \nnow and May of this year, to work with the FCC to develop a Federal-\nState universal service support system that will ensure affordable \ntelephone rates all around this country. In the absence of \naccomplishing that goal, we will see a number of monopolies, increased \ntelephone rates, and blame it on the telecommunications bill. Why will \nit happen? It will happen because the act and the legislation was not \nimplemented the way Congress intended it to be implemented.\n\n  One additional point I want to raise is the issue of media \nconcentration. I offered an amendment on the floor on this issue, and I \nwon my amendment, actually. At that point, the majority leader was the \nmajor opponent to the amendment. I won by four or five votes. It was 4 \no'clock in the afternoon. At about 7 o'clock, there was \nreconsideration, and another vote was taken. Some people, having eaten \na dinner that I am not privy to, decided they had better judgment after \ndinner than before. They came with arms in casts--having been broken in \nseveral places--and they changed their vote, and I lost. My victory was \nshort-lived. My amendment was to strike what I thought was \nfundamentally unwise deregulation of the 12-station broadcast \ntelevision rule and the limit on 25 percent of the national audience \nreach. The bill proposed that we unhitch and let whatever media \nconcentration exists in broadcast properties and television is just \nfine. That is really what the act did, with no regulation in radio and \nlittle regulation on television ownership.\n  I thought that was, in my judgment, exactly the wrong way to move. I \nrepeatedly said so and offered an amendment and won the amendment for a \nfew hours, and I subsequently lost. But since the enactment of the 1996 \nTelecommunications Act and, along with it, the lifting of broadcast \nownership limits in that act, media acquisitions hit a record $48 \nbillion in consolidation buyouts. In the first year of the act, \nbroadcast television deals increased over 121 percent from the previous \nyear, totaling $10.5 billion. Radio consolidation increased a whopping \n315 percent since passage of the act, leading to more than 1,000 deals \nworth a total of $14.9 billion.\n  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 increased the national audience \nreach for television broadcast ownership from 25 to 35 percent. \nAlready, two of the major networks are between 25 and 35 percent. It \nalso allowed unlimited numbers of television stations to rest under one \nownership.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a couple of articles from \nBroadcasting and Cable magazine be printed in the Record. These \narticles will provide colleagues with a sense of how rapidly the \nbroadcast industry has been consolidating.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From Broadcasting & Cable, Feb. 3, 1997]\n\n        Trading Market Explodes--1996 Spending Tops $48 Billion\n\n                         (By Donna Petrozzello)\n\n       Spurred by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, \n     consolidation swept the broadcasting industry last year, \n     ushering in an unprecedented era of megagroups and \n     multibillion-dollar deals.\n       In June, the $4.9 billion merger of Infinity Broadcasting \n     Corp. into Westinghouse Electric Corp./CBS Radio Inc. riveted \n     the attention of investors and advertisers to the radio \n     industry. In July, News Corp./Fox Television Stations Inc.'s \n     $3 billion purchase of the remaining 80% of New World \n     Communications Group Inc. made News Corp. the nation's \n     leading TV station owner.\n       Almost without exception, brokers and group owners across \n     the country describe the year as their busiest--and most \n     lucrative--ever. In 1996, $25.36 billion changed hands. That \n     is an astonishing 204.8% increase over the $8.32 billion \n     spent on TV and radio deals in 1995, according to figures \n     compiled by Broadcasting & Cable (see chart at right). And \n     1996 is the fourth consecutive year of increased station \n     trading since the slump of 1990-92.\n       Expectations also are high for this year. ``Last year and \n     1997 will represent the two highest levels of station trading \n     in the radio industry ever, and likely will never be \n     surpassed,'' says broker William J. Steding, managing \n     director, Star Media Group Inc., Dallas.\n       ``Nineteen ninety-six was the best year in our history,'' \n     says broker Fred Kalil, of Kalil & Co., Tucson, Ariz. ``And \n     we already have enough in the hopper for 1997 to beat 1996.''\n       Radio was the champion in 1996, with the all-radio \n     Westinghouse/Infinity merger topping the list of the year's \n     biggest deals (see box, page 23). The Telecommunications Act \n     did far more to deregulate radio than television, encouraging \n     radio-station consolidation and leaving many changes in the \n     TV rules in the hands of the FCC.\n\n\n                        new law drives the deals\n\n       ``The Telcom Act drove the deal business,'' says broker \n     Gary Stevens, of Gary Stevens & Co., New Canaan, Conn. ``I've \n     never seen such a quantum leap in the industry, particularly \n     in the radio industry, in so short a time. I think it \n     exceeded everyone's expectations, and it went much faster \n     than anyone could have imagined.''\n       The act allows broadcasters to own as many radio stations \n     as they want, nationally. Locally, the most generous cap \n     still in place allows ownership of up to eight stations in a \n     market with 45 or more other radio stations.\n       The amount spent on radio in 1996, $14.87 billion, topped \n     1995's radio total by a whopping 315.5%. Meanwhile, dollars \n     spent on TV stations rose 121.3%. to $10.49 billion. The \n     number of TV deals actually dropped, however, from 112 in \n     1995 to 99 last year.\n       ``Ninety-six was not as big a year as everybody thought it \n     would be [in TV],'' says Steve Pruett, senior vice president, \n     Communications Equity Associates, New York. Early in the \n     year, in anticipation of deregulation, TV stations were \n     drawing multiples of 14, 15 even 16, he says. However, \n     ``buyers drew a line [and] there just weren't a lot of \n     sellers. . . . Clearly, [TV trading] was not the deal-a-\n     minute thing that radio was.''\n\n\n                      prices rise for radio deals\n\n       Indeed, ``1996 was the most active trading year in the \n     history of radio broadcasting, and there was a tremendous \n     amount of consolidation,'' says Scott Ginsburg, chairman, \n     Evergreen Media Corp., Dallas. More than 1,000 radio deals \n     were made last year, compared with 737 in 1995.\n       Prices also ran high as radio stations became increasingly \n     popular investments. The average deal price was $14.64 \n     million last year, compared with $4.86 million in 1995. \n     Multiples, which have risen steadily since the early 1990s, \n     ``went out the window'' last year, says broker Brian Cobb, of \n     Media Venture Partners, Fairfax, Va. ``We've never seen \n     anything like this, ever.''\n       ``Consolidation has given buyers the ability to pay great \n     prices and still get good returns on their investments,'' \n     says broker Glenn Serafin, president, Serafin Bros., Tampa, \n     Fla. ``Watching the largest radio companies trade stations in \n     the 12, 14 or 16 times cashflow range'' increased trading \n     values even in the smallest markets, Serafin says, like ``a \n     rising tide lifts all ships.''\n       But the news wasn't all good. In October, radio companies' \n     stock plunged as much as 20% after the Justice \n     Department limited the number of stations and the amount \n     of radio revenue that American Radio Systems Corp. could \n     control in Rochester, N.Y. The previously fast-paced year \n     went out like a lamb. But by last month, radio stocks had \n     largely returned to pre-October levels.\n       Justice's ``inquiries and companies'' digesting earlier \n     acquisitions tapped the brakes a little on trading in the \n     fourth quarter.'' Serafin says. ``But that's temporary. \n     Stocks are rising, capital remains plentiful [and] \n     consolidation is working.''\n\n\n                         Mid-market groups grow\n\n       Midsize groups also gained clout with investors in 1997 and \n     acquired the muscle to grow at unprecedented levels.\n       ``The Telcom Act created a structural shift in the industry \n     that for the first time allowed the creation of middle-market \n     companies that are large enough to be of interest to public \n     markets,'' Pruett says. ``We are looking at a structural \n     change that is permanent.''\n       Nevertheless, some brokers expect smaller, privately held \n     radio companies to survive and perhaps even thrive in 1997. \n     Any private companies still in business are in for the long \n     term, Stevens says: They are not likely to accept a buyout if \n     they haven't already.\n       Other brokers envision a different scenario. Richard \n     Foreman, president, Richard A. Foreman Associates, Stamford, \n     Conn., anticipates a time when private groups may feel unable \n     to compete larger entities and eventually will sell.\n       ``In radio, we are hearing the onset of privately held \n     groups being in the minority,'' Foreman says. ``Their plight \n     is that eventually someone will make them a godfather offer \n     they can't refuse.''\n       Operating stations in a market with larger station groups \n     has ``made competition more intense. You've got better \n     competitors, and we're finding that the surviving companies \n     are much more savvy and they have more resources,'' says Jeff \n     Smulyan, chairman, Emmis Broadcasting Corp., Indianapolis.\n\n\n                        Groups become megagroups\n\n       The biggest deals of 1996 were marriages of publicly traded \n     radio groups: ``1996 was characterized by big-on-small \n     mergers,'' or big companies buying small companies, Stevens \n     says. ``In 197, we'll see combinations of the big companies \n     with each other.''\n\n[[Page S2052]]\n\n       Although brokers and owners don't expect the frenzied \n     levels of 1996 to last through 1997, they do expect trading \n     to remain strong through year's end.\n       ``The trading dollar volume will be high in 1997, but the \n     number of deals will be lower,'' Stevens predicts. ``There \n     will be fewer--but bigger--deals.''\n       ``In terms of the number of [radio] stations, I don't think \n     consolidation will keep up at the same pace,'' says Robert \n     F.X. Sillerman, executive chairman, SFX Broadcasting Inc., \n     New York. But, he says, ``there will be intriguing \n     transactions taking place.''\n       ``There's still an awful lot of acquisitions to be done,'' \n     especially in markets 20-100, says broker Dean Meiszer, \n     president, Crisler Co., Cincinnati. Swaps will continue as \n     buyers whittle down their large deals. ``Companies trading \n     [stations with similar] cash flow . . . improve their \n     positions in markets where they want to be,'' he says.\n       The year's ``hot'' properties will be ``strong cash-flow \n     stations with a rock-solid niche in a format or [audience] \n     demographic,'' says broker Michael Bergner, Bergner & Co., \n     Boca Raton, Fla.\n       ``In radio, the most sought-after situations in 1997 will \n     be any market where there is a facility left `unduopolized,' \n     particularly in large and medium markets,'' Cobb says.\n       Ginsburg expects trading to pick up as the year unfolds. He \n     describes 1996 as the first six innings of a baseball game \n     and the first 60 days of 1997 as ``the seventh-inning \n     stretch.'' Now ``we're ready to play the rest of the ball \n     game,'' Ginsburg says. ``I think it will last through 1996, \n     but then it will be pretty much done.''\n\n\n                     ``unprecedented'' tv multiples\n\n       In television, many brokers expect duopoly rules and \n     technology and must-carry issues that have limited the \n     industry's growth to be resolved in coming months, spurring a \n     period of heightened trading.\n       While television trading stepped up in markets of all sizes \n     last year, ``medium and small markets were particularly \n     active,'' Cobb says. Within the past two years, the number of \n     TV station owners has declined by 20%, he adds. Multiples \n     ranging from 10.5 to 15 ``are the highest multiples we've \n     seen. It's just unprecedented.\n       Pruett predicts ``a few more strategic moves in 1997'' \n     similar to last year's $1.13 billion purchase of Renaissance \n     Communications Corp. by Tribune Co., and the $1.2 billion \n     merger of River City Broadcasting and Sinclair.\n       Stevens anticipates a higher pace of TV trading in 1997. \n     ``Television is on the cusp of further deregulation, and \n     there will be more duopoly buys in television that will send \n     TV down the same road as radio,'' he says.\n       Most brokers agree that 1997 will be another seller's year: \n     ``More money than ever is looking for stock values and since \n     the beginning of 1997, radio stocks have rebounded anywhere \n     from 20 percent to 35 percent,'' Steding says.\n       ``Barring economic catastrophe, 1997 will be just as good a \n     year as 1996,'' says broker Ted Hepburn, Palm Beach, Fla. \n     ``This will even extend into the next century,'' he says. \n     ``Consolidation just can't happen overnight.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From Broadcasting & Cable, Jan. 27, 1997]\n\n                        Consolidation Yea or Nay\n\n                          (By Chris McConnell)\n\n       Washington.--More TV consolidation may be around the \n     corner, some broadcasters say.\n       Others contend it has already happened.\n       TV broadcasters gathering in Naples, Fla., this week for \n     the National Association of Broadcasters joint board of \n     directors meeting will consider supporting further relaxation \n     of the FCC's TV ownership restrictions. Some broadcasters--\n     particularly those heading smaller groups--fear that such \n     deregulation could open the door to placing more channels in \n     the hands of fewer owners.\n       Those worries are echoed by advertisers, watchdog groups \n     and even the Clinton administration. They fear that the \n     buying trend--totaling more than $10 billion in TV \n     transactions in 1996 compared with $4.7 billion in 1995--is \n     leading toward an era of Charles Foster Kane--type media \n     moguls.\n       ``Monopoly power, pricing power, is not a good thing no \n     matter what the medium is,'' says John Kamp, senior vice \n     president of the American Association of Advertising \n     Agencies.\n       ``It's a way for the good old boys to keep everybody out,'' \n     adds Andrew Schwartzman, president of the Media Access \n     Project.\n       But others say that much of the feared consolidation \n     already exists. They cite the widespread use of local \n     marketing agreements (LMAs), which allow broadcasters to \n     manage stations without counting them as ``owned'' \n     facilities. Some 49 of the deals now exist in 45 markets.\n       ``People have been slipping around the rule anyway,'' says \n     Philip Jones. Meredith Corp. Broadcast Group presidents \n     Jones--who opposes LMAs and further consolidation--also says \n     relaxing restrictions on owing more than one TV station in a \n     market would merely make people striking the LMA deals ``feel \n     less guilty.''\n       ``The major (deals) are probably already done,'' adds \n     William Sullivan, manager of the Cordillera \n     Communications station group.\n       Those LMA deals will eventually be subject to local \n     ownership restrictions, under the proposal issued by \n     commissioners last November. The proposal would treat new \n     LMAs as owned stations and would grandfather existing \n     agreements until they expire.\n       The move to attribute LMAs follows a series of actions in \n     Washington to relax the ownership rules. In response to the \n     1996 Telecommunications Act, the FCC last year eliminated the \n     12-station cap on TV ownership and raised the national \n     audience-reach limit from 25% to 35%. In 1995 the commission \n     also eliminated the financial interest and syndication (fin-\n     syn) rule.\n       Such relaxations cleared the way for Disney to buy Capital \n     Cities/ABC and for Westinghouse to buy CBS.\n       But while the FCC now is proposing to tighten its \n     ``attribution'' rules, it also is asking comment on whether \n     it should relax more ownership rules to allow common \n     ownership of two UHF stations or a UHF/VHF combination within \n     a market.\n       Policymakers have differed on the question. President \n     Clinton last fall said that he does not think that allowing \n     common ownership of two TV stations in a market is a good \n     idea.\n       ``Outside of group owners, no one thinks [further \n     concentration] is a good idea,'' adds Larry Irving, head of \n     the National Telecommunications and Information \n     Administration, ``Syndicators and advertisers are scared to \n     say anything.''\n       FCC commissioners, however, do not rule out the notion of \n     some ownership relaxation. FCC Commissioner James Quello says \n     he could see a UHF/UHF or even a UHF/VHF combination in areas \n     where the combination would not give the owner too much \n     control over the local advertising market.\n       And FCC Chairman Reed Hundt last month asked whether \n     allowing common ownership of two stations might increase \n     diversity of viewpoint and programing in some markets.\n       That was the argument favored by broadcasters at this \n     month's NATPE convention in New Orleans. Discussing the \n     remaining restrictions, executives on one panel pitched the \n     notion that more consolidation might mean more diversity. \n     Clear Channel Television's Rip Riordan pointed to the use of \n     LMAs to revive stations that otherwise would not be \n     broadcasting.\n       LIN TV President James Babb, in favoring more relaxation, \n     points to competition with cable and DBS, ``We need to be \n     active in proposing that,'' Babb says.\n       Other disagree. Hubbard Television Group President Robert \n     Hubbard says important distinctions remain between LMAs and \n     outright ownership. And he predicts that further relaxation \n     of local ownership rules will spur more consolidation.\n       ``We feel very strongly that it's not good for the industry \n     and it's not good for consumers,'' says Hubbard.\n       ``It removes from the market precisely those stations that \n     have historically provided entry to new and different \n     voices--minorities and women,'' adds Media Access Project's \n     Schwartzman.\n       One issue threatening to affect the ownership status of \n     several stations is the must-carry law pending before Supreme \n     Court justices. Defenders of the law requiring cable carriage \n     of local broadcast signals had a rough outing before the \n     court last October, and several expect the court to throw out \n     the law.\n       Broadcasters say that could threaten the viability of many \n     UHF stations. ``It makes the weak weaker,'' says Meredith's \n     Jones.\n       ``It could be a major negative impact,'' adds LIN's Babb, \n     who predicts that a struck-down must-carry law combined with \n     relaxed restrictions could accelerate TV consolidation.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. This consolidation is a direct result of a green light \nprovided under the deregulation in broadcast ownership limits in the \nTelecommunications Act. We have to ask ourselves if this is the result \nthat Congress intended and, if it is, I ask all of those who stood on \nthe floor of the Senate and said this act is going to provide much more \ncompetition: How do you square that with the notion that you have many \nfewer competitors? Competition means many competitors competing in a \nmarket system. Concentration is exactly the opposite of competition.\n  At present levels, I think every one of my colleagues ought to be \nalarmed. If this consolidation continues, we will soon be facing the \nquestion of how we deal with the prospect of a small handful of media \nmoguls controlling the majority of all media sources in this country. \nAt what point is the issue of localism and diversity so seriously \ncompromised that the Congress finally wakes up to pay attention to this \nsituation?\n  Where is responsibility in these areas? Well, I think the time for \nthat is now. In addition to the deregulation allowed under this act \nwith respect to broadcast ownership, the FCC is considering further \nownership rule changes that could further increase concentration. In \none proceeding, the FCC is considering changes to its so-called \nattribution rules that will allow for a more liberal use of local \nmarketing agreements, which they call LMA's. That will allow \nbroadcasters to\n\n[[Page S2053]]\n\nmanage stations without counting them under their ownership column. \nCurrently, there are 49 LMA's in 45 markets, and if the FCC liberalizes \nthose attribution rules, LMA's could become even more widespread. In \nthe strictest sense, station ownership is limited to a nationwide reach \nof 35 percent. But these so-called LMA's permit far greater influence \nin many more stations beyond the 35 percent audience reach limit. \nLiberalizing the attribution rules will further encourage consolidation \nunder this loophole.\n  In addition, the FCC is also considering changes to the newspaper and \nbroadcast cross-ownership restriction and is seeking comments on what \nkind of objective criteria should the FCC consider when evaluating \nwaivers to the newspaper/radio combinations.\n  The prospect of further consolidation in the media industry, I think, \nshould be of serious concern. This wasn't what was contemplated by the \nTelecommunications Act, although I feared that was going to be result \nof it. There has been this orgy of concentration in the industry, and \nthat is exactly the antithesis of competition.\n  It is interesting that on this floor we talk about what we are \nseeing, especially from the broadcast industry, from television, and \nfrom the airwaves, pollution that comes into our living room and hurts \nour children with excessive violence and course language. Where is the \naccountability? Where is all that produced? It is produced, apparently, \non the coast to be broadcast into our living rooms, and some are \nfighting--myself included--to see if we can't see more responsibility \nin what is broadcast during times when children are watching. But you \nfind more and more concentration in this industry, and what you will \nhave is less and less accountability. More concentration is not moving \ntoward more accountability; it is moving towards less accountability. \nAnd that concerns me as well.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to describe some of my concerns today largely \nbecause many believe--and I felt it worthy to support something that \nwould encourage competition in an industry that was changing \ndramatically. The telecommunications industry is making breathtaking \nchanges in our lives, and it can be changes for the good. But also it \ncan be destructive, and changes that are unhelpful to the market \nsystem.\n  I am concerned about local phone companies demanding deregulation of \nrates before there is effective competition. That would mean higher \ntelephone rates across the country. I am concerned about the FCC and \nthe decision it is going to make on universal service funds which will \ndetermine how much someone in one of our local rural counties pays for \ntelephone service. I am concerned about concentration in the \ntelecommunications industry, because I believe that determines what \nkind of an industry we have and at what price it is made available to \nthe consumers as well. I hope as we have oversight hearings in the \nCommerce Committee that we will begin to address these issues.\n  If the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is not implemented as intended, \nif its implementation is a perversion of the intent of that act, if it \nmoves toward less competition rather than more competition, if it moves \ntoward greater monopoly rather than toward more competition, if it \nmoves toward higher prices for cable television, for telephone service, \nand for other services in that industry, then I think Congress ought to \nrevisit this issue, because that is not what was intended.\n  Mr. President, let me finish with one note. I have from time to time \nheld up a little vacuum tube to describe what this revolution is all \nabout, and with it a little computer chip that is half the size of my \nlittle fingernail. We are all familiar with the vacuum tube, which is \nold technology, and the little computer chip. The computer chip is the \nequivalent of five million vacuum tubes. That is what we have done in \nthis country in terms of technology.\n  The head of one of our major computer firms, in a report to \nstockholders, was talking about storage density technology. He said, \n``We are near a point where I can believe that we will have in the \nfuture the capability of putting on a small wafer all 14 million \nvolumes of work which exist at the Library of Congress,'' which is the \nlargest repository of recorded human knowledge anywhere on Earth. The \nlargest deposit of recorded human knowledge anywhere on Earth is at the \nLibrary of Congress. Fourteen million volumes we will put on a wafer \nthe size of a penny. Think of what that means--the capability of and \nthe development and distribution of information and knowledge. It is \nbreathtaking what is happening. But it must happen the right way to be \naccessible to all Americans and at an affordable price. If it doesn't, \nif the on ramp and off ramp doesn't exist in the smallest towns of \nAlaska, or the smallest towns of North Dakota, or Nebraska, then we \nwill not have built an information superhighway that works for all \nAmericans.\n\n  That is why the implementation of this act is so critical to the \nAmerican people. And it is why I am so concerned about what I think is \nhappening in three areas that will represent a contradiction of what \nCongress intended with the passage of this act.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that the Commerce Committee will have \noversight hearings and that we will continue to address these special \nand important issues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I just returned from spending 3 days in \nflood-ravaged southern Ohio. I had the opportunity to visit with some \nof the victims in Clermont County, Adams County, Brown County, Scioto \nCounty, Jackson County, Lawrence, Gallia, and Meigs counties. When you \nsee the damage up close, it is even more terrifying than it is when you \nsee it on the nightly news, or see it on CNN.\n  As I visited with the victims, I saw something that was very \nheartening. I saw something that simply makes you feel good. It \ncertainly made me feel good. That was the number of people who were \npulling together in a spirit of community, reaching out to each other \nto reassure each other, to help each other, to be with their friends, \nto be with their neighbors. I can't tell you how many different times I \nsaw people who were volunteering to help someone else.\n  I walked into one home and talked to a woman. I said, ``How did your \nhome get cleaned up?'' She was an elderly lady. She said, ``I had 30 \npeople come in here, 30 of my friends. They came in. They cleaned it \nup.'' They cleaned it up in a very short period of time.\n  This weekend I visited Jackson, OH, in Jackson County. We were \nwalking down a street that had been very heavily damaged. The homes had \nbeen heavily damaged by flood water. We came across what looked like \n30, 40, or 45 Boy Scouts in Boy Scout uniforms. I asked the leader what \nthey were doing. He said, ``Well, we were supposed to be camping out \nthis weekend.'' These were scouts from four, five, or six different \ncounties. ``But we decided to come in here to Jackson.'' And they \nliterally just started volunteering to clean up people's homes.\n  So I watched these Boy Scouts for a while as they went about their \nbusiness moving the debris from that street, going into people's homes \nand helping them scrub down their floors and get the mud out. It was \nabsolutely an unbelievable thing to see.\n  That same day I saw the same spirit in New Boston. The Jaycee group \nwas in New Boston. Again, as I was walking down the street and talking \nto some of the victims of the flood, I saw a bunch of Jaycees. They \nwere out doing the same thing. They were drawn from all over the State \nof Ohio. They just volunteered to come in that day and were doing that \ntype of cleanup work.\n  On Sunday morning, yesterday morning, I participated in a church \nservice in the village of Vinton, OH, a small village in Gallia County. \nJust about every family in that church had experienced some devastation \nfrom the flood. Yet, I heard words of hope from the pulpit. I heard \nwords of hope from the members of the congregation.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, I was reminded of what I saw in Xenia, OH, in \n1974 when Xenia went through that tornado. Then, several days later, \npeople still went to Sunday church services. There were people who \nsaid, ``Why in the world do they do that?'' Again, it was, I think, a \nreaffirmation of faith,\n\n[[Page S2054]]\n\npeople's devotion to each other, devotion to God, and really a showing \nof spirit of coming together.\n  The Ohio National Guard has done a fantastic job. The Watercraft \nDivision of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources literally came in \nand saved life after life--rescued people from the top of homes. The \nOhio Department of Transportation is doing a phenomenal job, the Red \nCross. I could go on and on. An absolutely tremendous amount of work is \nbeing done in the communities to really make a difference in the \ncommunities.\n  My wife, Fran, had the opportunity to work in Ohio several days last \nweek. She worked with the Salvation Army. She worked with the Red Cross \nand is working with one group of Southern Baptists who are all geared \nup whenever there is a disaster. They come from all over the State of \nOhio and from other States into an area and cook and prepare food for \npeople. They really made a difference. She was very inspired by what \nshe saw them doing. And as she has told me about it, I have certainly \nbeen inspired as well.\n  So these are just a few examples of what we are seeing in the State \nof Ohio. We are seeing people who are out there making a difference, \npeople who are working with their neighbors, and people are just \nhanging in there.\n  I happened to talk to one man in New Boston. His home was flooded in \na very quick flash flood. He literally had to knock a hole in the \nceiling. As the water was rising inside his house, he had to knock a \nhole in the ceiling and put his four little children up into the attic. \nHe and his wife then crawled up into the attic. He knocked a hole in \nthe roof, and they were rescued from the top of their house. Yet, when \nI came across this man, the mayor of New Boston told me that he had \nbeen one of the chief volunteers over the last few days. This man who \nhad lost virtually everything in his home, who went through that \nunbelievable experience, was out leading the cleanup, volunteering for \nother people. So that is the type of thing we see.\n  Let me also compliment the FEMA personnel who are on the scene. These \nare good folks who are out doing their job every day and who are really \nmaking a difference.\n  So the report from Ohio, Mr. President, is that there is a tremendous \namount of damage. We think it is $150 million, maybe $200 million. We \nreally will not know until the entire flood has receded and we see what \ndamage has been done. But the good news is people are fighting back. \nHuman spirit is strong and people are helping each other. Again, I \nthink that is the good news that I have to report for the last 3 days I \nspent in the State of Ohio.\n  Mr. President, I will at this point yield the floor and yield back my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Presiding Officer's understanding \nthat the Senator from Nebraska, as designee for the Senator from \nWyoming, is allowed to speak for up to 30 minutes.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/10/senate-section/article/S2053-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2054-S2055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE NEED FOR LEADERSHIP ON THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ran for the Senate because I wanted to \nhelp strengthen America's future. I, like my colleagues here, want to \nhelp solve problems. America is reaching out for leadership to put our \nfiscal house in order.\n  When we debate the budget, we are debating America's future, the \nfuture we leave for our children and our grandchildren--the \nopportunities they will have, the burdens in debt they will inherit, \nthe America they will know.\n  Balancing the budget must be our top priority, not because we have \nsome abstract fascination with accounting but because the future of \nevery man, woman, and child hangs in the balance. The future of our \nvery liberty is at stake.\n  That is why I strongly supported the proposed balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution, an amendment that would have forced \nCongress to make the hard choices and set priorities, priorities that \nwe have for too long avoided. Despite the support of all my Republican \nand 11 of my Democratic colleagues, the Senate last week defeated the \nbalanced budget amendment. We lost by one vote.\n  President Kennedy told us three decades ago that real leaders ``are \nnot here to curse the darkness but to light a candle.'' Without the \nbalanced budget amendment, we are still looking for a candle to guide \nus to a balanced budget. Now more than ever we need leadership for \nAmerica's future.\n  However, when I read the President's budget, I do not like the future \nI see. This budget offers a future that continues to pile up more and \nmore and more debt. The President's proposal keeps running deficits for \nas far as the eye can see. Next year, the President's budget actually \nincreases the deficit by more than $25 billion. That is not acceptable.\n  Three weeks ago, I, along with 23 of my colleagues, sent a letter to \nthe majority leader. As we told the leader, ``A path to a balanced \nbudget should be just that--a path on which the deficit decreases every \nyear in as near equal amounts as possible until the year 2002,'' the \nyear of a balanced budget.\n  The President has chosen another path. At the end of his path, there \nis still a pool of red ink. The Congressional Budget Office says the \nbudget that the President has submitted is still $70 billion in the red \nin the year 2002. That is $70 billion, Mr. President, in the red in the \nyear 2002. That is a far cry from responsible, balanced fiscal policy. \nThat is a far cry from the balanced budget the President promised us. \nAnd it gets worse.\n  The President's budget offers a future where we put off tough choices \nuntil ``tomorrow.'' We all know that in the world of the Federal budget \n``tomorrow'' never comes. Our $5.3 trillion debt is proof enough of \nthat fact. We have to act today if we are to balance the budget and \nsave programs like Social Security and Medicare for years to come.\n  We need to act today if we are to save programs that protect \neducation and the environment. We need to act today if we want to \nmaintain a strong national defense that will preserve our children's \nfreedom as it has preserved ours. We need to act today if we care about \ntomorrow.\n  The President's budget does not act today. The truth is it does not \nact at all; it is a fraud, and the people need to know it is a fraud. \nMr. President, 98.5 percent of the deficit reduction in the President's \nbudget comes in the last 2 years of his 7-year plan--98.5 percent. \nThose are not my figures. Those numbers come from the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office. Does anybody here remember the President's \nfirst State of the Union Address when he promised to rely on CBO's \nfigures? Well, the CBO has spoken. It says the President's numbers just \ndo not add up.\n  The President's plan is very clear. He plans to put off the tough and \npainful choices until he is out of office and somebody else will have \nto make them. That is not leadership. That is business as usual. That \nis disaster.\n  But even that is not all. The President's budget offers a future \nwhere taxes go up and families must work harder to have less. The \nPresident may put off real deficit reduction until later, but he does \nnot procrastinate when it comes to raising taxes, for example. Despite \nthe President's claim that he will cut taxes, the Joint Committee on \nTaxation reports that the budget the President has submitted will \nresult in a net increase in taxes of $23 billion over the next 10 \nyears. There is no tax cut. This budget includes at least 39 specific \ntax increases, and they are permanent. By contrast, those tax cuts that \nthe President proposes expire by the year 2002. The bottom line is \nsimple: The President's tax cuts are temporary and conditional, but his \nnew tax increases are permanent. That is fraudulent. That is wrong.\n  Last week, 13 of my colleagues joined me in a second letter to the \nmajority leader. We made it very clear to the leader that we will not \nvote for any budget plan that increases taxes. Any solution to our \nbudget problems that relies on tax increases is really no solution at \nall; it is just more debt.\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan testified recently before the \nSenate Banking Committee that ``Ultimately, you cannot solve long-term \ndeficits from the receipt side.'' He added, ``It's got to be from the \nexpenditure side.'' That means cut spending.\n  That is why we are here. I came to Washington, as did many of my \ncolleagues, to cut spending, cut taxes and cut Government. We came to \ntake power and authority away from the Federal Government and return it \nto\n\n[[Page S2055]]\n\nthe States and to the people. We did not come to destroy. We came to \nrenew, to renew the American dream for future generations of Americans, \nto renew the freedom that made this Nation great and kept it strong.\n  The President's budget does none of this. It increases spending. It \nincreases taxes. It increases the power of the Federal Government.\n  This body must be about the work of the future, not the past. It is \nimmoral for us to mortgage our children's and grandchildren's future. \nThe truth is the future begins now. It is in our hands. It is time for \nus to lead. We must balance the budget with a real balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Vermont and I were going \nto speak. I know he has a time limitation, so I yield to him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/10/senate-section/article/S2054-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2055-S2056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NGAWANG CHOEPHEL\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank my colleague. I will be very brief. I \nunderstand Senate Resolution 19, concerning the imprisonment of Tibetan \nethnomusicologist Ngawang Choephel may be coming to the floor later in \nthe day, and I want to speak in favor of it. It will be most useful if \nwe pass this legislation, and I will be most pleased to vote for the \npassage of this legislation.\n  This case has a special resonance in Vermont because Mr. Choephel was \na Fulbright scholar at Middlebury College from 1993 to 1995, and has \nhundreds of friends throughout the State. He is well known as a \ntalented and compassionate individual, who cares deeply about the \nculture of the Tibetan people.\n  Indeed, it was while he was researching and recording traditional \nfolk song and dance in Tibet in the fall of 1995 that he was arrested \nby the Chinese authorities and held incommunicado. It was over a year \nbefore the Chinese Government acknowledged in letters to me and other \nMembers of Congress that he was in custody.\n  The charges filed against him by the Chinese Government--that he was \nin Tibet to spy for the Dalai Lama, shocked and outraged those of us \nwho know Ngawang well. His subsequent conviction at a secret trial and \nan incredible 18-year sentence are an injustice and have been widely \nand justifiably condemned by society in general.\n  I hope this resolution will help to convince Beijing to reconsider \nits actions in this case, and to release Ngawang immediately and \nunconditionally. The Chinese Government needs to understand that its \nhandling of this and other human rights cases, and its continued \nrepression of the minority rights in Tibet, are serious setbacks to the \nChinese-American relationship and make it difficult to pursue \ncooperation in other areas.\n  I yield to my good colleague and friend from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nVermont. I thank him for his strong support on the issue of Ngawang \nChoephel. He and I have heard from so many Vermonters who met Ngawang \nChoephel at his time in Middlebury and feel as we do.\n  I also thank Senator Moynihan for his support of this former \nMiddlebury College student and this Fulbright scholar, and also for his \nsupport of other prisoners of conscience in Tibet. Senator Moynihan has \nbeen a stalwart supporter of Tibet and its people for as long as I can \nremember. The fact he has sponsored this resolution gives added weight \nto it.\n  Like so many in Vermont, I was outraged when I heard of Mr. \nChoephel's 18-year prison sentence in December. This followed a secret \ntrial and followed a year of incommunicado detention. The Chinese \nGovernment has not released a shred of evidence that Mr. Choephel \ncommitted any crime. In fact, I understand the entire 16 hours of \nvideotape that he sent out of Tibet prior to his arrest contained only \nfootage of traditional Tibetan music and dance. That is what he studied \nat Middlebury College and that is the reason he returned to Tibet.\n  The frustrating aspect of this is that China has done so much to \ndestroy a lot of the tradition of Tibet, the history, the writings, the \nmusic, the dance. Mr. Choephel was simply preserving for future \ngenerations what is so important in this ancient, ancient culture. When \nthe Chinese authorities finally acknowledged that Mr. Choephel had been \narrested, and they did not do that until a year after he disappeared \ndespite numerous inquiries on his behalf, the State Department called \nfor his immediate release. Even after he was convicted, the Chinese \nGovernment refused to release any information to support the charge \nagainst him.\n  Many of us suspect that his arrest and sentence were intended to \nintimidate the Dalai Lama's supporters in the United States. The Dalai \nLama's supporters have voiced their support for Mr. Choephel, but I am \nnot aware of any relationship between Mr. Choephel and the Dalai Lama. \nIf the Chinese authorities' purpose was to scare off these supporters, \nthey are going to be disappointed. It is only going to embolden those \nlike myself who support Tibet and its people.\n  I have written several letters to Chinese and United States \nofficials, as has Senator Jeffords and Representative Sanders and \nothers. I was in Beijing in November, and I asked President Jiang Zemin \npersonally about the case of Ngawang Choephel, and I raised the case of \nNgawang Choephel with the other Chinese authorities with whom I met. \nJust last week I sent letters to President Jiang Zemin and Vice \nPresident Gore. The Vice President is due to travel to China in the \nnear future. Those letters were signed by the Democratic leader, \nSenator Daschle, and by Senators Feinstein, Glenn, Kempthorne, and \nDorgan, all of whom were on the November delegation to China.\n  Of course there have been all kinds of articles and editorials on Mr. \nChoephel's behalf in this country.\n  I said to the Chinese that here, at a time when we are celebrating \nthe 50th anniversary of the Fulbright Scholarship Program, a Fulbright \nscholar from Vermont is arrested unjustly. It shows a lack of any sense \nof history on the part of the Chinese in this because, of course, the \nfirst Fulbright scholarships 50 years ago were used in China. Now, on \nthe 50th anniversary of the Fulbright scholarship, the Chinese arrest a \nperson who was simply recording an ancient culture.\n  So, our resolution calls for the release of Ngawang Choephel. It \nurges United States officials to raise his case in their meetings with \nChina's officials, to support a resolution on human rights in Tibet and \nChina at the U. N. Commission on Human Rights, to urge the Chinese \nGovernment to allow international human rights groups to monitor human \nrights in Tibet, and to support an exchange program for Tibetan \nstudents. It says, instead of bringing the curtain down on Tibet, open \nthe doors to Tibet, open them to this wonderful, wonderful culture.\n  The resolution makes clear to the Chinese Government that the United \nStates Senate considers improvements and respect for human rights in \nChina and Tibet a priority. There would be no better way for the \nChinese Government to demonstrate sincerity on human rights than to \nrelease Mr. Choephel.\n  This resolution and the support for Mr. Choephel that we all share \nare not intended to embarrass or unfairly single out China. We want \nrelations between our two great countries to improve. But our purpose \nis to call attention to a terrible mistake that has been made in the \nhope that China's Government will review the case and set Mr. Choephel \nfree. I intend to keep writing and speaking about Ngawang Choephel \nuntil that day comes. So I thank Senator Moynihan for his leadership as \nwell as the other dozens of Members of Congress, the hundreds of \nVermonters, and Americans around the country who have signed letters in \nsupport of Ngawang Choephel.\n  The Chinese should look at the names on these resolutions. This is \nnot a Democrat or Republican issue, not conservative or liberal issue. \nIt goes across the political spectrum in this body. What it says is \nthat we are as interested in human rights as anybody else. It also \nsays, when you have an ancient culture like the Tibetans', an ancient \nreligion, ancient music, ancient writings and speakings, they cannot be \nstamped out by anybody and they should not be stamped out by anybody. \nThe Chinese should respect the culture of the Tibetans.\n\n[[Page S2056]]\n\n  The Tibetans pose no threat to the People's Republic of China. But \nactions in trying to suppress, to eliminate, to destroy their religion, \ntheir culture, their music and their writings, that poses a threat to \nall, including those of us in the United States, the greatest democracy \non Earth.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a letter about Mr. Choephel to \nVice President Gore signed by all Members of the Daschle delegation to \nChina be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 11, 1997.\n     Hon. Albert Gore,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Vice President: We learned recently that you plan \n     to visit China this spring. We were in Beijing in November, \n     where we met with President Jiang Zemin. Among the issues \n     Senator Leahy raised with the President was the case of a \n     Tibetan named Ngawang Choephel, a former Fulbright scholar at \n     Middlebury College in Vermont where he studied and taught \n     enthnomusicology. When he returned to Tibet in 1995 to make a \n     video about transitional music and dance, he was detained on \n     charges of spying and held incommunicado for 15 months. Last \n     month, after a secret trial, he was sentenced to 18 years in \n     prison.\n       Mr. Choephel sent many hours of video footage to India \n     before he was detained, which we understand deals only with \n     traditional music and dance. Other than referring to an \n     alleged ``confession,'' the Chinese have never produced any \n     evidence to support the charge that Mr. Choephel engaged in \n     epsionage on behalf of the United States or anyone else. The \n     State Department has urged the Chinese to release him.\n       We believe the Chinese government has made a tragic \n     mistake. Over forty Members of Congress have signed letters \n     to President Jiang and the Chinese Ambassador calling for Mr. \n     Choepel's release. We urge you to stress the administration's \n     view that Mr. Choephel should be released, and to ask \n     President Jiang to personally look into this case.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Patrick Leahy,\n     Thomas a. Daschle,\n     Dianne Feinstein,\n     John Glenn,\n     Byron L. Dorgan,\n     Dirk Kempthorne.\n                                                                    ____\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I urge all Senators to support this \nresolution.\n  I do not see others on the floor seeking recognition. Could I ask the \nChair what the parliamentary situation is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business with a \nlimitation on speaking for 5 minutes except by unanimous consent. That \ntime will expire at 3 p.m.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see other Senators have come to the floor \nso I will yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. How many minutes do I have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Baucus pertaining to the introduction of S. 415 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/10/senate-section/article/S2055-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2056-S2057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        VETERANS SAY ``RATIFY THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION''\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words today \nabout the Chemical Weapons Convention [CWC], which has been submitted \nto the Senate for advice and consent.\n  Various aspects of this historic treaty are now being debated. \nHowever, I would maintain that one of the most important considerations \nfor the Senate is how the CWC will affect our military forces in the \nfield. Will it or will it not help reduce the threat of a poison gas \nattack against U.S. troops? As the Persian Gulf war demonstrated, this \nthreat is real and must be addressed.\n  After reviewing the accord, I have concluded that the CWC will indeed \nhelp to protect U.S. fighting forces from chemical attack. But don't \njust take my word for it, consider the opinion of several respected \nveterans groups and military associations who have come out in favor of \nthe CWC, including the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Vietnam Veterans \nof America, the American Ex-Prisoners of War, AMVETS, the American G.I. \nForum, the Korean War Veterans Association, the Jewish War Veterans of \nthe U.S.A., and the National Association of Black Veterans.\n  VFW Commander in Chief James E. Nier, in calling for Senate \nratification of the CWC, said: ``This treaty will reduce world \nstockpiles of [chemical] weapons and will hopefully prevent our troops \nfrom being exposed to poison gases as we believe happened in the Gulf \nWar.''\n  The Vietnam Veterans of America lists ratification of the CWC among \nits top legislative priorities, noting that the treaty would be ``a \nsubstantive step toward preventing chemical weapons exposure problems \nfor veterans in the future similar to those experienced by Persian Gulf \nWar veterans and the veterans of prior wars.''\n  As a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I can vouch for the \nfact that these groups are among the most unflinching supporters of \nAmerican national security interests and would not support the CWC if \nthey believed that it put America's fighting forces at greater risk.\n  Several of our Nation's best-known and most decorated veterans have \nspoken out in their own right in support of the CWC, including Gen. \nColin Powell, Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, and Adm. Elmo Zumwalt.\n  In a hearing before the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee in \nJanuary, General Schwarzkopf made no bones about his views on the \nmatter. ``We don't need chemical weapons to fight our future \nwarfares,'' he told the committee, adding ``By not ratifying the [CWC] \nwe align ourselves with nations like Iran, Libya, and North Korea, and \nI'd just as soon not be associated with those thugs in this particular \nmatter.''\n  Admiral Zumwalt, in an editorial in the Washington Post, stated that \nthose who oppose the CWC ``do a grave disservice to America's men and \nwomen in uniform.'' ``Militarily,'' he wrote, ``this treaty will make \nus stronger.''\n  Those who now lead our troops have also registered their unequivocal \nsupport for the treaty. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General \nShalikashvili testified last year that the CWC is ``clearly in our \nnational interest'' and ``would reduce the probability that U.S. forces \nwould encounter poison gas in future conflicts.'' The influential \nReserve Officers Association of the United States, representing over \n100,000 active-duty, Reserve, and retired military officers, declared \nin a February 19 resolution that ``ratification of the CWC will enable \n[the U.S.] to play a major role in the development and implementation \nof CWC policy, as well as providing strong moral leverage to help \nconvince Russia of the desirability of ratifying the convention.''\n  Mr. President, even the treaty's supporters admit that the CWC is an \nimperfect treaty. However, all international agreements, by their very \nnature, involve some compromises. This particular treaty has been \nsigned by 161 countries and involves the most comprehensive \nverification regime of any international arms control accord to date. \nMoreover, 68 countries have already ratified the CWC, which means that \nthe treaty will come into effect on April 29 whether or not the United \nStates ratifies it. In view of this, the only issue at hand is whether \nthe United States is better off within the treaty regime, working with \nothers to reduce the threat, or on the outside, with a handful of rogue \nstates like Libya and North Korea.\n  Almost 6 years ago, then-President Bush foreswore the use of chemical \nweapons under any circumstances and began efforts, supported by \nCongress, to destroy our existing stockpiles of chemical arms. That \nremains U.S. policy. Doesn't it make sense, as long as we're destroying \nour own chemical weapons, to do everything we can to make sure that \nothers follow suit? The CWC is our most effective tool for \naccomplishing this task.\n  Those who oppose the treaty have come up with no better alternative \nthan to have us sit on our hands. Negotiating another treaty is out of \nthe question--there is no international interest in a new treaty and, \neven if there were, such a treaty would take\n\n[[Page S2057]]\n\nyears to negotiate. So why not embrace the strong treaty we have now \nand make the best use of it?\n  Failure to ratify this treaty will have serious negative consequences \nfor the United States. We would cede our longstanding international \nleadership on multilateral arms control issues and lose influence over \nthe way the CWC is implemented. And, ironically, the U.S. chemical \nindustry, which strongly supports the treaty and which participated in \nthe negotiations leading up to it, would be subject to trade \nrestrictions that could cost it up to $600 million a year in sales.\n  However, the greatest consequence of failure to ratify the CWC would \nbe that U.S. military forces would be placed at increased risk of \npoison gas attack.\n  In fiscal year 1997, the United States will spend over $800 million \non chemical and biological weapons defenses. This is money well spent. \nOur troops must be prepared to deal with this horrible threat. However, \nit would be folly to spend these funds without doing something concrete \nto reduce the long-term threat posed by chemical weapons.\n  Mr. President, veterans groups and military associations have spoken \nwith a clear voice. They want the scourge of chemical weapons \neliminated and agree that the Chemical Weapons Convention advances this \ngoal. Let's not ignore their pleas. Let's ratify the Chemical Weapons \nConvention as soon as possible so that we can get down to the business \nof rolling back chemical arms programs worldwide.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/10/senate-section/article/S2056-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of Senate Resolution 39, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 39) authorizing expenditures by the \n     Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill, which had been reported \nfrom the Committee on Rules and Administration, with an amendment to \nstrike all after the resolving clause and insert the following:\n\n       That (a) Senate Resolution 54, agreed to February 13, 1997, \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n\n                  ``Authorization of Additional Funds\n\n       ``Sec. 24. (a) In General.--A sum equal to not more than \n     $4,350,000, for the period beginning on the date of adoption \n     of this section and ending on December 31, 1997, shall be \n     made available from the contingent fund of the Senate out of \n     the Account for Expenses for Inquiries and Investigations for \n     payment of salaries and other expenses of the Committee on \n     Governmental Affairs under this resolution, of which amount \n     not to exceed $375,000 may be expended for the procurement of \n     the services of individual consultants, or organizations \n     thereof (as authorized by section 202(i) of the Legislative \n     Reorganization Act of 1946, as amended). The expenditures by \n     the Committee on Governmental Affairs authorized by this \n     section supplement those authorized in section 13 and may be \n     expended solely for the purpose stated in this section.\n       ``(b) Purpose of Additional Funds.--The additional funds \n     authorized by this section are for the sole purpose of \n     conducting an investigation of illegal activities in \n     connection with 1996 Federal election campaigns.\n       ``(c) Referral To Select Committee on Ethics.--The \n     Committee on Governmental Affairs shall refer any evidence of \n     illegal activities involving any Member of the Senate \n     revealed pursuant to the investigation authorized by \n     subsection (b) to the Select Committee on Ethics.\n       ``(d) Final Report.--The Committee on Governmental Affairs \n     shall submit a final public report to the Senate no later \n     than January 31, 1998, of the results of the investigation, \n     study, and hearings conducted by the Committee pursuant to \n     this section.''.\n       (b) Section 16(b) of Senate Resolution 54, agreed to \n     February 13, 1997, is amended by--\n       (1) striking ``$1,339,109'' and inserting $1,789,109''; and\n       (2) striking ``$200,000'' and inserting $300,000''.\n       (c) The Committee on Rules and Administration shall \n     continue to conduct hearings on campaign reform.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, on Thursday of last week, the Rules \nCommittee reported out an amendment to Senate Resolution 39, and it is \nmy understanding that the present business is that pending amendment, \nwhich does amend, if decided by the Senate, rule 39.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank the Chair. We will now proceed \nto discuss the amendment as passed by the Rules Committee on Thursday \nof last week, the 6th of March.\n  Madam President, the responsibility of the Rules Committee is to \nentertain, from all committees of the U.S. Senate, their requests for \nfunding. We have, in Senate Resolution 54, which has been adopted by \nthe Senate, the budgets for all of the committees of the Senate for \ntheir fiscal year, which runs from March 1 through February 28.\n  The Committee on Governmental Affairs, in Senate Resolution 39, \nsubmitted their request for funding. In the initial consideration of \nSenate Resolution 39 by the Rules Committee, the committee determined \nthat they would grant a portion of the funding request, and that is \nreflected in Senate Resolution 54.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee still had, under Senate Resolution \n39, the balance of their request, which was considered on the 6th of \nMarch by the Rules Committee. After a full debate--and certainly in the \njudgment of the chairman, myself, and actively participated in by \nSenators on both sides, as we had nearly 100 percent attendance at the \ncommittee hearing on both sides--the committee voted to provide $4.35 \nmillion for the Committee on Governmental affairs as a supplemental to \nthe request as reported in Senate Resolution 54.\n  Now, how did we arrive at that figure? You can look at the request of \nthe distinguished Senator from Ohio--indeed, a request that, by and \nlarge, was supported by most on that side of the aisle--that there be a \ndefinitive date for cutoff, and that date by the senior Senator from \nOhio was December 31 of this calendar year, 1997.\n  If I took that and viewed it as a reduced period of time; namely, \nthat the Governmental Affairs Committee could begin its work using the \nsupplemental funds, March 15, from a practical standpoint, through \nDecember 31, 1997, it would appear to this Senator that we would have, \nby and large, given that committee the funding profile in dollars in \nproportion to the timing from which those funds may be expended.\n  The next question was the scope. I worked with other colleagues, \nprimarily those on the Rules Committee, and I devised a formula, in \nconsultation with the distinguished majority leader and others, whereby \nlooking at the original Watergate resolution, we took from that the \nconcept that we would allow the Governmental Affairs Committee to \nexpend the supplemental budget for such investigations that they felt \nwere illegal in connection with the 1996 Presidential election and \ncongressional elections--not delineating between the House and Senate, \nbut simply all Federal elections in calendar year 1996.\n  So it seems to me that the Rules Committee, in a fair manner, \nrecognized the dollars that we needed, gave the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee a scope of the investigation and illegal--illegal is a very \nbroad scope. It goes beyond. And I will at a later time today put into \nthe Record the definitions of illegal. But it goes beyond just criminal \nassertions of allegations of criminal violations. It goes beyond that. \nSo it is a broad scope. Then the Rules Committee took from the \nproposal, which the senior Senator from Ohio will address momentarily, \na termination date of December 31, 1997.\n  In addition to the Rules Committee, I think very importantly \nrecognizing the essential need for the Senate of the United States to \nactively participate in determining what happened, certainly in 1996 in \nconnection with the ever-increasing number of allegations--most\n\n[[Page S2058]]\n\nof them regrettably could border on or do, in fact, constitute \nillegal--it was essential that the other committees of the Senate take \non their responsibilities, which is traditional under the allocation in \nthe Senate of the responsibilities among the several committees. \nTherefore, we charged the Rules Committee, of which I am privileged to \nbe the chairman, the duty to continue its hearings on campaign finance \nreform, gave it a sum of $450,000 to be used by that committee in \nenlarging and broadening the scope of their operations in the overall \ncontext of campaign reform and campaign financing. So the Rules \nCommittee will take on an added role.\n  In addition, if there is that development by the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee or the Rules Committee of facts which should be examined by \nthe Ethics Committee of the U.S. Senate as those facts relate to a \nMember of this body, it will be incumbent upon the Ethics Committee to \nreview any allegations we feel merit the judgment of that committee as \nit relates to an individual in the U.S. Senate.\n  So, Madam President, I feel that the Rules Committee unanimously, \nregrettably--bipartisan, yet unanimous among the Republicans--has \naddressed this tough issue, and we are here today for the purpose of \namending Senate Resolution 39 such that they can have the additional \nfunds and under a very carefully crafted and proscribed scope of \nactivities within a time limit of December 31, 1997.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor so that my distinguished colleague \nfrom Ohio can present his views.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, we are now into the second week in March. \nThe Senate has been operating for approximately 2 months. I don't know \nthat we have had much in the way of accomplishment during that time \nperiod. Certainly, there are national problems that should be \naddressed.\n  For example, we ought to be working on balancing the budget instead \nof just trying to pass amendments, which we tried to do, and it failed. \nWe also have a series of problems with our health care system. Managed \ncare may be saving money, but there is increasing evidence that it is \nhappening at the expense of lower quality of health care. So, for \nuninsured Americans, that continues to be a major problem. As far as \nhealth care goes, we are going to have a debate, I guess, about \npartial-birth abortion.\n\n  In other areas, the stock market has gone through the roof. \nUnemployment is at a 25-year low. But there is concern about the \nfuture, and about Social Security and Medicare. But there are no \nserious proposals by the Republican majority to deal with these issues. \nWell, today we have an opportunity. We have an opportunity to have the \npossibility of beginning a serious discussion about a serious issue: \nthe campaign finance system used by both political parties in the \nUnited States.\n  The American people are disgusted by what they see in campaign \nfinance. And they should be. Along with the steady drumbeat of \nantigovernment ideologues, it is a major factor in America's loss of \nfaith in our institutions of government. It is that serious. All you \nhave to do is look at the polling data and such things as decreased \nparticipation in voting. If this trend continues, if America goes \ndownhill because of the lack of confidence in our Federal Government, I \nsay that we face a crisis that could literally threaten the foundation \nof democracy in the United States.\n  There is a remedy to avert this crisis, as I see it, and to begin the \nrestoration of public support for this system of government. The remedy \nrequires that we reform the campaign finance system. It is a wonderful \nplace to start because it certainly needs reforming.\n  Will this get a serious examination by Congress, or will we get \nsidetracked by a partisan political circus? The jury is definitely out \non that at this time. We have before us a resolution to fund a Senate \ninvestigation which, if the scope were made broader than it currently \nis, has enormous potential as a tool to stimulate public pressure on \nCongress to enact meaningful campaign finance reform, honest campaign \nfinance reform.\n  Recent revelations about fundraising involving 1996 Federal races are \ndisturbing. They involve both parties in both congressional and \nPresidential campaigns. The truth is that the current fundraising \nsystem, both Presidential and congressional, is scandalous. Having said \nthat, in my opinion, most Members of Congress are honest elected \nofficials, both over in the House and here in the Senate. They are \nhonest elected officials trying to do a good job, albeit from different \npolitical philosophies. But that is our system. But the general public \nperception that money gets its way in determining policy is, indeed, \ntrue for too many.\n  There is a public perception that access follows money, and anybody \nwho has been around Capitol Hill very long knows that sometimes it \ndoes. Access can alter the balance of arguments weighed by a Member and \nhis or her staff when deciding a course of action, be it a vote on the \nfloor or in committee, a colloquy on the Senate floor, introduction or \ncosponsorship of a piece of legislation, floor speech, insertion of \nlanguage in a committee report, or a communication with an executive \nbranch agency requesting an action, or the withholding of an \naction. But even when there is no connection whatsoever between a \ndonation by a person to a politician and the latter's specific action \nas a legislator favoring that person, the perception of a payoff, even \nthe possibility of a perception of a payoff, is corrosive to public \ntrust in our Government. We must dispel this growing perception that \nCongress or parts of Congress are for sale if we are to reverse \nelectoral apathy and restore faith in our Government. Gift bans have \nnot done it. Honoraria bans have not done it. Only deep changes in the \ncampaign finance system will do the job, and it will not be easy.\n\n  The question is what should be the relationship of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee investigation to the drive for effective bipartisan \ncampaign finance reform? The resolution before us, S. 39, as amended by \nthe Rules Committee, states that the supplemental funds to be given to \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee for this investigation are for the \nsole purpose of an investigation into illegal activities in the 1996 \nFederal election campaign.\n  There are two things wrong with this statement of scope for the \ninvestigation. The first thing is that it is a bald-faced attempt by \nthe Republican majority of the Rules Committee to undo a unanimous \nbipartisan agreement among the members of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee to have a broad investigation that would examine improper as \nwell as illegal activities along with previous campaigns. Contrary to \nthe claims of the Rules Committee chairman that his language tracks the \nWatergate resolution, the fact is that the Watergate resolution called \nfor an investigation of improper and unethical activities as well as \nillegal ones.\n  I am looking at a copy of the Watergate resolution that was passed in \nthe Senate back in 1973. It was submitted by Senator Ervin, Sam Ervin \nand Mike Mansfield. In part 15 on page 8, it says they are ``to look \ninto any other activities, circumstances, materials or transactions \nhaving a tendency to prove or disprove that persons, acting either \nindividually or in combination with others, engaged in any illegal, \nimproper, or unethical activities in connection with the Presidential \nelection of 1972, or any campaign, canvas, or activity related to such \nelection.''\n  That is the language of one of the parts of what the Watergate \nCommittee was to look into--any illegal, improper, or unethical \nactivities in connection with the Presidential election of 1972.\n  The narrowing of the scope of the Governmental Affairs investigation \nby the Rules Committee is nothing more than a blatant pander to those \nelements in the Republican Party that do not wish to reform the \ncampaign finance system and who are quite willing to scuttle the \nGovernmental Affairs investigation if necessary to avoid creating \npublic pressure to pass a decent bill.\n  How does narrowing the scope to illegal activities avoid this problem \nfor the Republicans? The first thing to understand is that the problem \nwith the campaign finance system is not just what politicians do that \nis illegal. It is what politicians do that is legal that is\n\n[[Page S2059]]\n\nan equal scandal, and it happens every single day on Capitol Hill and \nwith both political parties.\n  Let me give you an example. Let us talk about soft money. That is the \nbest example. One of the most pernicious influences in politics these \ndays is soft money. Let me give you an example of that. Let us say \nSenator X, whoever it might be, solicits $50,000 or $500,000 in soft \nmoney from a potential donor to his or her party, ostensibly for party-\nbuilding purposes, get-out-the-vote drives or the like. But the party \ncan then turn around and use the money on an issue ad during the \nSenator's reelection campaign that helps him or her and hurts the \nopponent.\n  According to the Department of Justice, Senator X can even do the \nsolicitation for that $500,000 from his or her office because the \nsolicitation is not for his or her campaign specifically but, rather, \nfor the Senator's party.\n  This practice should be illegal, but it is not. Suppose Senator X \nwants a direct contribution to his or her campaign from a potential \ndonor, direct to his personal campaign. In that case, Federal election \nlaw prohibits the donor from contributing more than $1,000 per person, \nand it must be in the donor's own name.\n\n  But that same donor can go out and collect checks of $1,000 for \nSenator X from everyone he knows, bundle them together, and send them \nto the Senator's campaign. Let us say Senator X calls from the \nSenator's office for those donations. If Senator X calls, he is \ncommitting an illegal act. But if Senator X calls from outside, it is \nOK.\n  Suppose Senator X is so grateful, wherever the call came from, for \nthe donor's willingness to help that the next time the donor is in town \nand wants to talk to Senator X about a legislative matter he has an \ninterest in, Senator X not only lets him into his office but he \nwelcomes him and listens to his pitch. And suppose that Senator X is \nsufficiently concerned about maintaining the donor's political help \nthat the Senator does what the donor wants on the issue and there was \nno discussion linking the donation to the donor's request or to the \nSenator's action.\n  In that case, there has been no bribe. But it is certainly the case \nthat Senator X made his decision on the issue as a result of the donor \nhaving had access to the Senator, access that was based at least in \npart on the donation the Senator was given.\n  Now, suppose Senator X made the original call to the donor from the \nSenator's office phone instead of from an outside phone. That would be \na violation of law. You cannot do that.\n  Let me pose the question. Which is the worst ethical lapse, making \nthe phone call from a legally prohibited place or letting the money \ninfluence the Senator's vote? I submit that the answer is not even \nclose. Senator X's constituents and the people generally will have been \nill served if he lets money influence his decision, and that \novershadows the question of whether the phone he used was a private \nphone or a Government phone.\n  What is the point of this fictitious example? Well, the resolution \nbefore us, which limits the scope of the investigation only to illegal \nactivities, would allow an investigation of whether Senator X committed \nan illegal act by using a Government phone for the direct solicitation \nif there was an allegation that he had done so but would allow no \ninvestigation of the contribution, and if a soft money contribution was \ninvolved, whether Senator X's party had spent that money on certain ads \nhelpful to the Senator's campaign, a legal practice but one that should \nbe illegal.\n  It is not just the independent expenditures by the major parties that \nis the problem. There are also the independent expenditures by outside \nprivate groups including tax-exempt organizations that should be \ninvestigated for possible collusion with party organizations. The \nWashington Post had an article yesterday concerning nonprofits. To \nquote them: ``Mysterious organizations that funded a flurry of attack \nads at the end of the 1996 election,'' that were targeted mainly \nagainst Democratic candidates. No one apparently knows who supports \nthem. One group, the Coalition for Our Children's Future, spent \n$700,000 on ads, mailings, phone banks, to help Republican candidates \nfrom Louisiana to California.\n  Another group, Citizens for Reform, spent $2 million on ads, \nincluding a mailing labeling a Democratic candidate for Congress as \nsexist and anticonsumer. And this organization is tax exempt. They are \nnot supposed to deal in political matters. In the case of tax-exempt \norganizations, collusion with a political party would be illegal but \nwould not involve criminal penalties. In the case of a so-called \n501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization, which is prohibited from engaging in \npolitical activity, there is the question of whether the placing of \ncertain issue ads should be considered political activity under certain \ncircumstances.\n  Will this be investigated by the Governmental Affairs Committee under \nthe funding resolutions' current scope statement? That will depend on \nhow the word ``illegal'' is interpreted. I must say, at several points \nalong the way we have had different interpretations of that word.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post \narticle be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GLENN. That is only the beginning of the problems with this \nresolution. It also requires that if any evidence of illegality is \ndiscovered in the 1996 campaign activities of a Member of Congress by a \nMember of Congress, then such evidence is to be referred to the Ethics \nCommittee.\n  Does that mean the committee's investigation is to be terminated at \nthat point? And, if the evidence comes to the attention of the \ncommittee before an investigation has even been initiated, does that \nmean the committee is to defer to the Ethics Committee for the \ninvestigation of the Member? Does referral to the Ethics Committee mean \nthat Governmental Affairs will defer to the Ethics Committee on any \npossible criminal referral to the Department of Justice? We need \nanswers to all of those things, obviously.\n  What if we are into an investigation and there is something that pops \nup that looks as though it might be an ethical matter and might be \nillegal, which this committee would be permitted to deal with? Since \nthere is this special provision with regard to ethics in the Senate, in \nreferring it to the Ethics Committee, do we have to stop any \ninvestigation before anything comes out beyond a point where there has \nbeen just an allegation of illegality?\n  So, let me return to the question of the meaning of the word \n``illegal'' in the resolution. What is the standard to be used by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee to determine that an activity involves \nan illegality and is therefore subject to an investigation? Is \nillegality meant to be equivalent to criminality? Or is it broader and \nincludes activities that are in violation of law but subject to only \ncivil penalties or no penalties at all? The answer to this question \nwill determine whether the activities of tax-exempt organizations \nengaged in political activity will be investigated.\n  I believe the questions I am raising need to be answered during this \ndebate so Members will know precisely what they are voting on when the \ntime comes. These questions also need to be answered in order to \nexamine whether the 54 subpoenas issued thus far by the chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee are within the new scope of the \ninvestigation.\n  Let me turn to some other deficiencies in the resolution. These are \nalso deficiencies of omission. My remarks stem once again from my \nbelief that a balanced investigation of fundraising by both parties, \nhighlighting legal transgressions as well as their legal but ethically \ndubious fundraising activities, could be effective in pointing the way \ntoward real reform. Conversely, an unbalanced, partisan investigation \nsuggesting that the problems lie solely or even mainly with one party \nwould be destructive to forging a consensus and would lead to political \ngames, possibly including an attempt to pass reform legislation crafted \nnot so much to fix the system as to give one party a fundraising \nadvantage over the other.\n  As the ranking Democrat on Governmental Affairs, I have urged the \nchairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee to follow standard \nSenate practices and enter into a written agreement that the \ninvestigation will be\n\n[[Page S2060]]\n\ncarried out in a bipartisan manner with an agreed-upon agenda and with \nfairness. That involves ensuring that both the majority and minority: \nhave contemporaneous access to all documentary evidence received by the \ncommittee; have the right to be given adequate advance notice of, to be \npresent at, and to participate equally in all depositions and \ninvestigatory interviews; have equal opportunity to obtain and present \nrelevant evidence on the subjects of the committee's inquiry; and, are \ntreated equally and without discrimination in the discharge of the \ncommittee's administrative responsibilities.\n  I regret to say that no agreement on these matters has been reached \nthus far. This has most egregiously shown up in the way subpoenas have \nbeen handled thus far.\n  I am hopeful that passage of a funding resolution for the committee's \ninvestigation will be the occasion to put this investigation back on a \nbipartisan track. I believe that failure to do so will redound to the \ncredit of no one and mark the first major stain on this committee's \nrecord of bipartisan cooperation during my 22-year tenure on it.\n  Finally, I must comment on that part of the resolution that provides \nfor authorization of some $450,000 in additional funds for the Rules \nCommittee to examine those aspects of campaign fundraising that are \noutside the scope of the Governmental Affairs Committee's investigation \nunder the terms of this resolution as currently written. It is \ncertainly true that the Rules Committee has legislative jurisdiction \nover campaign finance reform and, therefore, can look into soft money \nand independent expenditures, among other things, as policy matters.\n  But the Rules Committee is not basically an investigative committee. \nI could not recall the last time it ever issued a subpoena. We made \nsome inquiry into this and found that no subpoenas have been issued by \nthe committee since at least 1980. We do not know whether any were \nbefore that time or not. They may do hearings, but that is not the same \nas an investigation as conceived under this resolution.\n  Let us not deceive the public about this. Recent press reports \nclearly indicated that at least two members of the Rules Committee, \nRepublican members of the Rules Committee, would not vote for the \nfunding resolution for the investigation that originally came out of \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee because the scope of the \ninvestigation would have included legal as well as illegal \ncongressional fundraising practices. Those Members were concerned that \nthe result of such an investigation might be to raise public pressure \non Congress to pass campaign finance reform legislation.\n  The fact is, there is little support for campaign reform among my \nRepublican colleagues. The McCain-Feingold bill has only one other \nRepublican cosponsor, and that is Senator Thompson, to his credit. So \nwe know what game is being played with the Rules Committee rewrite of \nthe previously-agreed-to scope of the Governmental Affairs Committee's \ninvestigation. It is a game in which legal but improper congressional \nfundraising is kept off the table while a parade of Presidential \nfundraisers for the Democratic Party and the Clinton-Gore campaign are \nbrought before the cameras at televised hearings, to give the \nimpression that all the problems are with the Democratic Party and \nthere is no need to change the laws.\n  I do not believe it will work. I do not believe the American people \nare that naive. I believe they will see through such a strategy were it \nto unfold. Chairman Thompson has said congressional fundraising should \nbe on the table. I agree with him. That is one of the reasons I was \ndisappointed when none of his first 65 subpoenas were directed toward \ncongressional fundraising. I and my Democratic colleagues will attempt \nto broaden the scope to include legal activities that are improper, \nwhich is where many of the major campaign finance problems are, and \nwhich should be thoroughly investigated by the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. So, I hope--in fact I invite Chairman Thompson to join me in \ncosponsoring an amendment I plan to offer to broaden the scope, and I \ninvite him to join me in voting against tabling any such amendment.\n  I also invite all Members of the Senate, Democratic and Republican, \nwho truly want to change our system to join us.\n  Let us look at it from your children's perspective of 20 years from \nnow. Whichever party is in the majority--and that may have changed in \nthat time, maybe before that--but look at your children as adults out \nthere, taking part in the political system at that time. Whichever \nparty is in the majority at that time, I am sure we can all hope that \npolitical fundraising will not be the mess that it is today. One way to \ngain that end is to assure that investigations are carried out now \nwithout fear or favor and spotlighting the dark corners, whether \nillegal or legal, but in either event, wrong, improper, and unethical.\n  The resolution before us does not take us in that direction, and that \nis why I also urge Senator Thompson, even if we fail to pass such an \namendment, to seek every opportunity at our committee level to examine \nand thoroughly investigate any alleged illegal fundraising activities \nby Members of Congress, in the House or Senate. That will at least be a \nstart, and I pledge my full support to such efforts.\n  So I await with interest his proposed agenda and subpoenas in this \narea.\n  At the appropriate time today, before we finish this debate, I will \nhave an amendment to submit. I would like to lay it down this evening. \nI doubt all the people on either side of the aisle who wish to speak on \nthe amendment will return before we go out of session, but I would like \nto have time later on to submit the amendment before we go out of \nsession this evening.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 9, 1997]\n\n  For Their Targets, Mystery Groups' Ads Hit Like Attacks From Nowhere\n\n                (By Charles R. Babcock and Ruth Marcus)\n\n       Campaign watchdog groups and government regulators are \n     concerned about the emergence of mysterious organizations \n     that funded a flurry of attack ads at the end the 1996 \n     election and could play an even larger role in coming \n     campaigns.\n       The groups, with bland names such as Citizens for Reform \n     and the Republic Education Fund, spent millions of dollars on \n     television advertising, mailings and telephone banks in the \n     closing weeks of the campaign, mostly on the side of the \n     Republicans. None of their activities was reported to the \n     Federal Election Commission (FEC).\n       ``The public has no idea who these people are or where \n     they're coming from or who funds them,'' said Charles Lewis, \n     executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, which \n     monitors political ethics. ``They are trying to influence the \n     political process and the public is in the dark.''\n       For example, a group called the Coalition for Our \n     Children's Future spent more than $700,000 on television and \n     radio ads, mailings, and telephone banks to bolster GOP \n     candidates in key races from Louisiana to California.\n       The last-minute onslaught, financed in part by a donor who \n     demanded a written confidentiality agreement, was conducted \n     without the knowledge or approval of the group's directors. \n     Two of the directors resigned in protest after The Washington \n     Post informed them of the late ads, saying they never \n     approved the expenditures. They said they still do not know \n     exactly what was done or the source of funding.\n       Former director Deborah Steelman, a GOP lobbyist, said she \n     thought the group had been inactive since spending more than \n     $4 million on advertising backing the GOP's legislative \n     agenda in 1995. ``Clearly, the organization created another \n     mission of which we were not a part,'' she said.\n       Like the more identifiable AFL-CIO and environmental groups \n     that also ran advertising, leaders of organizations such as \n     the coalition say their television commercials were not \n     political because they did not explicitly endorse a \n     candidate. Since they were engaging in ``issue advocacy,'' \n     they said, they were not required to report to the FEC the \n     source of their funds or how much they spent.\n       One group created last spring and calling itself Citizens \n     for Reform spent $2 million in the closing days, according to \n     its president, conservative activist Peter Flaherty. In \n     California, it sent mailings into the district of Democratic \n     Rep. George Brown accusing him of being sexist and anti-\n     consumer. The Consumer Federation of America, cited as the \n     source in one flier although it endorsed Brown, denounced the \n     mailing as ``extremely misleading and grossly unfair.'' In \n     Montana, the group bought television time calling Democratic \n     congressional candidate Bill Yellowtail a convicted criminal \n     who ``preaches family values . . . but took a swing at his \n     wife.''\n       Another new group called Citizens for the Republic \n     Educaiton Fund obtained at least $1 million in late ads, \n     according to director Lyn Nofziger, longtime political aide \n     to Ronald Reagan. In Texas, it bought television ads against \n     Democratic congressional candidate Nick Lampson that said he \n     had been\n\n[[Page S2061]]\n\n     accused of Medicare fraud. In Erie, Pa., another television \n     ad denounced ``big labor bosses'' for trying to buy ``a \n     Congress they can control.''\n       Some ads were so inflammatory that the Republican \n     candidates they were designed to help denounced them. And \n     some stations would not run some ads or pulled them off the \n     air after complaints by Democratic candidates. Leaders of the \n     groups targeting Democrats say they operated independently \n     and they and GOP officials said the groups were not fronts \n     for the party.\n       Nofziger called it, ``outrageous'' that advocacy groups \n     like his are allowed to ``go and run political ads and call \n     them education.'' He added, ``We wouldn't have had to do it \n     if it had not been for labor'' and its attacks on GOP \n     candidates.\n       The Flaherty and Nofziger groups were run by a Washington-\n     based firm, Triad Management, that advertises itself as sort \n     of an underground version of the Republican Party. A Triad \n     marketing video includes testimonials from Sen. Don Nickles \n     (R-Okla.) and several House members aimed at recruiting \n     donors for what the video labels a ``privatized Republican \n     national coalition.''\n       Triad's Carolyn Malenick, a former fund-raiser for Oliver \n     L. North, says on the video that labor has always been the \n     ``rapid fire'' of the Democratic Party. ``If the Republican \n     Party needs that quote `rapid fire' where're we going to find \n     it?'' she said. ``If we need to move or have $100,000 put \n     into a congressional race tomorrow where're we going to find \n     it?'' Malenick declined to be interviewed.\n       Mark Braden, Triad's attorney, said the group was not a \n     front for the GOP or a particular special interest, like the \n     tobacco industry. Malenick's donors are mostly individuals \n     from ``ideologically driven networks,'' he said.\n       While most of the late negative issue ads with mysterious \n     sponsors targeted Democratic races, a labor-funded group, the \n     '96 Project, paid for voter guides mailed in the name of \n     other groups in 14 races. The project paid $50,000 for \n     mailings in six House districts where the fliers said they \n     were ``sponsored'' by local or state affiliates of the \n     National Council of Senior Citizens, a group made up \n     predominantly of retired union members. There was no mention \n     of the '96 Project in the mailings.\n       Scott Wolf, director of the project, said there was no \n     intent to deceive the public on who was behind the mailings, \n     which made GOP candidates look unfavorable on key issues.\n       His group also paid for mailings in eight races \n     ``sponsored'' by the Interfaith Alliance, a group of \n     ministers formed as an alternative to the Christian \n     Coalition, according to the alliance's Greg Lebel. Lebel said \n     ``it never occurred to us'' voters might be misled because \n     the eight mailings said only that the '96 Project \n     ``prepared'' the voter guides.\n       Most of the late money from obscure groups was spent on \n     television. And Federal Communications Commission officials \n     who monitor political advertising say their authority over \n     broadcasters is limited. Charles Kelley, chief of enforcement \n     for the FCC's mass media bureau, said the agency wants to \n     know ``who is the attempted persuader'' in such ads. The \n     question, he said, is ``what legal authority we have, if any, \n     to obligate the true sponsor to step forward.''\n       The FCC managed to do that in a case in Oregon last fall, \n     when it discovered that a group calling itself Fairness \n     Matters to Oregonians was being financed by the Tobacco \n     Institute. The FCC ruled the group's ads, which opposed an \n     increase in the state cigarette tax, could be aired but the \n     tobacco Institute had to be identified as the sponsor.\n       Various campaign reform proposals in Congress attempt to \n     address the late attacks by saying the name or image of \n     candidates cannot be mentioned in ads in the last 60 days \n     before the general election. But many lawmakers and interest \n     groups say such proposals would put unconstitutional limits \n     on their First Amendment rights.\n       Flaherty, who also heads the Conservative Campaign Fund \n     PAC, said concerns about sponsorship are misplaced. ``Most \n     people when they see an ad don't focus on who put it on, but \n     focus on the message,'' he said. ``If the message has \n     strength and credibility it will persuade people. If it \n     doesn't, it won't.'' In applying for tax-exempt status, which \n     allowed it to avoid paying taxes on investment income, \n     Citizens for Reform told the IRS it had no plans to spend \n     money ``attempting to influence'' elections. But asked \n     whether the groups' advertising had been effective, Flaherty \n     said, ``I think we made a big difference. It was an absolute \n     onslaught in some of these areas by labor and liberal groups \n     and I think we helped stanch the bleeding artery.''\n       Perhaps the most peculiar of the late ad campaigns was the \n     one run in the name of the Coalition for our Children's \n     Future, which spent money in six House districts, the \n     Louisiana Senate race and 12 Minnesota legislative races, \n     according to Executive Director Barry Bennett.\n       Two directors, Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National \n     Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, and Donald L. Fierce, \n     a GOP consultant and former Republican National Committee \n     aide, resigned in protest; two others, Steelman and Gary \n     Andres, had left the board earlier.\n       How the unauthorized advertising campaign was launched and \n     how races were targeted remains murky. Bennett, working in \n     Ohio at the time of the election as chief of staff to then-\n     Rep. Frank A. Cremeans (R), at first said he did not know of \n     any extensive late advertising. Then he acknowledged he had \n     signed the secrecy agreement with the donor and signed blank \n     checks to pay a Houston political consultant who ran the \n     advertising campaign. Bennett said he did so without telling \n     board members.\n       Bennett and the group's fund-raising consultant, John \n     Simms, said the consultant, Denis Calabrese, approached them \n     last summer and helped connect them with some donors, who \n     they declined to identify. Calabrese, who has worked on \n     industry's side to make it harder to win large damage awards \n     in lawsuits, did not return numerous phone calls.\n       Bennett said he had tried without success, after the Post \n     inquiries, to obtain copies of the television scripts from \n     Simms' firm. He said he had no idea what the coalition, \n     organized to address federal issues, was doing in Minnesota \n     statehouse races.\n       ``Am I embarrassed by this?'' Bennett said before he \n     stopped returning phone calls. ``Yes . . . I understand we've \n     created a huge mystery here and that's our fault.''\n\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there are others anxious to speak to this. \nI see Senator Hatch is here, and I want to, just in reply to my \ndistinguished friend and colleague, say a few words here, and then \nSenator Hatch, hopefully, will take the floor momentarily.\n  First, I want to make it very clear, I am not going to personalize \nthis debate in any way or use the word ``pandering.'' Nobody is \npandering anybody around here. What we are trying to do is how to get \nas quickly as possible to the point where the U.S. Senate, in several \ncommittees, can start looking into this very important issue, hopefully \nin a fair and objective manner, for the best interests of this \ninstitution and our country.\n  I have been in politics--I am almost hesitant to mention how many \nyears--but it is a good 40-plus, and I have never in my lifetime ever \nseen a situation engulfing this great Nation, casting more doubt in the \nminds of the voters with regard to how we, those who serve in the \nCongress and those who serve in the executive branch as the President \nand Vice President, go about the process of elections, and we have to \nget at the bottom of this thing as quickly as possible.\n  I have indicated my support for Chairman Fred Thompson as a man I \nhave absolute faith in, who can deal with this matter fairly and \nobjectively, and I have said that for weeks. Never once have I \ndeviated, and I do not think there will ever be a basis that I shall \ndeviate. I said from the beginning that I want to support him as an \nindividual. I want to support the work of his committee. But there is a \nvery careful delineation of responsibilities here among the several \ncommittees, and there is clearly, within the jurisdiction of the Rules \nCommittee, which I am privileged to chair, the right to superimpose our \nown judgment on the scope and activities of the other committees of the \nSenate as it relates to those funds under our jurisdiction.\n  This is in no way any bald-faced effort by myself or other members of \nthe Rules Committee, particularly the distinguished majority leader, \nwho was just on the floor consulting with me minutes ago, no way to try \nto do other than what I have just said, which is to get the Senate on \nthe track as quickly as possible. We just have to get beyond all of \nthis procedure business and get on with the business.\n  I said that I drew this scope language, drawing from the Watergate. I \nnever said I used it. I have read it now probably 25 times and studied \nthe history of it. I know all the words that are in it. It is \ninteresting. In the Watergate resolution, I ask my friend, if he wants \nto debate it later on, whether or not you find any authority in there \nto investigate the Congress. I do not find it in the Watergate \nresolution, but it is very clearly expressed in this resolution as \nadopted by the Rules Committee. We in no way tried to obfuscate that \nissue.\n  This volume is the ``Authority and Rules of Senate Committees'' for \nthe last fiscal year, but it is applicable to this. I would like to \njust read the question of jurisdiction of the Rules Committee, and it \nis found on page 155 of that book. It states we have the authority to \ninvestigate ``corrupt practices.''\n  Now that is about as broad as any charter can be--as broad as any \ncharter can be. Then go to section 5:\n\n\n[[Page S2062]]\n\n\n       Federal elections generally, including the election of the \n     President, Vice President, and Members of the Congress.\n\n  There it is. That is the jurisdiction of the Rules Committee.\n  Now go over to the jurisdiction of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee--and I urge my colleague from Ohio to take a moment or two to \nlook through this book so that he can reply--found on page 101, and in \ndetail on page 102, where it says, the committee is duly authorized, or \na subcommittee thereof is authorized to study and investigate.\n  You do not find--at least I haven't thus far in studying it--that \nprecise language as it relates to the Rules Committee concerning \njurisdiction over precisely what it is that the U.S. Senate must \ninvestigate. If anything, this volume gives clearly the authority to \nthe Rules Committee, and I find less specificity as it relates to the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee.\n\n  Lastly, as to campaign finance reform, the generic subject, the Rules \nCommittee held a number of hearings last year. We already commenced our \nseries of hearings this year. The distinguished majority leader \ndesignated the majority whip, Mr. Nickles, and a group of us, including \nthe Senator from Virginia speaking, and it is our responsibility to try \nto come up with a grouping of proposals which we have reason to believe \nwill effect the greatest possible reform in this generic subject of \ncampaign finance reform.\n  You bet there are areas which I would like to see changed. In my last \ncampaign, I experienced spending by my opponent--and I do not castigate \nhim in any way at this point in time, nor did I ever--but clearly he \nhad the authority under the Supreme Court decision to spend all the \nmoney of his personal funds he wished. He set a record in the history \nof the U.S. Senate races from the first day this body was constituted \nthrough and including today for the greatest amount of money spent for \na State per capita in the United States.\n  I think we should enact some legislation that would curtail, in some \nmanner, the limit of an individual to expend millions and millions and \nmillions of dollars. In the case of my race, it is presumably in \nexcess, it was reported, $10 million out of personal spending. Maybe \nsubsequent records will show an additional amount, but that is not here \nto argue. The point being, the only way that can be done is by a \nconstitutional amendment. I would not want to see this body rest its \nentire package of reforms that a constitutional amendment is going to \nbe adopted in this area of campaign finance reform.\n  My own personal opinion, it is highly unlikely that such an \namendment, even though I would favor certain types of constitutional \namendments on campaign reform, that that can be achieved; essentially, \nthe first amendment, which, again, would require a constitutional \namendment. There are many areas of campaign finance reform that would \nbe solely predicated on the ability to get a constitutional amendment \nin order to achieve those goals.\n  I would not want to see this body pass a package of campaign finance \nreform proposals knowing full well in our hearts that the Federal court \nis going to strike down in large measure a number of those provisions.\n  So I look forward to continuing to work with the distinguished \nmajority leader and the majority whip in seeing what we can come up \nwith in a package of campaign finance reform proposals which can be \nadopted by this body and, Mr. President, can withstand the essential \nscrutiny that will come about by the third branch of Government, \nnamely, the Federal court system.\n  Mr. President, I now yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it befalls me to make a few comments here \ntoday concerning why this investigation is so important. Before I do, I \nwant to compliment the Rules Committee and the people on the Rules \nCommittee who have handled this very difficult subject matter and have \ndone it in a credible and responsible way.\n  I also personally believe that no two people could handle this matter \nbetter than the chairman and ranking member of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. Senator Thompson has had extensive experience in these \nmatters and Senator Glenn is known as an eminently fair and worthy \nperson here in this body. I have total confidence in both of them that \nthey will be fair, they will be thorough, they will be tough, and they \nwill do what is right.\n  We simply have to get to the bottom of this. The American people are \nconcerned about it. Certainly the media has written extensively about \nthese matters. It is incumbent upon the Senate in its oversight \ncapacity to investigate these matters fairly and thoroughly.\n  As we take up Senate Resolution 39 today, I would like to just take a \nfew minutes to emphasize one major point: That there is a serious \nnumber of very, very troubling matters to investigate, simply at the \nvery core of Senators Thompson's and Glenn's inquiry.\n  Merely in recent press reports--if that is all you had--there are \nvery substantial and troubling questions that must be answered \nregarding whether foreign money and foreign influence has infiltrated \nthe American political process. While numerous other allegations of \nimproper fundraising at the White House and by the White House have \nsurfaced in the media in the past week or so, that is not what I want \nto talk about today.\n  Even putting aside all of those allegations, the fact is that we have \nbefore us very serious allegations that China funneled funds into \nAmerican elections in an attempt to influence American policy and \npolicymakers. The gravity of these allegations should not and must not \nbe underestimated. Were our national interests sold out? I hope they \nwere not. But this matter must be pursued, and it must be done in a \nthorough, fair, and honest manner.\n  Later this week the Judiciary Committee will forward a letter to the \nAttorney General requesting that she apply for an independent counsel. \nTo date, she has refused to do so in this matter. I do not read \nanything sinister into that--I believe that the Attorney General is an \nhonorable, ethical person of integrity. She has applied for the \nappointment of no less than four independent counsels since she has \nbeen Attorney General. I think she has shown that she is a person who \ncan act. But to date she has refused to act on this matter.\n  Accordingly, Congress must be all the more vigilant. And given the \napparent conflict of interest, the public will be relying on Congress \nto ascertain the facts and get to the bottom of this whole affair.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee inquiry into fundraising \nimproprieties is, in my opinion, one of the most important \ncongressional investigations in history and involves some of the most \nserious allegations we have seen to date about our electoral system and \nour Government. The press and congressional committees have uncovered \nmaterial facts that prompt numerous questions:\n  First, did a foreign government try to influence our national \nelections and our domestic and/or foreign policy?\n  No. 2, were millions of dollars of foreign money laundered through \nvarious groups to the Democratic National Committee, particularly by \nthree individuals--Charlie Trie, Johnny Chung, and John Huang, all of \nwhom have some ties to China.\n  No. 3, were there violations of any of our existing laws, such as the \nHatch Act, the Ethics in Government Act, and our current Federal \nelections laws?\n  The breadth of this particular investigation is immense. We cannot \nallow ourselves, in an attempt to satisfy the tendentious cause for a \nbroad inquiry into congressional campaigns, to interfere with what is a \nserious matter.\n  Investigating the 1996 Presidential campaign alone will require a \nvery substantial budget and a substantial amount of time--I presume \neven more time than the Rules Committee has allowed in this instance, \nwhich is only until the end of this year or approximately 8 months. I \nsuspect this will go on beyond that and will have to go on beyond that \nbecause of what will be brought out. Let us focus for a moment, \nhowever, in terms of the breadth of this investigation, on one \nindividual--Mr. John Huang. He was born in China. He worked for the \nLippo Group, a huge conglomerate based in Indonesia with large business \ninterests in China. Lippo is owned and controlled by the Riady family--\nMochtar, James, and Stephen. These are also Chinese natives.\n\n[[Page S2063]]\n\n  By 1994, Huang was the top Lippo executive in the United States.\n  Huang was appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary for International \nEconomic Policy in our Department of Commerce in September 1994.\n  Let me just go down through what John Huang did while employed at \nCommerce--just a quick glance. He was, according to reports, given a \ntop security clearance without the usual background check, which is all \nbut unheard of; 78-plus visits to the White House; 70-plus calls to \nLippo during this period of time; 39 classified top secret briefings \ndwelling on China and other countries in Asia; 30-plus phone \nconversations with Mark Middleton or associates; 9 phone messages from \nor calls to Webster Hubbell; 9 phone messages from the Chinese Embassy \nofficials; 5 months of top secret clearance before joining the Commerce \nDepartment. In other words, even before he got in this very important \nposition in Government, he had 5 months of top secret clearance. Why? \nThat is a question that is going to be a big question in this matter.\n  Huang enjoyed a top secret clearance for 5 months of top secret \nclearance before joining Commerce and nearly a year after leaving \nCommerce to join the Democratic National Committee. Why? Why would \nthose security clearances go with him outside of Government? Why would \nhe be permitted this kind of access to very sensitive information? \nThese are questions that are very important. Taken with the $780,000 \nseverance pay Huang received from Lippo prior to joining the Commerce \nDepartment, these facts naturally raise questions.\n  This next chart involves a meeting at the White House to discuss the \nHuang transfer from the White House to the Democratic National \nCommittee on September 13, 1995. It was an Oval Office meeting. The \nPresident was there. James Riady, the Lippo executive was there. Bruce \nLindsey, the Deputy White House Counsel, was there. Joseph Giroir, who \nis, I believe, the former top partner in the Rose Law Firm, the Lippo \njoint venture partner/adviser, former Rose Law Firm partner, and, if I \nrecall correctly, was the managing partner of that firm, and none other \nthan John Huang, former Lippo executive, Principal Deputy Assistant, \nSecretary of Commerce.\n  At this meeting, it was decided that John Huang would move from the \nCommerce Department to the Democratic National Committee as vice \nchairman of finance.\n  We do not know what happened at this meeting, although some extremely \ntroubling explanations have been reported by the media. Each one of \nthese people, it seems to me, with the possible exception of the \nPresident, will have to be questioned regarding just what went on at \nthat meeting, why Huang left Commerce, and why he was immediately \ntransferred to the Democratic National Committee as the finance vice \nchairman, why James Riady, was even at this meeting. That is a very \nimportant meeting.\n  Let me put another chart up here.\n  This is John Huang at the Democratic National Committee. These are \nexamples of illegal funds raised by Huang. The Wiriadinatas raised \n$450,000, all of which was returned by the DNC. Pauline Kanchanalak, \n$250,000. She has since left the country. She is now in Thailand. All \nfunds returned by the DNC. Wogesh Gandhi, $250,000. He testified he had \nno assets. All funds returned by the DNC, the Democratic National \nCommittee.\n  Cheong Am America--or John H.K. Lee--$250,000. Like Kanchanalak and \nothers, Cheong Am America--or John H.K. Lee--has disappeared. All of \nthese funds were returned by the Democratic National Committee. Hsi Lai \nBuddhist Temple, $166,750: This comes from a temple where the residents \ntake a vow of poverty; $74,000 of the $166,750 was returned by the DNC. \nAll together, that we know of, John Huang raised $3.4 million, $1.6 \nmillion of which has been returned by the Democratic National \nCommittee.\n\n  These are just a few of some of the problems that I think the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee is going to have to go into. I do not \nsee how they can avoid doing it. To give a picture of some of the \npeople who seem to be involved in this, let me just highlight some of \nthe other individuals involved in this affair.\n  We start with John Huang, former top Lippo executive in the United \nStates, who had a $780,000 severance package when he went to Congress. \nHe had multiple contacts while there with Lippo.\n  The former Democratic National Committee vice chairman raised more \nthan $3.4 million, $1.6 million was returned, and he visited the White \nHouse during this period more than 75 times. C.J. Giroir, in the Lippo \njoint ventures, former Rose Law Firm attorney, met with James Riady, \nPresident Clinton, and Lindsey on the Huang move to DNC, and donated \n$25,000 to the DNC. Mark Middleton, former White House aide from Little \nRock, met with James Riady and President Clinton on that occasion, Far \nEast business interests, had unlimited access to the White House after \nhis departure.\n  Charles Trie, Little Rock restauranteur, received a $60,000 loan from \nLippo, and he arranged with the former Lippo executive Antonio Pan to \nget a Hong Kong dinner for Ron Brown. Trie also attempted to give \n$600,000 to the Clinton legal trust fund, and he visited the White \nHouse at least 37 times.\n  Mark Grobmyer, Little Rock attorney, close friend of President \nClinton, consultant to Lippo, Far East business interests, met with \nJames Riady, Huang and President Clinton. Soraya Wiriadinata, daughter \nof Hashin Ning, former Lippo executive, contributed $450,000 to the \nDNC, and it was all returned, according to the committee. Soraya has \ngone back to Indonesia.\n  S. Wang Jun, Lippo joint ventures, Chinese arms merchant, senior \nexecutive at CITIC and COSTIND, Chinese Government entities, and \nattended a White House conference. Webster Hubbell, former Associate \nAttorney General, received a $250,000 consulting fee from Lippo--would \nnot say why he got that.\n  Charles DeQueljoe is the president of Lippo Securities in Jakarta, \ngave $70,000 to the Democratic National Committee and was appointed to \nthe USTR office. Pauline Kanchanalak, a Thai lobbyist who worked with \nHuang when he was at Lippo, contributed $253,000 to the DNC, and it was \nall returned. She had frequent contacts with Huang. She visited the \nWhite House at least 26 times. And then we come back to John Huang \nhimself.\n  Now, all of these people are going to have to be interviewed. We are \ngoing to have to find out what the facts are here. What was going on? \nWere there illegalities?\n  In that regard, these are key players who have taken the fifth \namendment: John Huang, Charlie Trie, Pauline Kanchanalak, Mark \nMiddleton, and Webster Hubbell. I do not see how anybody on the other \nside of the floor can argue that this set of hearings should not go on, \nor that this would not take almost every second of any committee's \ntime, and I am only talking about one aspect of it. There are many \nother aspects to this.\n  The key players who have left the country--and we have not been given \nreasons why they left the country--are John H.K. Lee--gone. If he is \ngoing to be interviewed, it is overseas. Charlie Trie, gone, after \ntaking the fifth. Pauline Kanchanalak, gone--as far as I know, back in \nThailand, after having taken the fifth amendment. Arief and Soraya \nWiriadinata, gone. Charles DeQueljoe, gone. And James and Mochtar \nRiady, gone. They left the country.\n  All this is a brief discussion of one aspect of this. There are other \naspects of this, but this is a brief glimpse into some of the serious \nallegations the Government Oversight Committee will have to look into. \nI emphasize the point with which I opened, just that at the core of \nthis investigation is a vast series of matters which must be looked \ninto. This will be one of the most important congressional \ninvestigations in history. I hope it is not obstructed by partisan \ntactics and politics. I hope with all my heart it is not. I think the \nAmerican people expect as much.\n\n  When I found out over the weekend that the FBI--and I did not know \nthis before--had notified seven Members of Congress that they might be \nreceiving laundered funds from a foreign country, mainly China, I was \nkind of shocked at that, because if they informed those seven Members \nof Congress, surely the FBI informed the White House. I have been led \nto believe by the FBI they informed the National Security Council. That \nbeing the case,\n\n[[Page S2064]]\n\nwhy are all these people having such access to our White House under \nthose circumstances? As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, as \nchairman of the committee that oversees the Justice Department and the \nFBI, naturally, I have to be concerned about it.\n  Now, in addition to all of this, there are newer revelations coming \nout every day. I challenge the Government Affairs Committee to \nsubstantiate these allegations, to look into them.\n  Let me just list some of the new revelations about the campaign \nfinance scandals that were first reported after the Governmental \nAffairs Committee made a request of $6.5 million to investigate the \nscandal.\n  First, Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes made a telephone call from \nAir Force One to warn of the wiring of the money to the Democratic \nNational Committee and additional funds to nonprofit organizations. \nThere is some indication they used Air Force One for the purpose of \nraising funds. I hope that is not the case.\n  Second, questions have been raised concerning whether the White House \ndatabase was created for official--as opposed to political--purposes, \nsince it contained individuals' Social Security numbers, nicknames, \nrelations to the First Family, pet political issues, and sometimes a \nphotograph.\n  Third, China may have sought to influence U.S. policy through the \ndirection of foreign campaign contributions to the Democratic National \nCommittee and actions taken at the Chinese embassy. It has been \ndisclosed that Huang had contacts with the embassy while he worked at \nCommerce.\n  Fourth, the NSC, National Security Council, at the White House \nprovided the White House with warnings about Johnny Chung, who has ties \nto the Chinese Government, who was nonetheless subsequently granted \naccess to the White House on numerous occasions, even though they knew \nabout those ties.\n  Fifth, Huang approached two business associates and offered to pay \nthem $45,000 if they would take $250,000 from him and donate it in \ntheir own names to the Democratic National Committee. That is illegal.\n  Sixth, the White House fired four staff members whose salaries were \nbeing paid by the Democratic National Committee while they were working \nat the White House. I don't know whether that has ever been done \nbefore, but it should not be done.\n  There are other allegations, but let me just mention a couple of \nother things. The Democratic National Committee returned another $1.5 \nmillion in illegal or questionable campaign funds that have to be \nlooked into. The FBI warned, as I have said, seven Members of Congress \nthat the Chinese Government was laundering money into the United \nStates' election process. The FBI warned the National Security Council \nas well. We checked that today. And I have to tell you, just this one \nset of allegations could take more than a year or two just to get into \nthem. It's going to take overseas travel; it's going to be very \ndifficult with people taking the fifth amendment, with people possibly \nhiding documents and withholding them, and with just this one problem \nburgeoning and getting bigger every day.\n  So I commend the Rules Committee and the majority leader for getting \nthis thing off dead center and providing the money so the Governmental \nAffairs Committee can look into these matters and resolve them one way \nor the other.\n  I wish some of these things were not true. I certainly don't wish \nanyone any harm. But, unfortunately, if you look at the facts that I \nhave just given to you today, I think it's very unlikely that these \nmatters are going to be disproven. But I hope they can be.\n  It is going to be up to this Governmental Affairs Committee to look \ninto it. I think that committee is very capable of doing this. The two \nleaders are among the best in the Senate. I expect them to do a \nterrific job. Senator Thompson, in particular, has had extensive \nexperience because of his experience in the Watergate investigation and \nother investigations since then. He is an excellent lawyer, one of the \nbest who has ever served in the Congress of the United States. I don't \nknow anybody who will be more fair and more decent to the people who \nare being investigated. I think the same goes for the distinguished \nSenator from Ohio, Senator Glenn, for whom I have great friendship and \nfondness, and who I know will do an honest and decent job here.\n  I don't think we should get so caught up in this context, in some of \nthe issues that are being raised collaterally. I know the distinguished \nSenator from Ohio is not raising campaign finance reform to take the \nedge off of these issues.\n  I don't want to get into that today, because I think that is \nirrelevant to what needs to be looked into by the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. Now they are going to have a charter to proceed and, I \nthink, a fair amount of money to at least begin these investigations. \nHopefully, these investigations can be completed within the time \nallotted. But, if not, I think the Senate is going to have to look at \nit and extend the time if this burgeons into what many think it will.\n  With that, I thought some of these matters were important to bring \nout today in the beginning of this debate, so people realize this isn't \njust some little erstwhile decision by the Rules Committee; this is a \nvery important, well-thought-out resolution of what has been a very \ndifficult set of problems, which had a tendency to be greatly \npoliticized over the last few weeks.\n\n  I commend the chairman of the Rules Committee, the majority leader, \nand the others who have worked so hard on this important matter for the \nwork they have done.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend and \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Utah. Indeed, he points out, really, \nthe tip of the iceberg here, in terms of the scope of the problem of \nall the issues that befall the Senate of the United States. There is \nplenty of work for everyone. I urge that it be done in accordance with \nthe established rules and precedence of the U.S. Senate as to the \nallocation and responsibilities among the several committees.\n  I certainly join in the Senator's observation about the chairman of \nGovernmental Affairs, Senator Thompson, and my good friend, the senior \nSenator from Ohio. A note of irony here. The two of us used to do a lot \nof the investigation for the Senate Armed Services Committee a decade \nor so ago, and I thought we did it rather well. By the way, Mr. \nPresident, we didn't have any charter or much money, but we got the job \ndone and did it quite well, for the wonderful men who preceded us on \nthe Armed Services Committee, Senators Stennis, Tower, and Jackson. \nThey gave us special tasks and we followed through.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, with all due respect to my colleagues--\nand I have a lot of respect for my colleagues on the other side--I \nthink the decision of the Rules Committee doesn't represent a step \nforward, it represents a great leap sideways.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee had voted unanimously to have a \nfull inquiry. The inquiry certainly was going to focus on illegalities, \nbut also on improprieties. That's the way we should proceed. The Rules \nCommittee has stripped down the scope. And for people in the country \nwho care fiercely about our getting away from auctions and back to \nelections, for people in the country who care about our getting away \nfrom what we have right now, which is pseudo-democracy, with big money \ndominating, back to authentic democracy, what the Rules Committee has \ndone represents not a step forward, but a great leap sideways. It is a \ngreat leap sideways from an investigation that has to take place.\n  Mr. President, I know that sometimes we don't know what we don't want \nto know. But, quite frankly, I don't believe that this Congress is \ngoing to be able to step sideways from a full investigation into all of \nthe ways in which money has come to dominate politics today in the \nUnited States of America.\n  Mr. President, my colleague Senator Glenn, at some point in his \nprepared remarks, said something like: Even what is legal quite often \ncan be scandalous when you are looking at all the ways which money and \npolitics interact today, and it really undercuts the whole idea of \nrepresentative democracy. He is absolutely correct. We all\n\n[[Page S2065]]\n\nknow that there are all sorts of examples of, No. 1, too much money \nbeing spent in these campaigns; No. 2, too much special interest \naccess; we all know all about that; No. 3, too much of a money chase \nwith Senators spending way too much time, more than any of us want to, \nraising money; No. 4, therefore, a system where regular people, \nordinary citizens, which I do not use in a pejorative sense but in a \npositive way, don't even think they can play the game. That is what we \nare facing--money determining who gets to run, money determining who is \nconsidered a viable candidate, money determining the outcome of an \nelection, money determining what issues are on the agenda, money \ndetermining which people are here lobbying every day and which are left \nout, and money determining the outcome. This really represents a \ncorruption. But I am not talking about corruption as in the wrongdoing \nof individual officeholders. I am not here to bash any colleague on \neither side of the aisle. I am talking about a corruption which is \nsystemwide. It is systemic. It is systemic corruption in the following \nsense: Too few people with this system we have right now, this rotten \nsystem we have right now, have far too much wealth, power, say, and \naccess to decisionmakers, and the vast majority of people are left out \nof the loop. That is what is going on in the country.\n\n  My colleagues want to narrow the scope of inquiry. The Rules \nCommittee basically has made an end run around the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. The Governmental Affairs Committee at one point in time had \na unanimous vote. What happened? What happened? At one time the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee said we are going to be a reform \ncommittee, and we are going to look at illegal behavior--by the way, we \nshould; I am not defending any of it--and, in addition, we are going to \nlook at improper behavior, what is inappropriate, and if people have \nspecial-color stamps for big contributors, maybe that is not \nappropriate, and if people take folks on trips and give them access to \nRepublicans and Democrats based on their being big contributors, maybe \nthat is not right. If people have special meetings, special dinners \nwith special access to Senators because they are big givers or heavy \nhitters or well connected, maybe that is not right. Or if there is \nevidence of people being invited to help write legislation because they \nare big givers, maybe that is not right. Or if there is a meeting with \na business community or labor community and one party or the other \nsays, ``We noticed you have made contributions to Members of the other \nparty, and you had better not do that or you're not going to have \naccess to us,'' that is not right. The list goes on and on.\n  What is legal is scandalous. This whole system needs to be turned not \nupside down--it is upside down right now--but right side up. We need to \nget the big money out of politics. We need to get the big money out of \npolitics. Anybody who believes in free and open elections, anybody who \nbelieves in political equality, anybody who believes that each person \nin the United States of America should count as one and no more than \none, should be genuinely horrified with this system that we now have.\n  Mr. President, I think--I hope I am proven wrong--but I think the \naction of the Rules Committee represents not a step forward but a great \nleap sideways. I have my doubts as to whether or not we are going to \npass the reform that gets the big money out of politics. Given the \nscope now at least of Governmental Affairs, they are not going to be \nlooking at soft money, they are not going to be looking at independent \nexpenditure, they are not going to be looking at what the New York \nTimes yesterday in their editorial called systematized influence \npeddling, which by the way is a bipartisan invention. And when we \nnarrow the scope and don't look at all of the abuses --we can have \nabuses; they may not be illegal but they are abuses--it is arrogance. \nIt is what people in the country hate. It is what destroys confidence \non the part of people in our political process. When we don't look at \nany of that, how convenient it will be. Because, if we do not have a \nfull inquiry into all of these abuses, into all of this improper \nbehavior, into all of the ways in which legally big money has come to \ndominate politics, guess what? We don't make the case for reform.\n\n  My concern is as follows: I think if we are not careful--on this \npoint, even though I am in sharp policy disagreement with him, I think \nSenator Warner is the best when it comes to civility. I do not have any \nquestion about him at all when it comes to civility. But my concern is \nthat we have to really be careful so that what doesn't happen here--is \nthat you have just got people going after each other with accusations, \nthrowing bombs at each other, and all of the rest--is that we don't get \ndown to what should be the real business, which is when push comes to \nshove there is plenty of blame on all sides. I include myself as being \na part of the problem. I want to be part of the solution. I have said, \nin my not so humble opinion, that everybody in public office should \nhate this system and want to change it because when you run for office \nyou have to raise money. I just finished running for office, and I \nraised money. You call people. You call people to ask them to support \nyou. We do that. You may believe--and I did believe and I do believe --\nthat the compelling necessity to raise money in these campaigns, given \nthe current system, that it has never once influenced any position you \nhave taken on any issue. You may believe that. But I tell you \nsomething. It doesn't look that way to people. Even if you are very \nhonest--and I think my colleagues are--it doesn't look that way to \npeople. We have to change this system.\n  My real concern--and we will have an amendment or several amendments \non the floor of the Senate starting tomorrow--is that what the Rules \nCommittee has done is not moving us forward, but, as I say, it is a \ngreat step sideways. It is a great step sideways from full inquiry. It \nis a great step sideways so the Governmental Affairs Committee is not \nreally looking at all of the abuses. It is a great step sideways in not \nlooking at the full range of problems and not looking at all of the \nways in which money dominates politics. Therefore, is it is a great \nstep sideways from reform.\n  I mean, ultimately here is the litmus test for all of us. Speeches \ncan be made. I am making this speech right now on the floor. Words can \nbe uttered. But really the litmus test is, are you or are you not, \nregardless of political party, interested in change? Are you interested \nin getting this big money out of politics? Are you interested in having \nthese Senate races with less money being spent? Are you interested in \nelections as opposed to auctions? Are you interested in reducing \nspecial interests access to decisionmaking? Are you interested in a \nsystem where there is a level playing field for challengers? Yes, \nchallengers who can challenge all of us who are incumbents whether we \nare Democrats or Republicans. I will tell you. I do not think most \npeople in the country think we are interested in that. I do not think \nmost people in the country think we are going to pass any significant \nreform. I think most people in the country think that this is as much \nof a debate between ins and outs as Democrats versus Republicans, and \nthe ins don't want to change a system that is really a great benefit to \nthe ins; that is to say, people who hold office.\n  I am telling you that I think all of us are under a lot of scrutiny. \nAnd I think we had better figure out a way that we push through some \nsignificant reform, and it had better not be cosmetic, it had better \nnot be one of these pieces of legislation that has a great acronym, a \nkind of made-for-Congress look; you know, sounds great, but as a matter \nof fact very little substance by way of really changing this system. I \ndo not think we are heading in that direction. I think the Rules \nCommittee decision takes us not forward, but again I think it \nrepresents, if not a retreat, the best I can say is it is a step \nsideways. That is why we will have an amendment or amendments on the \nfloor demanding a full inquiry.\n  By the way, Mr. President, in the debates that I have been in, the \nargument I usually have to do deal with is, ``Well, this is just some \nkind of convenient strategy because you don't want to focus on the \nillegalities.'' Of course, we do. But there is nothing mutually \nexclusive about saying get the facts about illegalities, then there is \na full investigation and people are held accountable, but also look at \nthe abuses, also look at the improprieties, also\n\n[[Page S2066]]\n\nlook at the reform issue, also go down the path of changing the system \nfor the better.\n  Mr. President, that, I think, is the missing piece. That will be our \nchallenge on the floor of the Senate, and that is the direction that we \nhave to go in.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I listened very carefully to the Senator's remarks--\nindeed, I thank him for his comments about the Senator from Virginia. I \nhave also found the Senator from Minnesota to have the same \ncharacteristics although I disagree with him on a number of issues.\n  As I listen to the Senator, it seems to me the Senator has pretty \nwell made up his mind. The Senator has in mind already a framework of \nideas and concepts that should be legislated by this body, am I not \ncorrect?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the Senator is correct that I can see a \nnumber of pieces of legislation, and I am going to outline some of them \nin a few moments, that I think would make sense, but I also am \ninterested in the give-and-take with colleagues and fashioning \ncompromise if I think it represents a step forward.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I understand that. But I think the Senator \nis pretty well of a mind to let us get on with the business. The \nSenator knows what has to be done in exchange with colleagues. Yet, the \ncharter given by the Rules Committee for the additional funding, that \nsum of money on top of the normal budget for Government Affairs, goes \nto December 31. You are not going to wait until December 31 to \nhopefully get the legislation that you have resolved to have one way or \nanother put on the floor, am I not correct? As a matter of fact, do I \nhave reason to believe that you would like to see that legislation \nenacted before July 4 of this year?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The Senator from Virginia is absolutely correct. I do \nthink--if I could finish.\n  Mr. WARNER. Go ahead.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. There is an A and a B part. A, I do not think people \nin the United States of America need to be convinced that there are \nhuge problems, and I do not think they believe we do not already know \nwhat many of those problems are. It is not like all of a sudden we have \nto get all sorts of more and more investigation to know what we can do. \nBut I think the investigation can be helpful if you have a full scope \nof inquiry. I think now where we have gone with the Government Affairs \nCommittee is a step sideways, and I think we should take action.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on this issue I wish to engage my \ncolleague. Clearly, in this resolution we have added additional money \nfor the Rules Committee. If the Senator will examine the document which \nI referred to earlier, the authority and rules of the Senate, you see \nin here the clearest of jurisdiction given by the Senate over decades \nto the Rules Committee to do precisely this, the broadest type of \nauthority. You do not find in here, incidentally, the same authority \nfor Government Affairs. Why? Because they are charged with \ninvestigating violations of law. They are not a committee that \noriginates legislation in this area. That is for the Rules Committee.\n  So it is very clear to this Senator, and I think other Senators will \nsoon recognize, that we are not sidestepping any issue, I say to my \nfriend and colleague. We are simply adhering to the traditional \nguidelines, precedents and the written prescription for the committees \nof the Senate to perform their duties. I would urge the Senator to \nthink about whether or not this is sidestepping, or, rather, using the \nrules and precedents of the Senate set forth in this volume and \nelsewhere with great clarity.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, to respond to the question--and I \nbelieve my colleague has asked a question--I do not know any other way \nto say this but to be straightforward and honest. The proof will be in \nthe pudding. But I think once upon a time the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee under the leadership of Senator Thompson was going to look at \nillegalities; it was going to look at improprieties; it was going to be \na full scope of inquiry, and I think we were looking in the proper \ndirection.\n  With all due respect to my colleague, whom I respect, I think the \nmajority of the Rules Committee is not interested in reform. I think \nthe Rules Committee could very well be a burial ground for reform. Now, \nif I am wrong, I am pleased to be wrong. But right now, as I think \nabout some of the people who are most active on the Rules Committee and \nsome of the people I have heard speak on this, certainly some of them \nhave made it crystal clear that they are not interested in any reform \nat all.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I can certainly answer just for this \nSenator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes. And I am not talking about the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am in favor of reform, although I have not supported \nMcCain-Feingold because I find there are serious questions as to \nwhether the majority of that bill can be upheld in the Federal court \nsystem. That is my concern. And my concern is it totally ignores the \nvery serious problem in this Senator's mind whereby labor unions compel \ntheir membership to donate by taking it out of their paycheck before it \neven gets to the union family.\n  But anyway, I am not here to try to raise all the red hot irons. I \nwant to keep, hopefully, this debate focused on this volume which lays \nout the authority of the several committees and the fairness of the \nresolution in this Senator's mind. I take umbrage, personal and \notherwise, at the Senator's comment--he wants to generalize--that the \nRules Committee is the burial ground for campaign finance reform. Other \nSenators can speak to their thoughts on this. But certainly for this \nSenator, I am very anxious to participate in reform. As I said earlier, \nI am working with the distinguished majority whip in trying to bring \ntogether a series of concepts which will withstand Federal court \nscrutiny, in our judgment, and which will move forward in substantial \nreform.\n  So I say to my friend, I have listened very carefully to his \ncomments, but I do urge him to look at this volume, which prescribes \nthe duties of several committees, and to reflect once again on the \nfairness of the proposed resolution. We can move forward, Mr. \nPresident, with campaign finance reform irrespective of the timetable \nthat is given, whether it is to the Rules Committee or the Governmental \nAffairs Committee. We can move forward. And that is a judgment call of \nthe 100 Senators to work on collectively under their respective \nleaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Virginia yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I think I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague from \nVirginia. I say that I felt I was just expressing my honest opinion \nabout what I think is going to happen in the Rules Committee. And my \ncomment was not aimed at my friend from Virginia.\n  Mr. President, I will say one more time--and I will finish up because \nI see my colleague from Mississippi is here and I know my colleague \nfrom Mississippi is going to agree with everything I am saying so I am \nanxious for him to get the floor. But let me just finish up. Two \npoints.\n  One, I think it is problematical, I think it is suspect, I think it \nis weaving and bobbing and dancing around and a big step sideways to \nhave moved the Government Affairs Committee away from what should have \nbeen the scope of the inquiry. We are going to come out here to the \nfloor with language which is going to make it clear that we are serious \nabout reform. And we know that what is key to reform is an \ninvestigation not only of illegalities--and you get into a definitional \nbattle over that--but also what is improper, what is not appropriate. \nYou name it. And also all of the ways in which money and politics have \nnow interacted in such a way as to severely undercut the very idea of \nrepresentative democracy and really undercut the trust people have in \nour political process. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2. I just think people in the country are scratching their heads \nand saying, these folks in the Senate, they are saying that they \nactually need a lot of time to study all of these problems and they do \nnot want to make a commitment to any date to bring up any piece\n\n[[Page S2067]]\n\nof campaign reform legislation; permit us to be a little skeptical. We \nhave this idea that politicians are pretty good at delay, and they are \npretty good at sidestepping issues, and they are pretty good at not \ngetting down to the work; permit us to be a little skeptical.\n  How much more do people need to know about abuses, improprieties or \nillegalities in order to make some change? Many of us, my colleague is \nright, are pushing for some action. Now, I am not arrogant enough to \nsay that one person has all the ideas about what should be done, but I \ndo get very concerned about sidestepping here, narrowing the scope of \ninquiry here, delaying here and maybe, just maybe, at the very end \nlaboring mightily and producing a mouse--hardly any kind of reform. I \nwant to tell you, if we do that, people in the country should hold us \naccountable.\n\n  I think that my colleagues, some colleagues, fail to make a \ndistinction. I could be wrong about this. But I am coming to believe \nthat every day there is a headline about something new. I think people \nread it and they just quickly go on to other stories. I think part of \nthe reason is, unfortunately, people's expectations are not very high, \nand that should trouble all of us. But at the very core, what is inside \nof people in this country, is we do not like this system at all. We do \nnot feel as though we are well represented. We feel ripped off and we \nwant you to change it.\n  I would say to my colleagues--yes, we talked about McCain-Feingold. I \nsupport McCain-Feingold. I worked with both Senators from the word go. \nI think it is an important, significant reform effort.\n  If I had my way I would go the ``Maine option,'' legislation which \nreally gets the interested money and private money out; a major \noverhaul of the system. If not, Senator Cochran and I had an \nopportunity to be at a show last night and I said, ``Look, I will come \nto the floor with an amendment just to prohibit soft money.'' We are \ngoing to take action. There are a variety of different approaches and \nthere are other things that can be done that represent reform. But I \nsay to my colleagues, ultimately it gets down to this. We have to \ndramatically reduce the amount of money that is spent. We have to \ndramatically reduce the influence of interested dollars and special \ninterest access to decisionmakers. We have to dramatically reduce this \nmoney chase. And we have to move toward something that approximates, \nmore or less, a level playing field so we have competitive elections \nand so challengers have a chance against incumbents.\n  If we do not do that, we have not done the job. I think people are \ngoing to hold us to that standard. So we might be debating kind of the \nprocess we are going through to get to the end. But we need to get \nthere together at the end.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield for just one moment?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to yield to my distinguished chairman.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think the record should reflect our \ndistinguished colleague, the senior Senator from Kentucky, has just \nmade a statement with regard to his future. Otherwise he would be here \ntoday, participating in this debate. Senator Ford returned home to make \na very important statement regarding his future. I know my colleague \nfrom Ohio has looked over that statement in which he has indicated that \nhe no longer is going to pursue a career in the U.S. Senate, but is to \nreturn to greener fields. I just thought we should put that in the \nRecord, as to his absence here today.\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Yes. I want to praise Senator Ford, too. But we set \naside this time for debate on the resolution. We had 2 hours in morning \nbusiness and we will have additional morning business time, I am sure, \nlater. I hope we could debate the resolution, but I will be happy to \nyield to the distinguished Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank my friend from Mississippi. I just want to \nreinforce what the Senator from Virginia just said. Senator Ford, as \nranking minority member on the Rules Committee, would normally be on \nthe floor, managing this bill. Since I had been ranking minority member \nover at Governmental Affairs, which is involved with this very deeply, \nhe asked me to take his place here today. I should have noted that at \nthe beginning of the session today, before I made my speech.\n  But he will be missed. I was sorry to see my good friend, Wendell \nFord, who came here the same time I did, make a decision to not run \nagain. I know some of the pangs of going through that decision, having \ngone through those pangs myself just a short time ago. And I am sure I \nwill want to say more tomorrow, but that is the reason he is not here \nfloor-managing the bill.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I think we should make it clear at the \noutset that those of us who are supporting this resolution as reported \nby the Rules Committee favor looking very carefully at our current \ncampaign laws. The Federal Election Campaign Act sets out some very \nstrict rules and guidelines and laws with respect to how our Federal \nelection campaigns ought to be conducted. Some of us agree that those \nlaws can be improved and are in favor of making changes. For example, I \nthink one of the clear deficiencies in current law is the failure to \nrequire disclosure from all of those who spend money in the Federal \nelection campaign process. There is no law against participating. We \nlike to have full participation by all American citizens, by all of \nthose who are eligible to vote in our country, and we need to continue \nto examine the process to see if we are doing a good enough job of \ntrying to get everybody's involvement in the process. So there are a \nlot of things that we can do to improve the system.\n  But I hope that our friends who are urging immediate vote on a single \nproposal, certainly ought to allow a full debate to occur and a free \nexchange of ideas. This Committee on Rules has had a number of hearings \nunder the leadership of the distinguished Senator from Virginia on this \nsubject. And in this resolution there is a provision that further \ncampaign reform issues will be examined by the Rules Committee, in the \ncontext of this resolution on this investigation.\n  Having said that, I think we do need to support, though, the passage \nof this resolution now so investigation can move forward. The \nGovernmental Affairs Committee is charged under this resolution with \nresponsibility of conducting an investigation into illegal activities \nsurrounding the 1996 election campaigns. We do not single out the \nPresident's reelection campaign. We say the campaigns that were \nconducted in 1996, the challenge of the Republican candidate, the \ncampaigns of all Members of Congress, the campaigns of those Senators \nwho were up in the last cycle--all are to be the subject of the \ninvestigation by the Governmental Affairs Committee into illegal \nactivities.\n  Further, if any Senator is found to have engaged in illegal activity, \nthat is to be directly referred to the Ethics Committee for prompt \nattention and review.\n  What are these facts that support and are the basis for the \nresolution? I think it is important for us to look at what the facts \nare, to look at what the allegations are, some of the charges that have \nbeen made. One of the individuals who was mentioned by the Senator from \nUtah is John Huang. It is said by reports that he raised more than $3.4 \nmillion for the Democratic National Committee. Where did this money \ncome from? That is a fair question. That is a very legitimate question, \nand it ought to be answered by this investigation.\n  John Huang was given a security clearance while he was still working \nfor a private enterprise, the Lippo Group, and before he started to \nwork at the Department of Commerce. A legitimate inquiry by this \ninvestigation committee is: Why did he get a security clearance before \nstarting a job with the Department of Commerce? And he kept his \nsecurity clearance, even after he left the Department of Commerce and \nwent to work for the Democratic National Committee. Another legitimate \ninquiry is: Why did\n\n[[Page S2068]]\n\nsomeone who is a full-time fundraiser for the Democratic National \nCommittee need a security clearance? Or why was he permitted to have a \nsecurity clearance?\n  During his tenure with the Commerce Department and at the Democratic \nNational Committee, he had several visits with officials of the Embassy \nof the People's Republic of China. A legitimate inquiry: What were the \npurposes of these visits? Which Chinese officials at the Embassy did he \nvisit and why?\n  Another person who was mentioned by Senator Hatch, as involved in the \nreports and who was involved actively in the election campaign of 1996, \nis Johnny Chung. Johnny Chung is said to have donated a total of \n$366,000 to the Democratic National Committee. A legitimate inquiry: \nWhere did Chung get this money? Another reported fact: Johnny Chung \nvisited the White House more than 50 times, despite the fact that the \nNational Security Council staff had issued a memo describing him as a \nhustler, and warning officials at the White House of that. Why did \nJohnny Chung have such free access to the White House? That is a \nlegitimate inquiry. Who did he see when he went to the White House on \nthese occasions, and for what purpose? One day, during a radio address \nby the President of the United States, Johnny Chung brought six Chinese \nofficials with him to be spectators, and to witness the President's \nradio address, 2 days after giving a $50,000 check to a senior White \nHouse official to pass on to the Democratic National Committee.\n  Charlie Trie is another person who has been mentioned today. Charlie \nTrie was a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee and the \nClinton's legal defense fund. He is said to have raised more than \n$600,000. What were the sources of these donations? What did he expect \nin return, if anything? Charlie Trie visited the White House more than \n23 times. Who did he see when he was there? What were the purposes of \nhis visits? Charlie Trie arranged to have Wang Jun, a Chinese arms \ndealer, attend a White House event with the President.\n  These are legitimate subjects of inquiry into an investigation into \npossible illegal conduct in connection with the 1996 Presidential \nelection campaign. It seems to me that these are not only questionable \nactivities that raise questions about purposes of fundraising, but \nconnections with a foreign government which was very actively involved \nin developing new trade relations with our country, in testing our \nrelationship with other countries in that region of the world, and just \nthis past weekend there were new revelations in connection with the \nfact that the Chinese Government was said, by our own Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, to be targeting Members of Congress, to influence for \nthe purpose of enhancing China's position with respect to legislation \nand national policy here in the United States.\n\n  The question that is legitimate for us to undertake to answer in this \ninvestigation is what connection do these associates of the Democratic \nNational Committee or the President--John Huang, Charlie Trie, Johnny \nChung, and others--have with this effort by the Chinese, if any? These \nare legitimate inquiries.\n  Has there been a revelation or a discussion or a briefing at the \nWhite House by the FBI on these same subjects? And when did those \nbriefings occur? Before these people were given free access to the \nWhite House? Or later? Or when?\n  Did these activities on the part of the Chinese Government become \ncommon knowledge at the White House? If they did, who knew about it? \nSomebody is bound to have known about it. You don't have this kind of \nseemingly unlimited access with high-level officials in our \nadministration without somebody knowing why they were there.\n  What were their interests? One, of course, was a Department of \nCommerce official interested in trade, organizing trade missions all \naround the country. But not only that, Mr. President, let me show you a \nchart, for the purpose of information for Senators, reflecting \ninformation that may be close as a circle of interest.\n  Here we have the three persons I was talking about where there is \nclear evidence of a lot of fundraising activity, a lot of access with \nthe White House and with top officials in the administration, one \nworking at the Department of Commerce. This is John Huang, who was \nformer top U.S. Lippo executive. Lippo is the Indonesian conglomerate \nalready described by Senator Hatch and others. He was a top Democratic \nNational Committee fundraiser. He had a top-secret security clearance \nat Commerce--even before, we have now learned--and had almost unlimited \nWhite House access.\n  Johnny Chung visited the White House at least 50 times, brought \nseveral Communist Party officials, Chinese Government officials, to the \nWhite House, and maintains business relationships in China.\n  Charlie Trie, Little Rock restaurateur, has visited the White House \nfrom 20 to 30 times; owns a home and restaurant in Beijing.\n  All three participated in very productive fundraising activities for \nthe Democratic National Committee or the President's legal expense \nfund. Approximately $4.5 million was raised by these three individuals \nfor the Democratic National Committee. The Democratic National \nCommittee said it is returning $2.2 million of those contributions. For \nthe President's legal expense fund, Charlie Trie raised $639,000, all \nnow ruled by the lawyers as returnable and should be returned.\n  Then look at this. These are interesting connections as well. Does \nthis form a link, the link to China that gets the foreign government \ninvolved in our election process? It seems to me clearly to indicate a \nreason to go forward immediately with the passage of this resolution \nand to go forward with this investigation to find out what the facts \nare. But here are what some of the allegations are in the reported \nfacts that we can verify with an investigation.\n  Wang Jun, the foreign arms dealer who was brought to the White House, \nchairman of Poly Technologies, a Chinese arms manufacturer. He is also \nchairman of CITIC, which is the largest state-run business in China. He \nvisited the White House on February 6, 1996, as a guest of Charlie \nTrie.\n  Ng Lap Seng, a member of CPPCC. This is the Chinese Government's \nnational advisory board. He has multiple business interests in China, \nHong Kong, and Macao. He is partners with Charlie Trie in San Kin Yip \nInternational Trading Co.\n  And the Lippo Group, which was discussed in some detail by Senator \nHatch. Mochtar and James Riady are the family members who have large \ninterests, if not controlling interests, in the Lippo Group. Lippo has \nvast business interests in China, business partners with China \nResources, a Chinese Government-owned entity.\n  The CP Group, this is the largest foreign investor in China, $2 \nbillion investment, 130 joint ventures. Chairman Dhanin serves as \neconomic adviser to the Chinese Government. Dhanin visited with \nPresident Clinton in the White House on June 18, 1996, arranged by \nPauline Kanchanalak through John Huang.\n  The connections are with Huang, Chung, and Trie with investors, \nleading industrialists in China, in Indonesia, all with Chinese ties, \nall with very big stakes in the outcome of Government policies here in \nthe United States and legislation here in the United States, and, \napparently, Members of Congress were selected to be supported or \nencouraged or lobbied, or whatever happened, and we don't know what \nhappened. We don't know if anything happened, but we need to find out \nwhat steps were taken to try to influence decisions in this Government \nby the foreign government.\n  The question about whether passing a bill to reform campaign finance \nlaw cures all that, of course, begs the question. That is not the \nquestion, and it is certainly not the answer. The question is, What are \nthe illegal activities that are involved in these transactions, if any? \nThat is not only an appropriate area for inquiry by this U.S. Senate, \nit is mandatory, it is a duty, it is a mandatory responsibility, it is \na duty we have.\n  So I urge my colleagues to adopt this resolution. It is a product of \nan effort to try to resolve differences that some on the other side of \nthe aisle have had with the effort that we initiated in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee to put together a resolution to define \nscope and a budget and a process.\n  But I have confidence, Mr. President, in the chairman and the ranking\n\n[[Page S2069]]\n\nDemocratic member, Senator Thompson and Senator Glenn, who are totally \ndedicated, in my view, to a fair but full inquiry of the allegations \nthat are apparent and are begging to be investigated so that we can \nfind out what the facts are.\n  If laws need to be changed, we can recommend changes in the law. If \nwe simply need to disclose whether people are innocent of the charges \nthat have been made against them, that is an important part of the \nresponsibility, too. To clear those whose names may have been tarnished \nby published reports that we have seen in the newspapers and heard in \nthe broadcast media, that is part of the obligation of this committee \nas well, which I think will be taken very, very seriously.\n  So I am hopeful that the Senate will approve the resolution, Mr. \nPresident. I congratulate the chairman for his leadership in this.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague.\n  We are particularly fortunate on the Rules Committee to have a very \nsignificant number of senior colleagues, of which my good friend, the \nsenior Senator from Mississippi, is one. And three members of the Rules \nCommittee, three who voted for this resolution, are also members of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. That, in my judgment, is a very, very \nimportant aspect of this debate. They looked at it from both \nperspectives. They have counseled this chairman as well as others on \nthe committee. I think that goes a long way to say that this was a \nresolution carefully crafted and thoughtfully arrived at. I thank my \ndear friend.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise not for a lengthy statement here, \nbut just to say that most of the remarks on the other side of the aisle \nthis afternoon have been involved with ``The China Link,'' as it is \ncalled on the diagram I see on the other side right now, and with the \nChina connection, with Mr. Huang, Mr. Chung, Mr. Trie, and what may \nhave happened.\n  I am not quite sure what relevance all these things have to do with \nS. 39 that is before us on the floor now and which we are debating. \nBecause everyone is agreed, everyone I know on the Rules Committee, the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, the White House, the President, \neverybody is agreed that some things went awry in this area. And even \nthe President has said, yes, he wants to see this brought out. Let us \nfind out what happened. Let us correct it. Let us cure it and let us \nget on with it.\n  I do not know whether our debate here on the floor is going to take \nup time pushing this idea that somehow, or implying at least, that we \nare trying to avoid some sort of discussion or the President is trying \nto avoid some kind of discussion on Huang, Trie, and others, because I \ndo not think that is the case. I know the Justice Department, as I \nunderstand it--and this is just from news reports; I have not talked to \nthe people over there--but as I understand it, they have 25 FBI agents \nassigned to investigate exactly this matter that we are talking about \non the floor this afternoon. So if we need to, on the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, get into those areas because they involve, \nobviously, allegations of illegality, we will do so.\n  So I just want to make that comment that we are united, I think, in \nthe Senate on both sides of the aisle and down to Pennsylvania Avenue \nto the White House on finding out what happened with Mr. Huang, Mr. \nChung, and Mr. Trie, and bring that information out so we can correct \nwhatever the situation was or get new legislation if that is needed to \ncorrect it. So we are all committed to that. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is imperative that the public have a \nfull picture of the questionable campaign fundraising practices which \nhave risen to the surface in such quantity. These practices are not the \nsole domain of one party. Both parties raise money in comparable ways. \nRepublican practices as well as Democratic practices must be \ninvestigated and made public. Otherwise, there is going to be no \nconfidence and no credibility in this investigation. Unless we have an \ninvestigation into fundraising abuses by both parties, the committee's \ninvestigation--and here I am talking about the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee's investigation--will turn into a partisan squabble.\n\n  Both Democratic and Republican activities at both ends of \nPennsylvania Avenue must be investigated, and then let the chips fall \nwhere they may. There must be a full and thorough investigation into \nthe campaign finance practices of the last election, and to the extent \npractices of earlier elections shed light on current practices or set \nthe context for our consideration of current practices, the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee should include and voted to include \nthose election cycles in our investigation as well. Whatever we do in \nthis investigation will also hopefully contribute to the enactment of \ncampaign finance reform.\n  With those goals in mind, the members of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee met and together unanimously decided on language relative to \nthe scope of this investigation. Members on both sides of the aisle \nwere satisfied with the result and with the sense of accomplishment \nthat we felt. Senator Glenn said just before the vote on the scope \nresolution:\n\n       I think we have made really a lot of progress in this \n     regard. . . . I think this sets down in language what we had \n     talked about, what you, Senator Thompson had indicated you \n     were for, what we were for.\n\n  And Senator Lieberman described it as ``an extraordinarily positive \npiece of work.''\n  That agreed-upon scope in the Governmental Affairs Committee was not \nan expansion of Chairman Thompson's statement of scope which he made on \nthe Senate floor on January 28 when he announced his plans for the \ncommittee's investigation. It was the embodiment, for all practical \npurposes, of what Senator Thompson had described in his floor \nstatement. Senator Thompson said at that time:\n\n       The investigation that we are now undertaking is neither a \n     criminal investigation nor a seminar on campaign finance \n     reform, although it involves elements of both.\n\n  And continuing, Senator Thompson said:\n\n       Based on the information before us at this time, it is an \n     inquiry into illegal and improper campaign finance activity \n     in the 1996 Presidential campaign and related activities. . . \n     . Now certainly our work will include any improper activities \n     by Republicans, Democrats or other political partisans. . . . \n     We are investigating activities here, not political parties.\n\n  We had a disagreement over how much the investigation would cost, but \nwe did not have a disagreement over what the scope should be. We had a \ndisagreement over the length of the investigation. Democrats on the \ncommittee thought we should have a goal for an end date so that we \ncould responsibly, and in a reasonable amount of time, report to the \nSenate on our findings and conclusions. We thought, looking back at \nprevious investigations, that a year would be appropriate. The \ncongressional investigation into Watergate lasted just over a year. And \nwe thought an end date as well as the funding could always be adjusted \nif the public interest warranted an extension depending upon the state \nof the evidence at the time the agreed-upon end date was reached.\n  We had also hoped for, and actually expected, progress on working out \nbipartisan procedures for the conduct of the investigation. The \ncommittee directed the staff to work on an agreement on procedures to \nensure that there was bipartisan access to witnesses, documents and \ndepositions.\n  So that's where we were after the last Governmental Affairs Committee \nmeeting. We had a unanimously agreed-upon scope resolution, progress on \nbipartisan procedures, and differences over money and length of time. \nHow did we get to where we are today? Well, this whole thing took a \ndramatic detour to, and then a dramatic detour in, the Rules Committee.\n\n  Republican members of the Rules Committee decided to narrow the \nunanimously adopted scope of the committee investigation. Initially, \nsome of the Rules Committee wanted to leave Congress out of the \ninvestigation altogether. But they soon realized that that would not \npass muster with the\n\n[[Page S2070]]\n\nmedia or with the American people. So they concocted a formulation, \nsomething that made them look like they were covering Congress but, in \neffect, leaving out the most sensitive areas to Members: soft money and \nindependent expenditures. Republicans raised much more soft money than \nDemocrats, and outspent Democrats 10 to 1 in independent expenditures.\n  The Rules Committee majority no doubt thought that if they could get \nthe Senate to strike the word ``improper'' from the Governmental \nAffairs Committee jurisdiction and leave the scope covering only \nillegal activity, then they could deflect or avoid the possible \nresulting pressure to pass campaign finance reform. I have no doubt \nthat that was the goal of many members of the Rules Committee--to \ndeflect or avoid pressure to pass campaign finance reform.\n  That pressure would come from the bipartisan investigation in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee not only into what is illegal but into \nwhat should be illegal, what is improper, to what has an odor about it, \nto what is excessive. That is what the Governmental Affairs Committee, \non a bipartisan basis, wanted to look at. Not just as to what was \nillegal technically but as to what we should consider as a legislative \nbody to make illegal.\n  Now, the Rules Committee decided to put in language about referring \nallegations of illegal conduct against Members to the Ethics Committee \nand referred the issue of soft money and independent expenditures, and \nthose are the 800-pound gorillas of campaign finance in the 1990's. \nSoft money, independent expenditures currently--the legal portion of \nthose activities--were referred to the Rules Committee. But it is the \nRules Committee whose majority does not want the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee to have a full-blown investigation in the first place.\n  Now, that is where we are. The Rules Committee is proposing to this \nSenate that a unanimously agreed upon resolution of a standing \ncommittee of this body to investigate improper activity should not be \npermitted. Now, I do not know whether this has been done before in the \nhistory of this body where you have a committee with jurisdiction which \nvotes unanimously on an investigation, which is then denied that \ninvestigation by the Rules Committee. Perhaps it has happened before, I \ndo not know. I have asked the Democratic staff on the Rules Committee \nif they know of any precedent for this. They do not know of any.\n  We are not talking about reducing the funding. Here we are talking \nabout limiting the scope of an investigation within the jurisdiction of \na standing committee of this body, unanimously voted upon by that \nstanding committee. Now, anybody who has been following this sad story \nwill see through it because I do not think, again--and I will make this \nchallenge to my dear friend from Virginia, Senator Warner, and he is my \ndear friend; I will make this challenge to him, because we should know \nwhether or not the Rules Committee has ever in this way limited the \nscope of an investigation unanimously voted on by a standing committee \nof this body.\n  We are not talking about limiting the money. We are talking about \nsaying you may not investigate improper activity. That is clearly \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Governmental Affairs Committee. There is \nno doubt that the Governmental Affairs Committee has jurisdiction to \nlook into improper activities of the kind laid out in our full-scope \nresolution.\n  By the way, I have no doubt that the Rules Committee has jurisdiction \nto do what it has decided it wants to do, as well, that that \njurisdiction is not exclusive. The Governmental Affairs Committee has \nthe jurisdiction. There is nothing improper about its jurisdiction. For \nthe Rules Committee to tell a standing committee of this body you may \nnot look into improper activity within your jurisdiction, I believe, is \nunprecedented. If it has a precedent, then it seems to me this body \nought to hear about it from the Rules Committee.\n  Again, to make clear what we are not talking about, we are not \ntalking about reducing the funding, and we are not talking about the \nquestion of whether the Rules Committee has jurisdiction, as well, \nbecause clearly they have both jurisdiction to reduce the funds and to \ntake up an issue themselves. What we are talking about is something \nthat is clearly within the jurisdiction of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee and unanimously adopted by the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee.\n  Now, in setting aside the Governmental Affairs Committee resolution, \nthe Rules Committee and the resolution before the Senate struck the \nvery key word ``improper.'' Here is what the unanimously passed \nresolution of the Governmental Affairs Committee said:\n\n       The [committee] shall conduct a Special Investigation into \n     illegal or improper fundraising and spending practices in the \n     1996 Federal election campaigns. . .\n\n  Here is what the Rules Committee substitute says:\n\n       The additional funds authorized by this section are for the \n     sole purpose of conducting an investigation of illegal \n     activities in connection with 1996 Federal election \n     campaigns.''\n\n  The key word missing from the Rules Committee substitute is the word \n``improper.''\n  What they are restricting us to investigate on the Governmental \nAffairs Committee is illegal activities. We are barred from using these \nspecial funds--and I emphasize it is these special funds which are at \nissue--from investigating improper activities. If the Rules Committee \nversion of this resolution passes, and I hope it will not, the Senate \nwould go on record as affirmatively denying an investigative committee \nof the Senate from investigating improper campaign activities. I think \nthat is a precedent which this body should reject on a bipartisan basis \nbecause it puts us in the exact wrong direction in terms of what this \nNation wants us to do, which is to both look at illegal as well as \nimproper practices.\n  Now, some people say, what about the illegal practices which have \nbeen alleged. My answer to that is we ought to look at it even though \nthat is usually left to prosecutorial bodies and courts. We ought to \nlook at illegal activities. We should not shy away from that--illegal \nactivities by whomever. But we surely should look as well at improper \nactivities, which activities, at least arguably, should be made \nillegal.\n  We are also doing something else in addition to restricting us from \nlooking at the soft underbelly of campaign financing, which is soft \nmoney, we are also risking the very investigation of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, because the legislative purpose, which is to change \nthe laws, is being put into question by the restriction of the Rules \nCommittee. If we could only look at illegal activity, things already \nillegal, and we cannot look at things which arguably should be made \nillegal, then the question of legislative purpose arises. That is what \nthe courts have ruled must exist before subpoenas can be enforced.\n  A Federal district court in the Icardi case said that:\n\n       The court does hold that if the committee is not pursuing a \n     bona fide legislative purpose when it secures the testimony \n     of any witness, it is not acting as a ``competent tribunal'' \n     even though that very testimony be relevant to a matter which \n     could be the subject of a valid legislative investigation . . \n     .\n\n  So the resolution that is proposed by the Rules Committee substitute \nnot only strikes the key word ``improper'' that would give the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee the direct authority to investigate \npractices that are now legal but should be made illegal--because that \nis what the word improper allows us to do. What the substitute \nresolution of the Rules Committee does is fails to include any \nreference whatever to a legislative purpose. In this case, campaign \nfinance reform. The silence on this point is deafening, and I am afraid \nthe silence on this point, the removal of the word ``improper'' is also \ngoing to jeopardize the investigation which is left into the \njurisdiction of the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  Finally, I want to read one portion of the committee report of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee that supports the broader scope \nresolution which had been unanimously adopted by the Governmental \nAffairs Committee. This is what we said, Democrats, Republicans, \nunanimously. Or this is what the committee report, more accurately, the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, says about the broad scope resolution:\n\n       The allegations that have been made are very serious and go \n     to the fundamental\n\n[[Page S2071]]\n\n     workings of our democratic government. The faith of the \n     people in their government and in their system of government \n     is at risk. Our Constitution is premised on the fallibility \n     of human enterprises, including governments. The founders of \n     this Republic did not believe that the errors of \n     Government were self-correcting. They knew that only \n     constant examination of our shortcomings, and learning \n     from them, would enable representative government to \n     survive. They believed, correctly, that this process makes \n     America stronger, not weaker. We must have the same faith.\n\n  And then the committee report of the Governmental Affairs Committee \nsays the following:\n\n       These allegations of improper activities must be \n     investigated. The committee intends to investigate \n     allegations of improper activities by all, Republicans, \n     Democrats, or other political partisans. It will investigate \n     specific activities, not on the political party against which \n     the allegations are made.\n\n  The Senate, if it adopts the Rules Committee resolution, will \nundermine the solid, bipartisan work of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. A unanimously adopted resolution of that committee that has \njurisdiction to investigate improper activities will be undermined by, \ninstead, a partisan resolution of the Rules Committee, adopted on a \npartisan vote, which narrows the scope of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee on the use of these special funds.\n  So, again, while my friend from the Rules Committee, the chairman, is \nhere, let me repeat one point. There is no doubt that the Rules \nCommittee has jurisdiction to entertain the kind of hearings that it is \ngoing to have. There is no doubt that the Rules Committee can reduce \nthe funding that has been provided. But I don't know of--and I welcome \nmy friend correcting me if I am wrong--a precedent where the Rules \nCommittee has told a committee of jurisdiction in this body which \nunanimously adopts a resolution to investigate an activity that it may \nnot do so with the funds that are appropriate or allocated. I know that \nwe can use other funds for that purpose. But we are talking here about \na special funding resolution and a unanimously adopted, bipartisan \nresolution of the Governmental Affairs Committee to investigate \nsomething within its jurisdiction. For the Rules Committee to remove \nthe word ``improper,'' it seems to me is unprecedented and unwise, \ngiven the tremendous necessity to change the way campaign financing is \ndone in this country.\n  I yield the floor and would be happy to respond if my friend from \nVirginia, the chairman of the Rules Committee, desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague. Since he came to the \nSenate, I have valued his views greatly and his friendship a good deal \nmore. Although we differ from time to time, let us see if we can't come \nto some fundamental understanding here. Has the Senator had an \nopportunity to review the document, which I referred to today, the \n``Authority of the Rules of the Senate on Committees?'' If not, I urge \nthat the Senator take a little time to look through it. I read it as \nsaying very clearly, that the broadest jurisdiction possible is in the \nRules Committee to look into the subject before us--namely, campaign \nfinance reform, campaign finance violations, the whole generic subject. \nIt is silent with respect to the Governmental Affairs Committee. Most \nrespectfully, it is silent on that subject.\n  The distinguished Governmental Affairs Committee is not a legislative \ncommittee in the context of this subject. I wonder if the colleague \nwill take the microphone and we can have a colloquy. The first question \nis--you have not had a chance, but you will look at this?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct, and we would be happy to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Second, you agree that Governmental Affairs is not a \nlegislative committee.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The investigative jurisdiction of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee was the question I directed to my friend.\n  Mr. WARNER. I want to take it step by step. But as far as \nlegislation, to the extent that the Senate hopefully will adopt \nlegislation on campaign finance reform and campaign finance violations, \nthis Senator is going to--and has and will continue to--work vigorously \ntoward that goal. At the current time, the distinguished majority \nleader has designated the majority whip to head a task force on this \nside of the aisle, and I am a part of that. I can assure we are working \ndiligently. So that's the legislative action.\n\n  The second point I wish to make is, I don't know of anything done by \nthe Rules Committee in this particular resolution, or in any other \nthing the Rules Committee has done, which would deter the Senate or \nforestall the Senate from taking up campaign finance reform whenever \nthe concurrence as to the timing comes with the distinguished majority \nleader and the minority leader. That is traditionally the function of \nthose two leaders. That is a subject that is being actively discussed \nbetween the leaders. So nothing we have done deters that. That is a \nseparate timing, a separate subject.\n  But we see when we pick up the papers, there is something new on this \nsubject every day. It is the most distressing period I have ever seen.\n  Mr. GLENN. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. This is a colloquy. Go ahead.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank my friend. I reply that the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee has more broad jurisdiction on investigations than any \ncommittee here. It doesn't mean that we do those things legislatively \nthen, but we are a committee that does investigations. We have done \nbroad investigations in drug matters, for instance, and investigations \nand hearings regarding that. Yet, we turn that legislation over, we \nturn our information over to other people to form the legislative \nbackground they need to bring it here to the Senate.\n  We have conducted hearings on espionage in the past, and we certainly \ndon't have authority in those areas. But we are given broad \ninvestigative powers and staff and money to look into these things as \npart of our regular jurisdiction.\n  This committee was known through the years as a committee that took \non organized crime. It was known back in those days, originally, as the \nTruman committee, PSI subcommittee that we have, and the McClellan \nsubcommittee. We took on organized crime. But we didn't do the \nlegislative matters, the legislating that had to be done. We turned the \nresults over to other committees.\n  More recently, we have looked at fraudulent health programs involving \nthe District of Columbia here and West Virginia and, I believe, part of \nVirginia, also. We didn't propose to do the legislation in those areas. \nFor many years, I have personally been as involved as anybody in the \nSenate on matters regarding nuclear nonproliferation. Yet, primarily, \nthat was not something we had to go ahead and put legislation in on, \nalthough I did use that to put legislation in many years ago. We have \nhad investigations on terrorism, and it fell to other people to have \nthe legislation.\n  Mr. WARNER. I readily accede to all this history, which is important. \nIndeed the Senator has been on the committee for 22 years, has he not?\n  Mr. GLENN. I have indeed.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am just pointing out that this resolution goes to the \nauthority to investigate until December 31. Is the Senator suggesting \nthat we are going to wait in the Senate until December 31 to review a \nfinal proposal on campaign finance reform? I hope not.\n  Mr. GLENN. I respond to my friend, no.\n  Mr. WARNER. There is a clear separation between the two trains that \nare moving--your investigation, which is important, and campaign \nfinance reform, which, in my judgment, is equally as important. They \nare on different tracks.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Can I ask a factual question?\n  Mr. WARNER. The previous speaker said this Rules Committee resolution \nsidetracked campaign finance reform. I took serious question with him \non that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think that is the likely outcome. We will know that. Is \nmy friend from Virginia suggesting that the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee does not have jurisdiction to investigate improper campaign \nactivities?\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I didn't say that, Mr. President. The authority is very \nclear with respect to the Rules Committee, but it is less clear with \nGovernmental Affairs. If the Senator sees a passage which I have \nmissed--it is rather\n\n[[Page S2072]]\n\nlengthy--but it is less clear, in my judgment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Just to clarify the colloquy, I heard my friend say the \ncommittee can use regular funding to look into improper activity.\n  Mr. WARNER. That was my next point.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is there any doubt that the committee has jurisdiction to \nlook into improper activities under its broad jurisdiction--quoting the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee jurisdiction--``to have the duty to \nstudy the efficiency, economy, and effectiveness of all agencies and \ndepartments of Government, which would include the Federal Elections \nCommittee.''\n  My question of the Rules Committee chair is, is there any question \nabout the jurisdiction of the Governmental Affairs Committee to \ninvestigate the propriety of campaign financing and fundraising? Is \nthere some doubt about that?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are coming to a very important point, \nand I was going to raise that because I had this in my hand at the time \nI yielded for the colloquy with the Senator from Ohio. Senate \nResolution 54, the omnibus resolution of the Rules Committee for all \ncommittees, under which $4.533 million was allocated to the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee--there is nothing in here respecting \nexactly how it will go about it. That is a matter that is up to the \ncollective wisdom of the members of the committee under the leadership \nof the very fine chairman, and, indeed, equally fine ranking member. \nWhat the Rules Committee decided is, if you wish to have additional \nfunds, that is within the province of the Rules Committee to say that \nthose funds will be for a specific purpose, and that purpose being--we \nknow exactly what it is. But it would seem to me that that action by \nthe Rules Committee, subject to whatever the Senate does in working its \nwill on this resolution--however this resolution emerges--hopefully, in \nmy judgment, will emerge intact. There may be a technical change here \nor there. That should certainly be a precedent to the members of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee--a sort of guidepost as to how \ncollectively, exercising the majority vote in this, the members should \nexpend all the funds, in my judgment.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. The collective wisdom of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, unanimously adopted, is that we should look at both illegal \nand improper activities. I do not think there is a slightest doubt that \nboth of those are within the investigative jurisdiction of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. And nothing my friend from Virginia \nhere today says anything to the contrary. Both illegal and improper \nactivities are within the investigative jurisdiction of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. And here we have a Rules Committee on a \npartisan vote saying to a committee of jurisdiction that has \njurisdiction to investigate both illegal and improper activity: \n``Sorry. This additional funding can only be used on what is already \nillegal. You may not investigate activities which maybe should be made \nillegal.'' I believe that is unprecedented. I am not saying the Rules \nCommittee cannot do that. I am saying it is unprecedented. I believe it \nis unwise for the Rules Committee to do that institutionally. More \nimportantly, I believe that the Nation requires an investigation of \nboth illegal and improper, and that is what with the bipartisan \nunanimous vote of the Governmental Affairs Committee was.\n  It is to me just the wrong message to send to the country that we are \nnot going to let the investigative body look into improper activities, \nparticularly involving soft money; independent expenditures which are \nnow for the most part legal, not totally because there are some \nquestions of illegality. But there are some. Most of the soft money is \nprobably legal. Most of the independent expenditures are probably \nlegal. But much of it deserves scrutiny and investigation.\n  What the Rules Committee has done is to deny--in a unanimous vote by \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee--use of these additional funds to \nboth look at improper and illegal activity. And I just hope the Senate \nas a whole will not set this precedent.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, with that I await the will of the Senate \nto work on it. But I point out that there is $4.53 million. There is no \nproscription in there. But I would think that however this resolution \nemerges it should be a guidepost for the conduct of the investigation \nof this committee.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to compliment my colleague from \nVirginia, and echo some of the comments that he has made. I happen to \nhave the distinction, as a couple of us do, to serve on both \ncommittees. I serve on the Rules Committee, and I serve on the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. I think the resolution that the Senator \nfrom Virginia brought to the floor--and I compliment him for it--says \nthat we should abide by the jurisdiction of the committees. The Rules \nCommittee has jurisdiction over campaign finance reform. It has had \nthat jurisdiction for years. One of the reasons I became involved in \nthe Rules Committee, one of the reasons I participated in the \ncommittee, and one of the reasons I requested time for participating, \nwas because I am interested in campaign finance reform legislation, not \njust oversight on illegal activities. That is what the Governmental \nAffairs Committee investigates. That committee will be investigating a \nlot of things that have been discussed on the floor today and tomorrow \nand probably will be investigating these matters for some time this \nyear, and rightfully so.\n\n  I believe I even heard the President of the United States say that we \nshould investigate some of the alleged laundering of foreign money to \nthe Democratic National Committee. We should investigate whether \nforeign nationals have tried to influence American elections. I do \nthink, however, that the Rules Committee can work on campaign reform \nand simultaneously have hearings on legal activities dealing with soft \nmoney and with independent expenditures. I do not think that it is \nappropriate that those hearings should be mixed up with the hearings on \nillegal activity.\n  Think about it. We are talking about having people testify under oath \nand perhaps, by subpoena. I know from some of the subpoenas submitted \nby the minority that appear to focus on money spent by these groups--\ngroups such as the Christian Coalition, Right to Life, the Sierra Club, \nthe unions, and so on. A lot of organizations raise money and use that \nmoney to ``educate their voters.'' Maybe they do a lot more. Maybe they \nwant to educate every voter in America. Organized labor put in millions \nof dollars in this last election. I am on the Rules Committee and I \nhope that we have hearings. I would say to the chairman of the Rules \nCommittee, have hearings on soft money. What influence did it have on \nindependent expenditures?\n  I think it is perfectly proper for the Rules Committee to investigate \ncampaign finance reform. We put in an extra $450,000 in this resolution \nfor the Rules Committee to investigate ``legal but improper'' \nactivities. If somebody deems a legal act to be improper, well that is \nthe eyes of the beholder. But the Rules Committee, the committee of \njurisdiction, the committee that will be charged with writing campaign \nfinance reform, should be the committee that is going to be trying to \nfigure out how you handle soft money.\n  For those who have not really looked into campaign finance reform \nbefore, I will tell you: There is not an easy answer on soft money. \nSome people just say ban it. Well, if you just automatically say ban \nit, you probably have not thought about it very much. You probably have \nnot thought, ``Wait a minute. Are we going to tell an organization they \ncan't communicate their views to members on legislation pending or on a \nMember's vote on whether they are for their side or against this \nside?'' I do not think we want to do that. I think that can become an \ninfringement on the people's rights of free speech. I think it may very \nwell be declared unconstitutional. I really do not have any interest in \nus passing legislation just to have it to be declared unconstitutional \nby the courts.\n  So my point is that issues concerning independent expenditures and \nsoft money are not easily dealt with. I will tell my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle that I would be happy to work with others that \nhave ideas. I think there is a real imbalance in today's\n\n[[Page S2073]]\n\nelectoral system. Under today's laws, individuals are limited donations \nof $1,000. But you have unlimited expenditures on soft money. So an \nindividual can only put in $1,000. But you might have a wealthy person \nput in $10 million to try to educate the populace on a particular \nissue. Another example, as the Senator from Virginia found out, you \nmight run against a very wealthy candidate that might put in $12 \nmillion or $15 million and just swamp the airwaves. Yet, a Senator or \nanother individual, if they don't have a lot of resources, would be \nlimited to $1,000 per election, and $2,000 for a primary and general \nelection. There are some real imbalances here and I would like to see \nus work to correct those.\n  I think that is properly done in the Rules Committee, not the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. The Governmental Affairs Committee is \nnot going to be marking up the legislation on this issue. When you are \ndealing with the oversight on independent expenditures, on soft money, \non legal campaign activity and the investigations, the Rules Committee \nshould lead. The investigations under the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee is where we have the subpoena power. That is where we are \ntalking about trying to uncover what has happened. We have \nconstitutional responsibilities within this committee to exercise \noversight and find out if the laws have been broken. That is one of our \nresponsibilities on Government Affairs and we need to do it.\n\n  I don't think it would be fair to be calling on people who have \nallegedly broken the law, having them sworn in, giving depositions \nunder oath, making statements before the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, and then the next week be calling in groups under the same \ncircumstances that were acting legally under the current system. I \nthink they would be unfairly tainted with the same broad brush of \nillegal activity. I do not think that is right. I think it would be a \nmistake.\n  So I compliment my colleague from Virginia. I think he has designed a \ngood resolution, a resolution that we can pass. It is a resolution that \nprotects the jurisdictions of each committee. We actually have three \ncommittees involved. We have the Governmental Affairs Committee, which \nhas very broad jurisdiction.\n  My colleague from Michigan asked if they can not investigate \neverything else. The Governmental Affairs Committee basically has the \nauthority under its legislative authority to investigate almost \nanything related to Government. And so some people say, why even bother \ntrying to delineate what they can investigate? They can investigate \nanything. However, I think what we have come up with a solution to let \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee investigate the illegalities of the \nlast election, whether it be congressional or presidential. Let the \nRules Committee conduct hearings on campaign finance reform and soft \nmoney and include hearings on improper activities, if there truly were \nimproper activities. Maybe we can come to a consensus on how to handle \nsoft money or independent expenditures. And if we find Members who have \nviolated the rules or the laws, have those be referred to the Ethics \nCommittee.\n  Some people say that the Ethics Committee is a chamber that no one \nhears from. I have been in the Senate now 17 years, and I can think of \nat least 5 Senators who are not here primarily as a result of the \nEthics Committee. They do made a difference and they changed people's \ncareers. They caused people to retire. They caused people not to run \nfor reelection or they caused expulsion from the Senate. So the Ethics \nCommittee does exercise its responsibility.\n  I compliment my colleague from Virginia. I think the delineation and \nprotection is important. Frankly, if I was chairman of the Rules \nCommittee, I would guarantee you I would be down here fighting for my \ncommittee's jurisdiction. We do it all the time. The Rules Committee \ndoes have jurisdiction over campaign finance reform and it should fight \nto protect that. It should have any hearings on independent \nexpenditures. And my colleagues, if they want to get into it, I am all \nfor it. Have the hearings. But to me it is in the right scenario. It is \nnot putting people under oath and subpoenaing documents and making them \nsubmit to the same procedures as when illegal activities before a \ncommittee are under consideration.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. First, I as chairman wish to give assurance of the \nSenator, who is a member of the committee, and other members, it has \nbeen the intention of the Rules Committee to continue as we did last \nyear with extensive hearings--six in total. We will continue this year, \nand we will deal with those issues relating to soft money and \nindependent expenditures. Somebody thinks you can take a hand and \nremove soft money but it is just all driven into the independent \nexpenditure. And then you come straight to the first amendment and an \nindividual's right to speak and to spend, which the Supreme Court of \nthe United States has basically equated under their interpretation of \nthe Constitution. Am I not right on that?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I think the Senator is correct. We may well have the \ndebate on this this week, just to answer my colleague. We may well have \nthe debate on whether or not we will have a constitutional amendment to \nlimit the first amendment as it pertains to speech in campaigns. Some \npeople advocate that. I do not happen to be one. But again that is a \nfair debate and one that we will probably have in the Chamber.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could continue with the question, and \nI recognize two other Senators are seeking recognition so I will be \nbrief, but several of our colleagues, and I respect their views, have \ncome during the course of this very good debate this afternoon on this \nissue and tried to indicate in their judgment that this action by the \nRules Committee is a deterrent, stalling or in another way impeding the \nprogress of the Senate on the generic subject of campaign finance \nreform, which we have been working on now for some 2 years, and I do \nnot think this is in any way a deterrent. As a matter of fact, the \nGovernmental Affairs committee is to go on until next December.\n  It would be my hope and expectation that the distinguished majority \nleader and the Senator from Oklahoma in consultation with the minority \nleader would work on a schedule that is mutually agreeable. And I also \nwish to commend the Senator for taking the leadership in consultation \nwith the majority leader to have a specific task force within our group \nthat is now assessing what can be done and what will withstand \nconstitutional scrutiny of the Federal courts to put a package \ntogether. It would be wrong to put a package through here if we all \nknew, many of us being lawyers, that it was going to be struck down by \nthe Federal courts. But it is an easy thing to go out amidst this \npublic concern, rightful concern about campaign finance reform, shovel \nthe legislation out knowing that in a year's time it will be struck \ndone by the courts. And that is wrong.\n  So I wonder if the Senator would just take a minute to describe the \nwork of the task force. We have now had three meetings. In my judgment, \nwe are making progress and I hope that the Senator shares that \njudgment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my colleague. Let me just make a couple of \ncomments, Mr. President. One, we do have a group that is currently \nworking on campaign finance reform. And to those who are saying that \nthis effort of having the Rules Committee have jurisdiction over \ncampaign reform is a stall--I think it is quite the opposite. I think \nhaving the Rules Committee retain its historical, legitimate \njurisdiction over campaign reform is the right thing to do. I also \nthink it is the best thing to do if you want to have real campaign \nreform, if you want to get something passed.\n  Now, we can work simultaneously. I believe the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee is going to be swamped. It has numerous allegations to \nreview. Allegations have been made almost on a daily basis for weeks \nand weeks now. The list is very long. If you tack on to that, an \nadditional general oversight on campaign reform, I think that bogs down \nthe process for, one, getting the original investigation resolved and, \ntwo, it bogs down campaign reform.\n  Now, I think by separating the two oversight responsibilities by \nhaving\n\n[[Page S2074]]\n\nhearings on campaign reform in the Rules Committee, it will allow the \nRules Committee to consider those issues and to go ahead and work on \nlegislation. We may have to do the legislation in a couple of pieces. \nSome people are very adamant on passing campaign reform legislation \nthis year and they think we can only do it in one piece. I would urge \nmy colleagues--and I see my friend from Wisconsin here--who are really \ninterested in campaign reform to think of possibly what we can do. What \ncan we put together now that has bipartisan support that we can pass?\n  I can think of several things. Full and immediate disclosure for soft \nmoney, for independent expenditures and for all hard money. There is a \nlot of money under the table right now. We do not have any idea, for \nexample, how much total money that organized labor put into the \ncampaigns. We do not have any idea how much different groups have put \nin. We could require immediate disclosure, and I bet we could get an \noverwhelming vote, even a unanimous vote, for immediate disclosure.\n  I think we can do some other things. There are a lot of other good \nideas but I do not know that I should throw all of them out because I \nam starting to negotiate on these with my Democrat colleagues who want \nto make some real reform. Maybe we could come up with a consensus \npackage now that includes reform on individual and special interest \nmoney. Some people advocate confining money to being raised in their \nState or district. I am for looking into that. Let us negotiate and see \nif we cannot put together a package by having oversight in the Rules \nCommittee to include issues of independent expenditures and soft money. \nLet us see if we can come up with an agreement on that. Maybe the \nhearings will evolve to where we can come to a consensus on these \nissues. Also, maybe at the conclusion of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, we may find other statutes that need to be changed.\n  Most of the things that we are looking at investigating right now \nconcern statutes that are fairly clear. In some cases, they have been \nambiguous. I noticed the statute in section 607, where it says it shall \nbe unlawful for any person to solicit in a Government building. And the \nVice President said he is exempt from the law. I find that to be a \nstretch. I do not see an exemption there for the Vice President. But if \nhe is correct, maybe we need to change the law.\n  And so maybe these hearings will evolve and we will learn a little \nbit more about what should be included in our laws. I am happy to do \nthat. But I do not think the Rules Committee has to wait on the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee to act. I am willing to act earlier. I \nam very, very serious about trying to work to see if we cannot come up \nwith bipartisan consensus legislation. Once we have passed that, to see \nif we can come up with those elements that we can agree upon such as \nmaking sure, for example, that all contributions for political \ncampaigns are voluntary. To me that is a fundamental right. We should \nhave that in a package.\n  So let us put together a package, pass it and then if we determine \nbecause of the Governmental Affairs Committee hearings or the Rules \nCommittee hearings that we need to do further work, we can address it \nand pass that possibly later.\n  So again, I compliment my friend from Virginia for his resolution. I \nam hopeful that we will be able to pass it soon. I am hopeful--I see my \ncolleague from Ohio--that we will be able to work together in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee in a bipartisan fashion to get the facts \nout and to conclude. I will tell my colleague I was one that said let \nus try to wrap this up this year. I do not want this thing going on \nforever. So we will work towards that end. I thank my colleagues, and I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that was a very interesting dissertation \nas part of this debate by the distinguished majority whip.\n  I would like to also note that the former chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, the senior Senator from Alaska, \nparticipated throughout the debate in the Rules Committee on this \nissue. He, as well as anyone, understands that committee, the scope of \nits jurisdiction, the wisdom of preserving the jurisdiction, and he \nvoted solidly with us on this matter. So we have three members, the \ndistinguished Senator from Oklahoma, the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska, and the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, who spoke today \nin strong support of this resolution.\n  So we are particularly fortunate that we have three members of the \nother committee that served on the Rules Committee and who gave their \nunqualified support for this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I will not make prolonged remarks this \nevening, but I must reply to some of the things that have been said \nhere because the implication, at least, has been that somehow \nGovernmental Affairs was usurping jurisdiction or something, and that \nRules are protecting their turf in making sure this jurisdiction was \nnot taken over by Governmental Affairs. I think we need to briefly \nreview the bidding and how we got where we are.\n  When all this matter of campaign finance reform first came up, there \nwere a number of committees in the Senate that thought they had a piece \nof this and wanted to have hearings or were quoted in the paper as \nsaying they might look into it. We had Commerce, Judiciary, Foreign \nRelations, the Rules Committee, and Governmental Affairs--all were \ninvolved. What was decided in centering this in Governmental Affairs \nwas not a decision made on the Democratic side at all. To concentrate \nthis in the Governmental Affairs Committee was a decision of the \nRepublican leadership, that they did not want this strung out all over \nthe lot. And with Governmental Affairs having the preeminent \ninvestigative authority in the Senate, they would concentrate \neverything there. The newspaper reports, at least, indicated that the \nleadership got the other committee chairmen to sign off with that \napproach, and it was announced that the Governmental Affairs Committee \nwas going to take the lead in this.\n  That was not a decision made on the minority side. That was a \ndecision made and carried out on the majority side. So there was no \neffort whatsoever by anybody to take some jurisdiction away from \nanother committee.\n  Now, let us follow this through just very briefly as to what \nhappened. When did the Rules Committee finally get interested in this \nand decide it was in their jurisdiction? Only after the funding request \ncame from the Governmental Affairs Committee and the members on the \nRules Committee, who really do not want campaign finance reform, \nblocked the funding, period, not in an official committee meeting, but \nin a meeting just of the Republicans on that committee.\n  Why did they object to the funding rules? Because they have an \nobjection to campaign finance reform. This got into a real impasse, a \nreal impasse with Republican leadership. So, then it became a deal cut \nto say we will water down what Governmental Affairs is going to do and \nwe will let the Rules Committee handle this, because we have members \nopposed to campaign finance reform on the Rules Committee.\n  It has been pointed out that we have members now on the Rules \nCommittee that are also on the Governmental Affairs Committee, three \ncrossovers, three people with dual membership on both committees, who \nvoted on the Rules Committee to do what this Senate Resolution 39 that \nwe are debating is supposed to do. But I would point out, those are the \nsame three members who voted unanimously on the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, unanimously on the scope, unanimously on what was to be \nlooked into, unanimously there would be no-holds-barred, unanimously we \nwould look into soft money, unanimously we would look into legal, \nillegal, improper, whatever--wherever the track led us. That is what \nthey voted for on the Governmental Affairs Committee, and that is the \nreason it went to the Rules Committee that way.\n\n  It was only after members of the Rules Committee put this whole thing \ninto a quagmire of dissent and were going to block any funding that \nthis so-called compromise arrangement--or capitulation, I would term \nit--was\n\n[[Page S2075]]\n\nworked out. And that is just exactly how this thing developed.\n  So, all the talk here about how the Rules Committee members voted \nthis so it must be right because they are also on Governmental Affairs \nignores that they are the ones who voted unanimously on Governmental \nAffairs for the scope, for everything we wanted to look into. We hoped \nwe could work out a goal. All of these things that were voted out of \ncommittee only got objections after it got over to the Rules Committee \nwhere any funding was stopped by the people who basically do not want \nany campaign finance reform.\n  I hate to be so blunt, but that is exactly----\n  Mr. WARNER. Will my colleague yield for a second?\n  Mr. GLENN. I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think, if you are going to have that rendition of \nfacts, you should also include that those same members asked for $11-\nplus million and no time limitation, which, if I may with respect, you \nand your colleagues objected to. So that changed the entire formula for \nthose three members.\n  Mr. GLENN. How did that change the formula, changing the money?\n  Mr. WARNER. When you denied them the fact they could go on without a \ntime limitation, and the amount of money. My recollection is that you \nwere only going to grant $1.8 million.\n  Mr. GLENN. No, let me correct that, because what happened on this was \nthat was a proposal from the Democratic side. It was voted down on \nRepublican side. And the $6.5 million was voted out of committee to the \nRules Committee and the Democrats, who had thought we could get by with \na much lower figure because every other committee had, going into this \ninvestigation with the idea that you always could come back and ask for \nmoney--which was done in the case of Watergate, with five different \nallocations of money. They voted out of committee $6.5 million. That is \nwhat went to the Rules Committee. So we had gotten past that hurdle \nthere. We were going with $6.5 million over at Rules, and that is when \nRepublican members on the Rules Committee objected to going forward. \nThat was not the Democratic side. That is how we got to where we are \nright now.\n  So I am sure we are going to have more debate on this tomorrow, but I \njust thought I better indicate here, this was not Governmental Affairs \ntrying to usurp jurisdiction. That jurisdiction was given to us by the \nRepublican leadership in trying to combine all of the different \ncommittees that wanted this investigation into one investigation, under \nthe prime investigative committee in the Senate, which is the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. That was a decision of the Republican \nleadership. We had nothing to do with that on our side of the aisle. It \nonly came apart, even after it was voted out of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee unanimously, by all Republican members, and got over \nto the Rules Committee and ran into trouble with some who want no \ncampaign finance reform and objected so strenuously that a deal had to \nbe cut to let them have some jurisdiction back on the Rules Committee \nin the areas of soft money that they are so afraid will be changed, and \nbrought it back over there where they would have more of a chance to \ncontrol it.\n  We, then, on the Governmental Affairs Committee, were charged with \nlooking into only illegalities. That is a far narrower standard, when \nyou get to investigating matters. We had hoped to have, and what the \nRepublican members on the Governmental Affairs Committee had all voted \nfor, was a broad investigation, no-holds-barred, let's set the basis \nfor campaign finance reform for the future. That is basically what is \nbeing denied now.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I shall yield momentarily to my \ndistinguished colleague after just one further fact. The Rules \nCommittee--we went back and checked it again--noted that concerning the \nrequest for funding from the Governmental Affairs Committee, which in \nthe tradition of the Senate both the chairman and the ranking would \nsign, the distinguished ranking member of the Governmental Affairs did \nnot sign the financial request for $11-plus million that came to our \ncommittee.\n  So I think there are a few other facts that should be brought to bear \nas we look at this situation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it was not too long ago, just last June, \nwhen I joined the senior Senator from Arizona and the senior Senator \nfrom Tennessee, as well as the senior Senator from Minnesota and other \nSenators, in offering in this body the first bipartisan campaign \nfinance proposal in over a decade. Although the legislation had \nreceived unprecedented bipartisan support, including the backing of \nPresident Clinton and Ross Perot and Common Cause, 161 different \neditorial boards nationwide and some 60 congressional Democrats and \nRepublicans, we in this body did fail to invoke cloture on that measure \nby 6 votes.\n  We have heard some interesting arguments during the past summer about \nthis in the public debate, when we did finally debate campaign finance \nreform for just 2 days under a series of rules that would not allow us \nto amend the bill but would only allow us to have a debate for 2 days \nand then vote immediately on cloture.\n  That was the deal we had to accept, just to have this issue heard in \nthis body and before the American people. But we did so because we \nwanted a chance to be heard.\n  We were told on that occasion by our opponents, led by the junior \nSenator from Kentucky, very clearly that he believed there really \nwasn't much of a problem with our current campaign finance system. We \nwere told that the explosion in campaign spending that we had seen in \n1992 and, again, in the 1994 elections was not only not a cause for \nalarm; we were told by some, led by the senior Senator from Kentucky, \nthat this onslaught of campaign cash was healthy for democracy. That is \nwhat we were told, and it carried the day, although a majority of this \nbody did vote to go forward. The status quo, we were told, was \ndemocracy at its finest, and more spending, more big spending, would \nonly make it better.\n  Of course, we heard the other side of this debate from those of us \nwho adamantly are opposed to the status quo, and at one point during \nthe public debate over this issue, I recall very clearly hearing both \nthe Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], and the Senator from Tennessee \n[Mr. Thompson], predict that the 1996 elections would produce a large-\nscale scandal. They predicted a scandal. I also remember their stern \nwarnings that it would be a scandal of grand magnitude that would \neventually compel the Congress to pass meaningful campaign finance \nreform.\n  Mr. President, based on what has happened in the months that followed \nthat debate, what was right? Who was right? Those who were proclaiming \nthat money in politics was a match made in Heaven, or those who \nsuggested that money in politics was closer to gasoline and matches?\n  I believe the debate we are having today, and the endless headlines \nand media reports of abuses by both sides of the aisle in the last \nelection, provide a clear answer to that question. In fact, the Senator \nfrom Kentucky and others who opposed our effort last June on the \ngrounds that we needed more campaign spending, not less, got exactly \nwhat they wanted in the last election. They got more spending all \nright.\n  The 1996 elections set an all-time record for campaign spending at \n$2.7 billion--$2.7 billion, Mr. President. Now, was democracy \nstrengthened, as the Senator from Kentucky suggested it would be? I \ndon't think so. Considering that the fewest percentage of Americans \nwent to the ballot in 72 years in that election, I would say that we \ncan lay to rest the theory that more campaign spending increases \nparticipation in our political system and is somehow good for \ndemocracy.\n  The resolution before us today provides about $4.3 million for the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee to conduct an investigation into \nreported illegalities stemming from just the 1996 elections. This \nincludes abuses both in the Presidential and congressional elections. \nThe investigation, as we have laid out here today, must conclude by\n\n[[Page S2076]]\n\nDecember 31, and a report must be issued by the committee within 1 \nmonth after that date.\n  Ultimately, I certainly will support this resolution, because I \nstrongly believe these activities must be investigated on a bipartisan \nbasis. That is why I have also supported an appointment of an \nindependent counsel to investigate both Republican and Democratic \nabuses in the 1996 elections. I am aware that several of my colleagues \noriginally held to the position, as the senior Senator from Ohio is \npointing out, that the committee should only examine abuses in the \nPresidential election, but in light of the recent revelations about \npotential congressional campaign finance abuses in the last election, I \ncommend the authors of this resolution for their willingness to \ninvestigate wrongdoing at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  I am concerned, however, that this resolution is confined to the 1996 \nelections. Just in the past few days, allegations have come to light \nabout the 1992 elections and potential wrongdoing by the current \nSpeaker of the other body, as well as a former Vice President of the \nUnited States. These 1992 allegations are as serious, in my mind, as \nthe 1996 allegations, and they warrant a full investigation by the \noversight committees. The use of the White House and the office of the \nVice President for activities related to fundraising I don't think was \ninvented in 1996. That is just my guess, but I am pretty sure it was \nnot invented in 1996.\n  Although it is imperfect, I will ultimately support the underlying \nresolution to allow this investigation to go forward and hope that the \ncommittee, under the strong leadership of the Senators from Tennessee \nand Ohio, will conduct a balanced and bipartisan investigation process.\n  But we have to recognize that these investigations are only one small \nstep forward. We have to understand that these abuses, on both sides of \nthe aisle, were an almost inevitable byproduct of a campaign finance \nsystem that has virtually no restraints on candidate or party spending \nand no restraints whatsoever on the so-called soft money contributions \nthat seem to be at the focal point of so many of these abuses.\n  These abuses, as the Senators from Arizona and Tennessee predicted \nlast June, were simply inevitable. Yes, it is illegal to raise campaign \nfunds from the White House or from a Senate office. Yes, it is illegal \nto accept campaign contributions from nonresident foreign nationals. \nNow, that is clear. But let us talk about fundraising practices where \nthe lines between what is legal and illegal and what is ethical and \nunethical become far more blurred. This is very, very difficult to \ndetermine whether something is simply illegal or legal.\n\n  For example, under current law, it is viewed as legal for a \ncorporation, a labor union or a wealthy individual to hand the \nPresident of the United States or a U.S. Senator acting on behalf of \ntheir political parties a check for $400,000. As long as the check is \nmade out to the party and not the person accepting or even soliciting \nthe check, it is widely viewed as legal. It is called soft money, which \nis unlimited campaign contributions from sources which are normally \nrestricted in their contributing, based on the reforms that were \nenacted some 20 years ago.\n  For example, corporations and labor unions, which are strictly \nforbidden from contributing directly to Federal candidates, can \ncontribute unlimited sums of money to the national parties, which then \nfunnel these funds into various House and Senate races. Mr. President, \nI don't think anyone in this body is going to be able to fool the \nAmerican people on this. What this system is is a giant money \nlaundering operation, and it is done openly. That is what it is. It is \na giant money laundering operation, known as soft money.\n  It is also considered legal, apparently, for elected officials to \ntrade access for huge campaign contributions. That is probably on the \nlegal side of the ledger. Let me give you a couple of examples.\n  In 1995, the Republican National Committee promised $15,000 donors \nfour meetings a year with House and Senate Republican leaders, as well \nas participation in international trade missions. That same year, the \nDemocratic National Committee offered $10,000 donors the opportunity to \nparticipate in trade missions to Budapest, Vienna, and Paris.\n  This system of exchanging access to elected officials for large \ncampaign contributions was recently referred to by a Member of this \nbody as ``the American way,'' that it is simply the American way to do \nthings this way. Mr. President, if that is true, it is an awfully sad \nday for America.\n  The abuses that have been uncovered in recent elections are the \nsymptoms, not the disease. The disease is our failed campaign finance \nsystem. Nowhere is this more visible than with the virtual explosion of \nso-called soft money. In the 1992 elections, about $86 million was \nraised by the two national parties in these so-called soft money \ncontributions. In 1994, that figure jumped to over $100 million. And \nthen in the 1996 elections, soft money exploded, and the two parties \naccumulated over $263 million in soft money contributions. That, Mr. \nPresident, is more than a 150 percent increase in just 2 years.\n\n  When is this body going to stand up and say that it should be \nillegal, clearly illegal, for anyone, whether you are from Jakarta or \nJanesville, WI, to make a $400,000 contribution?\n  When is this body going to stand up and say that we should reform a \nsystem that reelects incumbents well over 90 percent of the time?\n  When is this body going to stand up and say there is simply too much \nmoney flowing through our campaign system? And, yes, we do need--soon--\ncomprehensive bipartisan reform.\n  I just got here a little while ago, got to the floor, and heard the \narguments of, yes, we are going to have the investigation and, yes, we \nare going to have a vote on the constitutional amendment on campaign \nfinance reform. I am hopeful no one will be fooled. That combination of \nlimited hearings that have to do with only illegal conduct and a vote \non a constitutional amendment that will lose is simply a way to sweep \nthis issue under the rug. That is all it is. That is a deadly \ncombination. That would be the death of campaign finance reform, to \nsimply pretend that a vote on a constitutional amendment, with the \nbarriers that are involved there in a limited hearing, will somehow \ntake care of this problem.\n  Many of the people who are saying that they are concerned and want to \nwork on this issue are the very ones that voted last year to not even \nput campaign finance reform on the agenda of the 104th Congress. So we \nought to very carefully examine their claims that the combination of a \ncouple days of debate on a constitutional amendment and limited \nhearings will do the job. If it can be accomplished, it will be a very \nneat trick. And it worked in the 104th Congress, but it will not work \nin the 105th Congress.\n  Mr. President, it will not be possible to contain this issue. It will \nnot be possible to just sweep it under the rug.\n  Mr. President, make no mistake, the investigations and the issue of \nlegislating campaign finance reform are automatically and inextricably \nlinked to each other. Let me say, if these investigations are done \nright, it can help.\n  An investigation that shines a spotlight on the darkest corners of \nour campaign finance system can be a useful endeavor so long as those \nwho benefit the most from our current campaign finance rules are \nwilling to turn the spotlight on themselves.\n  Passage of this resolution, if done right, is a first step. But I do \nnot believe its passage will change one bit the public's perception \nthat their Government and the elected leaders are for sale.\n  The only way we can truly begin the process of restoring the trust \nand faith of the American people in their elected officials is to pass \nmeaningful, bipartisan campaign finance reform. It is my sincere hope \nthat opportunity presents itself in the coming months. And I look \nforward to a thoughtful debate on the issue as well as negotiations \nwith regard to the specifics.\n  So although I will support this resolution, I will also support \nefforts to strengthen it by explicitly broadening its scope to include \nboth legal and illegal fundraising activities as well as including the \nelections prior to 1996 where the seeds of much of this abuse were \nplanted.\n  Mr. President, what I just described was the original scope of the \nhearings approved by the Governmental Affairs\n\n[[Page S2077]]\n\nCommittee on a bipartisan, unanimous vote of 16 to 0. And those who \nsupported the narrowing of this scope owe the American people an \nexplanation of why we are only going to examine some of the abuses but \nnot all of the abuses.\n  In my view, many of the issues can be investigated even under the \nwording of the resolution before us. In other words, I think it is \ngoing to be very difficult to simply make a legal ruling that something \nwas legal or illegal without looking at the facts. And I do think, \nhowever, though it would be preferable to restore the specific language \nregarding the detailed scope that was originally outlined by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the \nfloor.\n\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask my distinguished colleague from \nWisconsin a question.\n  We reviewed your bill with great care in the Rules Committee. You \nwill recall that. I think you appeared before the committee, am I not \ncorrect in that?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I do recall that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Essential to this whole debate is the question of unions. \nYet my colleague from Wisconsin excluded that from consideration in his \nbill.\n  What do you say as to why you purposefully left an important part of \nreform out of your proposed legislation?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the answer to the question is, the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia must be talking about a different \nbill. This bill bans soft money. The labor unions in this country, I \nbelieve, spent $7 million this year on soft money. That is wiped out by \nthe McCain-Feingold bill.\n  Second, this bill added last year, and it has in this year's version, \nsignificant limitations on political action committees. I believe the \nunions in this country spent about $14 million on political action \ncommittees.\n  Our bill says, if you want the benefit of the voluntary limits within \nthe bill, you have to limit how much you get from political action \ncommittees to total to less than 20 percent of your total campaign \ncontributions.\n  It also takes down the amount that a political action committee can \ngive from $5,000 to $1,000 to the individual limit.\n  These are severe and real restrictions which I can assure you that \nthe labor unions do not like. In fact, last year there was a meeting of \nvarious labor unions and business groups and women's groups and others \nsaying they were very unhappy.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me say, in answer to the question, the \nSenator from Arizona and I have said in the past we are willing to look \nat other provisions relating to this broader issue as long as it is \nfair from the point of view of looking at issues of corporate giving, \nof share-holding money and the giving activities of other organizations \nthat use their members' dues. That is possible.\n  So we have two major limitations on unions in the bill now. And we \nare willing to discuss an evenhanded provision that relates to other \nissues. It is simply not the case----\n  Mr. WARNER. If I----\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Let me finish. It is simply not the case, Mr. \nPresident, that anyone has barred limitations that affect unions in our \nbill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Do I understand that on the question of dues, these are \nin many instances deducted from the paycheck. Am I not correct in that?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, that is one of a variety of issues that \nhas to do with how unions operate. There are issues of how corporations \ntake money from shareholders, profits to use on campaigns. There are \nissues about how the National Rifle Association, for example, takes its \nmembers' dues and uses that for their activities. These are issues that \ncan be considered.\n  Now, I will agree with the Senator, we have not put a provision \nrelating to all of this in our bill at this point because I think it is \npossible that if we try to take all of that on, it could kill campaign \nfinance reform. It could make it very difficult for us to ban soft \nmoney and to put a voluntary limitation system on Members of Congress \nwith incentives.\n  But the Senator from Arizona and I have been very careful in saying \neverything is potentially on the table, and we want to negotiate. \nNothing has been stopped from being considered as this bill comes \nforward.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I just conclude by saying that over $35 \nmillion was spent by the unions in the last election, to the best of my \nknowledge.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. A brief rejoinder on that.\n  The Senator mentioned $35 million spent by the unions in the last \nelection. As I illustrated in my remarks, our bill certainly affects at \nleast $20 million worth of spending that unions did with regard to soft \nmoney and political action committees. And may I just point out that \nthe amount of money spent by corporations and other interests in this \ncountry, I think, would simply dwarf the figures that are being thrown \nout around here. That has to be addressed as well.\n  I thank the chair.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, before I introduce my amendment, I would \nlike to correct the statement I made in the earlier debate.\n  The Democrats voted against the $6.5 million recommendation that came \nout of the committee, but we were outvoted on that at the end. We had \nfavored the smaller amount and letting the committee back for \nadditional allocations of money as were required later on if paydirt \nwas being hit, if the hearings were being fruitful.\n  So, the original resolution to rules went with a partisan vote on the \nmoney, but not on the scope because there was unanimous agreement on \nthe scope. And that is what now is largely at issue here. So I just \nwanted to correct that so there would be no misunderstanding on it.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 21\n\n  (Purpose: To clarify the scope of the investigation, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Glenn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 21.\n\n  Mr. GLENN.

A bill to provide for a national standard to prohibit the \noperation of motor vehicles by intoxicated individuals; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                     THE SAFE AND SOBER STREETS ACT\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I introduce a bill that, if \nenacted, will go a long way toward reducing the deadly combination of \ndrinking and driving. I am proud to stand with Senator Mike DeWine of \nOhio in introducing this bill. The Safe and Sober Streets Act of 1997 \nsets a national illegal blood alcohol content [BAC] limit of .08 \npercent for drivers over 21 years of age. The bill gives States that \nhave a limit above .08 BAC, 3 years to adopt .08 laws. States that fail \nto enact this limit will have a percentage of their highway \nconstruction funds withheld.\n  Mr. President, drunk driving continues to be a national scourge that \nimposes tremendous suffering on the victims of drunk driving accidents \nand their loved ones. In 1995, drunk driving increased for the first \ntime in a decade. That year, 17,274 people were killed in alcohol-\nrelated crashes. Every one of those deaths could have been prevented, \nhad the driver decided to call for a ride, handed the keys to a friend, \nor did anything other than taking the wheel.\n  Every 30 minutes someone in America--a mother, husband, child, \ngrandchild, brother, sister--dies in an alcohol-related crash. The \nnumbers are increasing. Our highways are turning into death traps and \nour concrete clover leaves into killing fields.\n  Mr. President, we have made progress over the past few decades in the \nfight against drunk driving. In 1982, 53 percent of motor vehicle \nfatalities involved alcohol; today, alcohol-involved motor vehicle \ncrashes is 40.5 percent. In 1984, I authored the bill that President \nRonald Reagan signed into law to increase the drinking age to 21. Since \n1975, 21 drinking age laws have saved roughly 15,700 lives. And, 2 \nyears ago, Congress passed and President Clinton signed into law a zero \ntolerance bill with sanctions, making it illegal for drivers under 21 \nyears of age to drive with any amount of alcohol in their system.\n  While that shows promise, we know we must do more--17,274 lives lost \nis 17,274 too many. Instituting a national standard for impaired \ndriving at .08 BAC is the next logical step in the fight against drunk \ndriving.\n  There are those who ask why the standard for impaired driving should \nbe .08 BAC. But I think the better question is: why should the standard \nbe as high as .10? We know that any amount of alcohol affects motor \nskills and driving behavior to some degree. A 1991 study by the \nInsurance Institute for Highway Safety indicates that each .02 increase \nin the BAC of a driver with nonzero BAC, nearly doubles the risk of \nbeing in a fatal crash. This means that the risk a driver faces begins \nmuch earlier than when his or her blood alcohol content is at .10 or \n.08, after the first or second drink. In fact, the National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration [NHTSA] reports that in single vehicle \ncrashes, the relative fatality risk of drivers with BAC's of .05 and \n.09 is over 11 times greater than for drivers with a BAC of zero.\n  Mr. President, .08 BAC is not an insignificant level. A 170 lb. male \nmust consume four and a half drinks in 1 hour on an empty stomach to \nreach .08 BAC. This is not social drinking. While most States have .10 \nBAC as their legal limit, it is actually at .08 BAC where driving \nskills are seriously compromised. At that level, the vast majority of \ndrivers are impaired when it comes to critical driving tasks. Braking, \nsteering, speed control, lane changing, and divided attention are all \ncompromised at .08 BAC.\n\n  Thirteen States have .08 BAC limits, and many industrialized \ncountries have .08 BAC limits or lower. Canada, Great Britain, Austria, \nand Switzerland have .08 BAC limits. France and The Netherlands have a \n.05 BAC limit. They adopted these laws because they know that\n\n[[Page S2079]]\n\nthey work. They work for these reasons:\n  First, .08 BAC laws have proven to reduce crashes and fatalities. \nMost States that have adopted the .08 BAC level have found a measurable \ndrop in impaired driving crashes and fatalities. A study conducted by \nRalph Hingson, ScD. and published in the American Journal of Public \nHealth showed that those States that adopted .08 BAC laws experienced a \n16-percent decline in the proportion of fatal crashes involving fatally \ninjured drivers whose BAC were .08 or higher. And, those same States \nexperienced an 18-percent decline in the proportion of fatal crashes \ninvolving drivers whose BAC was .15 or higher. That means that not only \ndid the rates decrease for overall drinking and driving, but also for \ndrivers who were extremely impaired. This same study concluded that if \n.08 BAC were adopted nationwide, 500 to 600 lives would be saved \nannually. That alone should be enough to convince all of us that this \nshould be a national standard.\n  Second, .08 BAC laws deter driving after drinking. Crash statistics \nshow that even heavy drinkers, who account for a high percentage of DWI \narrests, are less likely to drink and drive because of the general \ndeterrent effect of the .08 BAC.\n  All of these facts, Mr. President, show us that .08 BAC needs to be a \nnational standard, not just an option. Different standards lead to \ndifferent perceptions, and in this case these differences can be \ndeadly. In regions with high interstate traffic, a driver should not be \nconsidered ``impaired'' in one State, and then is legally sober by \nsimply crossing a border. Pedestrians, passengers, and safe drivers \nshould be protected no matter in which part of our nation they are.\n  Mr. President, we know that .08 BAC laws work. We know that .08 BAC \nsaves lives. It is incumbent upon us to make sure that .08 BAC laws are \nadopted. That's why my bill gives States 3 years to adopt .08 BAC laws. \nIf a State does not meet that deadline, the Secretary of Transportation \nwill withhold 5 percent of a State's total Interstate Maintenance, \nNational Highway System, and Surface Transportation Program funding \ncombined in fiscal year 2001, and 10 percent for each year thereafter \nuntil that State adopts the .08 BAC limit.\n  Mr. President, sanctions work. While incentive grant programs allow \nStates to decide whether to pass laws on their own, they are \nnotoriously underfunded and States pay little attention. Since the \ninclusion of the .08 BAC limit as an incentive criteria, only seven \nStates have passed laws due to that incentive. The Federal Government \nhas a role to play to ensure that our highways and roads are safe, and \nthat drunk driving is decreased. The public is on our side. We must not \nback down.\n  Mr. President, .08 BAC limits save lives. This bill, if enacted into \nlaw, will work. I urge all my colleagues to join in the fight to \ndecrease drunk driving, to make our roadways safer, and most important, \nto provide comfort to those victims of drunk driving and their families \nthat the Federal Government stands behind them in the memories of their \nloved ones.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, according to the National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration, there were 17,274 alcohol-related traffic \nfatalities in 1995. Each year, 1 million people are injured in alcohol-\nrelated traffic crashes. Alcohol is the single greatest factor in motor \nvehicle deaths and injuries.\n  It is estimated that alcohol-related crashes cost society over $45 \nbillion every year, when you count up items like emergency and acute \nhealth care costs, long-term care and rehabilitation, police and \njudicial services, insurance, disability and workers' compensation, \nlost productivity, and social services for those who cannot return to \nwork and support their families. Just one alcohol-related fatality is \nestimated to cost society $950,000. The cost of each alcohol-related \ninjury averages $20,000.\n\n\n                           fixing the problem\n\n  The legislation we are introducing today would enact nationally a \nstrategy that has been proven to work against alcohol-impaired \ndriving--making it per se illegal to have a .08 level of blood alcohol \ncontent [BAC] when driving.\n  An illegal per se law makes it illegal in and of itself to drive with \nan alcohol concentration measured at or above the established legal \nlevel. Forty-eight States have established a per se law. Thirty-five \nStates have established per se laws at .10 BAC. Thirteen others have \nestablished the law at .08 BAC.\n  Virtually all drivers are substantially impaired at .08 BAC. \nLaboratory and on-road tests show that the vast majority of drivers, \neven experienced drivers, are significantly impaired at .08 BAC with \nregard to critical driving tasks such as braking, steering, lane \nchanging, judgment, and divided attention. The risk of being in a crash \nrises with each BAC level, but rises very rapidly after a driver \nreaches or exceeds .08 compared to drivers with no alcohol in their \nsystems. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has \nconcluded that in single-vehicle crashes, the relative risk for drivers \nwith BAC's between .05 and .09 is over 11 times greater than for \ndrivers with no alcohol in their systems.\n  The .08 laws reduce the incidence of impaired driving at .08. \nHowever, they reduce even more the incidence of impaired driving at \nhigh BAC's over .15.\n  Most States with a .08 law have found that it has helped decrease the \nincidence of alcohol-related fatalities. In California, NHTSA found \nthat the State experienced a 12-percent reduction in alcohol-related \nfatalities. A recent study conducted by a professor at Boston \nUniversity compared the first five States to lower their BAC limit with \nfive nearby States with a .10 limit. Overall, the .08 States \nexperienced a 16 percent reduction in the proportion of fatal crashes \nwith a fatally injured driver whose BAC was .08 or higher, as well as \nan 18 percent reduction in crashes where the fatally injured driver's \nBAC was .15 or higher. The study concluded that if all States lowered \ntheir BAC limits to .08, alcohol-related highway deaths would decrease \nby 500-600 per year.\n  Furthermore, .08 laws make it easier to arrest and convict drivers \nwith BAC's of .10 or .11 because these are no longer borderline cases.\n  Laws establishing a .08 per se limit serve as a powerful deterrent to \ndrinking and driving--sending a message that the State is getting \ntougher on drunk driving, and making people think twice about getting \nbehind the wheel. I strongly support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Breaux and Mr. \n        Gorton):\n  S. 414. A bill to amend the Shipping Act of 1984 to encourage \ncompetition in international shipping and growth of U.S. imports and \nexports, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n\n\n                 the OCEAN SHIPPING REFORM ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, last Congress, we made substantial \nprogress toward enacting ocean shipping reform. The House passed a bill \nand, under the leadership of Senators Lott and Pressler, we in the \nSenate were presented with a very workable framework for ocean shipping \nreform. I am pleased to make it the framework upon which we base the \nbill which Senators Lott, Gorton, Breaux, and I are introducing today. \nIt is my hope that we can develop the consensus necessary to pass this \nmeasure in a timely way.\n  The next step in this process is the hearing later this month before \nthe Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Subcommittee, which I \nchair. I am looking forward to hearing from those who will be impacted \nby our legislative efforts. Ninety-five percent of U.S. foreign \ncommerce is transported via ocean shipping. Half of this trade, which \nis carried by container liner vessels with scheduled service and is \nregulated under the Shipping Act of 1984, is affected by these reforms.\n  This legislation represents an important opportunity to ease the hand \nof regulation on a significant sector of commerce, and eliminate a \nregulatory agency altogether. Our bill terminates the Federal Maritime \nCommission and consolidates remaining maritime regulatory \nresponsibilities into a renamed Surface Transportation Board. Thus, we \nwill eliminate one regulatory agency and improve another by making its \nmission more reflective of the shipping world where commerce moves \nintermodally--over rail, road, and ocean.\n  This bill allows for greater flexibility in service contracting by \nshippers and\n\n[[Page S2080]]\n\nocean common carriers, which will permit freight to move at the most \ncompetitive prices while we continue to protect against discriminatory \npractices. To this end, we continue to require a form of tariff \npublication. However, it is much more flexible than current tariff \nfiling. Tariffs become effective upon publication through a private \nsystem, not the Government, and tariff changes do not require \nGovernment approval. This puts the maritime industry on similar footing \nas other transportation industries which we have deregulated in recent \nyears, providing carriers with much greater rate flexibility. At the \nsame time, we preserve protections required to counter the effects of \nocean carrier antitrust immunity and foreign carrier involvement in \nthis segment of commerce.\n  I look forward to working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto pass this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 414\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation that will update, revise and improve upon the Shipping Act \nof 1984. This legislation is a continuation and extension of work \ninitiated in the last Congress by Representative Bud Shuster, my friend \nin the House of Representatives and Senator Larry Pressler, then \nchairman of the Senate's Commerce Committee.\n  Under the leadership of Senator Pressler, the proposal from the House \nof Representatives was examined through an initial hearing, and it was \nmodified to address the concerns expressed by many in the industry. \nOnly after a critical review of the key issues and concerns was a \nrevised bipartisan amendment to the Senate bill introduced. \nUnfortunately, time ran out in the 104th Congress and the Senate \nCommerce Committee could not hold another hearing on the proposal. \nStill, changes continued to be incorporated into a single new version \nof the amendment, and in the last week of the 104th Congress the \namendment was placed in the Congressional Record.\n  My legislative plan was simple and direct--introduce a bill and then \nhold a hearing so that public input would have a genuine opportunity to \naffect the legislative process. This remains my plan, and that is why I \nused my public ending point in the 104th Congress as my new beginning \npoint in the 105th Congress.\n  As the process began again in this Congress, we again sought input \nfrom the maritime world as we prepared this important legislation for \nreintroduction. In the 104th Congress, the House of Representatives was \nthe first to act. In the 105th Congress, the Senate will be the first \nto act.\n  Mr. President, this explanation of the legislative journey was \nnecessary so that my colleagues will have an appreciation of the \noutreach that was pursued by the Senate in its drafting process \nregarding this shipping reform.\n  Let me say that I grew up in an active port community. In fact, I \nstill live in that port city of Pascagoula. There is nothing in our \nlegislative proposal that is intended to harm the onshore maritime \ncommunity. Believe me, I know first hand the challenges faced by ports \nbecause I have lived with them. I still remember the committee hearing \non the shipping act last year where I had to give lessons in how to \npronounce ``Pascagoula.'' On that day, I wanted to make sure people who \ndevelop and comment on maritime policy know and remember Pascagoula.\n  I would like to add one more comment about the development of this \nlegislation before I say a few words on what the bill will accomplish. \nThe U.S. Coast Guard detailed an officer to the Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee to assist the committee's members and staff on \nboth sides of the isle on issues affecting the Coast Guard and the \nmaritime world. Last year and part of this year we have had the able \nassistance of Lt. Comdr. Jim Sartucci. He was instrumental in \ncollecting comments and in drafting provisions of this proposal in both \nthe 104th and now the 105th Congress.\n  I have received many unsolicited compliments about Jim's willingness \nto listen and merge in a meaningful way, individual proposals from all \nsegments of the maritime world. Everyone that I have encountered has \ntold me that Jim was both professional and fair as we worked through \nthe process.\n  Mr. President, Lieutenant Commander Sartucci has clearly reflected \ngreat credit upon the Coast Guard, the Commerce Committee, and on this \nlegislative proposal.\n  Mr. President, we now know how we got to this point in the \nlegislative process. There are still two topics that need to be \naddressed today.\n  First, why do we need shipping reform and second, how does the bill \naccomplish that reform?\n  In just a few minutes, let me explain why we need shipping reform.\n  Last year's successful maritime reform effort addressed the critical \nrequirement of guaranteeing an American fleet and American crews in the \ncontext of necessary sealift capabilities for deploying and supporting \nour military forces overseas. Our efforts in shipping reform this year \nfocus on the needs of America's ports and Americans who work dockside. \nBoth big and little ports. were considered as part of the process. \nPorts with and without cranes.\n  Mr. President, last year, I spoke at length with the Honorable Helen\n\n[[Page S2084]]\n\nDelich Bentley, the former Maryland Congresswoman. She has been an \neffective defender of ports and maritime labor for years. She is a true \nchampion, and I value her advice. I made a commitment to Helen then and \nI believe it has been honored this year with the legislative language. \nThe legislation will provide adequate protection for small ports and \nsmall shippers. Also, the legislation will ensure that the collective \npower of some industry elements will not be allowed to abuse other \nsegments of the industry.\n  Having said this, it is time to deregulate the ocean shipping \nindustry and to sunset the FMC. The path was started by President \nReagan back in 1984. Senator Slade Gorton, my colleague and friend, was \nthe principal author of this initial step and with his help we took the \nnext step when we put together the proposal in the 104th Congress. I am \nvery pleased that the author of the original act that we are amending \nhas agreed to cosponsor this bill.\n  Mr. President, this year Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison will be leading \nthe charge to complete this second part of maritime reform. She has a \nclear understanding of what is necessary to strike the delicate balance \nto achieve deregulation without permitting marketplace abuses. She will \ndo an excellent job in chairing the hearing and finalizing the \nlegislative language for the full Senate.\n  Let me be very clear; this proposal only deals with liner shipping, \nbasically container ship, legislation--not bulk cargo shipping, which \nrepresents the other half of U.S. ocean borne trade. Do not let the \nopponents of reform confuse the issue. The already deregulated world of \nbulk cargo shipping is not being disturbed.\n  I must also be candid. The challenge is to balance ocean common \ncarrier antitrust issues and large ocean carrier and shipper desires \nfor more private business relationships with meaningful oversight to \nproduce a fair, yet competitive playing field. I believe this \nlegislation strikes the right balance.\n  I must also say that at the Commerce Committee hearing back in 1995, \nboth Senator Breaux and I challenged the witnesses to work with us to \nresolve the concerns we were hearing from our constituents. The \nwitnesses and many others did just that. They showed up and \nparticipated in extensive, good faith negotiations.\n  This bill is not antilabor. The shoreside and seafaring unions \ncontinue to work with us in a constructive manner. Their goal and ours \nis to put in place an ocean shipping framework that eliminates \ninefficient and burdensome regulations, promotes U.S. trade, and in so \ndoing, preserves and creates American jobs.\n  This bill is not about dealing with just a couple of players in the \nmaritime community. Many members of the industry were consulted. We \nprovided a genuine opportunity to participate in dialog as we drafted \nthis bill. Introduction should not stop the consensus seeking process. \nAnd, I hope the discussion will continue with Senator Hutchison as she \nprepares for the upcoming hearing and even following the hearing.\n  Let me now explain how this legislation accomplishes our goals to \nreform this critical industry.\n  This legislation will permit confidential contracting between \nindividual ocean common carriers and shippers, but will continue \ncurrent public filing requirements for joint ocean common carrier \ncontracts. This action balances the desire to make the U.S. ocean liner \ncontracting process consistent with international ocean shipping \npractices and other U.S. transportation modes with the unique \napplication of ocean common carrier antitrust immunity in the ocean \nliner shipping industry. At recent meetings held by the Maritime \nAdministration on the diversion of cargo from U.S. ports, the current \nU.S. ocean liner shipping system was identified as a contributor to \nthis problem. This legislation will help eliminate this U.S. port \nhandicap.\n\n  This legislation will retain common carrier tariff enforcement, but \nwould eliminate the requirement to file tariffs with the Government. \nCommon carriers would be able to take advantage of available modern \ntechnology by using a World Wide Web home page to satisfy the tariff \npublication requirement. This just makes common sense and reduces the \ncost of doing business while maintaining protections for small \nshippers.\n  This legislation will streamline and reform the Federal Maritime \nCommission [FMC], and establish a responsible time line to downsize the \nFMC in accordance with its new mission and merge it with the Surface \nTransportation Board. America will then have a single, centralized, \nindependent, Federal agency where the distinct regulatory systems for \neach mode of transportation are monitored and enforced in a coherent \nmanner.\n  This legislation does much to ensure that America's presence in the \nocean shipping business is not subjected to unfair foreign rules or \npractices. The recent FMC enforcement actions taken against unfair port \npractices in Japan is an illustration of an essential FMC mission that \nis not performed by other Federal agencies. This mission will continue, \nand I will support it wholeheartedly.\n  Let me be clear. This bill will significantly change the regulations \ngoverning ocean transportation in the foreign commerce of the United \nStates while providing Government efficiencies and genuine reforms to \nprotect American interests. The changes will strengthen ocean common \ncarriers' ability to competitively price their services, in turn, \nmaking American shippers more competitive.\n  Mr. President, the world's transportation community is now, and has \nbeen for some time, a seamless intermodal world. With this bill our \nFederal Government will finally be able to think and act in an \nintermodal manner. The American people get less Federal micro-\nmanagement of our ocean shipping industry while receiving the \nprotection of a government agency focused on preserving fair \ncompetition. An economically efficient, market oriented shipping \nindustry provides America an advantage in the global marketplace.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for their attention, and \nI hope they will give serious consideration to becoming a cosponsor to \nthis necessary bipartisan legislative reform. Remember this is not just \na port State matter; it is also an exporting State concern.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Rockefeller, and \n        Mr. Thomas):\n\n  S. 415. A bill to amend the Medicare program under title XVIII of the \nSocial Security Act to improve rural health services, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                THE RURAL HEALTH IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural Health \nImprovement Act of 1997. This bill makes rural health care more \nconvenient, more effective, and more responsive.\n  The cornerstone of this bill is an extension of the successful \nmedical assistance facility program, known as MAF's. Without the Rural \nHealth Improvement Act, MAF will remain only a test program which could \nbe discontinued in the future. Passing this legislation will make MAF's \npermanent and nationwide.\n  Big Timber, MT, is a good example of how MAF could help out a \ncommunity. It is a small ranching and farming town on the edge of the \nAbsaroka mountain range. People in that town of Big Timber say hi and \nchat when they see each other on the street. They are very friendly, \nvery down to Earth, very basic. Every year, the town puts on the Big \nTimber rodeo and black powder shoot. Big Timber is a town like many in \nrural Montana.\n  A few years back, the hospital in Big Timber had to shut down, as is \nthe case with many hospitals in our country. They could not make ends \nmeet with the regulations of the current system. But instead of \nwatching their health care services leave town, the people of Big \nTimber got together and applied for a MAF waiver.\n  I was fortunate enough to be in Big Timber last summer for the grand \nopening of their new MAF building. It was a pretty typical July day in \nMontana, which means it was very hot. But that did not stop the whole \ntown from turning out for the dedication ceremony. The MAF Program not \nonly saved Big Timber's hospital, but it renewed their sense of \ncommunity spirit. It was wonderful to watch, wonderful to see. Big \nTimber faced the same situation many rural communities face every day. \nThey found the solution.\n  Rural life has qualities you cannot find in big cities: The crime \nrate is low;\n\n[[Page S2085]]\n\npeople go out of their way to help a friend in need; and folks take the \ntime to know their neighbors, even if that neighbor happens to live 5 \nmiles down the road.\n  But challenges come with living in such remote surroundings. One of \nthe biggest is access to quality health care. Randy Dixon, a \nphysician's assistance at Philipsburg MAF, really hit the nail on the \nhead when he wrote to me:\n\n       Having arrived in your home State, I am greatly impressed \n     with its magnitude and expanse. However, those same \n     attributes turn into detriments when you are considering \n     access to primary health care. My history and recent \n     acquaintances have taught me that the people of Montana are a \n     tough, resilient people. But those acquaintances also tell me \n     that they have not had consistent, reliable primary care \n     available when that ``toughness'' had a dent or two in it.\n\n  Randy sums up life in rural Montana pretty well, but what he really \nunderscores is the importance of rural medical facilities. In Montana, \nvast distances and bad weather are about the only two things you can \ncount on. Rural hospitals make up a network that blankets Montana and \nmakes access to health care convenient for folks who are isolated by \ndistance and weather. When one of these hospitals closes its doors, the \nnetwork falls apart, and people can no longer depend on access to \nhealth care.\n  Jordan, MT, is another example. Without an MAF, the nearest health \nfacility would be Miles City, over 80 miles away. And whether you have \na serious medical emergency or simply need a routine checkup, 80 miles \nis too far, often, to travel.\n  Rural communities often don't have the patient base or the money to \nsupport a fully functional hospital. Yet, the care that these hospitals \nprovide is irreplaceable.\n  Essentially, Mr. President, there are a lot of communities like \nJordan, like Big Timber, Ekalaka, and other small communities in \nMontana and other parts of our Nation. Under my bill, an MAF can \nprovide emergency services during the day and have someone on call at \nnight. In a small town, that means that the hospital can be opened at a \nmoment's notice. Folks can still have immediate access to emergency \ncare, and rural hospitals do not have some of the same burdens and \noverhead expenses and all the redtape and regulations that the big \nhospitals, unfortunately, often have.\n  MAF makes exceptions to rules like that.\n  The whole point of this legislation is to make the MAF waiver \npermanent, so that hospitals do not have to apply year after year for \nMAF status. Rather, once that status is determined, that status can be \npermanent and people in rural communities can rest a little more \nassured they are going to have pretty good health care.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Rural Health \nImprovement Act of 1997, which I joined in introducing today with \nSenators Baucus, Rockefeller, and Thomas.\n  We've heard a lot lately, Mr. President, about how hospitals are \ndoing better financially than they have in years. ProPAC's recent \nreport to the Congress indicated that the average prospective payment \nmargins for hospitals are becoming healthy again. In 1995, the average \nPPS margin was 7.9 percent; only 3 years before, the average PPS \nmargins were negative.\n  This has truly been a remarkable turnaround, and I applaud hospitals \nfor their success at improving their efficiency. We must remember, \nhowever, that anytime we use average statistics, there are those which \nare below the average, as well as those are above it.\n  In my State of Iowa, as in many areas of the United States, small \nrural hospitals are essential links in the chain of health care access. \nFor these small hospitals, however, economic survival is a constant \nstruggle.\n  There are limits to what we here in Congress can do to help these \nhospitals survive. But I believe that we have an obligation to do our \nbest to give rural Americans a fighting chance at access to health \ncare. And at the very least, we must not hinder small rural hospitals \nas they try to serve their essential role.\n  Unfortunately, our Medicare policies have often been an obstacle, \nrather than a help. Our inflexible rules and reimbursement policies \nhave made it even harder for small, rural hospitals to survive. I am \npleased to report that the legislation we have introduced today is an \nimportant step toward making the Medicare Program a true partner with \nthese hospitals.\n  This bill expands two successful demonstration projects: the Montana \nMedical Assistance Facility project, and the Essential Access Community \nHospital, and Rural Primary Care Hospital projects. These projects have \nbeen limited to eight States, with Iowa not among them. Mr. President, \nI believe that the purpose of demonstration projects is to see what \nworks. Well, the results from the eight States have been very good. It \nis high time to make the same help available to hospitals in all 50 \nStates. That is what this bill will do.\n  This legislation allows the designation of certain hospitals as \ncritical access hospitals. To qualify, hospitals must have average \nlengths of stay of not more than 96 hours, referral relationships with \nlarger hospitals, and 15 or fewer beds, which may be used either for \ninpatient care or as swing beds. The bill also imposes a general \ndistance requirement of 35 miles from another hospital, but this \nrequirement need not be met if the State certifies that the hospital is \na necessary provider of services to residents in the area. The ability \nof States to waive the 35-mile rule is crucial to hospitals in Iowa, \nwhere the distances between communities are not as vast as in some \nWestern states.\n  Critical access hospitals will be given greater flexibility in \nmeeting Medicare regulations that were designed for larger hospitals. \nMost important, the legislation will help these hospitals to make their \ntransition from acute care to less expensive primary care. This is why \nthe General Accounting Office has found that the demonstration project \nhas not only assisted the hospitals, and the rural Americans they \nserve, but that it has actually saved money for the Medicare Program.\n  Mr. President, as you might expect, this bill will make a big \ndifference in Iowa. In 1995, 43 Iowa hospitals had six or fewer \ninpatients per day. Of these 43, 15 had negative operating margins. \nMany of these are not county hospitals, and thus are not subsidized by \ncounty tax revenues. These hospitals are in a real bind, and many will \nbenefit from this legislation. Some of the small towns which are likely \nto be helped are Hawarden, Primghar, Eldora, Rock Valley, Corning, and \nRock Rapids. For these Iowa communities, and for many others across \nAmerica, the Rural Health Improvement Act of 1997 could be a lifesaver. \nI urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues \nfrom Montana, Iowa, and Wyoming, Senators Baucus, Grassley, and Thomas, \nin re-introducing a very important bill for rural communities. My \ncolleague from Montana, Senator Baucus, has long been a strong advocate \nof rural health care issues and I am very pleased to be working with \nhim on such an important issue to rural America. Since Medicare's \nenactment in 1965, the Medicare Program has played a vital role in \nmaking sure senior citizens living in rural areas have adequate access \nto health care services. A disproportionate number of the elderly live \nin rural areas. As a result, rural hospitals are heavily reliant on the \nMedicare Program.\n  Our legislation will provide some basic assistance to help rural \nhospitals keep their doors open. The changes we are recommending are \nbased on carefully studied pilot projects in West Virginia, Montana, \nand other States, and we think it is time to apply some very good ideas \nto the rest of the Nation. I am pleased that President Clinton's budget \nwould also expand Essential Access Community Hospital [EACH] and the \nRural Primary Care Hospital [RPCH] program. We are very interested in \nseeing the specific details of his proposal.\n  Mr. President, most rural hospitals have only one choice when faced \nwith shrinking occupancy rates, declining Medicare and Medicaid \nreimbursement rates, and intense market pressures to lower their costs: \nclose their doors. That is where our bill steps in. When being a full-\nservice hospital is no longer viable, our bill gives them a way to \nbecome what we call a critical access hospital--a way to preserve \nessential primary care and emergency health care services for rural \nAmerica.\n  West Virginia is one of only seven States that is currently allowed \nto operate a EACH/RPCH Program. Since we\n\n[[Page S2086]]\n\nintroduced our bill in the 104th Congress, the EACH/RCPH Program, once \nagain, proved to be the salvation for a rural West Virginia county that \nwas on the brink of losing its access to primary care and emergency \ncare services. Because of the availability of the EACH/RCPH Program in \nWest Virginia, the local residents of Calhoun County, WV were able to \nmerge and reorganize two existing, but financially strapped, health \ncare providers, the Minnie Hamilton Primary Care Center and Calhoun \nGeneral Hospital. A neighboring hospital, Stonewall Jackson, stepped in \nand offered financial and administrative assistance during this very \ndifficult period of time. As a result, Calhoun County now has a \nthriving and financially stable health care provider that is meeting \nthe health care needs of its local residents. This is huge relief to \nthe residents of Calhoun County.\n\n  Mr. President, our bill is modeled on two separate, ongoing rural \nhospital demonstration projects, the EACH-RPCH Program, the other is \nthe Montana Medical Assistance Facility [MAF] Program. The basic \nconcept is to place limits on the number of licensed beds and patient \nlength of stays in the participating rural hospitals, and in exchange, \nhospitals receive Medicare payment rates that will cover their patient \ncare costs, along with badly needed relief from regulations that are \nintended for full-scale, acute care hospitals.\n  We believe, based on work by the General Accounting Office, that our \nlegislation will wind up saving the Medicare Program money. We are \nencouraging the development of rural health networks, to help small, \nrural hospitals save money and improve quality by working more closely \nwith larger, full-service hospitals.\n  I am very proud to note that West Virginia has been a leader in \nhelping small, rural hospitals figure out how to adapt and cope with \nrapid changes in the economics of health care. Six hospitals in West \nVirginia are federally designated RPCH hospitals and six hospitals are \nfederally designated EACH hospitals. I know that many other rural \nStates and rural hospitals are anxious to enjoy the benefits of this \nprogram.\n  Our legislation draws on the lessons learned from the pilot programs, \nimproves on them, and expands them so that rural hospitals and patients \nall across America will have the same benefits. Our legislation will \ngive other States the same opportunities already available in \nCalifornia, Colorado, Kansas, New York, North Carolina, South Dakota, \nand West Virginia through the EACH/RPCH Program and in Montana through \nthe MAF Program.\n  Our legislation is targeted at the 1,186 rural hospitals nationwide \nwith fewer than 50 beds. While these hospitals are essential to \nassuring access to health care services in their local communities, \nthese hospitals account for only 2 percent of total Medicare payments \nto hospitals. In return for certain limits, rural hospitals can count \non Medicare payments and regulatory relief to fit their circumstances. \nThey can form new relationships with health care providers in their \ncommunity, and larger hospitals farther away, so patients have the kind \nof access to care where it is best to get it.\n  Mr. President, as we move to adopt Medicare reforms in the Finance \nCommittee later this year, I will be working to make sure that \ncommonsense reforms to help rural hospitals are also adopted.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 417. A bill to extend energy conservation programs under the \nEnergy Policy and Conservation Act through September 30, 2002; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n          the energy policy and conservation act authorization\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this bill is very simple, yet it \nis extremely important to our Nation's energy security. This bill \ncontains the authorizations for two vital energy security measures, the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve and U.S. participation in the International \nEnergy Agency, which will expire at the end of this fiscal year. This \nbill would extend those two vital authorities, as well as several other \nimportant DOE programs, through 2002.\n  For every year in recent memory, we have authorized this act on a \nyear-to-year basis, and we have faced a potential crisis as these \nauthorizations go unrenewed until the very end of the Congress. We \nalways seem to end up facing a situation where the President does not \nhave authority to withdraw oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve if \nan energy emergency occurs.\n  Further, if these authorities are not renewed, our Government does \nnot have authority to participate in International Energy Agency \nemergency actions in an international energy emergency. There will be \nno antitrust exemption available to our private oil companies to allow \nthem to cooperate with the IEA and our Government to respond to the \ncrisis. These provisions are not controversial in and of themselves, \nbut this bill has a tendency to become a vehicle to address concerns \nover unrelated issues.\n  In an attempt to avoid the annual crisis, I am introducing \nlegislation today that will renew these authorities for 5 years. The \nbill also provides for the leasing of extra capacity in our reserve \nfacilities and changes to the antitrust exemption in the bill to \ncomport with the policies adopted by the IEA at our request.\n  Although it appears to be easy for some to disregard these dangers, \nrecent events have underscored exactly how precarious this Nation's \nenergy security is. Events in the Middle East clearly demonstrate the \ninstability of the region that we rely on to supply the oil that keeps \nthis Nation moving.\n  The situation is only getting worse. Since the establishment of the \nDepartment of Energy, our reliance on imported oil has passed 50 \npercent, and is expected to rise to 71 percent by 2015. The OPEC \ncountries are steadily regaining lost market share and it is projected \nto exceed 50 percent by 2000. The U.S. economy appears to be as exposed \nas it was in the early 1970's to supply disruptions and losses from \nmonopoly oil pricing. We are talking about jobs and people's lives. In \nthe face of these numbers, DOE has no real plan to stop our slide into \nnear complete dependence on foreign sources of oil, and the President's \nbudget contains a proposal to sell 67 million barrels of oil from the \nSPR in the year 2002.\n  I am dismayed by a recent trend toward using the SPR as a piggy bank \nto pay for other programs. The oil in the SPR cost an average of $27 \nper barrel. We have sold it for anywhere from $18 to $20 per barrel. \nBuying high and selling low never makes sense. We're like the man in \nthe old joke who was buying high and selling low who claimed that he \nwould make it up on volume.\n  In the face of our growing oil dependence, and the administration's \nproposal to sell oil from the SPR, I can't resist noting the \nadministration's opposition to the production of our domestic oil \nresources. The administration does not support the domestic storage or \nproduction of oil. They do not appear to like the reality that this \nNation will continue to need petroleum. However, reality doesn't cease \nto be reality because we ignore it.\n  We have already invested a great deal of taxpayer money in these \nstockpiles. As proven during the Persian Gulf war, the stabilizing \neffect of an SPR drawdown far outstrips the volume of oil sold. The \nsimple fact that the SPR is available can have a calming influence on \noil markets. The oil is there, waiting to dampen the effects of an \nenergy emergency on our economy. However, if we don't ensure that there \nis authority to use the oil when we need it, we will have thrown those \ntax dollars away.\n  So, the first step is to ensure that our emergency oil reserves are \nfully authorized and available to dampen the effects of the most severe \nsupply disruptions. We are talking about people's lives and jobs. The \nleast we can do is try to limit the possibility that this measure will \nbe held hostage to political ambition.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this legislation. I \nwould also like to introduce, by request, proposed legislation \ntransmitted by the administration. I ask unanimous consent that the \nadministration's transmittal letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S2087]]\n\n\n\n\n                                      The Secretary of Energy,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 1997.\n     Hon. Al Gore,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Enclosed is a legislative proposal \n     cited as the Energy Policy and Conservation Act Amendments of \n     1997. This proposal would amend and extend certain \n     authorities in the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) \n     which either have expired or will expire September 30, 1997, \n     as well as a weatherization provision in the Energy \n     Conservation and Production Act.\n       The EPCA was enacted in 1975. Title I authorizes creation \n     and maintenance of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (the \n     Reserve), which is the Nation's first line of defense in \n     responding to domestic and international oil supply \n     disruptions. Title II contains authorities essential for \n     maintaining a continuing commitment to the International \n     Energy Program administered by the International Energy \n     Agency (IEA) in Paris. Effective participation by the United \n     States in the IEA is critical to assuring our allies of our \n     mutual energy emergency preparedness in the event of a severe \n     interruption of international oil supplies. Title III \n     contains authorities for certain energy efficiency and \n     conservation programs.\n       As a result of changes in the overall energy environment \n     since the Reserve was authorized in 1975, the Department is \n     conducting a comprehensive review of Reserve policy. That \n     review will be completed during fiscal year 1997. If the \n     review results in recommendations for changes in title I of \n     EPCA, the Department will submit a legislative proposal under \n     separate cover. This would include proposals relating to \n     title I similar to those submitted to the Congress in October \n     1995.\n       Since Reserve and other authorities under EPCA expire on \n     September 30, 1997, it is necessary to extend, until \n     September 30, 1998, authorization for EPCA titles I and II, \n     and several provisions in title III, as well as the \n     Department's weatherization program in title IV of the Energy \n     Conservation and Production Act. The Administration also is \n     proposing amendments to certain provisions in EPCA title II \n     to ensure that the legal authorities for U.S. oil company \n     participation in the IEA's emergency preparedness programs \n     are fully in accord with current U.S. and IEA emergency \n     response policy. The United States has long advocated a \n     policy at the IEA of coordinated drawdown of government-\n     controlled oil stockpiles (e.g., the Reserve) to respond to \n     international oil supply disruptions, with reference on the \n     IEA's emergency oil allocation program as a last resort. This \n     is now IEA's accepted policy. Unfortunately, EPCA's current \n     antitrust provisions do not enable U.S. oil companies to take \n     part in the full range of IEA oil crisis planning activities. \n     The Administration's proposed bill would amend the present \n     limited antitrust defense available to U.S. oil companies to \n     enable them to assist the IEA in planning or implementing a \n     coordinated drawdown of government-controlled oil stockpiles.\n       The proposed legislation and a sectional analysis are \n     enclosed. The Office of Management and Budget advises that \n     submission of this proposal to the Congress would be in \n     accord with the President's program.\n       We look forward to working with the Congress toward \n     enactment of this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Charles B. Curtis,\n                                                 Acting Secretary.\n\n                           Section-by-Section\n\n\n        section 2. energy policy and conservation act amendments\n\n       Section 2 of the bill would amend the Energy Policy and \n     Conservation Act.\n       Paragraph (1) would amend section 166 of EPC to authorize \n     appropriations necessary to implement the Strategic Petroleum \n     Reserve for fiscal year 1998.\n       Paragraph (2) would amend section 181 of EPCA by extending \n     the expiration date of title I, parts B and C from September \n     30, 1997 to September 30, 1998.\n       Paragraph (3) is a technical correction which would amend \n     section 251(e)(1) by striking section ``252(1)(l)'' and \n     inserting in lieu thereof ``252(k)(l).''\n       Paragraph (4) would amend section 252 of EPCA, which makes \n     available to United States oil companies a limited antitrust \n     defense and breach of contract defense for actions taken to \n     carry out a voluntary agreement or plan of action to \n     implement the ``allocation and information provisions'' of \n     the Agreement on an International Energy Program (``IEP''). \n     These limited defenses are now available only in connection \n     with the companies' participation in planning for and \n     implementation of the IEP's emergency oil sharing and \n     information programs. The amendment would extend the section \n     252 antitrust defense (but not the breach of contract \n     defense) to U.S. companies when they assist the International \n     Energy Agency (``IEA'') in planning for and implementing \n     coordinated drawdown of government-owned or government-\n     controlled petroleum stocks. In 1984, largely at the urging \n     of the United States, the IEA's Governing Board adopted a \n     decision on ``Stocks and Supply Disruptions'' which \n     established a framework for coordinating the drawdown of \n     member countries' government-owned and government-controlled \n     petroleum stocks in those oil supply disruptions that appear \n     capable of causing severe economic harm, whether or not \n     sufficient to activate the IEP emergency oil sharing and \n     information programs. During the 1990-91 Persian Gulf crisis, \n     the IEA successfully tested the new coordinated stockdraw \n     policy.\n       Subparagraph (4)(A) would amend subsection 252 (a) and (b) \n     of EPCA. These sections would be amended by substituting the \n     term ``international emergency response provisions'' for the \n     term ``allocation and information provisions of the \n     international energy program.'' The new term establishes the \n     scope of oil company activities covered by the antitrust \n     defense and includes actions to assist the IEA in \n     implementing coordinated drawdown of petroleum stocks.\n       Subparagraph (4)(B) would amend paragraph 252(d)(3) of EPCA \n     to clarify that a plan of action submitted to the Attorney \n     General for approval must be as specific in its description \n     of proposed substantive actions as is reasonable ``in light \n     of circumstances known at the time of approval'' rather than \n     ``in light of known circumstances.''\n       Subparagraph (4)(C) would amend paragraph 252(e)(2) of EPCA \n     to give the Attorney General flexibility in promulgating \n     rules concerning the maintenance of records by oil companies \n     related to the development and carrying out of voluntary \n     agreements and plans of action.\n       Subparagraph 4(D) would amend paragraph 252(f)(2) of EPCA \n     to clarify that the antitrust defense applies to oil company \n     actions taken to carry out an approved voluntary agreements \n     as well as an approved plan of action.\n       Subparagraph 4(E) would amend section 252(h) of EPCA to \n     strike the reference to section 708(A) of the Defense \n     Production Act of 1950, which was repealed by Public Law 102-\n     558 (October 28, 1992), and the reference to the Emergency \n     Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, which expired in 1981.\n       Subparagraph 4(F) would amend subsection 252(i) of EPCA to \n     require the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission \n     to submit reports to Congress and to the President on the \n     impact of actions authorized by section 252 on competition \n     and on small businesses annually rather than every six \n     months, except during an ``international energy supply \n     emergency,'' when the reports would be required every six \n     months.\n       Subparagraph 4(G) would amend paragraph 252(k)(2) of EPCA \n     by substituting a definition of the term ``international \n     emergency response provisions'' for the present definition of \n     ``allocation and information provisions of the international \n     energy program.'' The new term, which establishes the scope \n     of company actions covered by the antitrust defense, covers \n     (A) the allocation and information provisions of the IEP and \n     (B) emergency response measures adopted by the IEA Governing \n     Board for the coordinated drawdown of stocks of petroleum \n     products held or controlled by governments and complementary \n     actions taken by governments during an existing or impending \n     international oil supply disruption, whether or not \n     international allocation of petroleum products is required by \n     the IEP.\n       Subparagraph 4(H) would amend subsection 252(l) of the EPCA \n     to make clear that the antitrust defense does not extend to \n     international allocation of petroleum unless the IEA's \n     Emergency Sharing System has been activated.\n       Paragraph (5) would amend section 256(h) of EPCA to \n     authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1998 for the \n     activities of the interagency working group and interagency \n     working subgroups established by section 256 of EPCA to \n     promote exports of renewable energy and energy efficiency \n     products and services.\n       Paragraph (6) would amend section 281 of EPCA by extending \n     the expiration date of title II from September 30, 1997, to \n     September 30, 1998.\n       Paragraph (7) would amend section 365(f)(1) to provide \n     authorization for appropriations in fiscal year 1998 for \n     State Energy Conservation Programs.\n       Paragraph (8) would amend section 397 to provide \n     authorization for appropriations in fiscal year 1998 for the \n     Energy Conservation Program for Schools and Hospitals.\n       Paragraph (9) would amend section 400BB to extend the \n     authorization for the appropriation for the Alternative Fuels \n     Truck Commercial Application Program to fiscal year 1998.\n\n\n      section 3. energy conservation and production act amendment\n\n       Section 3 would amend section 422 of the Energy \n     Conservation and Production Act to provide authorization for \n     appropriation for the weatherization program in fiscal year \n     1998.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER:\n  S. 418. A bill to close the Lorton Correctional Complex, to prohibit \nthe incarceration of individuals convicted of felonies under the laws \nof the District of Columbia in facilities of the District of Columbia \nDepartment of Corrections, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n              THE LORTON CORRECTIONAL COMPLEX CLOSURE ACT\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is a great pleasure today that I \nintroduce the Lorton Correctional Complex Closure Act. For, while a \nsmall penitentiary with 60 inmates might have been acceptable in rural \nFairfax County in 1916, when the prison was first established as a \nfarming work force, to have over 7,000 inmates in the middle of the \nheavily populated modern area of Fairfax today, this Senator finds \ntotally\n\n[[Page S2088]]\n\nunacceptable, legally, environmentally, and in terms of public safety.\n  The facts about Lorton clearly demonstrates that it should be \nremoved. I say that, Mr. President, having worked on it for some 18 \nyears that I have been here in the Senate. These facts clearly \ndemonstrate that it must be removed in a reasonable period of time, \nrecognizing that such removal requires careful planning, not only \ntaking into consideration the needs of the people in the communities of \nVirginia, but many other considerations, among them humanitarian needs.\n  The current facility is inadequate and unsafe. The facilities now \nlack any institutional control, certainly not that measure of control \nthat should be accorded an institution of this importance.\n  Also, on the question of rehabilitation, I do not think this facility \ntoday is serving to rehabilitative purpose, which is a very vital and \nimportant part of the ability to take people who have finished their \nsentences and equip them to return to society.\n  The antiquated management and physical structures mean the taxpayers \nin the District of Columbia get a very poor return on their investment, \nand a considerable part of the cost is directed to the citizens of the \nDistrict of Columbia. With its far too many escapes and disastrous \npollution record, this facility has continually degraded the quality of \nlife for those living in the immediate area. This is the combination of \nfacts that compels Congress, in my judgment, to end this unfairness to \nVirginia.\n  Now, part of the plan that the President of the United States is \nconsidering to revitalize the District includes Federal assumption of \nthe District's correctional facilities, including those at the Lorton \nPrison Complex in Northern Virginia. The present proposal anticipates \nmassive renovation of the existing prison and new construction, as well \nas a cost of nearly $1 billion to the Federal taxpayer.\n  Now, Mr. President, that is just not going to happen. I have \nconsistently advocated the closing of Lorton prison in its entirety \nthroughout my 18 years of Senate service. Several years ago, Mr. \nPresident, I participated with others on both sides of the aisle, and \nwith the House of Representatives, and we secured legislation and \nincluded initial appropriations to start the relocation of the Lorton \nfacility. The mayor at that time and other District of Columbia \nofficials refused even to make the first steps toward a site selection. \nWe were stonewalled even though Congress had spoken, even though \nCongress had anted up the necessary funds to conduct that site \nselection and to begin the relocation.\n  I know of one community in a nearby State that was more than anxious \nto participate in the construction of a major modern facility. District \nofficials looked the other way. I do not intend, and I say this \nrespectfully to the Senate and the President and his efforts, and I am \nnot known around here as one to make threats, but I do not intend to \nabandon my goal to relocate Lorton. I say that again. I do not intend \nto abandon my effort to relocate the Lorton facility.\n  I wish to be fair and constructive. Consequently, I wish to make it \nclear that I will be a constructive working partner on the President's \nproposals as they relate to other aspects of the District of Columbia, \nbecause I believe the Nation's Capital needs the help on a wide range \nof issues. It is my hope to vote in support of a broad relief plan, \nprovided, however, that the proposal contains a clear provision which \nis binding on D.C. officials, a provision that has a binding obligation \non the part of those in the executive branch, the Federal Bureau of \nPrisons and others, to work with the District, to work with other \njurisdictions on the relocation, if that is necessary. There could be a \nsite right in the District: I know of one site that lends itself more \nthan adequately to relocation. But unless those clear and binding \nprovisions are in there for a relocation within a stipulated and \nreasonable time--and that timetable should be laid out--then I will \nfight this. I will fight this.\n\n  I wish to advise my colleagues that absent such clear plans to remove \nthis facility, then I, the senior Senator from Virginia, would be \nforced to utilize to the fullest extent all rules of the U.S. Senate to \nblock any proposal relating to the District of Columbia. It is as \nsimple as that. I fervently hope I shall not do it, and I will work \nindustriously to include that provision.\n  I look forward, as I say, to working with my colleagues in the \nVirginia delegation to have Congress finally put Lorton on the road for \nremoval and relocation. I will work very closely with my good friend, \nthe distinguished Representative from Virginia, Congressman Tom Davis, \nchairman of the Subcommittee on the District of Columbia of the House \nCommittee on Government Reform and Oversight, who has shown incredible \nleadership on this issue. I cannot recall any Member of Congress on \neither side of the aisle who has worked more diligently and more \nconscientiously with very little return, if any, to him politically or \notherwise, but nevertheless has plowed ahead to show leadership on \nresolving the tough issues relating to the Nation's Capital. Tom Davis \nis to be saluted and commended. I know Senator Robb and Representatives \nFrank Wolf and Jim Moran from Virginia, as well, and the Governor and \nattorney general of Virginia, will do their best. The present Governor \nand attorney general, and hopefully their successors, will do their \nbest to make the removal of Lorton a reality in the near future.\n\n

Ex. Res. 62\n\n       Resolved, That the Senate hereby expresses its intention to \n     give its advice and consent to the ratification of the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention at the appropriate time after the \n     Senate has proceeded to the consideration of the Convention, \n     subject to the following declaration, which would be binding \n     upon the President:\n       (1) Chemical weapons destruction.--Prior to the deposit of \n     the United States instrument of ratification of the \n     Convention, the President shall certify to the Congress that \n     all of the following conditions are satisfied:\n       (A) Exploration of alternative technologies.--The President \n     has agreed to explore alternative technologies for the \n     destruction of the United States stockpile of chemical \n     weapons in order to ensure that the United States has the \n     safest, most effective and environmentally sound plans and \n     programs for meeting its obligations under the Convention for \n     the destruction of chemical weapons.\n       (B) Convention extends destruction deadline.--The \n     requirement in section 1412 of Public Law 99-145 (50 U.S.C. \n     1521) for completion of the destruction of the United States \n     stockpile of chemical weapons by December 31, 2004 will be \n     superseded upon the date the Convention enters into force \n     with respect to the United States by the deadline required by \n     the Convention of April 29, 2007.\n       (C) Authority to employ a different destruction \n     technology.--The requirement in Article III(1)(a)(v) of the \n     Convention for a declaration by each State party to the \n     Convention, not later than 30 days after the date the \n     Convention enters into force with respect to that party, on \n     general plans of the state party for destruction of its \n     chemical weapons does not preclude the United States from \n     deciding in the future to employ a technology for the \n     destruction of chemical weapons different than that declared \n     under that Article.\n       (D) Procedures for extension of deadline.--The President \n     will consult with Congress on whether to submit a request to \n     the Executive Council of the Organization for the Prohibition \n     of Chemical Weapons for an extension of the deadline for the \n     destruction of chemical weapons under the Convention, as \n     provided under part IV(A) of the Annex on Implementation and \n     Verification to the Convention, if, as a result of the \n     program of alternative technologies for the destruction of \n     chemical munitions carried out under section 8065 of the \n     Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1997 (as contained \n     in Public Law 104-208), the President determines that \n     alternatives to the incineration of chemical weapons are \n     available that are safer and more environmentally sound but \n     whose use would preclude the United States from meeting the \n     deadlines of the Convention.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise today to submit an executive \nresolution placing conditions on the Chemical Weapons Convention with \nrespect to this Nation's Chemical Demilitarization Program.\n  Muhammad Ali used to say that not only could he knock 'em out, but he \ncould pick the round. There is no doubt in my mind that when the \nfight's over, we will knock 'em out on the issue of alternative \ntechnologies. Unfortunately, we do not have the luxury of picking which \nround incineration goes down for good. That means every time we have an \nopportunity--or see an instance where the Army might try to bob and \nweave--we've got to be ready to get our punches in.\n  I believe the passage of the Chemical Weapons Convention could \npresent the Army with just such an opportunity to bob and weave on \nsearching for alternatives to incineration. Fortunately, the White \nHouse has agreed to placing additional conditions on the treaty which \nshould stop any of the Army's attempts to duck out on their \nresponsibility.\n  The head of the National Security Council, Sandy Berger, has sent me \na letter agreeing to my language placing conditions on the Chemical \nWeapons Convention. The letter not only makes it clear to the world and \nto the Army the President's commitment to exploring alternatives to \nincineration, it further clarifies the relationship between the \nChemical Weapons Convention and our Chemical Weapons Demilitarization \nProgram. I also have a copy of a letter from the President to Secretary \nof Defense William Cohen reiterating his strong support for finding \nalternatives to incineration that are safe and environmentally sound.\n  Why is this language so important?\n  First, back in 1989, as part of the Defense authorization bill, \nCongress set an arbitrary deadline of 2004 for the destruction of all \nchemical weapons. That date conflicts with the Chemical Weapons \nConvention which calls for destruction 10 years from the date the \ntreaty is signed, which would be 2007. While it should be clear to \neveryone involved that the treaty date supersedes the congressional \nmandate, we don't want to give the Army a reason to bob and weave.\n  Second, 30 days from signing the treaty, signatories are required to \nsubmit their plan for destruction. Because the Army is already \nincinerating chemical weapons in the United States and has already \ninvested billions in this method, this is the plan they will submit 30 \ndays after the treaty has been signed.\n  Under my language, this treaty requirement will not preclude the \nUnited States from going through with a different method than what is \noriginally submitted. Without my language, we have no protection \nagainst the Army holding up the official plan as a defense against \nlooking for alternatives.\n  Third, many in the Nation were very concerned the Army would see the \n10-year deadline as an excuse, claiming\n\n[[Page S2090]]\n\nthey simply wouldn't have the time to explore alternatives. In fact, \nthe treaty allows any country to request a 5-year waiver. Under my \nlanguage, the United States would automatically request that extension \nif an alternative method can be found.\n  The condition to the treaty states that if ``the President determines \nthat alternatives to incineration are available which are safer and \nmore environmentally sound, but whose use would preclude the United \nStates from meeting the Convention time lines, the President shall \nconsult with the Congress on whether to request to the Executive \nCouncil of the OPSW for an extension of the Convention's destruction \ndeadline.''\n  Finally, adding this condition to the treaty is crucial to the effort \nto find alternative methods because last year's appropriations language \nnot only has to be renewed every single year, but fails to address the \ntreaty's deadline. Year after year, we're going to be faced with \nfighting the funding aspect out on the House and Senate floor, with no \nguarantee of winning.\n  But with my language attached to the treaty, the search for \nalternative methods won't be left entirely up to a yearly floor battle. \nThat's because I will have effectively closed any loophole related to \ntreaty deadlines that might allow the Army to avoid searching for \nalternative technologies.\n  In closing, let me say that up until this point I have withheld \nsupport for the Chemical Weapons Convention. But because I have been \nable to negotiate these critical protections of the exploration of \nsafe, affordable, and environmentally sound alternatives to chemical \nweapons incineration. I will now put my support behind the treaty.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \nPresident to Secretary of Defense William Cohen, and a letter sent to \nme by the Acting Assistant to the President for National Security \nAffairs, Sandy Berger, be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 27, 1997.\n     Hon. William S. Cohen,\n     Secretary of Defense, Washington DC.\n       Dear Bill: Since the enactment of the FY 1997 Defense \n     Appropriations Act (P.L. 104-208) last fall, Under Secretary \n     Kaminski has acted quickly and diligently to begin \n     implementation of Section 8065, establishing a pilot program \n     to identify and demonstrate alternatives to the Army's \n     baseline incineration process for the demilitarization of \n     assembled chemical munitions. As I stated in a letter last \n     July to Senator Ford, who sponsored a similar provision on \n     the FY 1997 Defense Authorization Act, I am committed to \n     going the extra mile to explore whether there may be safer \n     and more environmentally sound alternatives to incineration.\n       I would, therefore, request that Defense give this pilot \n     program high priority in order to ensure that the United \n     States has the best plans and programs for meeting its \n     chemical weapons destruction requirements.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bill Clinton.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 27, 1997.\n     Hon. Wendell H. Ford,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Wendell: I am pleased that we have reached agreement \n     with you on the attached Condition to the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention CWC resolution of ratification, making clear the \n     President's commitment to exploring alternatives to \n     incineration for the destruction of the U.S. chemical weapons \n     stockpile and clarifying the relationship between the CWC and \n     our chemical weapons demilitarization program.\n       We look forward to entering this historic treaty into force \n     on April 29 with the U.S. as an original Party. As the \n     President said in his State of the Union address, ``Make no \n     mistake about it, it will make our troops safer from chemical \n     attack. It will help us to fight terrorism. We have no more \n     important obligations, especially in the wake of what we now \n     know about the Gulf War.''\n       Again, we appreciate your support on this crucial issue.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Samuel R.

Mr. President, the esteemed journalist David \nBroder profiled Mayor Joe Riley of Charleston, SC, in Sunday's \nWashington Post. Joe Riley has done more for Charleston and the State \nof South Carolina than anyone could have dreamed. He is truly one of \nthe brightest lights in the American political scene. I strongly \nencourage everyone to read Mr. Broder's article and I respectfully \nrequest that it be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                     The Right Way to Renew a City\n\n       Charleston, SC--``Sometimes, if you paint on a smaller \n     canvas, you can make a more beautiful picture.''\n       That's what Mayor Joseph Riley told me in his office here, \n     just hours after he had announced that he would not be the \n     Democratic candidate for governor of South Carolina next \n     year. He had lost the Democratic nomination for governor by a \n     hair in 1994 to a candidate who in turn was narrowly defeated \n     in the general election. Riley was the Democrat's leading \n     hope to challenge Republican Governor David Beasley in 1998, \n     but the ``painful decision,'' as he said in his formal \n     statement, was dictated by his family's reluctance to face \n     life in the fishbowl of a statewide campaign and, possibly, \n     the governor's office.\n       Riley, 54, has been mayor of Charleston since 1975, and \n     what has been achieved here under his leadership is \n     extraordinary. The city has endured much--Hurricane Hugo's $2 \n     billion devastation, the closing of the Navy base that was \n     its biggest employer. But Charleston has double the \n     population and six times the area it did when Riley became \n     mayor, it boasts the internationally renowned Spoleto music \n     festival, its downtown stores are thriving and it is one of \n     the nation's favorite tourist attractions.\n       But it is mainly the way that Charleston treats the social \n     problems that all old cities share that has made Riley's long \n     reign so remarkable.\n       When Britain's Prince Charles visited the city, he went \n     past the elegant homes on the harbor to the homeless shelter \n     run by Crisis Ministries, a nonprofit, interfaith group. It \n     is a spotlessly clean facility, which provides what former \n     HUD secretary Henry Cisneros urged all cities to offer, ``a \n     full spectrum'' of services to the men, women and children \n     who, as the staff is trained to say, are ``guests'' in the \n     building.\n       My guide, Debbie Waid, explained that the food is donated, \n     the cooking is done by community volunteers and the residents \n     keep it swept and scrubbed. But the mayor has arranged for \n     all the support services--from the policeman on duty every \n     night to the counselors who help the homeless get back on \n     their feet. The soup kitchen and the daily clinic serve \n     everyone in the city who needs help.\n       The other part of Cisneros's dream that has been realized \n     in Charleston is scatter-site public housing. In previously \n     run-down neighborhoods bordering the historic district with \n     its magnificent antebellum homes, the city housing authority \n     has been winning prestigious design awards of its own.\n       Don Cameron, who has been running the authority almost as \n     long as Riley has been mayor, showed me single lots, or two \n     or three adjoining lots, where town houses or duplexes or \n     small apartment buildings have been built so handsomely that \n     private developers have snapped up adjoining property and \n     whole blocks have been revived.\n       Driving with Cameron through the decrepit East Side, where \n     freed slaves congregated after the Civil War, you could see \n     where one freshly painted building, erected by the city or \n     one of the many nonprofits that have sprung up in response to \n     Riley's leadership, is being cloned up and down the street \n     with private capital, encouraged by federal low-income \n     housing tax credits.\n       These buildings don't resemble public housing. The porches, \n     the materials, the roof lines all have been chosen to look \n     like other Charleston homes. Riley's dictum is that ``there \n     is no reason for government ever to build something that is \n     not beautiful.'' Even his downtown parking garages have won \n     architectural awards.\n       Because the subsidized housing is handsome, the NIMBY \n     problem--Not in My Back Yard--has been minimized. Unlike the \n     old public housing projects, with weed-choked front lawns \n     littered with whiskey bottles, and beat-up cars at the curb, \n     the scatter-site homes are scrupulously maintained. The cars \n     are parked off-street, out of site. The fences are posted \n     against trespassing, and the police see to it that vagrants \n     do not loiter.\n       Riley has been at it for a long time and, with last week's \n     decision against running for governor, may be here a lot \n     longer. His work has had its rewards.\n       When I asked him how he had done in his last reelection \n     race in 1995, he said, ``I got 75 percent,'' then added with \n     a laugh, ``It would have been more, but we had a tornado \n     warning in midafternoon, and some of my people never got to \n     vote.'' But a more important commendation came recently at a \n     fancy reception at The Citadel commandant's home, where a \n     woman serving drinks whispered to the mayor, ``I'm moving \n     into public housing next week --and it is so beautiful.:\n       Next week, the 19th International Conference on Making \n     Cities Livable will be held here. They are coming to the \n     right place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/10/senate-section/article/S2091-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2091-S2092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCOMMEMORATING THE MASSACRE OF TIBETAN CIVILIANS BY THE CHINESE MILITARY \n                           ON MARCH 10, 1959\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate March \n10, 1959, a dark day in history for all of us. It was on this day that \nChinese troops viciously attacked and murdered 87,000 Tibetan civilians \nwho sought to protect their beloved Dalai Lama, a man whose love of \npeace is known to all of us. The pattern of intimidation and human \nrights abuses by the Chinese Government against the people of Tibet, \nunfortunately, continues today. It is quite frankly unsuitable for a \ncountry like China which seeks status as a responsible member of the \ncommunity of nations.\n\n[[Page S2092]]\n\n  The Chinese pattern of intimidation is especially seen in the case of \nNgawang Choephel, a former Fulbright scholar at Middlebury College and \nfriend of the United States. Last December, Chinese officials sentenced \nMr. Choephel to an 18-year prison term for supposed espionage \nactivities. This is an outrage.\n  In January I joined with other Members of the Senate in writing a \nletter to the new Secretary of State Madeleine Albright expressing our \nconcerns about Mr. Choephel's sentence. We requested that she raise Mr. \nChoephel's case in discussions with Chinese leaders on her trip to \nChina.\n  I also cosponsored a resolution which calls on the Chinese Government \nto release Mr. Choephel immediately and unconditionally. I am pleased \nto be a part of a bipartisan effort on this important issue.\n  Relations with other powerful countries are by their nature complex, \nbut we owe it to the people of Tibet and we owe it to ourselves as \nAmericans, to stress the importance of human rights as a cornerstone of \nall relations. All people have a right to religious freedom. The people \nof Tibet certainly have that right, and they have a right to live in \npeace. The people of Tibet also have a right to live their lives in a \ndignified manner free of oppression. It is the sacred duty of all of us \nto make sure that happens.\n  I applaud the efforts of those who are gathering today in New York \nfor Tibet National Uprising Day to show the world that vigilance does \nnot sleep and to express solidarity with the people of Tibet. As long \nas people such as those who are coming together today in New York take \na personal interest in the suffering of others, I have to believe that \nwe will reach our goals of democracy and religious freedom for the \nsuffering people of Tibet.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/10/senate-section/article/S2091-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO MUSIC EDUCATION IN NEVADA\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support \nfor one of the most important parts of the education of our Nation's \nchildren--music education. Nevada has a proud music tradition and one \nof the groups that help keep this tradition strong is the Nevada Music \nEducators Association [NMEA]. It is my pleasure to speak on behalf of \nthe NMEA, and to stress the importance of music to the education of our \nNation's youth.\n  A recent event has made me especially proud of my State and its \ncommitment to music education. The Hug High School band in Reno was \nselected to perform in President Clinton's second inaugural parade. \nBeing chosen for the parade is truly an honor and it spoke to the \nquality of Hug's band and Nevada's music programs. The only way the \nband could make the trip from Nevada to Washington, DC, however, was to \nraise a lot of money. Right in the wake of the terrible New Year's \nflood, which caused devastating damage throughout northern Nevada, the \ncitizens of Washoe County banded together and raised over $120,000 to \nsend these deserving students to our Nation's Capital. Thanks to the \nkindness, generosity, and support of their community, the Hug High \nSchool band was able to come to Washington and perform beautifully in \nthe inaugural parade.\n  Nevada is at the forefront of music education. We are leaders in the \ndevelopment of music standards and have active band, choir, and \norchestra programs throughout the State. Recently, the bands of Edward \nC. Reed High School and Green Valley High School had the opportunity to \nrepresent the United States in international music festivals.\n  Music and the arts are vital components of the education of our \nyouth; no school career is complete without them. Recent scientific \nresearch has shown that early childhood education in music helps \ndevelop a child's logical brain. Pediatric neurobiologists indicate \nthat the brain circuits for math reside near those for music. \nAccordingly, music lessons and listening to classical music may help a \nchild develop skills in logic and spatial reasoning and, thus, do \nbetter in math. In addition to the cultural and artistic enrichment \nthat music education provides, it also helps our children to learn and \ngrow in other areas. As we move into the future, our children need to \nbe given all the tools they will need to compete and succeed. Music \neducation is essential to this effort, and it must be supported.\n  I am very proud of Nevada's music programs and the bands, orchestras, \nand choirs that bring joy to all of our lives. It is my pleasure to \nspeak today in appreciation of the Nevada Music Educators Association \nand all the teachers, administrators, and citizens who support music \neducation in our schools.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/10/senate-section/article/S2092-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO FATHER ROBERT D. KENNEY\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, each of us--not just those of us \nhere in the Senate, but virtually every American--can remember someone; \na teacher, a coach, a principal, who made a singular contribution to \nour lives during our school days. Someone who helped to show us the way \nas we passed through adolescence and into adulthood. Someone who was a \nrole model, a mentor, a confidante, a friend.\n  For more than forty years, Father Robert Kenney has been such an \nindividual in the lives of hundreds, if not thousands, of young men who \nhave attended Salesianum School in Wilmington, Delaware. As a teacher \nof mathematics, he prepared them for college and careers; as Athletic \nDirector and baseball coach for 34 years, he molded the skills and the \ncharacters of young athletes, teaching lessons on the ball-field which \nwould remain with his players throughout their adult lives. As \nSalesianum's principal, and later president, he maintained and \nbroadened the school's fine reputation for building young men of \ncharacter, young men whose sense of integrity, honor, compassion, and \ncivic-mindedness were as great as their knowledge of mathematics, \nhistory, or literature. Today, Salesianum graduates can be found among \nthe leaders in business and industry, education and the law, public \nservice and community affairs can be found not only throughout \nDelaware, but across the Nation as well. A great many of them trace \ntheir leadership skills, in addition to their academic knowledge, to \nFather Kenney and the atmosphere he maintained at Salesianum School.\n  Father Kenney has been more than teacher and coach, more than \nprincipal and president, even more than mentor to scores of young men. \nHe is a major part of the beautiful and rich history of Salesianum and \nthe contributions that the school has made to our city, our State, and \nthe lives of so many of us. He is, quite simply, one of the heroes of \nour time in the State of Delaware.\n  The high school I attended, Archmere Academy, is one of Salesianum's \ngreat rivals on the athletic field. There were a number of spring \nafternoons when I looked across the baseball diamond and hoped \nfervently that this would be the game when we would finally beat Father \nKenney's well-coached and talented team. It never happened. Father \nKenney would always figure out a way to squeeze out a win against the \nArchers. Often, it wasn't close.\n  But as much of a rivalry as existed between the two schools, Father \nKenney was someone I respected immensely, for his character as a man \nand as an educator was legendary. During my years in public service, as \nI have witnessed on an even greater scale Father Kenney's contribution \nto our community, my admiration has only deepened.\n  This June, Father Kenney will be stepping down as Salesianum's \npresident, though he will remain involved in the life of the school and \nthe community. He calls Salesianum ``my life's work,'' and intends to \ncontinue to work with the school, its alumni association, and the \npeople of our community. He probably knows this, but even if his ties \nto school and community weren't so strong, we wouldn't let him cease to \nbe involved.\n  As Salesianum's baseball coach, Father Kenney and his teams compiled \na record of 411 wins against only 168 losses, for a winning percentage \nof .710. It is an impressive record, but I can tell you that his \nwinning percentage in developing young men of great character is even \nmore impressive.\n  On behalf of our fellow Delawareans, I wish Father Kenney the best \nfor his newest venture. Yet I promise you, Father Kenney, Delawareans \nare going to keep you busy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/10/senate-section/article/S2092-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S2093]]\n\n\n\n                    SAMUEL IRWIN ``SONNY'' GOLDBERG\n\nMr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my \nfellow Charlestonian and good friend, Samuel Irwin ``Sonny'' Goldberg. \nSonny was one of a kind, a true gentleman who was loved by all. As many \nothers have said, if there was ever an ambassador for Charleston's King \nStreet, it was Sonny. An esteemed businessman, he had friends in \nstations both high and low all over town. The origin of his name lay in \nhis father's penchant for singing Al Jolson's ``Sonny Boy.'' Sonny \ninherited his father's gift of song and everyone in the lowcountry is \nricher for it. Sonny sang all the old greats: ``Marialana.'' \n``Embraceable You,'' ``Honeysuckle Rose,'' ``I've Got You Under My \nSkin'' and a number of others. He was the King Street Singer.\n  Sonny's singing did not outshine his talent for business and \nfriendship. To know him was to love him. As his good friend, Douglas \nDonehue, said in his eulogy, ``Sonny had within him a spark of genius \nthat won the hearts of people from all walks of life.'' He loved to \nread; he was a student of the world and an avid observer of mankind. \nSonny was a man of his word, a man of his faith, strictly observing the \nSabbath every Saturday, and a man of family. His wife Shirley, and his \nchildren will greatly miss him.\n  Sonny Goldberg gave much to the Charleston community and was \nespecially integral in the revitalization of King Street, Charleston's \nmain shopping district. We will greatly miss him and his gentle \nreminder to, ``Drive carefully. We want you to get here.'' I \nrespectfully request that the following editorial be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n           [From the Charleston Post & Courier, Mar. 3, 1997]\n\n                        S.I. ``Sonny'' Goldberg\n\n     They call me the King Street Singer 'cause I sing whenever \n           I'm blue.\n     And if you should be feeling lonely I recommend it to you.\n     You may not be Mario Lanza or Fisher or Como or Bing.\n     But you'll feel so great in the morning\n     If you open your mouth and sing.\n\n       If there had ever been an election for mayor of King \n     Street, Samuel Irwin Goldberg would have surely won. Instead \n     Mr. Goldberg became the ``King Street Singer,'' one of the \n     city's most recognized personalities.\n       Born in Charleston in 1922, Mr. Goldberg began working in \n     his father's King Street furniture business early in life. In \n     the 1950s it was his decision to supplement the company's \n     newspaper advertising with radio and TV spots--a practice he \n     kept up after opening his own store in 1981.\n       In them, Mr. Goldberg--often with a ukulele in hand --would \n     sing a few bars of Jack Gale's ``Serenade of the King Street \n     Singer'' before stopping to insert a couple of lines about \n     the great values at Goldberg's.\n       It was because of these ads--both print and broadcast--that \n     Mr. Goldberg seemed to be known wherever he went. He usually \n     would seem surprised and ask, ``How do you know me?'' when \n     people would inevitably stop him on the street or in \n     restaurants and, more often to recite the later rap version \n     that aired: ``Go Sonny Go, Go Sonny Goldberg, Go Sonny Go, Go \n     Sonny Goldberg. . . .''\n       Although widely regarded for his humor, the private Mr. \n     Goldberg was much more than ``the singer.''\n       A deeply religious man, he was an Orthodox Jew who \n     considered his faith among the most important aspects of his \n     life. Even when South Carolina's Blue Laws prohibited many \n     retail stores from doing business on Sunday, Mr. Goldberg \n     opened his. He closed on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath. The \n     law was amended to legalize that practice with what was \n     called the Sabbatarian exemption. It since has been \n     extensively revised.\n       Regarding the Sabbath, he said in a 1994 newspaper article, \n     ``I look forward to it every week. We're supposed to restrict \n     ourselves from all that God did . . . from anything that \n     creates a fire, energy, anything like that. We don't cook on \n     Saturdays. I don't ride in the car on Saturdays. I go to the \n     Synagogue Friday night, Saturday morning and Saturday \n     evening. I think it's a relief that you can't put a value \n     on.''\n       Mr. Goldberg had that inherent knack for making those \n     around him feel good, and people from all walks of life \n     counted themselves among his many patrons and friends. In \n     1995, Sonny Goldberg closed the store that for so long was a \n     King Street institution. When he died Thursday at 74, \n     Charleston lost one of its favorite and most colorful \n     citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/10/senate-section/article/S2093-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                APPOINTMENT BY THE PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
