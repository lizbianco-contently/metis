Mr. President, it is good to see you again, looking in good \nform. I welcome back all our Members and staff. I hope everyone had a \npeaceful and restful August recess.\n  Now we will begin the final stretch of the legislative session of the \n105th Congress, as we work to complete action on appropriations bills \nand a number of other important pieces of legislation.\n  I think our goal should continue to be to keep our commitment to the \nbudget agreement of last year, stick to the caps we agreed to, preserve \nthe surplus, and see what we can do to return taxes to the people who \nhave worked and earned those taxes.\n  We have a number of other issues, obviously, that are very \nimportant--agriculture issues, education, bankruptcy reform. So we have \na lot of work to do--missile defense, the defense of our country. I am \nvery concerned, as I have said in writing to the President and my \ncommunications to the Pentagon. I am very worried that we are seeing a \ndeterioration of the morale and the readiness of our military. Of \ncourse, there are many foreign policy issues that we will need to \naddress--and all of this in only about 5 weeks or so.\n  As a part of that, of course, this week we will take up the foreign \noperations appropriations bill. We expect to be on that issue Tuesday \nand Wednesday. We would like to finish it up Wednesday night if at all \npossible. We will have to count on the Members to work with us in \ntrying to get identification of amendments that will be offered.\n  I hope Senators will reduce the number of amendments that they are \noffering on these appropriations bills. In July, it seemed as if every \nappropriations bill had 100 amendments. It was difficult, on both sides \nof the aisle, to work through all those amendments. I hope we will have \na limited number of amendments and can complete that work.\n  For today, we will be in a period of morning business until 1 p.m. \nFollowing that, we will turn to the consideration of any legislative or \nExecutive Calendar items that can be cleared for action.\n  As a reminder to Members, there will be no rollcall votes today, but \nthroughout the August recess I continued to hear from Senators, saying, \n``How about it, are we really going to work that first week in \nSeptember?'' The answer is absolutely yes. We are going to be working \nseriously Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. We will begin by \nhaving our first vote at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, on the adoption of the \nconference report to accompany the military construction appropriations \nbill. We expect Tuesday afternoon or Tuesday night, perhaps Wednesday \nmorning, to have a vote on the low level waste disposal issue. And we \nexpect votes on amendments with regard\n\n[[Page S9672]]\n\nto the foreign operations appropriations bill. We could have votes on \ncloture or clotures before the week is over, and we could, of course, \nhave votes if they are called for with regard to Executive Calendar \nitems.\n  I want to assure Senators, not only will we be having votes; I am \ngoing to make sure we have votes, probably more than normal, just to \nbring the point home clearly that Senator Daschle and I have kept our \nword to Senators this year. We told Senators in January this is when we \nwill be in, having votes, and this is when we will be out. So far we \nhave kept our word to the day on every one of those, both when we would \nbe in and when we would be out.\n  So this is going to be a busy week. I know it takes a little time to \nget up and running again after you have been gone for a few days or a \nfew weeks, but it is important that we make progress this week. Of \ncourse, next week we will not be in session on Monday because that is \nLabor Day.\n  I believe that is all I would have to say at this time, Mr. \nPresident. I look forward to meeting with leadership on both sides of \nthe aisle this afternoon or tomorrow, and I will be talking to Senators \nabout the need to be here and debate amendments and to have legislation \nprepared to be brought up for them. I do want to say that I expect to \nfile a cloture motion on missile defense sometime soon, and I do expect \nto file a cloture motion, probably on Friday, with regard to bankruptcy \nreform.\n  So those are two issues that will at least begin to be considered \nthis week, even though we may not be able to complete them until next \nweek.\n  I yield the floor. Mr. President, I observe the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/08/31/senate-section/article/S9671-5", "month": "08", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9672-S9673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         A TRIBUTE TO KENT HALL\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, my Senate family suffered a tragic loss \nFriday night. My Chief of Staff, Kent Hall, passed away suddenly and \nunexpectedly. I have lost a dear friend and a trusted adviser. North \nDakota has lost a strong and able advocate.\n  Kent Hall worked for me my entire tenure in the U.S. Senate. I can \nstill remember my job interview with him in 1987. It took place in my \nmakeshift office in the Hart Senate Office Building. I had a jelly \ndoughnut sitting on my desk, and Kent commented to me as we began the \ninterview that if I ate a doughnut every day I would gain 25 pounds in \na year.\n  Along with his terrific sense of humor and his assurance, Kent \nbrought with him a remarkable ability to analyze events. He was trained \nas an economist and he was always calm, even in the most difficult of \ncircumstances.\n  Kent Hall drafted the first speech that I ever gave in the U.S. \nSenate. It was entitled ``For North Dakota's Future and America's \nFuture.'' It was about the policies that would be necessary to \nstabilize the commodity-driven income of a State like North Dakota.\n  Although Kent began in my office as my chief agricultural aide, he \nwas later promoted to Legislative Director and then to Chief of Staff. \nThroughout his twelve years with me, he always gave a thorough and \ncomplete analysis to whatever problem was before us.\n  Kent was interested in issues and he was interested in improving \nconditions for people. That is what motivated him, that is what drove \nhim. He was especially interested in farm families because he had grown \nup on a farm in Iowa and he had relatives who were still on the farm, \nso he had a special understanding of their needs. He had special \nexpertise in agricultural economics.\n  I can remember very well Kent Hall working all night, during the \ndrought of 1988, to devise a disaster assistance formula that would be \nmost favorable to North Dakota. Kent was a perfectionist, and he was \nready to do whatever it took to get things right. He was so committed \nthat he was willing to stay up all night to make sure that what we were \ndoing would get the job done. That was Kent Hall.\n  I remember him staying weekends and holidays during the flood \ndisasters of last year. In fact, during that entire year I think he \ntook one day off. I remember him working this year as the agricultural \ncrisis spread across our State, working unceasingly to help our \nfarmers.\n  More than that, though, Kent had a special way about him. He brought \na calmness to an office. He brought a calmness to a situation. He had a \ntwinkle in his eye because, as he always liked to remind us, he was an \nIrishman. So today he would want us to think about the good things and \nto celebrate his life.\n  This morning we had a chance, with Reverend Ogilvie, to share with \nthe members of my staff and his widow the life that Kent Hall lived. He \nlived life fully, he loved life, and, most of all, he loved his family. \nHe leaves behind two young children. He leaves behind a wonderful wife.\n  Even his marriage was not uneventful. He married Michelle Reilly, who \nworks for Senator Harkin, in March of 1993. I don't think anybody will \nforget that day. It was the worst snowstorm in 20 years. It shut down \nthe entire city, but Kent Hall was undeterred. No snowstorm could stop \nKent, and that wedding went on. Many friends celebrated it.\n  Their wedding, in fact, occurred very close to St. Patrick's Day, \nwhich was almost like a holy day to Kent Hall. I still have staff who \nremember the St. Patrick's Day parties at his home. There was always \ngreen beer, and lots of it, and everyone was welcome.\n  The births of Kent and Reilly's two children, Caiti and Austin, were \nthe highlights of his life. He talked about them all the time. My staff \nand I always knew when they had said their first word, taken their \nfirst step, or even if they just kept Kent awake during the night.\n  Those of us who knew and loved Kent Hall will miss him terribly. Our \nthoughts and prayers are with his wife and children today and in the \ndays to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I join my colleague and friend, Senator \nConrad, in paying tribute to a friend of mine--for over 25 years now, a \nfellow public servant, a fellow Iowan. It was perhaps one of the \nsaddest phone calls I ever received in my life when I was notified \nSaturday morning that Kent Hall had died Friday night. He was a young \nman in the prime of his life. It just was a terrible shock.\n  There are no words to convey to his family and his many friends the \nshock and the disbelief and the sadness that I feel about this great \nloss.\n  Kent Hall, as I said, was a friend of mine for 25 years. Kent first \ncame to work on my first congressional campaign in 1972. Both of us had \nbeen in the military. He had served in Italy. We both felt it was \nvitally important that we bring the Vietnam war to a swift conclusion. \nToo many of our friends had lost their lives in Vietnam. We saw the \nfutility of it. So much of our campaign in 1972 was directed at the \nwar. That s why Kent was one of my principal campaign workers that \nyear.\n  He was a student at Iowa State University then. We did not win that \nelection, but I did fairly well. We stayed at it, and I ran again in \n1974. By then, Kent was in graduate school at Iowa State and then \nbecame a full-time campaign worker on my 1974 campaign, and we won that \nelection.\n  He was just a tremendously hard worker. He was very good at getting \npeople involved, especially a lot of the students at Iowa State. Kent \neven got some of the local high school students involved in the \ncampaign. He inspired them, he got them involved, and he really \nrepresented the best of what it means to be in politics. There was \nnever anything underhanded or dirty about Kent. He was just out there \nknocking on doors, getting the information out, and registering voters.\n\n[[Page S9673]]\n\n Kent was very, very good at that. He was one of my best campaign \nworkers.\n  After that election, Kent joined my staff in Ames, IA, where Iowa \nUniversity is located. He and I also shared the fact that we both came \nfrom very small towns. He came from Lamont, IA, in Buchanan County. I \nalways kidded him that he was from a big town. His town, I think, had \nabout 500 people and one stop light. My town of Cumming had about 150.\n  After I was elected in 1974, I remember talking with Kent about the \nfact that we were from small towns and no politician had ever visited \nour towns. A Congressman or a Senator was somebody who might go to Des \nMoines or Cedar Rapids but never came to small towns. We hit upon this \nidea of taking our office out to the small towns. I believe that Kent \nHall was the first person to do that in Iowa.\n  As a congressional representative, he would go out and have open \noffice hours in towns of 100 people, 150 people, 200 people. He would \ngo to the post office, or if there wasn't a post office, the American \nLegion club, maybe a church basement, and have office hours in all \nthese small towns around the district so that people who couldn't drive \nall the way to the district office would come and see him. It was a \ngreat outreach program. He initiated that, he started that in Iowa.\n  Kent also did my community development work, rural housing, rural \nwater programs. He initiated some good programs for people living in \nsmall towns and communities at that time. Again, it was because Kent \nfelt very strongly that Government--whatever else Government's \nfunctions are constitutionally--ought to be helping make life better \nfor people who live in rural areas and small towns who do not have the \naccess to the resources of those who may live in our bigger cities. He \nwas always greatly interested in extending Government out to people who \nlive in rural areas.\n  After his great work in Ames, Kent then came to Washington and \nreceived his doctorate degree in economics at George Washington \nUniversity. He was a great economic thinker. During the 1980s, Kent was \non the House Small Business Committee staff, and I had since come to \nthe Senate in 1985. During some of the tough debates--the 1985 farm \nbill debate, the 1990 farm bill, and in between we had a credit bill we \nhad to work on--I can always remember asking for Kent Hall's advice on \na farm bill and especially on farm economics and agricultural \neconomics. He really had an understanding of the economics of rural \nAmerica and agriculture and small businesses and small towns that I \nfound absolutely invaluable.\n  After that, then, of course, he joined the staff of Senator Conrad of \nNorth Dakota. I listened to Senator Conrad speak very eloquently about \nhis association with Kent Hall.\n  Several years ago, Kent began dating a woman in my office from \nAlgona, in northern Iowa, by the name of Michelle Reilly. They got \nmarried in 1993 and had two small kids--Austin, who is now about 2, and \nCaite, who is 4. So his death leaves two small kids.\n  I want it to be known that Kent Hall was a wonderful human being, a \npersonal friend, someone I admired and someone I regularly consulted on \na lot of different matters--mainly agriculture and agricultural \neconomics. Through it all, Kent remained a fine man.\n  A lot of times people live and then they are gone and you wonder what \nit all meant, especially when someone dies as young and as abruptly as \nKent.\n  I am reminded of what John Kennedy once said when he was President. \nHe was asked how he would like to be remembered after his passing on, \nwhenever that would be. He responded with something I have never \nforgotten. He said ``the highest''--I may not have the words correct, \nbut basically he said:\n  The highest honor that can be given to a person is just to be \nremembered as a good and decent human being.\n  If we use that as the highest tribute we can give to any person, that \nthey are remembered as a good and decent human being, then that tribute \ncertainly belongs to Kent Hall.\n  He meant a great deal to his country. He meant a great deal to all of \nhis friends, a great deal to Michelle, his wife, and to his two \nchildren. He meant a great deal to this Congress and this Senate. But \nabove all this--above it all --we will always remember Kent Hall as a \ngood and decent human being.\n  To Michelle, Caiti and Austin, to his parents Kenneth and Evelyn, to \nhis brothers and sister back in Iowa, to all his many friends, my wife \nand I and our family extend our deepest sympathies. And we will always \nremember Kent Hall for the kind and decent human being that he always \nwas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to join this tribute to Kent \nHall, following on the remarks offered by Senator Harkin from Iowa and \nmy colleague, Senator Conrad from North Dakota.\n  I knew Kent Hall, who was Senator Conrad's chief of staff, for 12 \nyears in the time that he had served North Dakota and served with \nSenator Conrad. I was shocked to learn Saturday morning that Kent had \ndied Friday evening in his sleep.\n  I know how difficult it is for his family right now. I know how \ndifficult it is for Senator Conrad and his staff, the extended family \nthat worked with Kent Hall and served with him in the Senate.\n  We lead busy, fast-paced and challenging lives here. Kent Hall was a \npart of that. We, from time to time, I suppose, forget to tell people \nwhat an integral role people like Kent Hall play to make this system of \nours work. Kent Hall was smart, was tough, and yet had a great sense of \nhumor. He was a quick study. He worked very hard. He always had a \ntwinkle in his eye. He was quite an extraordinary man.\n  He always, to me, had a certain dignity about him as well. When Kent \nwas around in a meeting or with a group of people, he was always the \none who had that certain sense of dignity. Yes, he had the sense of \nhumor, but he had a sense of dignity that was unusual as well.\n  The last time I talked to Kent, I guess it was a couple of weeks ago \nbefore the August recess, and what we talked about then was what he \ntalked about a lot--it was his children. We talked about our children. \nHe leaves behind two young children. And we talked about them.\n  I know how difficult this must be now for his widow and his children. \nKent Hall was a young man with a young family. He had an enormous \ncommitment to that family. He also had a commitment to our State and to \nour country. That commitment was a commitment that was manifested every \nday in every way in his public service to all of us.\n  So today I express my sorrow and my sympathy for the passing of Kent \nHall.\n  Emily Dickinson wrote a poem called ``Because I could not stop for \nDeath.'' I want to read two verses of it.\n\n       Because I could not stop for Death,\n       He kindly stopped for me;\n       The carriage held but just ourselves\n       And Immortality.\n\n       We slowly drove, he knew no haste,\n       And I had put away\n       My labor, and my leisure too,\n       For his civility.\n\n  It is very, very hard, for those of us who have seen too many at too \nyoung an age leave us, to understand any civility in a death like the \ndeath of Kent Hall. But I hope that his contributions, as a family man \nand as a public servant, will be known to his family and his children \nby these remarks and by other words that will be spoken in the coming \ndays.\n  His children, I believe, are age 4 and 2. And I hope they will \nsomeday understand that their daddy was a very special man. Their \nfather contributed to their family and their country in a very \nimportant way. And those of us who were privileged to call him a friend \nwill miss him dearly.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask that I may proceed as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/08/31/senate-section/article/S9672-1", "month": "08", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9674]]\n              A BIENNIAL BUDGET FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, all of us have been various places during \nthe recess. I have been back in Wyoming listening to people and to a \nnumber of things that people are concerned about. We are back now, \nbasically, to spend this month, I suppose, almost totally immersed in \nthe appropriations process, which we must do. I have been interested \nfor some time in making some changes in that process. It seems to me \nnow to be appropriate, perhaps, while we are into it, to talk about the \npossibility of changing a bit.\n  What are some of the things we are going to have confronting us now? \nFirst of all, we have talked about appropriations, in most years, for \nabout 40 percent of the time. About 40 percent of the time the Senate \nand House spends in session is spent on appropriations. During this \nlast period of time, we will be confronted with trying to move quickly \nto complete that work, which has to be completed, of course, for the \nGovernment to go on. And that is OK. But as part of that, we will see a \ngreat deal of nongermane amendments being put onto appropriations \nbills, which really have nothing to do with appropriations. They are \nput on there partly because the year is nearly over, and if they are \ngoing to happen, they have to happen now.\n  Often it is easier to move an appropriations bill with an amendment \nthan it is a freestanding bill. We will be confronted again, I suspect, \nby the administration threatening, where they don't agree with the \nCongress on the payments in certain areas and appropriations for \ncertain areas, that they will close down the Government and blame the \nCongress. We have to guard against that. It is not the intention of the \nCongress to close down the Government--nor was it several years ago. \nBut that is the pressure that is used. So what could we do to change \nthat?\n  It seems to me that we ought to consider going into a biennial budget \nprocess--a process in which every 2 years we would spend our time on \nthe budget. We would budget for a biennial time and have the remainder \nof the time to do the other business of the Congress. I am persuaded \nthat the Congress spends too much time on budget issues.\n  One of the really important things, after the budget is completed, is \nfor the Congress to ensure that those programs that have been funded \nand the money that has been spent is spent as efficiently as possible, \nspent in the way in which the appropriation was designed and for the \npurpose for which it was designed. That doesn't always happen. So \noversight, it seems to me, is certainly one of the more important \nthings Congress has to do. We have relatively little time to do that.\n  We don't always complete our work. Since 1997, we have had 60 \ncontinuing resolutions. That means that we didn't complete the \nappropriations and that we simply continued what had been done in the \npast. As I mentioned before, we have devoted roughly 40 percent of our \ntime to budget resolutions, reconciliation and appropriations. We have \ntoo many repetitive votes on the same issues. There are lots of things \nfor the Congress to do and lots of things that the Congress has a \nresponsibility to do. Many of them, I think, are neglected because we \nspend too much time each year on appropriations.\n  There is not enough time for vigorous oversight. We continue to let \ninefficient and inappropriate programs continue. One of the other \nthings that brings it to mind--and I am sure the Presiding Officer had \nthe same experience at home--is when you hear about all these programs \nbeing operated in quite a different fashion than was the concept of the \nlegislation, and that is part of our responsibility in Congress.\n  In the last Congress, I introduced a bill that creates a 2-year \nauthorization for appropriations and budget resolutions--partly, I \nsuppose, because of my experience in the Wyoming legislature in which \nwe operated with biennial sessions. Most States operate with biennial \nappropriations, as a matter of fact. One of the arguments against it, \nhowever, is that some of the States are going to annual appropriations. \nI will tell you why. They are going to annual appropriations to be \nconsistent with the Federal Government, and there is so much Federal \nfunding, it is difficult. If the Federal Government would do it, I \nthink you would find these States going back to it, and it would \neliminate some of the redundancy in budgeting and help to reduce the \nsize of Government, and I think it would help put a bridle on unchecked \nGovernment spending. It would encourage agencies and executive branch \nagencies to plan for longer in the future. And I think it is difficult \nfor an agency to have to plan one year at a time when they are doing \nlonger term projects. They can be useful for them as well. They could \nhelp Government do it with Federal grantees to do it.\n\n  The author of the bill, Senator Domenici, has introduced bipartisan \nlegislation with the bipartisan support of 35 of our colleagues. It \npassed the Budget Committee and the Governmental Affairs Committee, and \nis pending on the Senate calendar.\n  Bipartisan support has been expressed by Senator Lott, Senator \nDaschle, leaders of both sides of the Senate, and Vice President Gore \nand the OMB Director have all expressed support for biannual budgets. A \nlimited time has elapsed. I suspect it is unlikely that it will pass, \nwhich is part of what I am talking about. Now we are jammed in here for \n4 weeks. The leader spoke this morning about how difficult it will be \nto do all of the things that have to be done. As I recall, the budget \nis supposed to have been pretty well done by now. It is supposed to \nmove along on a schedule. We, of course, seldom, if ever, live by that \nschedule. So we are in our annual sprint to avoid a Government \nshutdown.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider some reform of legislation that \nwould change what we do. I think there is great merit in doing it. It \nis not a new idea. Certainly it is not a cure-all of all Federal \nGovernment ills. But it is a process that perhaps would be helpful.\n  Processes are hard to change in this institution. And I respect that. \nThere should be a reason to change things. I am a little discouraged \nwhen you talk about making things work a little better when the \nresponse often is, ``Well, we have always done it that way.'' That is \nnot a very good response.\n  I think we could save time. I think we could save money. I think we \ncould manage better. I think we could allow ourselves to do the things \nthat we need to do.\n  I suspect, frankly, that one of the reasons there is opposition is \nthat those people and the appropriators have a little more power to \nexert each year rather than every other year by being on this committee \nand helping to decide where money is spent. That is one of the realisms \nof it. On the other hand, there are a lot more people who are not on \nthe appropriations committee than there are on the committee. So that \nshould not keep us from doing it.\n  This, as I said, would not be a panacea but certainly would be a step \nin the right direction of what we seem to constantly talk about, and I \nhope constantly seek; that is, a more efficient operation, a more \neffective operation by spending less taxpayers' money. It seems to me \nthat this is one of the ways to do that.\n  I hope we consider it. If we don't get it done this time, we ought to \nbring it up early in the next session. We ought to bring it before both \nthe House and the Senate and streamline the way we appropriate the \nfunds for the programs in Congress.\n  Mr. President, I thank you. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/08/31/senate-section/article/S9674-1", "month": "08", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9674-S9676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        U.S. POLICY TOWARD IRAQ\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thought I might take just a moment to speak \nto the issue of the policy of the United States of America toward Iraq \nand Saddam Hussein.\n  In the month or so that the Senate has been out of session, there has \nbeen a significant series of developments which cause me considerable \nconcern about the direction of the administration's policy--or not \npolicies, as the\n\n[[Page S9675]]\n\ncase may be--and the requirements of the Senate to act in accordance.\n  The President will recall that about 7 years ago the entire country \nwas fixed on the problem of Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and \nstrongly supported the action of the President--at that time President \nBush--to first engage in what was called Desert Shield and then later \nDesert Storm; the militarily significant rollback of the Iraqi forces \nin about 100 hours. I visited Saudi Arabia as that buildup of American \nforces was occurring. It was unprecedented really since the time of the \nVietnam war. The success of the operation was one of the great \nsuccesses of U.S. military history.\n  I remember the parades all across America when our troops returned \nhome. We were very proud of what we had done. We had turned back a \ndifficult dictator who had engaged in unspeakable horrors against \npeople in Kuwait, against the environment, and really against the rule \nof international law.\n  We had disengaged from Iraq because the President had succeeded \nthrough the efforts of General Norman Schwarzkopf and the Secretary of \nDefense--at the time Richard Cheney--and Secretary of State Jim Baker \nto force Saddam Hussein into an agreement that would forever bar him \nfrom developing weapons of mass destruction, or the means to deliver \nthem. That was an agreement that Saddam Hussein willingly entered into, \nalthough one could say it wasn't too willingly because we had about \n500,000 troops in his country at the time. But the deal was we will \nstop now if you will sign this agreement; otherwise we will have to \ncontinue our military operation. Saddam Hussein wisely decided to sign \nan agreement with the United States. That agreement was to allow U.N. \ninspectors to ensure that Iraq was not developing weapons of mass \ndestruction, and that it would destroy the stocks that it had \ndeveloped.\n  We know that for the first few years world attention was focused on \nSaddam Hussein because of what he had done. The United Nations was \nfocused on supporting and enforcing those inspections, and the United \nStates on a couple of occasions either took or threatened to take \nmilitary action to force Saddam Hussein to comply with his part of the \nbargain. America was united in that position. Now, the Bush \nadministration policy at the time was called a policy of containment. \nThe effort was not to get Saddam Hussein out of power per se but, \nrather, to prevent him from doing any damage to neighbors. But a \nconcomitant to that policy was to ensure that he did not have the \ncapability of causing his neighbors problems by virtue of the U.N. \ninspections.\n\n  Slowly, over time, after the Clinton administration took office, that \npolicy evolved. Now, they continued to call it containment, but a \ncritical component of the policy was missing --the policy that denied \nSaddam Hussein the ability to conduct military operations against his \nneighbors--because over time the administration became less and less \nwilling to ensure that the inspection regime called for under the \nagreement was actually carried out. UNSCOM is the name by which we know \nthis, the acronym of the United Nations inspection regime. And the \nUNSCOM inspections eventually became very big news because Saddam \nHussein saw that from time to time he could thwart the inspectors, \nprevent them from doing their job, and cause the United States to have \nto build up military forces in the region. And about the time we would \nspend a lot of money and effort and time to get these military forces \nin place, then he would agree to strike some kind of a deal. And as \nsoon as we then brought the force level back down again, he would break \nthe deal, and we would have to do the same thing all over again. He was \njerking our chain.\n  This administration, however, failed to develop a strategy to deal \nwith that. Many of us in the Senate, through meetings with members of \nthe administration, through correspondence, and through public hearings \nand statements, have tried to get the administration to focus on a \nlong-term strategy that would have as its ultimate goal not containing \nSaddam Hussein but eliminating Saddam Hussein. No one believes that \nthis is easy. It is a long-term project, and it takes a real \ncommitment. This administration has not been willing to make that \ncommitment.\n  In February of last year, the administration again built up forces \nbecause again Saddam Hussein had refused to allow the inspectors to do \ntheir job under the agreement that he had made. Many of us in the \nSenate were concerned that if the administration simply lobbed a few \ncruise missiles into certain Iraqi facilities, it would be antithetical \nto our long-term goal. It would not do anything to ensure that the \ninspectors could do their job. It would probably kill a lot of innocent \npeople. It would turn world opinion against the United States. And we \nneed the support of our allies, support that we used to have when the \nBush administration worked to get that support. But most importantly, \nmilitary action would not be in furtherance of any particular strategic \npolicy. It would waste money, it would not achieve anything, and in the \nend we would still have an empty policy.\n  The administration continued to insist that our policy was one of \ncontainment. But containment is no policy if, in fact, you are at the \nsame time allowing your opponent--in this case, Iraq--to build up \nmilitary forces so that when they want to strike, they have the \ncapability of doing so. And because we don't have forces in the area \nsufficient to stop aggression, again, it would have to be a reaction on \nthe part of the free world in response to aggression by Saddam Hussein \nrather than preventive action to begin with.\n  And so as time went on, the Iraqis continued to snub their nose at \nthe United Nations inspectors, probably building up the capability to \nproduce weapons of mass destruction and also to develop the missiles, \nor produce the missiles to deliver those weapons.\n\n  The inspectors then have reported back to us. Richard Butler, who \nheads UNSCOM right now, and others have said that if we stop those \ninspections, it is only a matter of time before Iraq can develop the \ncapability of producing these missiles and either has now or could \nquickly develop the chemical and biological weapons that would be \nnecessary to threaten or cause harm to their neighbors. So the \ninspections are a key component of any strategy, including a strategy \nof containment. And it does no good to have a strategy of containment \nif you don't enforce the inspection regime called upon by the agreement \nwith Saddam Hussein 7 years ago.\n  Recently, Scott Ritter, a well known inspector on the UNSCOM team, \nhas resigned in protest, and the reason, Mr. President, is because he \nhas said that U.S. officials, including the Secretary of State, \nMadeleine Albright, have thwarted the inspections by specifically \nputting conditions on U.S. involvement with the inspectors and by \nconditioning the time, the place, and manner of inspections.\n  Now, this is all wrapped up in diplomatic speak. The administration \nhas flatly denied this is true. The administration, frankly, in this \nrespect is not telling the truth, Mr. President. If Scott Ritter is to \nbe believed, restrictions have been placed upon the American \ninvolvement in the inspections of these facilities. And it has been \ndone because the administration doesn't want to have to follow up on \nwhat the inspections will demonstrate; namely, that action needs to be \ntaken against Saddam Hussein.\n  Or, failing that, if Saddam Hussein says, ``I am not going to allow \nyou to inspect certain facilities,'' the administration will then be \nforced with the option of either doing nothing or of having to take \nsome kind of action. And since the administration is unwilling, \napparently, to take any kind of action, it therefore has to select the \noption of doing nothing. But it obviously cannot be perceived as doing \nnothing, so instead it sweeps the problem under the rug, says, ``We \ndon't see any problem with Saddam Hussein.'' And of course you don't \nsee any problem if you have your eyes closed, if you are not engaging \nin any inspections, or you are not allowing your inspectors to engage \nin the key inspections.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, the administration's duplicity in this regard \nis something that the Congress should not permit and the American \npeople need to be aware of. We ought to have the truth from the \nadministration. Have we changed our policy with respect to Iraq? Have \nwe decided not to enforce the agreement anymore? And\n\n[[Page S9676]]\n\nwhat are the implications of this policy?\n  Scott Ritter has laid forth his allegations. The administration has \nresponded simply with denials. And yet there are enough sources who \nconfirm Scott Ritter's allegations to cause me to believe that the \nadministration's denials are false, that in fact Secretary of State \nAlbright has, in one way or another, discouraged the American \ninspectors from inspecting key facilities that the inspectors believe \nneed to be inspected because of what would be revealed.\n  So, Mr. President, here is where we are now. After the agreement that \nSaddam Hussein entered into, in which he agreed to allow inspections to \nensure that he did not develop the capability to pose a threat to his \nneighbors, part of the containment policy--as a result of that \nagreement, the United States had enforced for a period of years the \ninspection regime through UNSCOM--we are now no longer doing that in \npractice. It is now a charade.\n  The reason it is a charade is because we don't want to face the \nconsequences of either, A, being denied the ability to engage in the \ninspections or, B, finding something we don't want to find, because in \neither event we would have to do something, and this administration is \nfrozen into inaction in dealing with Saddam Hussein. If they can lob a \nfew cruise missiles at a problem, as they did against the terrorist \nOsama bin Laden 10, 12 days ago, then they can say they have taken \naction.\n  But that is not enough in dealing with Saddam Hussein. He is more \nclever. He knows that we lack patience. He knows that if he defies us \nlong enough, eventually our allies will desert us because, A, we don't \nhave the capability anymore of keeping the coalition together and, B, \nthe American people will get tired of the issue and no longer be \nwilling to support the kind of military action or long-term action that \nwould be required to oust Saddam Hussein.\n  The result of this is that the United States has, in fact, changed \nits policy with respect to Iraq without telling either the Congress or \nthe American people. It apparently no longer intends to enforce the \nagreement that George Bush and his administration insisted Saddam \nHussein make.\n  The implications for peace in the world are significant, because when \nSaddam Hussein has been able to build up his weapons of mass \ndestruction to the level where he can cause significant damage, he will \neither do so or he will threaten to do so. At that point, his \ncapability will cause a lot of countries in the world, especially those \nclose neighbors who fear that kind of activity on his part, to back off \nof any opposition to him. His neighbors are relatively unprotected and, \nnot believing the United States is a reliable ally to protect them, \nthey will accede to his demands. Then, rather than having one or two \ncountries in the Middle East that we have to contend with, we will have \none or two belligerents and a lot of neutral parties who no longer \ncooperate with us in restricting his activities and his aggression and \nhis terrorism.\n  We need these countries in the fight against terrorism. I am very \nconcerned that by backing off of the enforcement of the agreement \nagainst Saddam Hussein we will have permitted terrorism to further its \ngoals in the Middle East and around the world, especially against \nAmericans; and will have advanced the day when Iraq decides to engage \nin yet another form of aggression.\n  I think it is a sad day when not only do we see U.S. foreign policy \nin tatters, in shambles, with respect to a country that we know poses a \nthreat to us, but an administration which is unwilling to come clean on \nits policy. I know these are harsh words, but the fact of the matter is \nthe administration has not leveled with the American people on this \nproblem. I believe that Scott Ritter is essentially correct in his \nassessment of the situation, especially the administration's decision \nto pull the plug on the inspections in any meaningful way. As a result, \nI think this matter deserves airing in the Senate, in the House, and \nbefore the American people. I expect, either as chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Terrorism or as a member of the \nIntelligence Committee, I will ask the administration to explain its \nposition. I think the Senate will probably have to take some action \nbefore we adjourn in October to ensure that this country has a strong \npolicy with respect to one of the rogue nations of the world.\n  In conclusion, when discussing this in my home State of Arizona this \nlast month, one of my friends said, ``Isn't it the obligation of the \nPresident to conduct the foreign policy and shouldn't the Congress \nleave that to the President?'' The answer is, as I said, as a general \nproposition, yes. But when an administration is frozen into inaction \nfor one reason or another, whether the President is being distracted by \nother matters or whether it is simply too hard a problem for the \nadministration to want to deal with, then the Senate, in its historic \nrole as a partner in the administration of foreign affairs, needs to \ninsert itself into the equation. To the extent we need to influence the \ndevelopment and execution of foreign policy in this area, the U.S. \nSenate will have to be involved.\n  I would rather the administration develop a policy and a strategy and \nexecute it with the cooperation of the Senate, but if the \nadministration is unwilling to do that, then the Senate will have to \nget involved. It is not a happy day to have to talk about this kind of \nthing in this way. We would much rather cooperate with the \nadministration. I hold myself out to be willing to do that at any time \nand any place. But the administration has to come clean with the \nAmerican people on what its strategy really is in dealing with Iraq. \nUntil that statement of strategy has been laid out in an honest way, \nthe Senate is going to have to involve itself in this issue.\n  I hope and pray we will be able to maintain peace in the Middle East \nand that we will be able to contain Saddam Hussein, but it is going to \nrequire commitment and will, not just of the American people, but of \nthe American Government. I am hoping in the next few weeks we can help \ndevelop the policy so, between the administration and the Congress and \nthe American people, we will jointly, together, unify and be able to \nconfront this threat to peace in the world.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I welcome back the distinguished \nPresiding Officer and our staff on the Senate floor and hope that you \nall had as enjoyable an August recess as I did.\n  I want to talk about three things this afternoon. The first is to \nexpress how saddened I am with the loss of a very key member of the \nstaff of Senator Kent Conrad and somebody whom I knew and respected \nquite well.\n  Secondly, I would like to talk about the agricultural situation in my \nState of South Dakota that I spent a good deal of time talking about as \nI was home.\n  And then obviously, thirdly, I would like to discuss the agenda at \nhand and what my expectations and hopes are for the remaining 6 weeks \nof this session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/08/31/senate-section/article/S9674-2", "month": "08", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9676-S9677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO KENT HALL\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, just before Congress left for the \nAugust recess, we suffered a staggering loss in our ``Capitol Hill \nfamily''--the deaths of Detective John Gibson and Officer J.J. \nChestnut.\n  Today, as we returned to our work here, we learned that we have \nsuffered another loss in our family.\n  This past Saturday morning, Kent Hall died in his sleep. Kent was \nchief of staff for my colleague and friend, Senator Kent Conrad of \nNorth Dakota.\n  Outside of Congress, his beloved family, and his many friends, it's \nlikely that few Americans ever heard Kent's name. But millions of \nAmericans benefited from his years of hard and conscientious work in \nthis body.\n  Kent Hall was a rare man--a Renaissance man. He held a doctorate in \neconomics and philosophy. He loved ideas. But he also loved the nitty-\ngritty of politics, and policy.\n  And he loved this institution, this Senate. He was honored to work \nhere. And we were honored to have him.\n\n[[Page S9677]]\n\n  He first came to the Hill to work for Tom Harkin. He joined Senator \nConrad's staff as agriculture advisor in 1987, the year Senator Conrad \ncame to the Senate. He later went on to serve as Senator Conrad's \nlegislative director and eventually as his chief of staff.\n  One of Kent's great passions was the federal budget. He believed \nAmerica's budget should be balanced not only economically, but morally \nas well.\n  So he fought for budgets that would enable working families to share \nin these good economic times, budgets that would extend the benefits of \nthis economy beyond Wall Street, to Main Street. He fought for budgets \nthat would allow working parents to take their children to a doctor \nwhen they're sick, budgets that would enable parents to find good, \naffordable day care, budgets that would allow parents to send their \nchildren to good schools--and after that, to send them on to college.\n  Kent had a special place in his heart for people who live close to \nthe land--farmers and ranchers and the people who grow up in the small \ntowns of rural America.\n  He grew up in one of those towns: a little farm town in Iowa--\npopulation about 600. And though he left that town long ago, he still \nkept it close to his heart.\n  Farmers and people in farm towns all over America have lost a good \nfriend, and an extraordinary advocate. We are grateful for Kent's \ndiligent work on: disaster relief and farm-crisis relief.\n  And we extend our deepest sympathy to Kent's wife, Michelle, who \nworks for Senator Harkin and to their two small children, 4-year-old \nCaitlin--``Caiti''--and 2-year-old Austin, both of whom he loved even \nmore than he loved this place.\n  We also offer our condolences to Kent's father, Ken, and his mother, \nEvelyn; his brothers, Mel and Michael; his sister Cheri; and his many \nnieces and nephews. Our thoughts and prayers are with them, and with \nall the members of the Conrad and Harkin staffs, who are feeling this \nloss more deeply than probably any member of the ``Capitol family.''\n  Like Detective Gibson and Officer Chestnut, Kent Hall died too young. \nHe was only 52 years old. But his legacy will live on--in his two \nlittle children and in the ideals he believed in so passionately, and \nfought for so hard, and helped transform into law.\n  We will miss him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/08/31/senate-section/article/S9676-1", "month": "08", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE NATIONAL AGRICULTURE CRISIS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, in July, less than a month and a half \nago, the Senate voted unanimously on a resolution to declare there is a \nnational crisis in agriculture, that we needed to take immediate action \nto address it.\n  Following the unanimous passage of that resolution, we passed several \namendments to the agricultural appropriations bill designed to address \nthe problem. We passed an amendment to require mandatory price \nreporting for livestock. We passed a second amendment offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from South Dakota, Senator Johnson, requiring the \nlabeling of imported meat. And we passed an amendment offered by the \ntwo hard-working Senators from North Dakota to require at least a $500 \nmillion indemnity program for victims of multiple-year disasters.\n  Unfortunately, we failed to pass my amendment to lift the cap on \nmarketing loans and extend their term by 6 months--which is probably \nthe single most effective way to address the problem of low prices and \nlost income among grain farmers.\n  Since we considered those amendments, the farm crisis has deepened \nvery seriously. Over the past 3 weeks, as I visited with farmers and \nranchers and rural businesspeople from all over South Dakota, they told \nme the same story. Many of them simply will not survive the coming \nmonths unless circumstances change. Unless we can bring about a better \nfarm economy, a more stable price in most of the commodities now being \ngrown, we will see an attrition in agriculture the likes of which we \nhave not seen in over a decade.\n  Nick Nemec, a young farmer from Holabird, SD, who testified at a \nhearing on July 29 on the agricultural crisis, said that when prices go \ndown, his family's everyday expenses go up proportionately. He said, \n``If the Consumer Price Index was up 40% in one year, there would be \nriots in the streets of cities all across America. Out in farm country, \nwe just have farm auctions.''\n  I heard that same sentiment over and over again when I was home these \npast few weeks. We have already seen too many auctions. Our farmers and \nranchers are very concerned, frankly, about their survival.\n  So the circumstances, Madam President, as I report to the Senate this \nafternoon, are, unfortunately, in worse shape and more precarious than \nthey were just a month and a half ago when these amendments were \noffered. We must find ways to address the current crisis in American \nagriculture.\n  So I put the Senate on notice this afternoon that we will again be \noffering our amendment to increase the loan rate, to establish some \nkind of a floor in agricultural grain prices, just as we have on \nminimum wage across this country now for generations. We need a minimum \nprice, because if we do not have that, all of those stories and all of \nthose concerns can only worsen. The farm auctions will become more \nfrequent.\n  So I hope we can find, in as bipartisan a fashion as is humanly \npossible this close to an election, legislation we can all agree upon \nthat will allow us to address the price more effectively, that will \nallow us to deal with the issues we began to confront in July.\n  We must pass and sign into law the mandatory price reporting \nlegislation that passed in the Senate. We must pass and sign into law \nthe labeling legislation that was passed in the Senate. We certainly \nmust pass this indemnity legislation and sign that into law as quickly \nas we can.\n  What is missing is what will help the grain farmers. And unless we \npass that minimum floor, that increase in the loan rate, there is \nnothing out there that can help the grain farmers to survive what is \nthe worst disaster they have experienced in now more than 15 years.\n  So, Madam President, as we begin to consider what the agenda ought to \nbe as we come back from a month in our States, I hope everyone \nunderstands and appreciates and empathizes with the circumstances \nconfronting America's farmers. I hope that empathy will lead to a \nconsensus about increasing the loan rate and providing the kinds of \nopportunities to farmers that they failed to achieve when we debated \nthis matter just over a month ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/08/31/senate-section/article/S9677-1", "month": "08", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9677-S9678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE REMAINING SENATE AGENDA\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, we have 6 weeks remaining in the \nCongress. Those 6 weeks will define our efforts as a Congress. And this \nis the last matter that I wish to raise before our colleagues this \nafternoon--the agenda for those remaining 6 weeks.\n  Time is short. Distractions are many. Needless to say, we must focus \non our priorities. Our success for the entire Congress will really \ndepend on what we achieve in the next 6 weeks. It will depend on \nwhether we are committed to accomplishing the people's business.\n  What is the people's business? I think everyone understands what it \nis. The people's business is the business that we have before us. \nAppropriations bills must be completed.\n  The Congress' first responsibility is to ensure stable Government \noperations. There must not be talk of a Government shutdown. I have \nheard some of our Republican leaders, especially on the other side, \nsuggest that the President may shut the Government down.\n  Today is the last day in August. The budget resolution was due in \nApril. So far, neither body has delivered a budget resolution. So I \ncall upon the Republican leadership in the House and in the Senate to \ndo what the law requires, to do what is so essential to restore \nconfidence, to do what really is required to set the framework for the \npriorities and the commitments that we must make in these next 6 weeks. \nI call on the Republican leadership to pass a budget resolution.\n  Not one single appropriations bill has gone to the President. \nRepublican poison pills appear throughout the appropriations bills. So \nif there is a danger of a shutdown, we all know where it originates. \nBut it is incumbent upon\n\n[[Page S9678]]\n\nall of us to keep the Government operating. It starts with the budget \nresolution. And it will be completed once we pass every one of those \nappropriations bills, which we must do.\n  After we complete that task, we must turn our attention to managed \ncare reform. The American people have said loudly and unequivocally \nthat they want a comprehensible, enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights. \nThey want to know that they can go to the nearest emergency room when \nthey suffer a true health emergency. They want to know that they can \nsee a specialist when they need one. They want to know that doctors--\nnot HMO bureaucrats--will decide which treatments are medically \nnecessary. They want to know that managed care organizations, like \neveryone else in the health care environment, can be held accountable \nfor decisions that result in serious harm or death to patients.\n  What they do not want--what they do not want--is legislation that \nfalls short on those or other key patient protections. They do not want \nlegislation that claims to give them rights without providing them the \nmechanism necessary to enforce those rights.\n  There are those who suggest there is not enough time to debate a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. I disagree. There are those who would, for \nwhatever reason, try to gag the Senate as we debate this important \nissue.\n  Let us eliminate the gag orders and the gag rules. Let us open up \nthis important piece of legislation to a good, healthy debate. \nDemocrats will be prepared to work 24 hours a day to assure that we can \nhave that opportunity. But it is important we set it high on our agenda \nand our priority list as we complete our work in the 105th \nCongress. Other than the appropriations bills, there is nothing more \nimportant on our national agenda right now than that. The Republican \nbill, as everybody knows, is inadequate in many respects. We need to \npass a bill that merits our support, that merits our signatures, that \nmerits a broad-based, bipartisan commitment to real reform in managed \ncare. We will have an opportunity to do that. And I must say that we \nwill be offering this legislation with whatever determination may be \nrequired, and to whatever piece of legislation may be presented, in an \neffort to assure consideration of this legislation prior to the end of \nthis Congress.\n\n  The third issue, beyond the budget and appropriations first, and \nmanaged care second, is campaign finance reform. In spite of the \nRepublican leadership's opposition, the House has now passed an \nimportant campaign finance reform bill that many thought was impossible \nto pass just a few months ago. And so the Senate now has the \nopportunity--a rare opportunity--to enact meaningful reform this fall.\n  Madam President, we must seize the opportunity to stem the \nunrestricted flow of special interest money in Federal elections. There \nis no question that, given what the House has already done, attention \nwill be focused on the U.S. Senate to see if we can live up to the \nexpectations of the American people in this regard. I, frankly, cannot \nthink of anything more important than to take up this legislation--the \nShays-Meehan bill--and give it the kind of priority it deserves, to \nwork in a bipartisan way to pass meaningful legislation within the next \n6 weeks.\n  Again, I will put my colleagues on notice that this issue is of such \nimport to us that we will offer it in amendment form, if necessary. I \nhope that isn't necessary. I hope we can get a good opportunity and \nagreement to bring it up, to debate it, because it is now here. It has \nalready been debated and passed in the House. Let's do it in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  As I have often said, we can pass legislation the easy way or the \nhard way. I hope we will not be required to pass it the hard way. But \nDemocrats will make every single effort that we have available to us to \npass it--hard or easy. There are many other issues that we hope we can \naddress in the short time that we have left.\n  We must not ignore education. We must recognize that school \nmodernization is essential. As I traveled through South Dakota, it was \nremarkable the number of times modernization needs came to my \nattention, the number of times school board members, school board \npresidents, teachers, superintendents and principals said, ``We hope \nyou can pass legislation that will allow us to deal with our crumbling \ninfrastructure.'' As we speak, young children are going back into \nunsafe school buildings, into environments that are not conducive to \nlearning. School modernization must be addressed. I hope we can address \nit this year, this Congress. I hope we can address in this Congress \nthis year the need for 100,000 additional teachers. So as children go \nback to school, as we consider all of the needs of our Nation, let us \nnot forget the importance of the needs in education.\n  We must look at Social Security. We must begin to consider very \ncarefully what options are available to us. We must stop any action, \nwhether it is on a tax bill--which I understand will be brought to the \nSenate floor--or elsewhere, which might jeopardize Social Security. \nThere are those who, for short-term gain--either political or \neconomic--would argue that we have to tap the so-called surplus. We \nhave made the case--and I think everybody understands it--that there is \nno surplus unless you use Social Security trust funds. I hope that both \nsides of the aisle will come to the same conclusion about the \ninadvisability of doing that this year--or any year.\n  We must look at juvenile crime. We certainly will have an opportunity \nto debate the minimum wage. The minimum wage is, without a doubt, one \nof the single most important actions we can take to improve the \neconomic stability and viability of working families in many homes \nacross our country. Madam President, those issues, too, must be \nexamined and action taken before the end of this session.\n  As we come back after being away 1 month, we also recognize our \ninternational obligations. Just this afternoon, the President left for \na very important summit with the President of Russia. We wish him well \nas he departs. We know how precarious circumstances now are in economic \nand political terms in Russia. We know how difficult this trip will be. \nI hope I speak for everybody in this Chamber in expressing our hope for \ngreat success, with the realization that all we can have are limited \nexpectations, given those circumstances. We must not overlook the need \nfor IMF funding, especially in light of the Russian crisis. We should \nredouble our efforts to fulfill our obligations to the International \nMonetary Fund. Terrorism, again, became a very important aspect of \nforeign policy in the last several weeks while we were gone. We must \nsupport efforts to stem it and support military efforts to respond to \nit.\n  Arms control issues in Iraq and North Korea must be addressed, and so \nthe array of foreign policy challenges, not the least of which is an \nimportant question relating to funding in the United Nations, also must \nbe high on our international priority list.\n  Madam President, obviously, to accomplish all of these important \nobjectives, we will need to use these 6 weeks wisely, to stay focused \non our Nation's needs and priorities. I hope that we can do that. \nEarlier today, the majority leader suggested that Democrats want to \nstall legislative business. Nothing could be farther from the truth. To \nthe contrary, we are anxious, as we have been for months, to get on \nwith the Nation's agenda, the agenda that I have outlined.\n  So speaking on behalf of my Democratic colleagues in the Senate, I \nwelcome back both Republican and Democratic colleagues, and I urge them \nto work together to accomplish all of this and more. Time is short, the \nneed is great, and our desire to achieve is high. I hope we can meet \nall of those expectations in the coming weeks.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/08/31/senate-section/article/S9677-2", "month": "08", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9678-S9680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE NATIONAL SALVAGE MOTOR VEHICLE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, today I would like to share a few details \nabout S. 852, the National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection \nAct. As you\n\n[[Page S9679]]\n\nare well aware, Senator Ford and I co-authored and introduced S. 852 to \nprotect the hundreds of thousands of American consumers who fall prey \nto unscrupulous auto rebuilders who conceal damage information from \nprospective car buyers. Equally important are the millions of us who \nshare the roads with previously totaled automobiles and trucks sold as \nundamaged vehicles. This type of fraud is a national travesty that puts \nAmerica's motorists and passengers in great peril. It can and must be \nstopped by this Congress.\n  S. 852 is the right vehicle for Congressional action. It is a \nbalanced consumer protection bill that has received significant support \nin the United States Senate. In fact, 54 of our colleagues from both \nsides of the aisle are cosponsors of S. 852. They recognize that the \nonly individuals who stand to lose from this legislation are the chop \nshop owners and other charlatans who victimize our nation's drivers by \nselling them what is tantamount to ``garbage on wheels.''\n  The time has come to eliminate the practice of vehicle title \nlaundering, a scam that costs American consumers and the auto industry \nmore than $4 billion each year. And, there are plenty of horror stories \nwhere individuals have been injured or killed in a wreck involving a \nstructurally unsafe vehicle that was sold to the unsuspecting victims \nas undamaged. Every year more than one-half of the 2.5 million totaled \nvehicles are rebuilt and placed back on our nation's roads and \nhighways. As a result of titling loopholes, crooks and con artists are \nable to sell many of these vehicles without disclosing the vehicles' \ndamage histories. In some states, as many as seventy percent of all \ntotaled vehicles are sold to unsuspecting buyers with ``clean titles.'' \nClearly, the status quo is not working. There are 2.5 million reasons \nwhy S. 852 is needed now.\n  While most states do require some type of disclosure on a vehicle's \ntitle to indicate its history, the fact remains that titling \nrequirements vary from state to state. The existing hodgepodge of state \nlaws allows unscrupulous rebuilders to profit from inconsistent state \ntitling procedures. Even when a vehicle has been totaled, swindlers are \nable to ``wash'' the titles so they bear no indication of the vehicle's \nstructural damage. This is achieved by simply retitling a severely \ndamaged vehicle in another state so the car or truck's damage history \nwill not appear on the vehicle's new title. S. 852 would help eliminate \nthis type of fraud by requiring accurate information about a vehicle's \ndamage history to be branded on a title, and subsequent titles, for the \nlife of the vehicle.\n  Let me say it clearly. S. 852 is an anti-fraud, anti-criminal, pro-\nconsumer piece of legislation. I would also like to point out that \nwhile S. 852 establishes a much needed uniform standard to protect \nAmerica's motorists, it does not create a federal mandate. Instead, the \nbill establishes a uniform baseline. States are free, as they should \nbe, to adopt more stringent disclosure requirements or to choose not to \nparticipate at all. Even so, I believe the minimum disclosure \nrequirements contained in S. 852 will go a long way toward protecting \nused car buyers, automobile dealers, insurance companies and policy \nholders, consumer advocacy groups, salvage dealers, and everyone who \ntravels on our nation's roads.\n  This legislation applies to seven model years of vehicles. Those \nvehicles with a pre-accident value of more than $7,500, regardless of \ntheir age, would also be subjected to the bill's branding requirements. \nI am also pleased to report that Senator Gorton and I recently reached \nan agreement with state attorneys general, after extensive discussion \nand negotiation, which authorizes states to cover any vehicle, \nregardless of age. Consequently, concerns raised about certain vehicles \nbeing excluded have been adequately addressed.\n  The bill contains a number of provisions designed to better inform \nconsumers of a vehicle's damage history. Cars and trucks classified as \n``totaled'' by insurance companies would be identified as ``salvage'' \nby state motor vehicle departments. Since totaled cars and trucks are \nthe primary source of vehicles that rebuilders use in their operations, \nS. 852 provides assurance that virtually all of these vehicles titles \nwill be ``branded'' with this important information. Participating \nstates are also required to ``carry forward'' any brands carried on the \ntitle from other states. This approach will dramatically limit the \nability of deceitful rebuilders to ``wash'' titles and defraud \nconsumers. Vehicles not covered by S. 852 are those that are repaired \nunder the bill's seventy-five percent damage threshold that are \nreturned to their owners. And, of course, if a state desires, it may \nprovide disclosure for buyers of these vehicles or for vehicles with \nthat have sustained damage of less than seventy-five percent of its \npre-accident damage. Thus a state like Minnesota, which requires \ndisclosure when a vehicle has sustained damage to the extent of seventy \npercent of its pre-accident value, is free to adopt the uniform \ndefinitions and procedures in S. 852 and still maintain its seventy \npercent disclosure requirement. Again, this bill is about ensuring \ndisclosure to consumers. It is not about limiting state actions.\n  S. 852 also ensures that if a salvage vehicle is rebuilt, it will \nundergo a theft inspection, as well as any state required safety \ninspection. A branded ``rebuilt salvage vehicle'' title must be \nobtained before the vehicle can be driven on the road and state \ninspector must affix a permanent sticker on the vehicle's door jamb, as \nwell as a window sticker, specifying that it has been rebuilt, and \nwhether it passed a safety inspection.\n  Since state law, not federal law, traditionally provides for causes \nof action and consumer remedies, S. 852 specifically provides that the \nbill would in no way affect actions or remedies available under state \nlaw. It has never been asserted that consumer remedies in any state are \ninadequate to protect their citizens. Instead, as a supplement to state \nlaw remedies, a provision was recently added to the bill that allows \nstate attorneys general to sue on behalf of citizens who are victimized \nby rebuilt salvage fraud and to recover monetary judgments for damages \nthey may have suffered.\n  It is important to reiterate that S. 852 will not force states to \nweaken or otherwise cut back on their disclosure standards. Instead, \nthe adoption of a minimum threshold will significantly enhance consumer \nprotections and lead to safer roads and highways everywhere. Under S. \n852, state legislatures are given the freedom to decide whether they \nwant to change their laws in any way or maintain their current program. \nIf a state decides to adopt the bill's uniform definitions and \nprocedures, but also wants to disclose additional information about a \nvehicle's damage history to its residents, S. 852 gives the state ample \nflexibility to do so.\n  Congress started down this road six years ago with the passage of the \nAnti-Car Theft Act of 1992. The Act directed the Secretary of \nTransportation to establish a task force to study problems associated \nwith motor vehicle titling, and more importantly, the specific problems \nthat have contributed to this serious and costly titling fraud. The \nstatute required ``an examination of the extent to which the absence of \nuniformity and integration of state laws regulating vehicle titling and \nregistration and salvage of used vehicles allows enterprising criminals \nto find the weakest link to `wash' the stolen character of the \nvehicles.''\n  This was an important charge entrusted to a very qualified group of \nindividuals with significant knowledge and experience in motor vehicle \ntitling procedures. The task force included representatives from a wide \nrange of backgrounds including federal transportation officials; \nfederal, state, and local law enforcement officials; state motor \nvehicle officials; motor vehicle manufacturers, dealers, and recyclers; \nsalvage yard operators and scrap processors; insurers; and others.\n  After approximately eight months of deliberation, the task force \nconcluded that the lack of uniformity in state laws is the primary \nreason that unscrupulous rebuilders are able to ``wash'' vehicle titles \nwith relative ease. What's more, the task force recommended a seventy-\nfive percent damage threshold before a vehicle would be branded as \n``salvage.'' By including the seventy-five percent threshold in our \nlatest draft of the bill, Senator Ford and I simply followed the task \nforce's recommendations, which were based on careful and thorough \nconsideration of this issue for all affected parties.\n\n[[Page S9680]]\n\n  While the vast majority of people in the auto salvage business are \nhonest, hard-working individuals, a group of dishonest rebuilders are \ncontinuing to tarnish the salvage vehicle industry. It is this latter \ngroup that Congress must put out of business. Far too many people are \nfalling victim to the scam of passing off rebuilt totaled vehicles as \nundamaged. The loopholes that allow this deceptive practice to continue \nmust be closed now. Only cheats and crooks that prey on the innocent \nwill benefit from any lack of action during this Congress.\n  While not a perfect solution, S. 852 is a significant step in the \nright direction. It represents a fair balance between the need to \nestablish uniform procedures for disclosing information to consumers \nabout a vehicle's damage history and the need to preserve states' right \nto determine what is in the best interest of their citizens.\n  S. 852 will stem the tide of motor vehicle titling fraud, protect \nconsumers and automobile dealers, and reduce the number of injuries and \nfatalities on America's roads and highways. I urge my colleagues to \ngive S. 852 their full support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/08/31/senate-section/article/S9678-1", "month": "08", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting one treaty \nand sundry nominations which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/08/31/senate-section/article/S9680-1", "month": "08", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 7, 1997, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on August 4, 1998, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the House has passed the following bills and joint \nresolution, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1759.

A bill to amend the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands \nManagement Act of 1996 to extend the legislative authority for the \nBlack Patriots Foundation to establish a commemorative work; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n               BLACK REVOLUTIONARY WAR PATRIOTS MEMORIAL\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that seeks \nto extend the legislative authority for the construction of the Black \nRevolutionary War Patriots Memorial and for the Foundation raising \nfunds to construct the memorial.\n  Mr. President, in 1986, the Congress enacted and President Reagan \nsigned into law, legislation establishing a Black Revolutionary War \nPatriots Memorial, a memorial to honor the more than 5,000 African-\nAmericans who fought for this country during the Revolutionary War. In \norder to appropriately recognize the bravery and sacrifice of these \nhonorable and distinguished patriots, Public Law 99-558 sought to \nestablish a suitable memorial, a monument which will be located on the \nMall here in Washington, DC. When complete, the memorial will be the \nfirst monument on the Mall to be dedicated solely to the \naccomplishments of African-Americans.\n  The centerpiece of P.L. 99-558 was the establishment of the Black \nRevolutionary War Patriots Foundation, as a not-for-profit organization \nwhose sole charter is to raise the necessary funding for the costs \nassociated with constructing the memorial.\n  When enacted, the foundation was authorized to operate for a period \nof 10 years. In 1996, I introduced legislation which provided an \nadditional 2-year extension of the legislative authority for the \nestablishment of the memorial. While the foundation has raised a \nsubstantial amount of funding, it remains short of its $9.5 million \ngoal. The bill I introduce today would allow for a second and final \nextension which will provide the foundation with valuable time to \ncomplete its fundraising.\n  Mr. President, this memorial serves a noble purpose, honoring the \nservice and patriotism of individuals long deserving of this praise and \nI strongly support the ongoing efforts for its establishment. Likewise, \nI am proud that the sculptor who has been commissioned to design this \nmemorial, Ed Dwight, is not only from my home state of Colorado, but is \nalso the first African-American astronaut trainee. Mr. Dwight is an \naccomplished artist residing in Denver and his work is known across the \nworld. I would very much like to see his design for the Black \nRevolutionary War Patriots Memorial become one of the memorials \nsituated among many of this country's most distinguished monuments.\n  Mr. President, I believe Congress has demonstrated its commitment to \nthe establishment of the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial by \nauthorizing its construction 10 years ago. It is my hope this \nlegislation will receive the full, expeditious support of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2427\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. BLACK REVOLUTIONARY WAR PATRIOTS MEMORIAL.\n\n       Section 506 of the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands \n     Management Act of 1996 (40 U.S.C. 1003 note; 110 Stat. 4155) \n     is amended by striking ``1998'' and inserting ``2000''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (by request):\n  S. 2428. A bill to provide for the restructuring of the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n  THE IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE RESTRUCTURING ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege on behalf of the \nadministration to introduce the Immigration and Nationalization Service \nRestructuring Act of 1998, and I urge the Senate to support it. The \npurpose of the act is to strengthen the enforcement of the Nation's \nimmigration laws at the borders and in other parts of the country, and \nalso to strengthen the many immigration and citizenship services that \nthe INS provides.\n  The Nation has a long and distinguished history of welcoming \nimmigrants and refugees who come to this country legally. But because \nthe United States is widely viewed around the world as a land of \nextraordinary economic opportunities, these opportunities are often a \nmagnet for illegal immigration. The Immigration and Naturalization \nService has two equally important missions. It provides services and \nbenefits to immigrants and refugees eligible for assistance under our \nlaws, and it enforces the laws that prevent illegal immigration.\n  In recent years, the effectiveness of the INS in carrying out these \ntwo complex and often competing missions has been increasingly \ncriticized. Many critics say that the agency is suffering from \n``mission overload'' and proposals have been made to dismantle the \nagency and assign its responsibilities to other parts of the Federal \nGovernment.\n\n[[Page S9690]]\n\n  One such proposal was made by the Commission on Immigration Reform, \nwhich conducted a comprehensive study of the functions and capabilities \nof the INS. The Commission's report contains some well-reasoned \nfindings and excellent recommendations. However, the Commission's \nproposal for structural reform is highly controversies because it seeks \nto reassign core INS responsibilities to other federal agencies, the \nservices and benefits function would be assigned to the Department of \nState, and the enforcement function would be assigned to the Department \nof Justice.\n  Under Commissioner Doris Meissner's impressive leadership, the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service has made significant progress in \nidentifying its problems, developing strategies to correct them, and \nimplementing successful reforms. A prime example is the significant \nachievements of the INS in expediting the asylum process. Today, asylum \napplications are processed in weeks, not months, and legitimate \nrefugees fleeing persecution are granted prompt asylum.\n  Nonetheless, Commissioner Meissner is the first to admit that the \nagency faces continuing serious challenges that impede the agency's \nability to carry out its basic responsibilities. The most significant \nproblems are insufficient accountability between field offices and \nheadquarters, the lack of consistency in its actions, the need for \ngreater professionalism overlapping internal responsibilities, and \nweaknesses in regional and local management.\n  The administration has concluded, and I agree, that the most \neffective way to address these problems is by modifying the agency, not \ndismantling it. After considerable study and analysis, the \nadministration has developed worthwhile reforms to address the \nproblems.\n  The Immigration and Nationalization Service Restructuring Act of 1998 \nwill untangle the overlapping and often confusing organizational \nstructure of the INS and replace it with two clear chains of command--\none for enforcement and the other for the provision of services. These \ntwo equally important divisions will report, through their respective \ndirectors, to the INS Commissioner. The proposed act will maintain the \nintegrity of the agency, and preserve its vast knowledge, skills and \nabilities, and use them in a more effective and efficient framework.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this approach and approve this needed \nand important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2428\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service Restructuring Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are to:\n       (1) Advance the effective enforcement of our immigration \n     laws at our borders and in the interior, and the efficient \n     provision of immigration and citizenship services.\n       (2) Untangle the overlapping and frequently confusing \n     organizational structure of INS' by replacing it with two \n     clear operational chains of command--one for enforcement and \n     one for providing services--from the highest level of the \n     agency to the lowest.\n       (3) Create two parallel operational divisions which can \n     each focus on its unique management, knowledge, skills and \n     abilities, while also retaining the essential functions for \n     guiding and coordinating these operations.\n       (4) Improve customer-oriented immigrant services by--\n       (A) creating new local service offices;\n       (B) establishing new, distinct lines of accountability of \n     authority for services;\n       (C) setting clear standards for customer service; and\n       (D) using technology to improve efficiency and customer \n     service.\n       (5) Strengthen enforcement operations by--\n       (A) establishing a single, coordinated enforcement mission;\n       (B) integrating enforcement, and strengthening \n     accountability;\n       (C) organizing enforcement areas by function, including \n     Border Patrol, inspections, investigations and removals, \n     detention and enforcement support; and\n       (D) developing overtime pay parity with other Federal law \n     enforcement agencies.\n       (6) Provide for efficient integration of service and \n     enforcement by--\n       (A) creating an administrative and technical backbone of \n     support for enforcement and service; and\n       (B) developing and managing essential immigration records, \n     computer systems, training, and shared administrative \n     functions.\n\n     SEC. 3.

This day is not only significant due to this \ncelebration but also because it will mark the completion of a $2 \nmillion addition and renovation project.\n  The history of the East Lansing Public Library is very interesting. \nIt has grown from just a few shelves of books in a room provided by the \nPeople's Church and a fund of $26 set up by the women of the Child \nConservation League in 1923, to a 25,000 square foot building that \nserves over 125,000 visitors a year. All of the people who have helped \nthis institution grow and prosper over the years should be commended \nfor their efforts and dedication.\n  I extend my best wishes and congratulations to the East Lansing \nPublic Library on this momentous occasion. The East Lansing community \nis fortunate to have such a wonderful library. I wish them all of the \nbest in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/08/31/senate-section/article/S9693-2", "month": "08", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             EFFECTS OF THE FARM CRISIS ON OUR COMMUNITIES\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I want to make some remarks on \nthe subject of the farm crisis that exists in North Dakota and other \nparts of the country. North Dakota is faced with a combination of \ncollapsed grain prices and crop disease. This has produced a farm \ncrisis that is very, very serious and to which this Congress must \nrespond.\n  In my home State of North Dakota, net farm income has dropped 98 \npercent in 1 year. That's right; a 98-percent drop in net farm income \nin 1 year. Ask yourself what would be the result for you, your \nneighbor, or your community, if you experienced a 98-percent drop in \nnet income?\n  Many third and fourth generation farmers have been unable to get an \noperating loan this season due to low grain prices. They have had so \nmany auction sales on North Dakota farms that they have had to call \nretired auctioneers back from retirement to handle the auction sales. \nEvery one of these auction sales represents a family farmer who has \nworked hard, and invested everything they have, to run a family farm. \nAnd then they discover they can't make it.\n  I'd like to share it with you a poem written by Luella F. Hermanson \nof Hampden, North Dakota. She describes what the farm crisis has done \nto her community and what it will do to ours unless we take decisive \naction.\n\n                     When the Farmers All Shut Down\n\n           (By Luella F. Hermanson of Hampden, North Dakota)\n\n     They're selling out my neighbor\n     It's his auction sale today\n     Life's hard out in the country\n     We can't farm the good old way\n\n     Remember neighbor helping neighbor\n     It's not like that anymore\n     We're hanging on by just our boot straps\n     Wondering what we have in store\n\n     What will our city cousins do\n     When the farm boys move to town\n     Will there be jobs for all of them\n     When our farms are all shut down\n\n     Who'll buy that big machinery\n     Standing idle on the lots\n     And the gas and parts and fuel oil\n     They might have to close their shops\n\n     Who'll buy the fertilizer\n     and the spray to kill the weeds\n     They'll probably close the diner\n     There'll be no one left to feed\n\n     There'll be no grain to borrow on\n     So the bank will close its door\n     The insurance boys will duck and run\n     When we can't pay them anymore\n\n     Who'll buy the tractors, plows and trucks\n     Or plant the barley, beans and wheat\n     Who'll pick the rocks and mow the roads\n     And smile in dark defeat\n\n     Who'll spend forty bucks an hour\n     To fix a combine in the fall\n     And his last red cent to save his land\n     When his back's against the wall\n\n     Yes they're selling out my neighbor\n     Heard he's moving into town\n     What will happen to this land we love\n     When farmers all shut down.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/08/31/senate-section/article/S9693-3", "month": "08", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "31", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9693-S9695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I hereby submit to the Senate \nthe budget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget \nOffice under Section 308(b) and in aid of Section 311 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the \nrequirements for Senate scorekeeping of Section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, \nthe First Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget\n\n[[Page S9694]]\n\nthrough July 28, 1998. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and \nrevenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 1998 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget (H. Con. \nRes. 84), show that current level spending is below the budget \nresolution by $16.2 billion in budget authority and above the budget \nresolution by $1.9 billion in outlays. Current level is $1.0 billion \nbelow the revenue floor in 1998 and $3.0 billion above the revenue \nfloor over the five years 1998-2002. The current estimate of the \ndeficit for purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is \n$176.4 billion, $2.9 billion above the maximum deficit amount for 1998 \nof $173.5 billion.\n  Since my last report, dated October 29, 1997, the Congress has \ncleared, and the President has signed the following authorization acts: \nNational Defense (P.L. 105-85), Adoption and Safe Families (P.L. 105-\n89), Savings Are Vital to Everyone's Retirement (P.L. 105-92), \nVeterans' Benefits (P.L. 105-114), Food and Drug Modernization (P.L. \n105-115), 50 States Commemorative Coin Program (P.L. 105-124), Hispanic \nCultural Center (P.L. 105-127), Surface Transportation Extension (P.L. \n105-130), Small Business Reauthorization (P.L. 105-135), Acquisition of \nReal Property for Library of Congress (P.L. 105-144), an act amending \nSec. 13031 of COBRA of 1985 (P.L. 105-150), Transportation Equity Act \nfor the 21st Century (P.L. 105-178), Care for Police Survivors Act of \n1998, (P.L. 105-180), Agriculture Export Relief Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-\n194), and Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform (P.L. 105-\n206). The President also signed the following 1998 appropriation bills: \nAgriculture (P.L. 105-86), Commerce, Justice, State (P.L. 105-119), \nDistrict of Columbia (P.L. 105-100), Foreign Operations (P.L. 105-118), \nInterior (P.L. 105-83), Labor, HHS, and Education (P.L. 105-78), and \n1998 Emergency Supplementals and Rescissions (P.L. 105-174). In \naddition, Congress has cleared for the President's signature the \nHomeowners Protection Act (S. 318). These actions changed the current \nlevel of budget authority, outlays and revenues.\n  In addition, the budget authority and outlay totals established in H. \nCon. Res. 84 have been revised to reflect adjustments made by the \nBudget Committee for continuing disability reviews, arrearages for \ninternational organizations, Federal land acquisitions, the \nInternational Monetary Fund (new arrangements to borrow), and the \nrenewal of expiring contracts under section 8 housing assistance. Since \nmy last letter, these changes have increased budget authority and \noutlays $12,489 million and $50 million, respectively.\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 30, 1998.\n     Hon.

Res. 84 have been revised to reflect \n     adjustments made by the Budget Committee for continuing \n     disability reviews, arrearages for international \n     organizations, Federal land acquisitions, the International \n     Monetary Fund (new arrangements to borrow), and the renewal \n     of expiring contracts under section 8 housing assistance. \n     Since my last letter, these changes have increased budget \n     authority and outlays $12,489 million and $50 million, \n     respectively.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E.

(a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) child experts estimate that as many as 250,000 children \n     under the age of 18 are currently serving in armed forces or \n     armed groups in more than 30 countries around the world;\n       (2) contemporary armed conflict has caused the deaths of \n     2,000,000 minors in the last decade alone, and has left an \n     estimated 6,000,000 children seriously injured or permanently \n     disabled;\n       (3) children are uniquely vulnerable to military \n     recruitment because of their emotional and physical \n     immaturity, are easily manipulated, and can be drawn into \n     violence that they are too young to resist or understand;\n       (4) children are most likely to become child soldiers if \n     they are poor, separated from their families, displaced from \n     their homes, living in a combat zone, or have limited access \n     to education;\n       (5) orphans and refugees are particularly vulnerable to \n     recruitment;\n       (6) one of the most egregious examples of the use of child \n     soldiers is the abduction of some 10,000 children, some as \n     young as 8 years of age, by the Lord's Resistance Army (in \n     this section referred to as the ``LRA'') in northern Uganda;\n       (7) the Department of State's Country Reports on Human \n     Rights Practices for 1997 reports that in Uganda the LRA \n     kills, maims, and rapes large numbers of civilians, and \n     forces abducted children into ``virtual slavery as guards, \n     concubines, and soldiers'';\n       (8) children abducted by the LRA are forced to raid and \n     loot villages, fight in the front line of battle against the \n     Ugandan army and the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), \n     serve as sexual slaves to rebel commanders, and participate \n     in the killing of other children who try to escape;\n       (9) former LRA child captives report witnessing Sudanese \n     government soldiers delivering food supplies, vehicles, \n     ammunition, and arms to LRA base camps in government-\n     controlled southern Sudan;\n       (10) children who manage to escape from LRA captivity have \n     little access to trauma care and rehabilitation programs, and \n     many find their families displaced, unlocatable, dead, or \n     fearful of having their children return home;\n       (11) Graca Machel, the former United Nations expert on the \n     impact of armed conflict on children, identified the \n     immediate demobilization of all child soldiers as an urgent \n     priority, and recommended the establishment through an \n     optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the \n     Child of 18 as the minimum age for recruitment and \n     participation in armed forces; and\n       (12) the International Committee of the Red Cross, the \n     United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations \n     High Commission on Refugees, and the United Nations High \n     Commissioner on Human Rights, as well as many nongovernmental \n     organizations, also support the establishment of 18 as the \n     minimum age for military recruitment and participation in \n     armed conflict.\n       (b) In General.--The Senate hereby--\n       (1) deplores the global use of child soldiers and supports \n     their immediate demobilization;\n       (2) condemns the abduction of Ugandan children by the LRA;\n       (3) calls on the Government of Sudan to use its influence \n     with the LRA to secure the release of abducted children and \n     to halt further abductions; and\n       (4) encourages the United States delegation not to block \n     the drafting of an optional protocol to the Convention on the \n     Rights of the Child that would establish 18 as the minimum \n     age for participation in armed conflict.\n       (c) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the President and the Secretary of State should--\n       (1) support efforts to end the abduction of children by the \n     LRA, secure their release, and facilitate their \n     rehabilitation and reintegration into society;\n       (2) not block efforts to establish 18 as the minimum age \n     for participation in conflict through an optional protocol to \n     the Convention on the Rights of the Child; and\n       (3) provide greater support to United Nations agencies and \n     nongovernmental organizations working for the rehabilitation \n     and reintegration of former child soldiers into society.\n       Sec. 8145. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall obligate the funds provided for \n     Counterterror Technical Support in the Department of Defense \n     Appropriations Act, 1998 (under title IV of Public Law 105-\n     56) for the projects and in the amounts provided for in House \n     Report 105-265 of the House of Representatives, One Hundred \n     Fifth Congress, First Session: Provided, That the funds \n     available for the Pulsed Fast Neutron Analysis Project should \n     be executed through cooperation with the Office of National \n     Drug Control Policy.\n       Sec. 8146. Of the funds provided under title IV of this Act \n     under the heading ``Research, Development, Test and \n     Evaluation, Navy'', up to $1,000,000 may be made available \n     only for the development and testing of alternate turbine \n     engines for missiles.\n       Sec. 8147. Voting Rights of Military Personnel. (a) \n     Guarantee of Residency.--Article VII of the Soldiers' and \n     Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 (50 U.S.C. 590 et seq.) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``Sec. 704. (a) For purposes of voting for an office of the \n     United States or of a State, a person who is absent from a \n     State in compliance with military or naval orders shall not, \n     solely by reason of that absence--\n       ``(1) be deemed to have lost a residence or domicile in \n     that State;\n       ``(2) be deemed to have acquired a residence or domicile in \n     any other State; or\n       ``(3) be deemed to have become resident in or a resident of \n     any other State.\n       ``(b) in this section, the term `State' includes a \n     territory or possession of the United States, a political \n     subdivision of a State, territory, or possession, and the \n     District of Columbia.''.\n       (b) State Responsibility to Guarantee Military Voting \n     Rights.--(1) Registration and balloting.--Section 102 of the \n     Uniformed and Overseas Absentee Voting Act (42 U.S.C. 1973ff-\n     1) is amended--\n       (A) by inserting ``(a) Elections for Federal Offices.--'' \n     before ``Each State shall--''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b) Elections for State and Local Offices.--Each State \n     shall--\n       ``(1) permit absent uniformed services voters to use \n     absentee registration procedures and to vote\n\n[[Page S9710]]\n\n     by absentee ballot in general, special, primary, and run-off \n     elections for State and local offices; and\n       ``(2) accept and process, with respect to any election \n     described in paragraph (1), any otherwise valid voter \n     registration application from an absent uniformed services \n     voter if the application is received by the appropriate State \n     election official not less than 30 days before the \n     election.''.\n       (2) Conforming amendment.--The heading for title I of such \n     Act is amended by striking out ``FOR FEDERAL OFFICE''.\n       Sec. 8148.

(a) The Secretary of Defense shall study the \n     policies, procedures, and practices of the military \n     departments for protecting the confidentiality of \n     communications between--\n       (1) a dependent of a member of the Armed Forces who--\n       (A) is a victim of sexual harassment, sexual assault, or \n     intrafamily abuse; or\n       (B) has engaged in such misconduct; and\n       (2) a therapist, counselor, advocate, or other professional \n     from whom the victim seeks professional services in \n     connection with effects of such misconduct.\n       (b)(1) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe in \n     regulations the policies and procedures that the Secretary \n     considers necessary to provide the maximum possible \n     protections for the confidentiality of communications \n     described in subsection (a) relating to misconduct described \n     in that subsection.\n       (2) The regulations shall provide the following:\n       (A) Complete confidentiality of the records of the \n     communications of dependents of members of the Armed Forces.\n       (B) Characterization of the records under family advocacy \n     programs of the Department of Defense as primary medical \n     records for purposes of the protections from disclosure that \n     are associated with primary medical records.\n       (C) Facilitated transfer of records under family advocacy \n     programs in conjunction with changes of duty stations of \n     persons to whom the records relate in order to provide for \n     continuity in the furnishing of professional services.\n       (D) Adoption of standards of confidentiality and ethical \n     standards that are consistent with standards issued by \n     relevant professional associations.\n       (3) In prescribing the regulations, the Secretary shall \n     consider the following:\n       (A) Any risk that the goals of advocacy and counseling \n     programs for helping victims recover from adverse effects of \n     misconduct will not be attained if there is no assurance that \n     the records of the communications (including records of \n     counseling sessions) will be kept confidential.\n       (B) The extent, if any, to which a victim's safety and \n     privacy should be factors in determinations regarding--\n       (i) disclosure of the victim's identity to the public or \n     the chain of command of a member of the Armed Forces alleged \n     to have engaged in the misconduct toward the victim; or\n       (ii) any other action that facilitates such a disclosure \n     without the consent of the victim.\n       (C) The eligibility for care and treatment in medical \n     facilities of the uniformed services for any person having a \n     uniformed services identification card (including a card \n     indicating the status of a person as a dependent of a member \n     of the uniformed services) that is valid for that person.\n       (D) The appropriateness of requiring that so-called Privacy \n     Act statements be presented as a condition for proceeding \n     with the furnishing of treatment or other services by \n     professionals referred to in subsection (a).\n       (E) The appropriateness of adopting the same standards of \n     confidentiality and ethical standards that have been issued \n     by such professional associations as the American Psychiatric \n     Association and the National Association of Social Workers.\n       (4) The regulations may not prohibit the disclosure of \n     information to a Federal or State agency for a law \n     enforcement or other governmental purpose.\n       (c) The Secretary of Defense shall consult with the \n     Attorney General in carrying out this section.\n       (d) Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to \n     Congress a report on the actions taken under this section. \n     The report shall include a discussion of the results of the \n     study under subsection (a) and the comprehensive discussion \n     of the regulations prescribed under subsection (b).\n       Sec. 8158. (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) on the third of February a United States Marine Corps \n     jet aircraft, flying a low-level training mission out of \n     Aviano, Italy, flew below its prescribed altitude and severed \n     the cables supporting a gondola at the Italian ski resort \n     near Cavalese, resulting in the death of twenty civilians;\n       (2) the crew of the aircraft, facing criminal charges, is \n     entitled to a speedy trial and is being provided that and all \n     the other protections and advantages of the United States \n     system of justice;\n\n[[Page S9711]]\n\n       (3) the United States, to maintain its credibility and \n     honor amongst its allies and all nations of the world, should \n     make prompt reparations for an accident clearly caused by a \n     United States military aircraft;\n       (4) a high-level delegation, including the United States \n     Ambassador to Italy, recently visited Cavalese and, as a \n     result, $20,000,000 was promised to the people in Cavalese \n     for their property damage and business losses;\n       (5) without our prompt action, these families continue to \n     suffer financial agonies, our credibility in the European \n     community continues to suffer, and our own citizens remain \n     puzzled and angered by our lack of accountability;\n       (6) under the current arrangement we have with Italy in the \n     context of our Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), civil \n     claims arising from the accident at Cavalese must be brought \n     against the Government of Italy, in accordance with the laws \n     and regulations of Italy, as if the armed forces of Italy had \n     been responsible for the accident;\n       (7) under Italian law, every claimant for property damage, \n     personal injury or wrongful death must file initially an \n     administrative claim for damages with the Ministry of Defense \n     in Rome which is expected to take 12-18 months, and, if the \n     Ministry's offer in settlement is not acceptable, which it is \n     not likely to be, the claimant must thereafter resort to the \n     Italian court system, where civil cases for wrongful death \n     are reported to take up to ten years to resolve;\n       (8) while under the SOFA process, the United States--as the \n     ``sending state''--will be responsible for 75 percent of any \n     damages awarded, and the Government of Italy--as the \n     ``receiving state''--will be responsible for 25 percent, the \n     United States has agreed to pay all damages awarded in this \n     case.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the United States should resolve the claims of the \n     victims of the February 8, 1998 United States Marine Corps \n     aircraft incident in Cavalese, Italy as quickly and fairly as \n     possible.\n       Sec. 8159. Training and Other Programs. (a) Prohibition.--\n     None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to \n     support any training program involving a unit of the security \n     forces of a foreign country if the Secretary of Defense has \n     received credible information from the Department of State \n     that a member of such unit has committed a gross violation of \n     human rights, unless all necessary corrective steps have been \n     taken.\n       (b) Monitoring.--Not more than 90 days after enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of State, shall establish procedures to ensure that \n     prior to a decision to conduct any training program referred \n     to in subsection (a), full consideration is given to all \n     information available to the Department of State relating to \n     human rights violations by foreign security forces.\n       (c) Waiver.--The Secretary of Defense, after consultation \n     with the Secretary of State, may waive the prohibition in \n     subsection (a) if he determines that such waiver is required \n     by extraordinary circumstances.\n       (d) Report.--Not more than 15 days after the exercise of \n     any waiver under subsection (c), the Secretary of Defense \n     shall submit a report to the congressional defense committees \n     describing the extraordinary circumstances, the purpose and \n     duration of the training program, the United States forces \n     and the foreign security forces involved in the training \n     program, and the information relating to human rights \n     violations that necessitates the waiver.\n       Sec. 8160. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) Since 1989--\n       (A) the national defense budget has been cut in half as a \n     percentage of the gross domestic product;\n       (B) the national defense budget has been cut by over \n     $120,000,000,000 in real terms;\n       (C) the United States military force structure has been \n     reduced by more than 30 percent;\n       (D) the Department of Defense's operations and maintenance \n     accounts have been reduced by 40 percent;\n       (E) the Department of Defense's procurement funding has \n     declined by more than 50 percent;\n       (F) United States military operational commitments have \n     increased fourfold;\n       (G) the Army has reduced its ranks by over 630,000 soldiers \n     and civilians, closed over 700 installations at home and \n     overseas, and cut 10 divisions from its force structure;\n       (H) the Army has reduced its presence in Europe from \n     215,000 to 65,000 personnel;\n       (I) the Army has averaged 14 deployments ever four years, \n     increased significantly from the Cold War trend of one \n     deployment ever four years;\n       (J) the Air Force has downsized by nearly 40 percent, while \n     experiencing a fourfold increase in operational commitments.\n       (2) In 1992, 37 percent of the Navy's fleet was deployed at \n     any given time. Today that number is 57 percent; at its \n     present rate, it will climb to 62 percent by 2005.\n       (3) The Navy Surface Warfare Officer community will fall \n     short of its needs of a 40 percent increase in retention to \n     meet requirements.\n       (4) The Air Force is 18 percent short of its retention goal \n     for second-term airmen.\n       (5) The Air Force is more than 800 pilots short, and more \n     than 70 percent eligible for retention bonuses have turned \n     them down in favor of separation.\n       (6) The Army faces critical personnel shortages in combat \n     units, forcing unit commanders to borrow troops from other \n     units just to participate in training exercises.\n       (7) An Air Force F-16 squadron commander testified before \n     the House National Security Committee that his unit was \n     forced to borrow three aircraft and use cannibalized parts \n     from four other F-16's in order to deploy to Southwest Asia.\n       (8) In 1997, the Army averaged 31,000 soldiers deployed \n     away from their home station in support of military \n     operations in 70 countries with the average deployment \n     lasting 125 days.\n       (9) Critical shortfalls in meeting recruiting and retention \n     goals is seriously affecting the ability of the Army to train \n     and deploy. The Army reduced its recruiting goal for 1998 by \n     12,000 personnel.\n       (10) In fiscal year 1997, the Army fell short of its \n     recruiting goal for critical infantry soldiers by almost \n     5,000. As of February 15, 1998, Army-wide shortages existed \n     for 28 Army specialties. Many positions in squads and crews \n     are left unfilled or minimally filled because personnel are \n     diverted to work in key positions elsewhere.\n       (11) The Navy reports it will fall short of enlisted sailor \n     recruitment for 1998 by 10,000.\n       (12) One in ten Air Force front-line units are not combat \n     ready.\n       (13) Ten Air Force technical specialties, representing \n     thousands of airmen, deployed away from their home station \n     for longer than the Air Force standard 120-day mark in 1997.\n       (14) The Air Force fell short of its reenlistment rate for \n     mid-career enlisted personnel by an average of six percent, \n     with key war fighting career fields experiencing even larger \n     drops in reenlistments.\n       (15) In 1997, United States Marines in the operating forces \n     have deployed on more than 200 exercises, rotational \n     deployments, or actual contingencies.\n       (16) United States Marine Corps maintenance forces are only \n     able to maintain 92 percent ground equipment and 77 percent \n     aviation equipment readiness rates due to excessive \n     deployments of troops and equipment.\n       (17) The National Security Strategy of the United States \n     assumes the ability of the United States Armed Forces to \n     prevail in two major regional conflicts nearly \n     simultaneously.\n       (18) To execute the National Security of the United States, \n     the United States Army's five later-deploying divisions, \n     which constitute almost half of the Army's active combat \n     forces, are critical to the success of specific war plans.\n       (19) According to commanders in these divisions, the \n     practice of under staffing squads and crews that are \n     responsible for training, and assigning personnel to other \n     units as fillers for exercises and operations, has become \n     common and is degrading unit capability and readiness.\n       (20) In the aggregate, the Army's later-deploying divisions \n     were assigned 93 percent of their authorized personnel at the \n     beginning of fiscal year 1998. In one specific case, the 1st \n     Armored Division was staffed at 94 percent in the aggregate; \n     however, its combat support and service support specialties \n     were filled at below 85 percent, and captains and majors were \n     filled at 73 percent.\n       (21) At the 10th Infantry Division, only 138 of 162 \n     infantry squads were fully or minimally filled, and 36 of the \n     filled squads were unqualified. At the 1st Brigade of the 1st \n     Infantry Division, only 56 percent of the authorized infantry \n     soldiers for its Bradley Fighting Vehicles were assigned, and \n     in the 2nd Brigade, 21 of 48 infantry squads had no personnel \n     assigned.\n       (22) At the 3rd Brigade of the 1st Armored Division, only \n     16 of 116 M1A1 tanks had full crews and were qualified, and \n     in one of the Brigade's two armor battalions, 14 of 58 tanks \n     had no crewmembers assigned because the personnel were \n     deployed to Bosnia.\n       (23) At the beginning of fiscal year 1998, the five later-\n     deploying divisions critical to the execution of the United \n     States National Security Strategy were short nearly 1,900 of \n     the total 25,357 Non-Commissioned Officers authorized, and as \n     of February 15, 1998, this shortage had grown to almost \n     2,200.\n       (24) Rotation of units to Bosnia is having a direct and \n     negative impact on the ability of later-deploying divisions \n     to maintain the training and readiness levels needed to \n     execute their mission in a major regional conflict. \n     Indications of this include:\n       (A) The reassignment by the Commander of the 3rd Brigade \n     Combat Team of 63 soldiers within the brigade to serve in \n     infantry squads of a deploying unit of 800 troops, stripping \n     nondeploying infantry and armor units of maintenance \n     personnel, and reassigning Non-Commissioned Officers and \n     support personnel to the task force from throughout the \n     brigade.\n       (B) Cancellation of gunnery exercises for at least two \n     armor battalions in later-deploying divisions, causing 43 of \n     116 tank crews to lose their qualifications on the weapon \n     system.\n       (C) Hiring of outside contract personnel by 1st Armored and \n     1st Infantry later-deploying divisions to perform routine \n     maintenance.\n       (25) National Guard budget shortfalls compromise the \n     Guard's readiness levels, capabilities, force structure, and \n     end strength, putting the Guard's personnel, schools, \n     training, full-time support, retention and recruitment, and \n     morale at risk.\n       (26) The President's budget requests for the National Guard \n     have been insufficient, notwithstanding the frequent calls on \n     the Guard to handle wide-ranging tasks, including deployments \n     in Bosnia, Iraq, Haiti, and Somalia.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the readiness of United States military forces to \n     execute the National Security Strategy of the United States \n     is being eroded from a combination of declining defense \n     budgets and expanded missions;\n       (2) the ongoing, open-ended commitment of United States \n     forces to the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia is causing \n     assigned and supporting units to compromise their principle \n     wartime assignments;\n       (3) defense appropriations are not keeping pace with the \n     expanding needs of the Armed Forces.\n       (c) Report Requirement.--Not later than June 1, 1999, the \n     President shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of \n     the Senate and\n\n[[Page S9712]]\n\n     the Committee on National Security of the House of \n     Representatives, and to the Committees on Appropriations in \n     both Houses, a report on the military readiness of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States. The President shall include in \n     the report a detailed discussion of the competition for \n     resources service-by-service caused by the ongoing commitment \n     to the peacekeeping operation in Bosnia, including in those \n     units that are supporting but not directly deployed to \n     Bosnia. The President shall specifically include in the \n     report the following--\n       (1) an assessment of current force structure and its \n     sufficiency to execute the National Security Strategy of the \n     United States;\n       (2) an outline of the service-by-service force structure \n     expected to be committed to a major regional contingency as \n     envisioned in the National Security Strategy of the United \n     States;\n       (3) a comparison of the force structures outlined in \n     paragraph (2) with the service-by-service order of battle in \n     Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, as a representative and \n     recent major regional conflict;\n       (4) the force structure and defense appropriation increases \n     that are necessary to execute the National Security Strategy \n     of the United States assuming current projected ground force \n     levels assigned to the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia are \n     unchanged;\n       (5) a discussion of the United States ground force level in \n     Bosnia that can be sustained without impacting the ability of \n     the Armed Forces to execute the National Security Strategy of \n     the United States, assuming no increases in force structure \n     and defense appropriations during the period in which ground \n     forces are assigned to Bosnia.\n       Sec. 8161. Sense of the Senate Regarding Payroll Tax \n     Relief. (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The payroll tax under the Federal Insurance \n     Contributions Act (FICA) is the biggest, most regressive tax \n     paid by working families.\n       (2) The payroll tax constitutes a 15.3 percent tax burden \n     on the wages and self-employment income of each American, \n     with 12.4 percent of the payroll tax used to pay social \n     security benefits to current beneficiaries and 2.9 percent \n     used to pay the medicare benefits of current beneficiaries.\n       (3) The amount of wages and self-employment income subject \n     to the social security portion of the payroll tax is capped \n     at $68,400. Therefore, the lower a family's income, the more \n     they pay in payroll tax as a percentage of income. The \n     Congressional Budget Office has estimated that for those \n     families who pay payroll taxes, 80 percent pay more in \n     payroll taxes than in income taxes.\n       (4) In 1996, the median household income was $35,492, and a \n     family earning that amount and taking standard deductions and \n     exemptions paid $2,719 in Federal income tax, but lost $5,430 \n     in income to the payroll tax.\n       (5) Ownership of wealth is essential for everyone to have a \n     shot at the American dream, but the payroll tax is the \n     principal burden to savings and wealth creation for working \n     families.\n       (6) Since 1983, the payroll tax has been higher than \n     necessary to pay current benefits.\n       (7) Since most of the payroll tax receipts are deposited in \n     the social security trust funds, which masks the real amount \n     of Government borrowing, those whom the payroll tax hits \n     hardest, working families, have shouldered a disproportionate \n     share of the Federal budget deficit reduction and, therefore, \n     a disproportionate share of the creation of the Federal \n     budget surplus.\n       (8) Over the next 10 years, the Federal Government will \n     generate a budget surplus of $1,550,000,000,000, and all but \n     $32,000,000,000 of that surplus will be generated by excess \n     payroll taxes.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) if Congress decides to provide tax relief, reducing the \n     burden of payroll taxes should be a top priority; and\n       (2) Congress and the President should work to reduce this \n     payroll tax burden on American families.\n\n         TITLE IX --MONITORING OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN CHINA\n\n       Sec. 9001. Short Title. This title may be cited as the \n     ``Political Freedom in China Act of 1998''.\n       Sec. 9002. Findings. Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Congress concurs in the following conclusions of the \n     United States State Department on human rights in the \n     People's Republic of China in 1996:\n       (A) The People's Republic of China is ``an authoritarian \n     state'' in which ``citizens lack the freedom to peacefully \n     express opposition to the party-led political system and the \n     right to change their national leaders or form of \n     government''.\n       (B) The Government of the People's Republic of China has \n     ``continued to commit widespread and well-documented human \n     rights abuses, in violation of internationally accepted \n     norms, stemming from the authorities' intolerance of dissent, \n     fear of unrest, and the absence of inadequacy of laws \n     protecting basic freedoms''.\n       (C) ``abuses include torture and mistreatment of prisoners, \n     forced confessions, and arbitrary and incommunicado \n     detention''.\n       (D) ``prison conditions remained harsh and the Government \n     continued severe restrictions on freedom of speech, the \n     press, assembly, association, religion, privacy, and worker \n     rights''.\n       (E) ``although the Government denies that it holds \n     political prisoners, the number of persons detained or \n     serving sentences for `counterrevolutionary crimes' or \n     `crimes against the state', or for peaceful political or \n     religious activities are believed to number in the \n     thousands''.\n       (F) ``nonapproved religious groups, including Protestant \n     and Catholic groups . . . experienced intensified \n     repression''.\n       (G) ``serious human rights abuses persist in minority \n     areas, including Tibet, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia, and \n     controls on religion and on other fundamental freedoms in \n     these areas have also intensified''.\n       (H) ``overall in 1996, the authorities stepped up efforts \n     to cut off expressions of protest or criticism. All public \n     dissent against the party and government was effectively \n     silenced by intimidation, exile, the imposition of prison \n     terms, administrative detention, or house arrest. No \n     dissidents were known to be active at year's end.''.\n       (2) In addition to the State Department, credible \n     independent human rights organizations have documented an \n     increase in repression in China during 1995, and effective \n     destruction of the dissident movement through the arrest and \n     sentencing of the few remaining pro-democracy and human \n     rights activists not already in prison or exile.\n       (3) Among those were Li Hai, sentenced to 9 years in prison \n     on December 18, 1996, for gathering information on the \n     victims of the 1989 crackdown, which according to the court's \n     verdict constituted ``state secrets''; Liu Nianchun, an \n     independent labor organizer, sentenced to 3 years of ``re-\n     education through labor'' on July 4, 1996, due to his \n     activities in connection with a petition campaign calling for \n     human rights reforms; and Ngodrup Phuntsog, a Tibetan \n     national, who was arrested in Tibet in 1987 immediately after \n     he returned from a 2-year trip to India, where the Tibetan \n     government in exile is located, and following a secret trial \n     was convicted by the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China of espionage on behalf of the ``Ministry of Security of \n     the Dalai clique''.\n       (4) Many political prisoners are suffering from poor \n     conditions and ill-treatment leading to serious medical and \n     health problems, including--\n       (A) Gao Yu, a journalist sentenced to 6 years in prison in \n     November 1994 and honored by UNESCO in May 1997, has a heart \n     condition; and\n       (B) Chen Longde, a leading human rights advocate now \n     serving a 3-year re-education through labor sentence imposed \n     without trial in August 1995, has reportedly been subject to \n     repeated beatings and electric shocks at a labor camp for \n     refusing to confess his guilt.\n       (5) The People's Republic of China, as a member of the \n     United Nations, is expected to abide by the provisions of the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n       (6) The People's Republic of China is a party to numerous \n     international human rights conventions, including the \n     Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or \n     Degrading Treatment or Punishment.\n       Sec. 9003. Conduct of Foreign Relations. (a) Release of \n     Prisoners.--The Secretary of State, in all official meetings \n     with the Government of the People's Republic of China, should \n     request the immediate and unconditional release of Ngodrup \n     Phuntsog and other prisoners of conscience in Tibet, as well \n     as in the People's Republic of China.\n       (b) Access to Prisons.--The Secretary of State should seek \n     access for international humanitarian organizations to \n     Drapchi prison and other prisons in Tibet, as well as in the \n     People's Republic of China, to ensure that prisoners are not \n     being mistreated and are receiving necessary medical \n     treatment.\n       (c) Dialogue on Future of Tibet.--The Secretary of State, \n     in all official meetings with the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China, should call on that country to begin \n     serious discussions with the Dalai Lama or his \n     representatives, without preconditions, on the future of \n     Tibet.\n       Sec. 9004. Authorization of Appropriations for Additional \n     Personnel at Diplomatic Posts To Monitor Human Rights in the \n     People's Republic of China. There are authorized to be \n     appropriated to support personnel to monitor political \n     repression in the People's Republic of China in the United \n     States Embassies in Beijing and Kathmandu, as well as the \n     American consulates in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shenyang, \n     Chengdu, and Hong Kong, $2,200,000 for fiscal year 1999 and \n     $2,200,000 for fiscal year 2000.\n       Sec. 9005. Democracy Building in China. (a) Authorization \n     of Appropriations for NED.--In addition to such sums as are \n     otherwise authorized to be appropriated for the ``National \n     Endowment for Democracy'' for fiscal years 1999 and 2000, \n     there are authorized to be appropriated for the ``National \n     Endowment for Democracy'' $4,000,000 for fiscal year 1999 and \n     $4,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, which shall be available to \n     promote democracy, civil society, and the development of the \n     rule of law in China.\n       (b) East Asia-Pacific Regional Democracy Fund.--The \n     Secretary of State shall use funds available in the East \n     Asia-Pacific Regional Democracy Fund to provide grants to \n     nongovernmental organizations to promote democracy, civil \n     society, and the development of the rule of law in China.\n       Sec. 9006. Human Rights in China. (a) Reports.--Not later \n     than March 30, 1999, and each subsequent year thereafter, the \n     Secretary of State shall submit to the International \n     Relations Committee of the House of Representatives and the \n     Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate an annual report on \n     human rights in China, including religious persecution, the \n     development of democratic institutions, and the rule of law. \n     Reports shall provide information on each region of China.\n       (b) Prisoner Information Registry.--The Secretary of State \n     shall establish a Prisoner Information Registry for China \n     which shall provide information on all political prisoners, \n     prisoners of conscience, and prisoners of faith in China. \n     Such information shall include the\n\n[[Page S9713]]\n\n     charges, judicial processes, administrative actions, use of \n     forced labor, incidences of torture, length of imprisonment, \n     physical and health conditions, and other matters related to \n     the incarceration of such prisoners in China. The Secretary \n     of State is authorized to make funds available to \n     nongovernmental organizations presently engaged in monitoring \n     activities regarding Chinese political prisoners to assist in \n     the creation and maintenance of the registry.\n       Sec. 9007. Sense of Congress Concerning Establishment of a \n     Commission on Security and Cooperation in Asia. It is the \n     sense of Congress that Congress, the President, and the \n     Secretary of State should work with the governments of other \n     countries to establish a Commission on Security and \n     Cooperation in Asia which would be modeled after the \n     Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe.\n       Sec. 9008. Sense of Congress Regarding Democracy in Hong \n     Kong. It is the sense of Congress that the people of Hong \n     Kong should continue to have the right and ability to freely \n     elect their legislative representatives, and that the \n     procedure for the conduct of the elections of the legislature \n     of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region should be \n     determined by the people of Hong Kong through an election law \n     convention, a referendum, or both.\n       Sec. 9009. Sense of Congress Relating to Organ Harvesting \n     and Transplanting in the People's Republic of China. It is \n     the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Government of the People's Republic of China should \n     stop the practice of harvesting and transplanting organs for \n     profit from prisoners that it executes;\n       (2) the Government of the People's Republic of China should \n     be strongly condemned for such organ harvesting and \n     transplanting practice;\n       (3) the President should bar from entry into the United \n     States any and all officials of the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China known to be directly involved in \n     such organ harvesting and transplanting practice;\n       (4) individuals determined to be participating in or \n     otherwise facilitating the sale of such organs in the United \n     States should be prosecuted to the fullest possible extent of \n     the law; and\n       (5) the appropriate officials in the United States should \n     interview individuals, including doctors, who may have \n     knowledge of such organ harvesting and transplanting \n     practice.\n\n                                TITLE X\n\n                         HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA\n\n                 Subtitle A--Forced Abortions in China\n\n       Sec. 10001. This subtitle may be cited as the ``Forced \n     Abortion Condemnation Act''.\n       Sec. 10002. Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Forced abortion was rightly denounced as a crime \n     against humanity by the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal.\n       (2) For over 15 years there have been frequent and credible \n     reports of forced abortion and forced sterilization in \n     connection with the population control policies of the \n     People's Republic of China. These reports indicate the \n     following:\n       (A) Although it is the stated position of the politburo of \n     the Chinese Communist Party that forced abortion and forced \n     sterilization have no role in the population control program, \n     in fact the Communist Chinese Government encourages both \n     forced abortion and forced sterilization through a \n     combination of strictly enforced birth quotas and immunity \n     for local population control officials who engage in \n     coercion. Officials acknowledge that there have been \n     instances of forced abortions and sterilization, and no \n     evidence has been made available to suggest that the \n     perpetrators have been punished.\n       (B) People's Republic of China population control \n     officials, in cooperation with employers and works unit \n     officials, routinely monitor women's menstrual cycles and \n     subject women who conceive without government authorization \n     to extreme psychological pressure, to harsh economic \n     sanctions, including unpayable fines and loss of employment, \n     and often to physical force.\n       (C) Official sanctions for giving birth to unauthorized \n     children include fines in amounts several times larger than \n     the per capita annual incomes of residents of the People's \n     Republic of China. In Fujian, for example, the average fine \n     is estimated to be twice a family's gross annual income. \n     Families which cannot pay the fine may be subject to \n     confiscation and destruction of their homes and personal \n     property.\n       (D) Especially harsh punishments have been inflicted on \n     those whose resistance is motivated by religion. For example, \n     according to a 1995 Amnesty International report, the \n     Catholic inhabitants of 2 villages in Hebei Province were \n     subjected to population control under the slogan ``better to \n     have more graves than one more child''. Enforcement measures \n     included torture, sexual abuse, and the detention of \n     resisters' relatives as hostages.\n       (E) Forced abortions in Communist China often have taken \n     place in the very late stages of pregnancy.\n       (F) Since 1994 forced abortion and sterilization have been \n     used in Communist China not only to regulate the number of \n     children, but also to eliminate those who are regarded as \n     defective in accordance with the official eugenic policy \n     known as the ``Natal and Health Care Law''.\n       Sec. 10003.
