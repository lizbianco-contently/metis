Mr. President, if I could be heard just briefly on the \nlegislation itself.\n  You will note that in my opening statement here, the debate is on the \nmotion to proceed. I want the American people to hear that. We \nbasically have the threat of a filibuster from the Democrats on even \ntaking up for consideration the substance of the bill, S. 543.\n\n  What is this bill? This bill is the Volunteer Protection Act. I think \nit is quite a coincidence, highly ironic actually, that there is this \nmeeting now in Philadelphia, the City of Brotherly Love, to encourage \nvoluntarism in America--a worthy goal. And I have been impressed by the \nparticipants and by what they have had to say. We need to encourage \nAmericans to volunteer, to be more philanthropic, to contribute what \nthey can, not only of their money but of their time--a worthy goal of \nAmerica. And while America leads all the rest of the world already in \nthat effort, we can all do more, I am sure.\n  But now comes this bill and trying to protect volunteers from being \nsued. In many instances in America, if you volunteer, if you go on a \ncharitable organization's board of directors, if you join some of the \nvolunteer organizations, you run the risk of being sued and being held \npersonally liable.\n  So in the spirit of the conference going on in Philadelphia, it seems \nvery appropriate to me that the Senate would pass legislation to \nprovide some reasonable modicum of protection against these frivolous \nlawsuits that discourage people from volunteering, and yet we are being \ntold that we are going to have a filibuster of even proceeding to this \nbill.\n  Let me read some of the components of this bill. It says:\n\n       To provide certain protections [not total protections, but \n     certainly protections] to volunteers, nonprofit \n     organizations, and governmental entities in lawsuits based on \n     the activities of volunteers.\n\n  It says that:\n\n       The Congress finds and declares that--\n       (1) the willingness of volunteers to offer their services \n     is deterred [now] by the potential for liability actions \n     against them and organizations they serve;\n       (2) as a result, many nonprofit public and private \n     organizations and governmental entities, including voluntary \n     associations, social service agencies, educational \n     institutions, and other civic programs, have been adversely \n     affected by the withdrawal of volunteers from boards of \n     directors and service in other capacities;\n       (3) the contribution of these programs to their communities \n     is thereby diminished, resulting in fewer and higher cost \n     programs than would be obtainable if volunteers were \n     participating;\n       (4) because Federal funds are expended on useful and cost-\n     effective social service programs, many of which are national \n     in scope, depend heavily on volunteer participation, and \n     represent some of the most successful public-private \n     partnerships, protection of volunteerism through \n     clarification and limitation of the personal liability risks \n     assumed by the volunteer in connection with such \n     participation is [certainly] an appropriate [action] for \n     [this] Federal legislation;\n\n  It goes on and talks about how the threat of lawsuit is limiting \nvolunteers. It is leading to higher costs of private programs as well \nas public-private cooperation. It then sets out exactly what those \nlimitations are.\n  If you are actually involved in serious personal misconduct, you \nstill\n\n[[Page S3742]]\n\nwould be subject to liability. But to have some clarification here with \nregard to when you will be sued, even when you are in effect an \ninnocent bystander in a voluntary capacity, is something that we should \ndo. It is long overdue.\n\n  We have known many instances, I am sure, in our own States where \nthese types of lawsuits have been filed. And it is time that we take \naction. In fact, it goes hand in glove with what is happening in \nPhiladelphia.\n  So I urge my colleagues that have reservations based on this, if \nthere are concerns by trial lawyers that we can legitimately address, \nfine. But I do not think we should allow trial lawyers to dictate that \nwe cannot have even the consideration of legislation that would provide \nsome protection for volunteers in America.\n  Mr. President, again, I urge my colleagues to allow this legislation \nto go forward. And I hope that our colleagues will be able to vote for \na final product by an overwhelming vote.\n  I yield the floor at this time, Mr. President.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns).

Mr. President, several months ago I visited White Pine \nCounty High School located in Ely, NV, one of the rural spots of \nNevada. I was going to speak to an assembly of high school students. I \nwas in a room waiting to give my presentation. In the room were two \nyoung ladies. They were dressed in letter sweaters from White Pine \nCounty High School. One of them was named Lauren and the other was \nCasandra.\n  While waiting, I struck up a conversation with these two young \nladies. I asked them what sports they participated in. One of them ran \ntrack. She told me she had won the summer tournament in sprints. The \nother girl said she participated in softball.\n  So we carried on our conversation for a short period of time. As I \nwas getting ready to go in, one of the young ladies said, ``Senator I \ndon't know what I would do without my sports.''\n  Mr. President, these two young ladies' ability to participate in \nathletics is as a result of something that the Federal Government has \ndone.\n  I started a series of speeches last summer on the Senate floor to \ndiscuss the good things that happen in Government. We tend to dwell on \nthe negative, rather than the positive aspects of Government. I talked \nabout how proud I was that we have our National Park System with great \nparks like Yellowstone, Yosemite, Grand Canyon, and the other great \nentities that are the envy of the world.\n  I talked about the Federal Emergency Management Agency, what a great \njob they have done in Nevada, and how proud I was of the work they had \ndone in the State of Nevada during the recent floods. They are, of \ncourse, in every newspaper and on every news program because of the \nwork they are doing with the floods of North Dakota and South Dakota \nright now.\n  I talked about the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and about the \ngreat work they do to make the marketplace safer for us.\n  I also talked about the great work that 25,000 men and women engage \nin every summer in fighting forest fires, principally in the Western \npart of the United States. They do very courageous things, such as \njumping out of helicopters with backpacks weighing almost 100 pounds, \nand rappelling off the back of helicopters.\n  These are Government programs. We should acknowledge them. The \nFederal Government has its shortcomings, and I am the first to \nacknowledge that. But let's not dwell on the shortcomings. Let's talk \nabout some of the good things that happen.\n  That is the reason I am here today; to talk about one of the programs \nthat the Federal Government initiated that I think is good. I am here \nto speak about title IX, enacted as part of the Education Act \nAmendments of 1972, which gives women and girls equal rights in \neducation and in athletics.\n  Just a couple of months ago we celebrated the 11th annual National \nGirls and Women in Sports Day. We had all kinds of star female athletes \ncome here to The Mall in Washington to celebrate the accomplishments of \nwomen in sports and to commemorate the upcoming anniversary of title \nIX.\n  I think this Federal statute is an example of good Government. What \nwe attempted to do in this legislation is level the playing field for \nall Americans.\n  Title IX is an example of Government funding providing just such an \nopportunity in America. We have not reached the goal of equity for men \nand women in high school and college athletics. But we have come a \ntremendous way as indicated, in my opinion, by Lauren and Casandra \ntelling me about their enthusiastic participation in rural Nevada \nathletics.\n  So as we approach the 25th anniversary of title IX this June we can \nbe proud of the accomplishments made under this law while looking ahead \nto the goal of equal treatment for men and women in education and in \nsports.\n  In 1972, when this law went into effect, about 1 out of every 30 \ngirls in high school played sports. Today it is 1 in 3. Now women \naccount for 34 percent of athletic participants in high school and \ncollege sports.\n  In 1972, just a small amount of money was spent nationwide on \nathletic scholarships for women--less than $100,000. Today it is \napproaching $200 million. Fifty-five percent of women participate in \nhigh school sports.\n  A recent USA Today analysis of 303 NCAA Division I schools found that \nwomen comprised 37 percent of all athletes at these schools. There has \nbeen an increase even since 1992 in girls participating in college \nathletics. It is up over 20 percent.\n  It is a great accomplishment to have one of your children graduate \nfrom college. I have had that opportunity with my children. But it is \nalso a great thrill to watch your children participate in athletics at \nthe high school level and at the college level. Only one of my children \nhas participated in athletics at the college level. But that was a \ngreat thrill for me to watch my young boy play on three national NCAA \nchampionship teams on three separate occasions. He played soccer at the \nUniversity of Virginia, where they were national champions. Girls \nshould have the same opportunity that my son had to play Division I and \nDivision II college athletics.\n  Nationwide, 7 million women of all ages play soccer. The number of \nNCAA Division I women's soccer teams has increased from 22 in 1982 to \nover 200 now. That is a significant increase. Thanks to title IX, more \nwomen are going to college, more women are getting scholarships, and \nmore women are playing sports at a competitive level.\n  I have always been one that supported college athletics. While some \ncriticize competitive athletics in college, I think they are great. \nAthletics allows people who would never have set foot within a \nuniversity campus to get an education. They don't always graduate, even \nthough the graduation rates\n\n[[Page S3743]]\n\nare increasing, but it gives them the opportunity to be someplace where \nthey ordinarily would not be able to go. That is good. It should also \nallow women the opportunity to go to college because of their athletic \nabilities. Title IX is helping women get athletic scholarships that \nthey would not have gotten just a few years ago. This is important and \ngood for the country and for education generally.\n  What are the benefits of sports for women and for girls? Women and \ngirls achieve numerous benefits from participating in athletics. In my \nopinion, with our society becoming increasingly more sedentary, we need \nto increase physical activity and athletics for all of our citizens--\nnot just for boys but also for girls.\n  Getting young ladies involved in sports improves their health and \nwell-being, and increases the likelihood they will stick with athletics \nand exercise throughout their lives.\n  In addition to the general health benefits of physical activity, a \nstudy conducted at the Harvard University's Graduate School of Public \nHealth showed that young women who participated in college sports were \nsignificantly--and I stress that--less likely to contract breast cancer \nand other reproductive cancers.\n  There are other benefits. Participation in athletics benefits young \nwomen in the same way that it benefits young men. Participation in \nsports has been found to increase the self-esteem of girls and boys.\n  Mr. President, one of my older boys played football in high school. I \nwas talking on the telephone to one of my friends who had been a \ncollege athlete. He and I played ball together in high school. I was \nconcerned that a boy from my son's team had just gone to the hospital \nwith some football injury. And my friend, who is now a veterinarian, \ntold me, ``Harry, athletics builds character. He may have gone to an \nemergency room. He is home now. Stick it out. Athletics builds \ncharacter.'' That it does.\n\n  I believe, for those that I have seen participate in athletics \ngenerally, it is a character builder. It should be a character builder \nnot only for young men but also for young women.\n  I believe, as I said, that athletics increases self-esteem of girls \nand boys. High school athletes have higher graduation rates than \nnonathletes. Female athletes also have lower dropout rates than \nnonathletes.\n  Studies reveal that girls involved in sports are more likely to \naspire to be leaders in their communities. Expanding sports \nopportunities for women and girls will help more women in their \nleadership roles and help them to lead successful adult lives. If it is \ntrue for men, then it should be true for women.\n  Further, increased opportunity for women in sports increases exposure \nfor women's athletics, and makes it possible for more women to make a \ncareer of sports.\n  Mr. President, the NCAA women's basketball championship this year was \na sellout. The women's--not men's but women's--college basketball \nchampionship was a sellout. They played great basketball.\n  When I go home I love to watch women's softball. Last year UNLV was \nranked in the top five of the Nation. It was exciting to watch these \nyoung women play fast pitch softball. I am sure, if you brought the \nmen's baseball players over to play these young women in softball, that \nthe men would lose. These young women are good. I like to watch women's \nbasketball too. It is just as entertaining as men's. Title IX has \nplayed an important role in providing opportunities for women to excel \nin athletics.\n  It is important to stress, however, that the intent of title IX was \nnot to cut men's programs but merely to bring women's programs up to \nthe level that they ought to be. This costs money, and many schools \naren't willing to shell out this money. Subsequently, title IX has \ngotten some negative reaction from schools who have limited funds.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important to note that schools are \ntrying to comply. For example, the University of Nevada at Las Vegas \ndeveloped a compliance action plan to make changes and work toward \ncompliance with title IX. They have submitted a plan that will put \ngirls athletics at UNLV on a par with male athletics by the year 2001. \nTheir plan is to increase female athletic participation opportunities--\nscholarship and nonscholarship--by a minimum of 100 over the next 5 \nyears. They are going to add women's soccer in 1998 and add another \nwomen's sport in the year 2001. They are going to provide medical \nsupport, training and equipment to meet these additional needs; and \nprovide new funding, up to $4 million over the next 5 years, to meet \nthese gender equity needs.\n  UNLV doesn't currently meet any of the tests for title IX compliance, \nbut they are working at it to the benefit of Nevada's athletes, and I \nthink to education generally.\n  Mr. President, compliance with title IX is not unreasonable, nor is \nit impossible. Seven NCAA Division I schools meet the proportionality \ntest, where the percentage of female athletes is within five points of \nfemale undergraduates.\n  Among the schools in compliance are Dartmouth, Lehigh, the University \nof Massachusetts, Harvard, and Montana State.\n  So it is not all of these eastern schools. It can be done, if people \ntry. Obviously, Montana State was interested in complying, and they \naccomplished that.\n  Even the most basic efforts that schools make toward compliance with \ntitle IX have started a nationwide boom in women's sports.\n  I talked about basketball. But as more women have entered athletics \nthey have not displaced men. Instead the total number of athletes has \nincreased. There has been an ongoing struggle. We have had case \ndecisions in the U.S. Supreme Court. On Monday, April 21, the Supreme \nCourt declined to review a case filed by Brown University where they \nwanted to test the Constitutionality of title IX.\n  The Supreme Court would not even consider the case. As a result of \nthat, we are going forward with more proportionality. We are going to \nmake an even playing field.\n  Because of these positive outcomes, title IX must be supported and \nenforced because it is good government. Somewhere out there are future \nfemale professional athletes and Olympic gold medalists who may never \njump a hurdle or pick up a ball if their families, coaches, and schools \ndo not give them the opportunity and the encouragement to play sports. \nThese girls and women who are the champions of the future must be \nsupported. Title IX is vital to that effort.\n  (Ms. COLLINS assumed the chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/28/senate-section/article/S3742-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3743-S3744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, when I came to the Senate about 11 years \nago, one of the first things I did was come to the Senate floor and \ntalk about the need for campaign finance reform. I thought it would \ncome very quickly. I could not believe, with all the problems that \noccurred during that election cycle, including what happened in my \nelection in the State of Nevada 11 years ago, we would not rush to \nreform the way we elect Senators and Members of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The problems were replete, with the Federal Election Commission being \nreally a toothless tiger. They had no money to enforce the rules and \nthe laws that existed. Much to my chagrin and, frankly, much to my \nsurprise, 11 years later we have done nothing, zero. In fact, things \nhave even gotten worse. Why? Because the Supreme Court, among other \nthings, declared that any money that goes to a State party cannot be \nregulated. So this last cycle, even though we had Federal law to the \neffect that there would be no corporate money in Federal elections \nsince the early part of this century, the Supreme Court stood that on \nits head, and suddenly not only do we have the problems we have had \nwith a myriad of people trying to skirt the law, now we have the fact \nthat you can use corporate money in Federal elections.\n  I think that is wrong. I think it is too bad that we have not done \nsomething. That is why I am here today to commend and applaud Senators \nFeingold and McCain for their courageous work on campaign finance \nreform. I am a cosponsor of that legislation. I do not agree with every \njot and tittle, every line and verse within that legislation, but it is \na step in the right direction, and I happily joined in cosponsoring \nthat legislation. Why? Because it is going to do some things--it\n\n[[Page S3744]]\n\nis going to reform campaign financing significantly and importantly and \nin a good way. It will require greater disclosure of independent \nexpenditures. I believe independent expenditures is a sore that is \nfestering and is going to wind up tremendously damaging the body \npolitic.\n  Unnamed people, with money coming from unknown sources, are running \ncampaign ads viciously attacking candidates. That is wrong. That is \nreally un-American.\n  The McCain-Feingold legislation will require the FEC to provide \nadvance notice to complying candidates if they have been targeted by \nthese independent expenditures or outside organizations.\n  McCain-Feingold would restrict contributions from people not eligible \nto vote in Federal elections. It could ban incumbent use of franked \nmass mailings in the calendar year of an election.\n  It would increase disclosure and accountability for those who engage \nin political advertising. And it would strengthen penalties for willful \nviolations of Federal election law. We must do something to make people \nfeel better about the elections.\n  Elections are 18 months away. Negative ads are already starting \naround the country. That is wrong. People who say we need to hold more \nhearings to determine whether or not McCain-Feingold is a good law, I \nsay let us look at what has happened over the past 10 years. Congress \nhas produced almost 6,800 pages of hearings. There have been 3,361 \nfloor speeches. I guess because of this one, it is 3,362 floor \nspeeches. There have been 1,060 pages of committee reports, 113 Senate \nvotes on campaign finance reform, and one bipartisan Federal \ncommission. Certainly this is enough. We have enough information to act \nresponsibly.\n\n  Over the next 2 years, Madam President, Congress will deal with \nchanges to regulations and programs that affect virtually every \nAmerican, from clean air and water to education programs, matters \ndealing with crime in the streets, juvenile crime, trying to improve \nour infrastructure, Medicare, Medicaid, problems dealing with our \nNation's elderly. In order to address these concerns credibly, should \nwe not first act to reform the way we are elected? I say yes. I hope \nthat my colleagues join hands in rallying around the McCain-Feingold \nlegislation. It is the best we have to bring debate to the Senate floor \nand to get something done. I have talked about it for 11 years. It has \nbeen a problem even longer than that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The St. Dominic's team spent a considerable amount of time \nand energy reaching the national finals this weekend by winning various \ncompetitions in Maine in order to earn the honor of representing our \nState.\n  The 14 members of our State's outstanding team, who should be \nindividually acknowledged for their efforts in this undertaking, are:\n  Robyn Adair, Michael Beam, Julie Blanchette, Nicole Bouttenot, Rachel \nBouttenot, Martin Bruno, Derek Coulombe, Emma Dore-Hark, Jennifer \nElliott, Jonathan LaBonte, Kendra LaRoche, Kathryn Mailhot, Michael \nTheriault, and Matthew Walton.\n  Of course, in addition to these outstanding students, I want to \nacknowledge and recognize the hard work of their teacher, Rosanne \nDucey, who deserves her fair share of the credit for the team's success \nas well. The ``We the People'' program coordinator for Maine, Pamela \nBeal, has also contributed a significant amount of her time and effort \nto help the St. Dominic team reach the national finals.\n  The ``We the People'' program, which is administered by the Center \nfor Civic Education, is the most indepth educational program in the \ncountry developed specifically to educate high school students about \nthe U.S. Constitution. This past weekend's 3-day national competition \nre-creates a public hearing in which the student's oral presentations \nare judged on the basis of their knowledge of constitutional principles \nand their ability to apply them to historical and contemporary issues.\n  The ``We the People'' program has been operating for 10 years now. \nSince its origination, millions of students nationwide have \nparticipated in this program at either the elementary, middle, and/or \nhigh school level. This program provides an excellent opportunity for \nstudents to gain an informed perspective on the significance of the \nU.S. Constitution and its place in our history and our lives.\n  Mr. President, I'm pleased to be able to recognize the valuable \ncontribution that the St. Dominic Regional High School team has made to \nthe success of the ``We the People'' program, and I wish these students \nand their teachers the very best of luck. I am proud of their \naccomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/28/senate-section/article/S3744-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 543, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 543) to provide certain protections to \n     volunteers, nonprofit organizations, and governmental \n     entities in lawsuits based on the activities of volunteers.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, this week in Philadelphia, President \nClinton is joining former Presidents Bush and Ford, along with former \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell at a summit to \npromote voluntarism.\n  I commend any and all efforts to increase charitable activity on the \npart of Americans. And I find it extremely fitting that this summit is \nbeing held in the City of Brotherly Love because charitable activity \ndoes more even than providing help and counseling to those in need. \nCharitable activity helps all Americans by promoting habits and \nappreciation of benevolent actions--actions aimed at helping those in \nneed because it is the right thing to do.\n\n[[Page S3745]]\n\n  Charitable activity binds us together as members of the same \ncommunity. It helps each of us think of our neighbors, and even \nstrangers, as our brothers, deserving of our care and help. By \nvolunteering, Americans bring us together in our towns, cities, States, \nand indeed our Nation.\n  America has a vast interstate network of 114,000 operating nonprofit \norganizations, ranging from schools to hospitals to clinics to food \nprograms.\n  This network's revenues totaled $388 billion in 1990.\n  Meanwhile, revenues for the 19,000 support institutions--which raise \nmoney to fund operating organizations--came to $29 billion.\n  And total revenues for religious congregations were $48 billion. \nThat's 465 billion dollars worth of nonprofit activity we enjoyed in \n1990 alone.\n  Nonprofit organizations rely heavily on volunteers, and Americans \ngladly comply. According to a 1993 report from the Independent Sector, \na national coalition of 800 organizations, Americans donated 9.7 \nbillion hours of their time to nonprofit organizations that year.\n  This volunteer time produced the equivalent of 5.7 million full time \nvolunteers, worth an estimated $112 billion.\n  But there is trouble in the organizations and among the people who \npromote voluntary, charitable activity in our country. Unfortunately \nvoluntarism is declining nationwide.\n  According to the Independent Sector report, the percentage of \nAmericans volunteering dropped from 54 percent in 1989 to 51 percent in \n1991 and 48 percent in 1993.\n  Americans also are giving less money. The average household's \ncharitable donation dropped from $978 in 1989 to $880 in 1993.\n  The decline of giving and volunteering spells danger for our \nvoluntary organizations, for the people who depend on them, and for the \nsocial trust that is based on the spirit of association.\n  This makes gestures, like the summit on voluntarism, important. It \nalso means that we should look for immediate, practical means by which \nwe in government can reduce the burdens that we impose on voluntary, \ncharitable activity.\n  That is why I am extremely pleased to rise today to join my \ncolleagues, Senator Coverdell and Senator McConnell, in sponsoring the \nVolunteer Protection Act of 1997, which we are debating on the floor at \nthis time.\n  I commend Senators Coverdell and McConnell for their leadership in \nencouraging and supporting the voluntarism that is so important to \ncommunities in Michigan and across this country.\n  This long overdue legislation will provide volunteers and nonprofit \norganizations with desperately needed relief from abusive lawsuits \nbrought based on the activities of volunteers. Those are precisely the \nactivities that we should be protecting and encouraging.\n  And one major reason for the decline is America's litigation \nexplosion. Nonprofit organizations are forced to spend an increasing \namount of time and resources preparing for, avoiding, and/or fighting \nlawsuits.\n  Thus, litigation has rendered our nonprofit organizations less \neffective at helping people, and allowed Americans to retreat more into \ntheir private lives, and away from the public, social activity that \nbinds us together as a people.\n  Last Congress, I spoke on the floor many times concerning the need \nfor litigation reform and describing the litigation abuses that plague \nour small businesses, our consumers, our schools, and others. I came to \nCongress as a freshman Senator intending to press for lawsuit reforms, \nand it is something I have worked very hard on.\n  I supported the securities litigation reform legislation, which \nCongress successfully enacted over the President's veto, and I also \nsupported the product liability reform bill, which the President \nunfortunately killed with his veto.\n  I also introduced legislation with Senator McConnell to provide \nbroader relief in all civil cases, and offered floor amendments that \nwould do the same.\n  I continue to support broader civil justice reforms and I \nparticularly look forward to considering product liability reform \nlegislation both in the Commerce Committee and on the floor in this \nsession.\n  But I believe that our voluntary, nonprofit organizations, perhaps \nmore than any other sector of our country, urgently need protection \nfrom current lawsuit abuses. I encourage my colleagues to consider the \nproblems facing our community groups and their volunteers, and to \nsupport this legislation.\n  I hope that, given his public support for voluntary activity, \nPresident Clinton will support this litigation reform bill, recognize \nthe value of volunteers and nonprofit groups, and give them the \nprotection they need to keep doing their good deeds.\n  Litigation adds a variety of onerous burdens to our nonprofit \norganizations. Among the most obvious is increasing insurance costs.\n  Mr. John Graham, on behalf of the American Society of Association \nExecutives [ASAE], gave testimony last year arguing that liability \ninsurance premiums for associations have increased an average 155 \npercent in recent years.\n  Some of our most revered nonprofit institutions have been put at risk \nby increased liability costs.\n  Dr. Creighton Hale of Little League Baseball reports that the \nliability rate for a league increased from $75 to $795 in just 5 years. \nMany leagues cannot afford this added expense, on top of increasing \ncosts for helmets and other equipment. These leagues operate without \ninsurance or disband altogether, often leaving children with no \norganized sports in their neighborhood.\n  What kind of suits add to insurance costs? ASAE reports that one New \nJersey umpire was forced by a court to pay a catcher $24,000. Why? \nBecause the catcher was hit in the eye by a softball while playing \nwithout a mask. The catcher complained that the umpire should have lent \nhim his.\n  Organizations that try to escape sky-rocketing insurance costs must \nself-insure, and Andrea Marisi of the Red Cross will describe self-\ninsurance costs only as ``huge.'' The result? ``Obviously, we have \nfewer funds available for providing services than would otherwise be \nthe case.''\n  Outside insurance generally comes with significant deductibles. \nCharles Kolb of the United Way points out that insurance deductibles \nfor his organization fall into the range of $25,000 to $30,000. When, \nas has been the case in recent years, the organization is subjected to \nthree or four lawsuits per year, $100,000 or more must be diverted from \ncharitable programs.\n  And there are even more costs. Mr. Kolb reports that the costs in \nlost time and money spent on discovery--for example going through files \nfor hours on end to establish who did what when--can run into the \nthousands of dollars as well.\n  Further, as the Boy Scouts' William Cople puts it:\n\n       We bear increased costs from risk management programs of \n     many kinds--[including] those to prevent accidents. We have \n     higher legal bills as well. But even more of a problem is the \n     need to find pro-bono help to quell possible lawsuits. The \n     Scouts must spend scarce time, and use up scarce human \n     capital in preventing suits. For example, 5 years ago the \n     General Counsel's office, a pro-bono operation, committed \n     less than 100 hours per year on issues relating to lawsuits. \n     Last year we devoted about 750 hours to that duty.\n\n  The Boy Scouts must do less good so that they can defend themselves \nfrom lawsuits, and that just doesn't seem quite right.\n  Frivolous lawsuits also increase costs by discouraging voluntarism. \nDottie Lewis of the Southwest Officials Association, which provides \nofficials for scholastic games, observes, ``Some of our people got to \nthe point where they were just afraid to work because of the threat of \nlawsuits.''\n  What makes this fear worse is the knowledge that one need do no harm \nin order to be liable.\n  Take for example Powell versus Boy Scouts of America. While on an \nouting with the Sea Explorers, a scouting unit in the Boy Scouts' \nCascade Pacific Council, a youth suffered a tragic, paralyzing injury \nin a rough game of touch football.\n  Several adults had volunteered to supervise the outing, but none \nobserved the game. The youth filed a personal injury lawsuit against \ntwo of the adult volunteers. The jury found the volunteers liable for \nsome $7 million, which\n\n[[Page S3746]]\n\nOregon law reduced to about $4 million--far more than the volunteers \ncould possibly pay.\n  What is more, as Cople points out, ``the jury seemingly held the \nvolunteers to a standard of care requiring them constantly to supervise \nthe youth entrusted to their charge, even for activities which under \nother circumstances may routinely be permitted without such meticulous \noversight.''\n  Clearly, when an injury of this sort occurs, it is a tragic \nsituation. The question is, How should society allocate these \nresponsibilities, and to what extent should a voluntary organization \nand its volunteers be responsible for the same standard of care as \noutlined by this jury?\n  No one can provide the meticulous oversight demanded by the jury. \nThus volunteers are left at the mercy of events--and juries--beyond \ntheir control.\n  Such unreasonable standards of care also penalize our nonprofit \norganizations.\n  Len Krugel of the Michigan Salvation Army reports that regulations \nand onerous legal standards often keep his organization from giving \ntroubled youths a second chance.\n  Because the organization is held responsible for essentially all \nactions by its employees and volunteers, it can take no risks in \nhiring.\n  As Mr. Krugel observes, ``If we can't give these kids a second \nchance, who can?''\n  Then there is the problem of joint and several liability, in which \none defendant is made to pay for all damages even though responsible \nfor only a small portion.\n  Such findings are a severe burden on the United Way, a national \norganization that sponsors numerous local nonprofit groups. Although it \ncannot control local operations, the United Way often finds itself a \ndefendant in suits arising from injuries caused by the local entity.\n  Such holdings result from juries' desire to find someone with the \nfunds necessary to pay for an innocent party's injuries. But this \nsearch for the deep pocket leads to what Ms. Marisi calls a ``chilling \neffect'' on Red Cross relations with other nonprofits. And the same is \nobviously true for other national organizations.\n  The Red Cross is now less willing to cooperate with smaller, more \ninnovative local agencies that might make it more effective.\n  Thus nonprofits forbear from doing good because they cannot afford \nthe insurance, they cannot afford the loss of volunteers, they cannot \nafford the risk of frivolous lawsuits.\n  The Volunteer Protection Act will address the danger to our nonprofit \nsector, Madam President.\n  It will not solve all the problems facing our volunteers and \nnonprofits.\n  But it will provide voluntary organizations with critical protection \nagainst improper litigation, at the same time that it recognizes the \nability of the States to take additional or even alternative \nprotections in some cases.\n  By setting the standard for the protection of volunteers outright, \nthis bill provides much-needed lawsuit relief immediately to volunteers \nand nonprofits wherever they may be. Let me briefly describe what this \nbill does.\n  The bill protects volunteers from liability unless they cause harm \nthrough action that constitutes reckless misconduct, gross negligence, \nwillful or criminal misconduct, or is in conscious, flagrant disregard \nfor the rights and safety of those harmed.\n  This ensures that where volunteers truly exceed the bounds of \nappropriate conduct they will be liable. But in the many ridiculous \ncases I have described, some of them clearly frivolous--where no real \nwrongdoing occurred--the volunteer will not be forced to face and \ndefend a lawsuit.\n  In lawsuits based on the actions of a volunteer, the bill limits the \npunitive damages that can be awarded.\n  It is unfortunate that charities and volunteers have punitive damages \nawarded against them in the first place, but they do.\n  Congressman John Porter, who is leading the fight for this \nlegislation on the House side, reports that in August 1990, a Chicago \njury awarded $12 million to a boy who was injured in a car crash. The \nnegligent party? The estate of the volunteer who gave his life \nattempting to save the boy.\n  Under this bill, punitive damages in cases involving the actions of a \nvolunteer could be awarded against a volunteer, nonprofit organization, \nor Government entity only upon a showing by the claimant that the \nvolunteer's action represented willful or criminal misconduct, or \nshowed a conscious, flagrant disregard for the rights and safety of the \nindividual harmed.\n  This should ensure that punitive damages, which are intended only to \npunish a defendant and are not intended to compensate an injured \nperson, will only be available in situations where punishment really is \ncalled for because of the egregious conduct of the defendant.\n  The bill also protects volunteers from excessive liability that they \nmight face through joint and several liability.\n  Under the doctrine of joint and several liability, a plaintiff can \nobtain full damages from a defendant who is only slightly at fault. I \nhave spoken many times before about the unfairness that may result from \nthe application of this legal doctrine. The injustice that results to \nvolunteers and nonprofits is often even more acute, because they lack \nthe resources to bear unfair judgments.\n  This bill strikes a balance by providing that, in cases based on the \nactions of a volunteer, any defendant that is a volunteer, nonprofit \norganization, or Government entity will be jointly and severally \nresponsible for the full share of economic damages but will only be \nresponsible for noneconomic damages in proportion to the harm that that \ndefendant caused.\n  Finally, I would like to speak for a moment about how this \nlegislation preserves important principles of federalism and respects \nthe role of the States.\n  First, the bill does not preempt State legislation that provides \ngreater protections to volunteers. In this way, it sets up outer \nprotections from which all volunteers will benefit and permits States \nto do even more.\n  But second, the bill includes an opt-out provision that permits \nStates, in cases involving only parties from that State, to \naffirmatively elect to opt out of the protections provided in the \nVolunteer Protection Act. A State can do so by enacting a statute \nspecifically providing for that. I suspect that no States will elect to \ndo so, but I feel that, as a matter of principle, it is important to \ninclude that provision in order to maintain the proper balance of \nfederalism in this legislation.\n  Madam President, in short, these reforms can help create a system in \nwhich plaintiffs sue only when they have good reason--and only those \nwho are responsible for their damages--and in which only those who are \nresponsible must pay.\n  Such reforms will create an atmosphere in which our fear of one \nanother will be lessened, and our ability to join associations in which \nwe learn to care for one another will be significantly greater. And \nthat, Madam President, will make for a better America. I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important piece \nof legislation.\n  We talk often in this Chamber about how to foster a sense of \ncommunity in America. It is something which many people have a varied \nperspective on. But it strikes me, Madam President, that nothing can do \nmore to help generate the sense of community than to create an \natmosphere in which people stop looking at their neighbors as possible \nplaintiffs and defendants and start looking at them as friends and \nneighbors again.\n  I think we have moved in the wrong direction because of the \nlitigation explosion generated by frivolous lawsuits. I think \nlegislation such as the Volunteer Protection Act will help to redress \nthat balance and put us back on the right course so that the ideals \nthat are being talked about these days in the summit in Philadelphia \ncan truly be realized and effectuated to their maximum possible degree.\n  For that reason, I am glad to be a cosponsor of this legislation. I \nlook forward to speaking again on it here as the debate continues. I do \nhope our colleagues will join us in supporting this very important \npiece of legislation which we might, with some help, get through the \nCongress in the very near future.\n  I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S3747]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, as I noted in my past remarks a moment \nor so ago, today in Philadelphia, PA, some of the leaders of our \ncountry, former Presidents as well as President Clinton and numerous \nother elected officials and volunteer leaders from around the Nation, \nare meeting to try to provide incentives to all of us to take a greater \nand more active role in volunteering in our communities to help our \nfellow citizens.\n  In light of that happening, I cannot help but think about a friend of \nmine who passed away a couple of years ago, former Gov. George Romney \nof Michigan.\n  Governor Romney was elected Governor of our State in 1962 and held \nthat job for 6 years, at which time he was asked to join the Cabinet of \nPresident Nixon and became Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. \nPrior to his Government service, he had been the president of American \nMotors Corp. So he had a distinguished career in both business as well \nas in the public sector.\n  When he left Government officially, he then made sort of his \nprincipal focus in life the spirit of voluntarism and worked in a \nvariety of ways throughout his remaining 20 years or so of life to try \nto generate nationwide interest and support for voluntarism. In fact, \nhe started as head of the national organization called Volunteer, I \nbelieve, whose job it was to try to provide stimulus for greater \nvolunteer participation.\n  I recall very vividly in 1991 when Gov. John Engler was elected to \nhis first term in our State. Governor Romney reinvolved himself in the \nvoluntarism activity level in Michigan and helped put together a \nbipartisan voluntarism commitment in our State that has done many good \ndeeds as a consequence.\n  He also was active in the Points of Light organization nationally. He \nwas on the board of the nonprofit entity, Points of Light, I believe it \nis called, and certainly served as an inspiration in both the launching \nof that as well as its successful development.\n  I mention him today not just because of the connection to voluntarism \nthat the summit provides but also because it turns out he was perhaps, \nmore than anyone, the inspiration for this summit, having thought of \nthe idea and recommended it, I believe, to Mr. Wofford and others who \nthen moved it forward.\n  So he was an inspiration both to his Nation and certainly to this \nU.S. Senator in many ways. But also he should be remembered today on \nthe floor of the Senate, as so many Americans will spend the next day \nor so focusing on what they can do to help others in their communities. \nIt is people like George Romney who have called our attention to the \nenormous challenges ahead of us.\n  So I wish to mention him today to recall his many achievements, his \nmany contributions, and how much I am confident that, were he still \nalive, he would be involved even today, in Philadelphia, if he could \nhave been, in helping to further the cause for which he had such a \ngreat commitment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senate \nis considering S. 543.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is on a motion to proceed to that \nbill, S. 543.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield myself whatever time is \nnecessary to make my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today the Senate begins debate on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 543, the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997.\n  This bill would grant immunity from personal civil liability under \ncertain circumstances to volunteers working for nonprofit organizations \nin governmental entities. This legislation is intended to encourage \nmore people to step forward and serve their communities as volunteers \nby removing the fear of unwarranted lawsuits against volunteers.\n  It is appropriate that we consider this issue today. Yesterday in \nPhiladelphia a remarkable gathering got underway. The President's \nSummit for America's Future brought together President Clinton, \nPresident Bush, President Ford, President Carter, Gen. Colin Powell, \nand other national leaders in an effort to focus the Nation's attention \non the importance of and the need for volunteer service.\n  The assembled leaders there issued a call to action, asking every \nAmerican to do more, asking all of us to volunteer our time and efforts \nin community service.\n  This is in the best tradition of America. Since before our Nation's \nfounding, charities have helped the poor, counseled the troubled, and \nby their example taught us to care for our neighbors. They are the key \nto our survival as a nation. Americans have a proud history of \nsupporting volunteers.\n  Yet, many who would heed the call of the Philadelphia summit will not \ndo so--not because they lack the desire or the ability to help, but \nbecause they, quite frankly and rightly, fear risk of liability in a \nsociety that seems too often to resemble a lawsuit lottery.\n  In a recent Gallup survey of nonprofit volunteers, one in six \nvolunteers reported withholding their services for fear of being sued. \nAbout 1 in 10 nonprofit groups report the resignation of a volunteer \nover the threat of liability. Eighteen percent of those surveyed had \nwithheld their leadership services due to fear of liability.\n  These numbers reflect a chilling effect that causes potential \nvolunteers to suppress their good intentions and their desire to get \ninvolved. Nonprofit organizations rely heavily on volunteers. Moreover, \nthe very act of participating in charitable work helps bind Americans \ntogether as a people. At a time when there is so much good work that \nneeds to be done, we cannot afford to have good people turn away for \nfear of a devastating lawsuit.\n  That is why I introduced the Volunteer Protection Act, along with \nSenator McConnell, who has dedicated long service to this effort and \nwho has been an outstanding leader on the issue, and Senator Abraham, \nSenator Santorum, and Senator Ashcroft. We have since been joined by a \nnumber of our colleagues.\n  Briefly, Mr. President, our bill provides that no volunteer of a \nnonprofit organization or governmental entity shall be liable for harm \ncaused by a volunteer's negligent acts or omissions on behalf of the \norganization. To enjoy this protection, the volunteer must be acting \nwithin the scope of his or her responsibilities in the organization and \nmust not cause harm by willful or criminal misconduct, gross \nnegligence, or reckless misconduct.\n  It is also important to note that the protection from liability does \nnot extend to misconduct involving violent crimes, hate crimes, sex \ncrimes, or civil rights violations. It does not apply where the \ndefendant was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. This ensures \nthat where volunteers truly exceed the bounds of appropriate conduct, \nthey are liable.\n  The bill is intended to protect volunteers who make simple, honest \nmistakes. Where behavior is more egregious, no protection is warranted. \nBut in the many ridiculous cases where no such wrongdoing occurs, the \nvolunteer will not face a lawsuit or financial ruin. We want to \nencourage people to get involved without the fear of losing their home \nand all the family assets in a lawsuit if an act happens.\n  Persons injured by a volunteer's simple negligence will still be able \nto bring suit against the organization itself to compensate for their \ninjuries. As a result, nonprofit organizations will continue to have \nthe duty to properly screen, train, and supervise their volunteers. \nNothing in this bill encourages carelessness on anyone's part.\n  The bill requires clear and convincing evidence of gross negligence \nbefore\n\n[[Page S3748]]\n\npunitive damages may be awarded against a volunteer, nonprofit \norganization, or governmental entity because of a volunteer's actions. \nBecause punitive damages are intended to punish and deter misconduct, a \nhigher standard is required to trigger those damages. Punitive damages \nwill only be available where the defendant's conduct merits punishment.\n  This bill also establishes a rule of proportionate liability rather \nthan joint and several liability in suits based on the action of a \nvolunteer. For noneconomic losses, the volunteer, the organization, and \nothers who may be at fault in a given action will be responsible for \npaying only for their portion of the harm. Any defendant will continue \nto be jointly and severally liable for economic loss.\n  We have seen a problem with joint and several liability in which one \ndefendant is made to pay for all damages even though responsible for \nonly a small portion. Such results are a severe burden on the United \nWay, the national organization sponsoring numerous local nonprofits. \nAlthough it cannot control local operations, the United Way often must \ndefend itself in suits arising from injuries caused by the local \nentity.\n  These holdings result from juries' desires to find someone with funds \nto pay for an innocent party's injury but the search for deep pockets \nproduces what a Red Cross spokesperson calls ``a chilling effect'' on \nRed Cross relations with other nonprofits. The Red Cross is now less \nwilling to cooperate with smaller more innovative local agencies that \nmight make it more effective.\n  So, on the issue of joint and several liability, the bill promotes a \nbalance between ensuring full compensation for economic losses, \nincluding medical expenses, lost earnings, placement services, and out-\nof-pocket expenses, among others, and ensuring fairness in not holding \nvolunteers, nonprofit organizations, and government entities \nresponsible for noneconomic harm they do not cause.\n  Mr. President, in putting this bill together, we were mindful of the \nconcerns about federalism. While the bill will generally preempt State \nlaw to the extent that it is inconsistent with the bill, the bill will \nnot preempt any State laws that provide additional protections from \nliability relating to volunteers, nonprofit organizations, and \ngovernment entities. This sets an outer limit of volunteer liability \nwhile permitting States to provide even greater protections.\n  We give States flexibility to impose conditions and make exceptions \nto the granting of liability protection. And we allow States to \naffirmatively opt out of this law for those cases where both the \nplaintiff and the defendant are citizens of that State.\n  Mr. President, the independent sector reports that the percentage of \nAmerican volunteering dropped from 54 percent in 1989 to 48 percent in \n1993. That, I might add, represents thousands upon thousands of \nvolunteers. Obviously, there are a number of relevant factors \nexplaining this decline. But one major reason is America's litigation \nexplosion.\n  Nonprofits must spend an increasing amount of time and resources \npreparing for, avoiding, and/or fighting lawsuits. Litigation renders \nthem less effective at helping people, and it scares off the volunteers \nwhich they rely on.\n  Mr. President, in closing, let me just once again remind my \ncolleagues of the historic summit that occurred in Philadelphia \nyesterday. That summit was designed to remind Americans of something \nthat is so very much unique to our Nation. The world has long studied \nand wondered and marveled at the American volunteer.\n  I was fortunate to be the Director of the United States Peace Corps, \nwhich has sent about 150,000 volunteers into over 100 countries over \nthe last 35-plus years. So I have had a chance to look right in the eye \nat this unique quality of the American spirit and can attest to it, and \nadmire it.\n  Your work is not finished when you leave the country that you have \nserved. When you return to the United States the third goal begins--\nhelping to make America understand the world. To do that we call on the \nvolunteers to step forward again, again, and again.\n  The United States should do everything within its power to nurture \nthis unique treasure and to make it grow. It is infectious, and it is \nwonderfully healing.\n  On my trip from the airport to the Senate Chamber, I was advised that \nthis legislation has been caught in a leveraging dispute, and it is a \ndispute in which I participated--the Executive order proposed by the \nadministration to very much narrow those eligible for Federal contract \nwork. That dispute will go on for some time, but I cannot think of a \nworse piece of legislation to be dragged into the dispute. It should \nnot be ensnarled. It should become another demonstration of what \nRepublican and Democrat Presidents said to the Nation in Philadelphia \nyesterday. I hope the other side would think very carefully about \ndrawing the Volunteer Protection Act, which is an extension of efforts \nto strengthen the American volunteer, into that dispute.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/28/senate-section/article/S3744-5", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3748]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

(ii) \n    the United States understands that the maintenance of national \n    restrictions on trade in chemicals and chemical production \n    technology is fully compatible with the provisions of the \n    Convention, including Article XI(2), and solely within the \n    sovereign jurisdiction of the United States; (iii) the convention \n    preserves the right of State Parties, unilaterally or collectively, \n    to maintain or impose export controls on chemicals and related \n    chemical production technology for foreign policy or national \n    security reasons, notwithstanding Article XI(2); and (iv) each \n    Australia Group member, at the highest diplomatic levels, has \n    officially communicated to the United States Government its \n    understanding and agreement that export control and \n    nonproliferation measures which the Australia Group has undertaken \n    are fully compatible with the provisions of the Convention, \n    including Article XI(2), and its commitment to maintain in the \n    future such export controls and nonproliferation measures against \n    non-Australia Group members.\n  --In connection with Condition (9), Protection of Advanced \n    Biotechnology, the legitimate commercial activities and interests \n    of chemical, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical firms in the United \n    States are not being significantly harmed by the limitations of the \n    Convention on access to, and production of, those chemicals and \n    toxins listed in Schedule 1 of the Annex on chemicals.\n  --In connection with Condition (15), Assistance Under Article X, the \n    United States shall not provide assistance under paragraph 7(a) of \n    Article X, and, for any State Party the government of which is not \n    eligible for assistance under chapter 2 of part II (relating to \n    military assistance) or chapter 4 of part II (relating to economic \n    support assistance) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961: (i) no \n    assistance under paragraph 7(b) of Article X will be provided to \n    the State Party;

(ii) consensual peacekeeping \n    operations when the use of force is authorized by the receiving \n    state, including operations pursuant to Chapter VI of the United \n    Nations Charter; and (iii) peacekeeping operations when force is \n    authorized by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the United \n    Nations Charter.\n  --In connection with Condition (27), Chemical Weapons Destruction, \n    all the following conditions are satisfied: (A) I have agreed to \n    explore alternative technologies for the destruction of the United \n    States stockpile of chemical weapons in order to ensure that the \n    United States has the safest, most effective and environmentally \n    sound plans and programs for meeting its obligations under the \n    convention for the destruction of chemical weapons; (B) the \n    requirement in section 1412 of Public Law 99-145 (50 U.S.C. 1521) \n    for completion of the destruction of the United States stockpile of \n    chemical weapons by December 31, 2004, will be superseded upon the \n    date the Convention enters into force with respect to the United \n    States by the deadline required by the Convention of April 29, \n    2007;

Mr. President, in my State of Alaska the University of \nAlaska is the oldest post-secondary school. The university was \nchartered prior to statehood and has played a vital role in educating \nAlaskans as well as students from around the world. The expertise of \nthe university has been in many areas, mining, agriculture, arctic and \nsubarctic sciences.\n  Additionally, the university has served as an important cornerstone \nin the history of our State. For example, the university housed the \nAlaska Constitutional Convention where the fathers of our statehood act \ncarved out the rights and privileges guaranteed to Alaskan citizens. \nFurther, Mr. President, the university is proud of the fact that it \nbegan life as the Alaska Agricultural and Mining College. However, Mr. \nPresident, what makes the University of Alaska unique is the fact that \nit is the only land-grant college in the Nation that is virtually \nlandless today.\n  As some of my colleagues know, one of the oldest and most respected \nways of financing America's educational system has been from the land-\ngrant system. This was established in 1785 and the practice gives land \nto schools and universities for their use in supporting their \neducational endeavors. in 1862, Congress passed what was then known as \nthe Morrill Act, which created the land-grant colleges and universities \nas a way to underwrite the cost of higher education to more and more of \nAmerica's young people. These colleges and universities received land \nfrom the Federal Government for facility location, and more importantly \nas a way to provide for sustaining revenues to those educational \ninstitutions.\n  Mr. President, the University of Alaska received the smallest amount \nof land of any State, with the exception of Delaware that has a land-\ngrant college. Delaware received about 90,000 acres. Even the land-\ngrant college in Rhode Island received more land from the Federal \nGovernment than has the University of Alaska. Rhode Island received \n120,000 acres.\n  In a State the size of Alaska, about 365 million acres, we should \nlogically have one of the best and most fully\n\n[[Page S3751]]\n\nfunded land-grant colleges in the country. Yet, to date, the University \nof Alaska only has about 111,000 acres. Unfortunately, without the land \npromised to Alaska under the land-grant allocation system in earlier \nlegislation, the university is unable to share as one of the premier \nland-grant colleges in this country.\n  Previous efforts were made in Congress to fix this problem. These \nefforts date back to 1915, less than 50 years after the passage of the \nMorrill Act, when Alaska's delegate to Congress, Delegate James \nWickersham shepherded a measure through Congress that set aside \npotentially more than a quarter of a million acres in the Tanana Valley \noutside Fairbanks for the support of an agriculture college and school \nof mines.\n  Following the practice established in the lower 48 States for the \nother land-grant colleges, Wickersham's bill set aside every section 33 \nof the unsurveyed Tanana Valley for the Alaska Agriculture College and \nSchools of Mines.\n  Alaska's educational future at that time looked favorable. Many \nAlaskans saw the opportunity to set up an endowment system similar to \nthat set up by the University of Washington in the downtown center of \nSeattle, WA, where valuable university lands are leased providing \nfunding for the university's maintenance and upkeep as well as some \ncapital projects.\n  However, in Alaska's case, before the land could be transferred to \nthe Alaska Agricultural College and School of Mines, renamed the \nUniversity of Alaska in 1935, the land had to be surveyed in order to \nestablish the exact acreage included in the reserve lands.\n  The section reserved for education could not be transferred to the \ncollege until they had been delineated. According to records at the \ntime, it was unlikely given the incredibly slow speed of surveying that \nthe land could be completely surveyed before the end of the current \ncentury. Surveying is still an extraordinarily slow process in Alaska's \nremote and unpopulated terrain.\n\n  In all, only 19 section 33's, or approximately 11,211 acres, were \never transferred to the University of Alaska. Of this, 2,250 acres were \nused for the original campus, and the remainder was left to the \ndiscretion of the board of regents to support educational programs and \nfacilities.\n  Recognizing the difficulties of surveying in Alaska, subsequent \nlegislation was passed in 1929 that simply granted land for the benefit \nof the university. This grant totaled approximately 100,000 acres, and \nto this day comprises the bulk of the university's total 111,211 acres \nof land--less than one-third of what was originally promised. In 1958, \nthe Alaska Statehood Act was passed which extinguished the unfulfilled \nland grants. The university was thus left with little land with which \nto support itself and is thus unable to completely fulfill its mission \nas a land-grant college.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today would redeem \nthe promises made to the university in 1915 and put the university on \nan even footing with other land-grant colleges in the United States. It \nprovides the university with the land needed to support itself \nfinancially and it offers the chance to grow and continue to act as a \nresponsible steward of the land and educator of young Alaskans. It also \nprovides a concrete timetable under which the university must select \nits land and the Secretary of Interior must act upon those selections.\n  This legislation also contains significant restrictions on the land \nthat the university can select. The university cannot select land \nlocated within a conservation system unit, land validly conveyed to the \nState or an ANCSA corporation or land used in connection with Federal \nor military institutions.\n  Accordingly, Mr. President, under my bill, the university must \nrelinquish extremely valuable inholdings in Alaska once it receives its \nsecond-tier State/Federal grant under section 6, of this bill. \nTherefore, the result of this legislation will mean, specifically, \nrelinquishment of prime university inholdings in such magnificent areas \nas the Alaska Peninsula and Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, the \nKenai Fjords National Park, Wrangell St. Elias National Park and \nPreserve and Denali Park and Preserve. Mr. President, not only does \nthis bill uphold a decades-old promise to the University of Alaska, it \nfurther protects Alaska's unique parks and refuges.\n  Recognize, Mr. President, my bill requires the State to participate \nin the process, as well, under an option. Specifically, the bill would \ngrant the university 250,000 acres of Federal land. The university \nwould be eligible to receive another 250,000 acres of Federal land on a \nmatching basis with the State, for a total of 500,000 additional acres. \nThis would be at the option of the legislature, the Governor, and the \nuniversity's board of regents\n  Mr. President, the State matching provision is an important component \nof this legislation. Most agree with the premise that the university \nwas shorted land. However, some believe it is the sole responsibility \nof the Federal Government to compensate the university with land, while \nothers believe it is solely the responsibility of the State to grant \nthe university land. The legislation I am introducing today offers a \ncompromise, a compromise giving both the State and the Federal \nGovernment the opportunity to contribute, as well as provide the \nGovernment with valuable inholdings in Federal parks and preserves.\n  With the passage of this bill, Mr. President, the University of \nAlaska will finally be able to act fully as a land grant college, and \nwill be able to select lands that can provide the university with \nstable revenue sources, as well as provide responsible stewardship for \nthe lands.\n  This is an exciting time for the University of Alaska. The promises \nthat were made 82 years ago could be fulfilled with this legislation, \nand Alaskans could look forward to a very bright future for the \nuniversity and the many Alaskans who receive an education there.\n  I ask unanimous consent, at this time, to have printed in the Record \nthe proposed inholdings that the University has which would be deeded \nover to the Federal Government under this legislation, a history of the \nuniversity of Alaska's land grant from the time we were designated as a \nterritory, land grant rankings of all the States, as well as a copy of \nthe bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 660\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the University of Alaska is the successor to and the \n     beneficiary of all Federal grants and conveyances to or for \n     the Alaska Agricultural College and School of Mines;\n       (2) under the Acts of March 4, 1915, 38 Stat. 1214, and \n     January 21, 1929, 45 Stat. 1091, the United States granted to \n     the Territory of Alaska certain federal land for the \n     University of Alaska;\n       (3) the Territory was unable to receive most of the land \n     intended to be conveyed by the Act of March 4, 1915, before \n     repeal of that Act by Sec. 6(k) of the Alaska Statehood Act \n     (P.L. 85-508, 72 Stat. 339);\n       (4) only one other state land grant college in the United \n     States has obtained a smaller land grant from the federal \n     government than the University of Alaska has received, and \n     all land grand colleges in the western states of the United \n     States have obtained substantially larger land grants than \n     the University of Alaska;\n       (5) an academically strong and financially secure state \n     university system is a cornerstone to the long-term \n     development of a stable population and to a healthy, diverse \n     economy and is in the national interest;\n       (6) the national interest is served by transferring certain \n     federal lands to the University of Alaska which will be able \n     to use and develop the resources of such lands and by \n     returning certain lands held by the University of Alaska \n     located within certain federal conservation system units to \n     federal ownership;\n       (7) the University of Alaska holds valid legal title to and \n     is responsible for management of lands transferred by the \n     United States to the Territory and State of Alaska for the \n     University and that an exchange of lands is consistent with \n     and in furtherance of the purposes and terms of, and thus not \n     in violation of, the Federal grant of such lands.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this act are--\n       (1) to fulfill the original commitment of Congress to \n     establish the University of Alaska as a land grant university \n     with holdings sufficient to facilitate operation and \n     maintenance of a university system for the inhabitants of the \n     State of Alaska; and\n       (2) to acquire from the University of Alaska lands it holds \n     within federal Parks, Wildlife Refuges, and Wilderness areas.\n\n     SEC. 2. PRIMARY FEDERAL GRANT.\n\n       (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, but subject \n     to valid existing rights and\n\n[[Page S3752]]\n\n     the procedures set forth herein, the University is granted \n     and entitled to take up to 250,000 acres of federal lands (or \n     reserved interests in lands) in or adjacent to Alaska as a \n     federal grant. The University may identify and select the \n     specific lands it intends to take pursuant to this grant, and \n     the Secretary of the Interior (``Secretary'') shall promptly \n     convey to the University the lands selected, in accordance \n     with the provisions of this Act.\n       (b)(1) Within 48 months of enactment of this Act, the \n     University of Alaska may submit to the Secretary a list of \n     properties the University has tentatively selected to receive \n     under the conditions of this grant. Such list may be \n     submitted in whole or in part during this period and the \n     University may make interim tentative selections that it may \n     relinquish or change within the 48 month period. The \n     University may submit tentative selections that exceed the \n     amount of the grant except that such selections shall not \n     exceed 275,000 acres at any one time.\n       (2) All selections shall be in reasonably compact units: \n     Provided, That the University may select small tracts of \n     federal land within federal reservations consistent with the \n     limitations in subsection (c) below.\n       (3) The University may submit tentative selections of \n     federal lands validly selected but not conveyed to the State \n     of Alaska or the corporations organized pursuant to the \n     Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act: Provided, That such \n     lands may not be approved or conveyed to the University \n     unless the State of Alaska and or the corporation has \n     relinquished its prior selection.\n       (4) The University shall make no selections within \n     Conservation System Units as defined in the Alaska National \n     Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 3101).\n       (5) Within forty-five (45) days of receipt of a University \n     tentative selection, the Secretary shall publish notice of \n     said selection in the Federal Register. Such notice shall \n     identify lands included in the tentative selection and \n     provide for a period for public comment on the tentative \n     selection not to exceed sixty (60) days.\n       (6) Within six months of the receipt of a University \n     tentative selection, the Secretary shall notify the \n     University of his acceptance or objection to each tentative \n     selection, including the reasons for any objection. Failure \n     to object within six months shall constitute approval by the \n     Secretary. Any public comments submitted in response to a \n     public notice issued pursuant to paragraph (5) above may be \n     considered by the Secretary: Provided, That the Secretary may \n     object to tentative selections of the University if and only \n     if he demonstrates that a conveyance of such to the \n     University--\n       (A) will have a significant adverse impact on the purposes \n     for which a Conservation System Unit was established; or\n       (B) will have a significant adverse impact on fulfillment \n     of the Alaska Statehood Act or the Alaska Native Claims \n     Settlement Act. (43 U.S.C. 1601)\n       (7) The Secretary's acceptance of, or objection to, any \n     tentative selections submitted by the University of Alaska \n     pursuant to Section 2 of this Act or the conveyance of any \n     such selections by tentative approval, patent or other \n     instrument are not major federal actions within the means of \n     section 102 (2)(c) of P.L. 91-190.\n       (8) The Secretary shall publish notice of any decision to \n     accept or object to a tentative selection in the Federal \n     Register.\n       (c) The Secretary shall not approve or convey, under this \n     grant,\n       (1) any federal lands which, at the time of enactment of \n     this Act, are included in a Conservation System Unit;\n       (2) any federal lands validly selected or top filed \n     pursuant to Sec. 906(e) of Public Law No. 96-487 but not \n     conveyed to the State of Alaska or the corporations pursuant \n     to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act; or\n       (3) any federal lands withdrawn and actually used in \n     connection with the administration of any federal \n     installations and military reservations unless the head of \n     the land holding or occupying agency or entity agrees.\n       (d) If, following the Secretary's review of tentative \n     selections by the University, the amount of acreage approved \n     by the Secretary for conveyance is less than the full primary \n     grant, the University may select additional lands to satisfy \n     the primary grant.\n       (e) Upon the University's tentative selection of land--\n       (1) Such land shall be segregated and unavailable for \n     selection by and conveyance to the State of Alaska or any \n     corporation organized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims \n     Settlement Act and shall not be otherwise encumbered or \n     disposed of by the United States pending completion of the \n     selection process.\n       (2) The University shall possess the non-exclusive right to \n     enter onto such lands for the purpose of--\n       (A) assessing the oil, gas, mineral and other resource \n     potential therein. The University, and its delegatees or \n     agents, shall be permitted to engage in assessment techniques \n     including but not limited to core drilling to assess the \n     metalliferous or other values, and surface geological \n     exploration and seismic exploration for oil and gas: \n     Provided That this paragraph shall not be construed as \n     including or allowing exploratory drilling of oil and gas \n     wells; and\n       (B) exercising due diligence regarding the making of a \n     final selection.\n       (f) Within one year of the Secretary's approval of a \n     tentative selection, the University may make therefrom a \n     final selection pursuant to this Act. Within six months of \n     such final selection by the University, the Secretary shall \n     issue a tentative approval of such final selection. Such \n     tentative approval shall be deemed to transfer to the \n     University all right, title, and interest of the United \n     States in and to the described selection. Any lakes, rivers \n     and streams contained within such selections shall be \n     meandered and lands submerged thereunder conveyed in \n     accordance with 43 U.S.C. Sec. 1631, as amended. Upon \n     completion of a survey of lands included within such \n     tentative approval, the Secretary shall promptly issue patent \n     to such lands. Pending issuance of a patent, the University \n     shall have rights and authorities over tentatively approved \n     lands consistent with those under the Alaska Statehood Act \n     and the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, including the \n     right to transfer, assign, exchange, grant, deed, lease or \n     otherwise convey any or all present or future interest in the \n     lands granted pursuant to this Act.\n       (g) The Secretary of Agriculture, as well as the heads of \n     other federal agencies, shall take such actions as may be \n     necessary to facilitate and expedite the implementation of \n     this Act by the Secretary of the Interior.\n\n     SEC. 3. RELINQUISHMENT OF CERTAIN UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA \n                   HOLDINGS.\n\n       (a) As a condition to receiving the land grant provided by \n     Section 6 of this Act, the University of Alaska shall convey \n     to the Secretary those lands listed in ``The University of \n     Alaska's Inholding Reconveyance Document'' and dated April \n     24, 1997.\n       (b) The University shall begin conveyance of the lands \n     listed in (a) above upon taking title to lands it has \n     selected pursuant to section 6 of this Act and shall convey \n     to the Secretary a percentage amount of land proportional to \n     that which it has received, but in no event shall it be \n     required to convey any lands other than those listed in (a) \n     above to the Secretary. The Secretary shall accept quitclaim \n     deeds from the University for these lands.\n\n     SEC. 4. ALIENATION OF LANDS.\n\n       Nothwithstanding any other provision of law, the University \n     of Alaska may transfer, assign, exchange, grant, deed, lease \n     or otherwise convey any or all present future interests in \n     the lands granted pursuant to this Act.\n\n     SEC. 5. JUDICIAL REVIEW.\n\n       The University of Alaska has the right to bring action for, \n     including but not limited to, relief in the nature of \n     mandamus, against the Secretary for violation of this Act or \n     for review of an agency decision under this Act. Such an \n     action can only be brought in the United States District \n     Court for the District of Alaska and within two (2) years of \n     the alleged violation or the final decision-making. For all \n     other entities or persons, decisions of the Secretary shall \n     be final and conclusive.\n\n     SEC. 6. STATE MATCHING GRANT.\n\n       (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, but subject \n     to valid existing rights and the procedures set forth in this \n     Act, the University is granted and shall be entitled to take, \n     in addition to the primary grant provided for in Section 2 \n     herein, up to another 250,000 acres in federal lands (or \n     reserved interests in lands) in or adjacent to Alaska: \n     Provided That any additional acres are granted, as specified \n     below, on a matching acre-for-acre basis to the extent that \n     the State of Alaska shall first grant to the University \n     State-owned land in Alaska.\n       (b) The university may select and the Secretary shall \n     convey lands which the University is entitled to receive \n     pursuant to this State Matching Grant Provisions in minimum \n     increments of 25,000 acres up to the maximum of 250,000 \n     acres.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             History of the University of Alaska Land Grant\n\n       1785--The Ordinance of 1785 established the rectangular \n     survey of New England as the basis of which all land west of \n     Ohio would be subdivided. Land was surveyed into townships \n     composed of 36 sections of 640 acres or one square mile each. \n     The law also established the principle of reserving section \n     16 of every township ``for the maintenance of public \n     schools.''\n       1848--With the Admission of Oregon in 1848, the grant \n     doubled from one section to two sections (16 & 36). Three of \n     the last four states admitted into the union, UT, NM, and AZ \n     each got four sections (2, 16, 32, and 36).\n       1842--The Morrill Act passed which dedicated lands to \n     states for ``agriculture and mechanic arts''. The grants were \n     based on population as measured by the size of the delegation \n     with each state receiving approximately 30,000 acres/member.\n       1915--Alaska Delegate James Wickersham pushed through a \n     measure in Congress which reserved lands for a common school \n     system and an agricultural land grant college in the Tanana \n     Valley. The bill followed the pattern of reserving 2 sections \n     of every township for support of ``common schools.'' (About \n     20 million acres in AK). Wickersham's bill also set aside \n     every section 33 in the Tanana Valley for support of an \n     agricultural college and school of mines. (Approx. 250,000 \n     acres).\n       1916--Wickersham introduces first statehood bill \n     ``Granting'' 11.3 million acres for higher education and 20 \n     million acres for public schools.\n       1917--Alaska territorial legislature formally incorporates \n     the Alaska Agricultural College and School of Mines (Renamed \n     UA in 1935) as Alaska's land grant institution.\n       Up to this point no land had every been transferred to \n     University due to fact that all bills required a survey to \n     occur before transfer and AK had never been surveyed.\n\n[[Page S3753]]\n\n       By the time federal grant would be revoked only 19 section \n     33's out of a possible 420 had been surveyed and transferred \n     to the University. Ultimately the University received 11,211 \n     acres of section 33's of which 2,250 were he original campus.\n       1929--Congress passes act ``Granting'' 100,000 acres for \n     the ``exclusive use an benefit'' of the Alaska Agriculture \n     College and School of Mines making up the bulk of the \n     University's approx. 111,000 acres.\n       1936 to 1943--During the 74th, 75th, 76th, 77th, and 78th \n     Congress Alaska Delegate Anthony J. Dimond Introduced five \n     identical bills to extend the 1915 land grant to all section \n     33's, not just those in the Tanana Valley, for a total land \n     grant of approx. 10 million acres.\n       1943--Bartlett introduces statehood bill reserving two \n     sections of each township (20m acres) for support of schools \n     and 1 section of every township (10m acres) for higher \n     education. For the most part this formula existed in all \n     statehood bills through 1949. (Exception is a compromise bill \n     between Bartlett and then-Secretary Gardner during mid 40's \n     which never went anywhere).\n       1950--Since Alaska could not receive title to a specific \n     section of land until it was surveyed in 1950 Congress \n     rejected ``in place grants'' of specific sections of \n     townships and endorsed the concept of ``quantity'' grants. \n     This concept was incorporated in all future statehood bills.\n       All statehood bills during the 50's supported around 103.3 \n     million acres for the state with a typical breakdown as \n     follows:\n       100m acres--general grant;\n       .8m--community development grants to be used for expansion \n     of communities; and\n       3.25m--for ``internal improvements as follows\n       500,000 acres--university;\n       500,000 acres--teacher's college;\n       500,000 acres--public buildings;\n       200,000 acres--schools and asylums (deaf, dumb, and blind);\n       200,000 acres--penitentiaries;\n       200,000 acres--mental institutions;\n       200,000 acres--charitable, penal, and reform institutions; \n     and\n       250,000 acres--pioneer homes.\n       1954--UA President Ernest Patty made several requests to \n     DOI for more land including lands in the NPR-A.\n       1955--University Board Of Regents passes resolution asking \n     Congress to give University authority to select up to 500,000 \n     acres with mineral rights.\n       1958--With the passage of Statehood the ``internal \n     improvement grants''--including the University's 500,000 \n     acres and the 500,000 acres for the University's teacher \n     training programs were consolidated into the 100 million-acre \n     general grant leaving disposition of all 102,550,500 acres at \n     the discretion of the legislature. Statehood also canceled \n     the 1915 education reserve (though it did confirm the \n     University's rights to the few thousand acres of section 33 \n     land that were already reserved and surveyed).\n       Passage of the Statehood bill virtually ended all \n     discussion of federal land grants.\n       1959--University attorney, Ed Merdes, wrote Senator \n     Bartlett about impact of Statehood bill on Tanana selections. \n     After extensive research a legislative aide, Joe Josephson \n     wrote Merdes back and said unequivocally that Congressional \n     intent in the statehood bill was for the new state government \n     to address University land grant;\n       ``The theory of the land-grant provisions in the statehood \n     act was they would replace inter alia (among other things) \n     the reservations authorized in 48 U.S.C. 353 and that the \n     state university would petition the sate government to \n     satisfy the needs of the University which previously to \n     statehood were met in part by 48 U.S.C. 353.'' (Josephson to \n     Merdes, 10 November 1959, Pres Papers)\n       1959--House Bill No. 176. Of the New Legislature declared \n     the intent to reserve one million acres for the university \n     and declared the legislature's ultimate attempt to reserve 5 \n     million acres ``for the purpose of replacing those grants \n     previously allowed under federal law . . . which has been \n     superseded . . . and for the further purpose of establishing \n     a means by which the University may be properly maintained \n     and operated and direct state support thereby reduced.''\n       To much surprise Governor Egan vetoed the bill. His main \n     reason was that this could lead to further earmarking of \n     state land and dollars for other ``internal improvements'' \n     and that this was not sound administrative procedure. Egan \n     suggested it was much more prudent to appropriate and bond \n     for the University.\n       1960's--With Governor Egan's opposition to the State grant \n     future bills never received much support in the legislature. \n     With the defeat of Egan in 1966 by Walter Hickel, Hickel \n     promised a new era of Alaska economic development and support \n     for the University. Yet one month later Secretary Udall \n     declared a land freeze in Alaska that virtually brought all \n     state land selections to a halt, and consequently froze the \n     University land grant as well.\n       1970's--Legally and politically the Alaska land picture \n     grew more complex year-by-year. Within the next 15 years the \n     open public doman in AK would essentially vanish, as the \n     entire state was parceled off among development interests, \n     environmental interests, and native groups with the passage \n     of ANCSA in 1971, construction of TAPS in 74-77, and passage \n     of ANILCA in 1980.\n       1995--After passing the legislature Governor Knowles vetoed \n     a SB 16 granting the University 350,000 acres of state lands. \n     The Governor declared his support for the concept but wanted \n     assurances that: (1) the University would not select any \n     lands needed by growing communities; (2) oil found on ``new'' \n     university lands were subject to permanent fund requirements \n     and royalties and bonus payments to the state; and (3) that \n     all environmental and mineral entry laws would apply.\n       1996--FHM bill introduced in Senate setting up a matching \n     grant provision.\n       1996--A new bill, SB 250, passed the legislature by a 46-12 \n     vote and was again vetoed by Governor Knowles for many of the \n     same reasons stated in the first veto.\n                                  ____\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n         Region and area             UA ID number       Acres                   Federal land type\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSouth Central:\n    Alaska Peninsula............

A bill to provide an administrative process for obtaining a \nwaiver of the coastwise trade laws for certain vessels; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n               coastwise trade vessel waivers legislation\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that would \nprovide an administrative process for obtaining a waiver of the \ncoastwise trade laws to allow certain vessels to commercially operate \nin the coastwise trade. This legislation will improve the \nresponsiveness of the Federal Government in meeting the needs of many \nvessel-operating small businesses.\n  The coastwise trade laws require that vessels operating between U.S. \nports be built and documented in the United States and owned and \noperated by U.S. citizens. Today, if a U.S. citizen owner of a foreign-\nbuilt vessel wants to carry passengers for hire on that vessel in the \ncoastwise trade of the United States, that person must obtain a \nlegislative waiver of the coastwise laws.\n  Many of my colleagues are familiar with these private relief bills. \nThe legislative process for consolidating these numerous House and \nSenate bills usually involves including them in the Coast Guard \nauthorization bill for final passage.\n  While some Members may value the current process as a useful \nconstituent service, it often delays resolution of a constituent's \nrequest by a year or more, causing financial hardship for the \nconstituent's business. The potential influence of campaign \ncontributions on such private relief bills is also a concern. The \nlegislative process is slow, inefficient, and potentially unfair. Our \nconstituents would be better served by delegating this waiver authority \nfor noncontroversial requests to an appropriate administrative agency.\n  My bill would authorize the Secretary of Transportation to \nadministratively waive certain coastwise trade restrictions for vessels \nthat meet the following criteria, which the Commerce Committee \ncurrently uses to determine if a waiver is warranted:\n  First, this waiver authority would apply to foreign-built vessels of \nat least 3 years of age, and U.S.-built vessels that were rebuilt in \nforeign countries at least 3 years prior to the effective date of the \nwaiver. The vast majority of the waiver requests considered by the \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation Committee in the past 3 years \nwere for vessels of at least this age that had originally been used for \nrecreational or other noncoastwise purposes.\n  Second, this bill would limit the coastwise trade use of vessels \nobtaining such privileges through this process to service carrying a \nmaximum of 12 passengers for hire. Again, the vast majority of waiver \nrequests considered by the Commerce Committee specified this type of \nintended use.\n  Finally, the Secretary would be required to make a determination that \nthe use of the applicant's vessel in the coastwise trade would not \nadversely affect U.S.-vessel builders or the coastwise trade business \nof any person who employs U.S.-built vessels in the same trade. An \nexemption granted under this authority could be revoked if the vessel \nuse substantially changes so as to cause such problems.\n  Mr. President, during the 104th Congress, 73 of the 119 bills \nconsidered by the Commerce Committee were requests for waiver of the \ncoastwise trade laws for special vessels. If my bill is enacted, only a \nfew waiver requests falling outside the above criteria would need to be \nconsidered by the Commerce Committee each year, allowing the\n\n[[Page S3755]]\n\nCommittee to focus its attention on more weighty matters.\n  This bill would not authorize exemption from existing U.S. citizen \nownership and crewing requirements. Also, this bill would not apply to \nvessels used for any purpose other than the carriage of a maximum of 12 \npassengers for hire. My approach to these waivers is supported by the \nPassenger Vessel Association, National Association of Charterboat \nOperators, the Offshore Marine Services Association, the Committee for \nPrivate Offshore Rescue and Towing, and the Shipbuilders Council of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support from \nthese organizations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 Passenger Vessel Association,\n\n                                    Arlington, VA, March 10, 1997.\n     Mr. Jim Sartucci,\n     Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Sartucci, in response to your earlier \n     communication regarding Chairman McCain's interest in \n     developing a new process for evaluating proposed waivers from \n     the U.S.-build requirement of the Jones Act or the Passenger \n     Service Act, the Passenger Vessel Association will not object \n     to a proposal which:\n       Clearly states the vessels in question are limited to those \n     certified to carry 12 or fewer passengers; shifts the burden \n     of proving ``no competitive impact'' to the waiver applicant; \n     provides that the Maritime Administration (MARAD) shall \n     review the waiver if the vessel for which it was granted is \n     relocated and, if MARAD determines that the vessel in its new \n     location poses a competitive disadvantage to an existing \n     operator, shall revoke the waiver; requires the Maritime \n     Administration to devise a means of widely informing the \n     passenger vessel industry about waiver requests that is \n     separate from a simple Federal Register notice; includes a \n     statement to the effect that the change does not reflect the \n     committee's view on the overall integrity of the Jones Act or \n     the Passenger Service Act.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to evaluate and comment on \n     this proposed change to the law. If you have any questions, \n     please do not hesitate to let me know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              John R. Groundwater,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                        Charterboat Operators,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 20, 1997.\n     Chairman John McCain,\n     Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman McCain: I am writing you in support of the \n     proposed legislative language for documentation of small \n     passenger vessels on behalf of the National Association of \n     Charterboat Operators (NACO), a 4,100 member association \n     representing owners the charter industry. NACO appreciates \n     the opportunity to comment on the proposed legislation.\n       NACO applauds the Committee for understanding and \n     attempting to correct certain laws governing coastwise trade \n     for vessels. These laws often times produce consequences that \n     very significantly depending on the size and the nature of \n     business of the vessel. NACO is hopeful that this is the \n     first step by the Committee in recognizing that small vessels \n     are consistently and inappropriately grouped with large \n     vessels under the same rules and regulations. As you are \n     aware, this leads to increased regulatory costs and burdens \n     for these small businesses.\n       This proposed change to title 46 of the U.S. Code will \n     alleviate undue and costly burdens currently placed on small \n     passenger vessels who do not have the manpower or the \n     resources to go through the long and difficult documentation \n     process. This will help to ease these burdens, saving each \n     company time and money.\n       By creating specific qualifications for documentation, the \n     Committee creates standards for documentation for small \n     passenger vessels which will ease the burden of the Committee \n     from responding to each individual request for documentation \n     and appropriately moves this documentation responsibility to \n     the Department of Transportation while also giving them \n     flexibility in approving documentation.\n       Although NACO is in full agreement with the language, we \n     are concerned about sections (b)(2) and (c)(B) pertaining to \n     whether employment of the vessel adversely affects U.S. \n     vessel builders or operators of ships. NACO is concerned that \n     the criteria used in determining the adverse affects to \n     shipbuilders and operators in the same trade would be \n     arbitrary.\n       Again, NACO is in full support of this administrative \n     change to the Jones Act, however, at the same time, the \n     association believes that the Committee should move \n     cautiously when making any sort of revision to the Jones Act.\n       Thank you for you time and your attention to the need to \n     ease unfair burdens placed on small business.

We understand and respect \n     Chairman McCain's administrative objective and intention with \n     respect to this legislative initiative. Consequently, \n     speaking strictly for our constituency, OMSA has no absolute \n     objection to the proposal to grant restricted and conditional \n     coastwise trading privileges to certain small foreign built \n     vessels. In actual fact, however, our association's members \n     are not significantly affected, at least directly, by the \n     specific parameters included in this proposed legislation. \n     The PVA, and perhaps others, would appear to be the parties \n     to whom we would normally defer on the specifics of this \n     proposition.\n       As discussed, our own support is contingent upon retention \n     of the protective covenants and limitations set forth in the \n     proposal presented to us for consideration, viz. in (b)(1), \n     that the vessel be strictly limited to service as a small \n     passenger vessel or an uninspected passenger vessel as those \n     terms are defined in Section 2101 of title 46, United States \n     Code, and in (b)(2) and (c).\n       Finally, for the record, we ask that you please note that \n     OMSA does have some discomfort with the precedent that could \n     be set by this legislation. We harbor some concern it could \n     conceivably ``open the door'' to subsequent, additional \n     legislation that would, relatively speaking, more seriously \n     impact the coastwise trade protections afforded to U.S. flag \n     vessels under the Jones Act and the Passenger Vessel Services \n     Act. However, we accept, in good faith, the Chairman's stated \n     objectives and the collateral safeguards that are promised.\n       OMSA would agree that the U.S. Maritime Administration \n     (MARAD) could be the appropriate government agency within the \n     Department of Transportation to consider and approve \n     applications for the purposes of the proposal.\n       We thank you for keeping us advised of such proposals and \n     for inviting our views. Please do not hesitate to contact the \n     undersigned, at (504) 734-7622, if you have any questions or \n     wish to discuss this matter in further detail.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                 Robert J. Alario,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From the C-Port News, Mar. 1997]\n\n             Senate Committee Proposes Change to Jones Act\n\n       Congress will soon be proposing a major change to the Jones \n     Act that will allow marine assistance operators to use \n     foreign built vessels and vessels rebuilt outside the United \n     States in their businesses.\n       The bill, introduced by Senator John McCain (R-AZ), \n     Chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation \n     Committee, allows for the use of a foreign built or rebuilt \n     vessel in commercial coastwise trade when the vessel is over \n     3 years old and is used as a small or uninspected passenger \n     vessel. Marine assistance towing vessels are classified by \n     the Coast Guard as uninspected passenger vessels, not \n     uninspected towing vessels.\n       Although the bill will help the marine assistance industry, \n     it also contains two stipulations about which C-PORT is \n     concerned. The bill allows the Secretary of Transportation to \n     revoke the new documentation policy for foreign vessels if it \n     is found to adversely affect U.S. vessel builders or other \n     similar businesses using U.S. built vessels. According to the \n     bill, ``the Secretary of Transportation may issue a \n     certificate of documentation with appropriate endorsement for \n     employment in the coastwise trade as a small passenger vessel \n     or an uninspected passenger vessel for an eligible vessel if \n     the Secretary determines that the employment of the vessel . \n     . . will not adversely affect (1) United States vessel \n     builders; or (2) the coastwise trade business of any person \n     who employs vessels built in the United States in the \n     business.''\n       C-PORT sent the following letter to Chairman McCain to \n     express support for the bill, but also to voice concern over \n     these two stipulations:\n       ``Dear Chairman McCain: C-PORT applauds the Committee for \n     understanding and attempting to correct certain laws \n     governing coastwise trade for vessels. These laws often times \n     produce consequences that vary significantly depending on the \n     size and the nature of business of the vessel. C-PORT is \n     hopeful that this is the first step by the Committee in \n     recognizing that small vessels are consistently and \n     inappropriately grouped with large vessels under the same \n     rules and regulations. As you are aware, this leads to \n     increased regulatory costs and burdens for these small \n     businesses.\n       ``This proposed change to title 46 of the U.S. Code will \n     alleviate undue and costly burdens currently placed on small \n     vessels who do not have the manpower or the resources to go \n     through the long and difficult documentation process. This \n     will help to\n\n[[Page S3756]]\n\n     ease these burdens, saving each company time and money.\n       ``By creating specific qualifications for documentation, \n     the Committee creates standards for documentation for small \n     vessels which will ease the burden of the Committee from \n     responding to each individual request for documentation \n     and appropriately moves this documentation responsibility \n     to the Department of Transportation while also giving them \n     flexibility in approving documentation.\n       ``Although C-PORT is in full agreement with the language, \n     we are concerned about sections (b)(2) and (c)(B) pertaining \n     to whether employment of the vessel adversely affects U.S. \n     vessel builders or operators of ships. C-PORT is concerned \n     that the criteria used in determining the adverse affects to \n     shipbuilders and operators in the same trade would be \n     arbitrary.\n       ``Again, C-PORT is in full support of this administrative \n     change to the Jones Act, however, at the same time, the \n     association believes that the Committee should move \n     cautiously when making any sort of revision to the Jones Act.\n       ``Thank you for your time and your attention to the need to \n     ease unfair burdens placed on small business.''\n       C-PORT expects this legislation to easily pass the Senate \n     and the House.

SCA shares your basic \n     objective of reducing the paperwork burden on Committee \n     members and staff while in no way eroding or changing the \n     U.S.-build requirement or any other provisions of the Jones \n     Act.\n       SCA supports all of the suggested additions to Senator \n     McCain's bill included in a letter of February 25 sent to you \n     and Carl Bentzel by Rolf Marshall of the Maritime Cabotage \n     Task Force (MCTF). Most importantly, these recommended \n     changes will make it undeniably clear that by enacting this \n     bill Congress in no way lessens or modifies the protections \n     granted by cabotage statutes.\n       Therefore, SCA supports the February 19 draft of the Jones \n     Act waiver bill along with the recommended changes described \n     in the February 25 letter from the MCTF.\n       On behalf of the members of SCA I want to commend you for \n     your diligence in crafting a new Jones Act waiver process \n     that makes sense administratively while safeguarding the \n     Jones Act.\n           Cordially,\n                                                 Penny L.

Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 82d \nanniversary of the Armenian genocide. Each year we remember and honor \nthe victims and pay respect to the survivors we are blessed to have in \nour midst.\n  Approximately 1.5 million Armenians were killed under the Turkish \nOttoman Empire during a 28-year period which lasted from 1894 to 1921. \nApril 24, 1915, serves as a marking point for the government \norchestrated carnage that took place. On this date, over 5,000 \nArmenians were systematically hunted down and killed in Constantinople, \nincluding some 600 Armenian political and intellectual leaders.\n  History records that the world stood by, although it knew. Our \nAmbassador to the Ottoman Empire, Henry Morgenthau, telegraphed the \nfollowing message to the American Secretary of State on June 16, 1915: \n``Deportation of and excesses against peaceful Armenians is increasing \nand from harrowing reports of eyewitnesses it appears that a campaign \nof race extermination is in progress under the pretext of reprisal \nagainst rebellion.''\n  Not only did the world stand by while atrocities took place, but it \nalso refused to learn the awful lessons that were taught during this \nperiod. One leader who did acknowledge the Armenian genocide was \nWinston Churchill, who wrote the following in 1929:\n\n       In 1915, the Turkish Government began and carried out the \n     infamous general massacre and deportation of Armenians in \n     Asia Minor . . . the clearance of the race from Asia Minor \n     was about as complete as such an act, on a scale so great, \n     could be. There is no reasonable doubt that this crime was \n     planned and executed for political reasons.\n\n  But, for the most part, nations did not learn from history. The world \nlooked away and genocidal horrors revisited the planet.\n  Each year we vow that the incalculable horrors suffered by the \nArmenian people will not be in vain. That is surely the highest tribute \nwe can pay to the Armenian victims and a way in which the horror and \nbrutality of their deaths can be given redeeming meaning. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in remembering the Armenian genocide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/28/senate-section/article/S3757-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3757-S3758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO THE GORHAM HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION IN \n  THE ``WE THE PEOPLE . . . THE CITIZEN AND THE CONSTITUTION'' PROGRAM\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to 21 students from Gorham High School in Gorham, NH, who were \nrecently selected to compete in the national finals of the ``We the \nPeople\n. . . the Citizen and the Constitution'' program to be held April 26-28 \nin Washington, DC. These high school students competed on the State \nlevel on February 10 for the opportunity to represent New Hampshire at \nthe national competition, and will be among more than 1,200 students \nfrom 49 States and the District of Columbia to participate.\n  The distinguished members of the team representing New Hampshire are: \nDavid Arsenault, Jan Bindas-Tenney, Melissa Borowski, Alyssa Breton, \nMire Burrill, Kevin Carpenter, Todd Davis, Rebecca Evans, Brad Fillion, \nCindy Gibson, Patrick Gilligan, Sean Griffith, Reid Hartman, Sarah \nKing, Michelle Leveille, Monica McKenzie, Ashley Thompson, Michael \nToth, Julie Washburn, Tuuli Winter, and Melanie Wolf.\n  All 21 New Hampshire students will be tested on the Constitution and \nBill of Rights before simulated congressional committees to demonstrate \ntheir knowledge of constitutional principles and their relevance to \ncontemporary issues. The competition in Washington will consist of 2 \ndays of hearings; and the 10 finalists, with the highest scores, will \ncompete for the title of national winner on Capitol Hill in a \ncongressional hearing room.\n  Michael Brosnan, a teacher at Gorham High School, also deserves \nspecial recognition for helping these students prepare for the intense \nconstitutional testing. Raymond Kneeland the district coordinator of \nthe ``We the People . . . the Citizen and the Constitution'' program, \nHolly Belson, the State coordinator, and Howard Zibel, of the New \nHampshire Bar Association, all contributed a significant amount of time \nand effort to help the students reach the national finals. As a former \nteacher myself, I applaud all of them on their\n\n[[Page S3758]]\n\ncommitment to enriching the lives of these students.\n  The ``We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution'' program \nprovides an excellent opportunity for students to gain an informed \nperspective about the history and principles of our Nation's \nconstitutional government. I wish these young constitutional experts \nfrom Gorham High School and their teacher, Michael Brosnan, the best of \nluck in preparing for the April national finals. We are proud to have \nthem representing New Hampshire, and wish them luck as they prepare to \nbe America's leader in the 21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/28/senate-section/article/S3757-4", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3758-S3759]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  [At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.]\n\n                   TESTIMONY OF MAJ. MICHAEL DONNELLY\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, Maj. Michael Donnelly of Connecticut \nflew 44 missions for the Air Force during the Persian Gulf war. He is \nnow afflicted with a neuro-muscular disorder he suspects was caused by \nchemical exposure in the war. I had the pleasure of meeting with Major \nDonnelly last week after he testified before the Human Resources \nSubcommittee of the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight. \nHis testimony provided a special insight into the plight of some \nPersian Gulf war veterans who fell ill after returning home.\n  Mr. President, I ask that his testimony be printed in the Record.\n  The testimony follows:\n\n  Prepared Statement of Maj. Michael Donnelly, U.S. Air Force, Retired\n\n       Congressman Shays and members of this committee, I want to \n     thank you for giving me the opportunity to testify before you \n     today. My name is Major Michael Donnelly. I am not the enemy.\n       I was medically retired in October of 1996 after 15 years \n     and 1 month of service as a fighter pilot in the Air Force. \n     At the time Iraq invaded Kuwait, I was stationed at Hahn Air \n     Base in Germany flying F-16s. My unit, the 10 Tactical \n     Fighter Squadron, was attached to the 363rd Tactical Fighter \n     Wing and deployed to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates on \n     1 January 1991 in support of Operation Desert Shield and then \n     Desert Storm. My unit redeployed to Germany on the 15th of \n     May 1991.\n       During the war, I flew 44 combat missions. On those \n     missions I bombed a variety of targets, including strategic \n     targets (airfields, production and storage facilities, \n     missile sites, etc.), tactical targets (troops, battlefield \n     equipment, pontoon bridges, etc.). I also flew Close Air \n     Support, and Combat Air Patrol missions. Never during any of \n     these missions was I warned of the threat of exposure to any \n     chemical or biological weapons. Although we expected and \n     trained for that eventuality, we never employed any of the \n     procedures because we were never told that there was any \n     threat of exposure. Had we been warned, there were steps we \n     could have and would have taken to protect ourselves.\n       Unlike other veterans who have testified before you, I \n     don't have a specific incident that I can remember during the \n     war that might have caused my illness. However, I can tell \n     you that I flew throughout the entire region of Iraq, Kuwait \n     and much of Saudi Arabia, to include in and around the oil \n     smoke. Evidence now shows that chemical munitions storage \n     areas and production facilities that were bombed by us \n     released clouds of fallout that drifted over our troops \n     through the air, and that's where I was. I know also of other \n     pilots who do remember a specific incident that caused them \n     to later become ill.\n       So while I cannot point to one event to explain my illness, \n     I come before you today to tell you that I am yet another \n     veteran from the Gulf War with a chronic illness. Upon return \n     from the Gulf, I was reassigned to McDill Air Force Base in \n     Tampa, Florida. It was here that I first started to \n     experience strange health problems. It was nothing you could \n     really pinpoint except to say that I didn't feel as strong as \n     I once had or as coordinated. I felt like I was always \n     fighting a cold or the flu.\n       By the summer of 1995, I was stationed at Shepperd Air \n     Force Base in Texas. It was here that I believe my illness \n     started and that I began to suspect that it was related to \n     service in the Gulf. During the summer, I was exposed several \n     times to malathion, which is a fairly dilute organophosphate-\n     based pesticide used for mosquito control. The base's policy \n     was to spray with a fogging truck throughout base housing \n     where I lived with my family. I was exposed to the malathion \n     fogging while I was running in the evenings. I would like to \n     point out something I learned later: that organophosphate \n     poison is the chemical basis for all nerve agents--it is a \n     poison that kills just like a pesticide does.\n       It was immediately after my exposure to malathion that I \n     started to have serious health problems. After this time, \n     every time I ran I would get a schetoma--or blind spot--in \n     front of my eyes and my heart would beat erratically. I \n     started to have heart palpitations, night sweats, \n     sleeplessness, trouble concentrating, trouble remembering, \n     trouble taking a deep breath and frequent urination. I \n     noticed that one cup of coffee would make me extremely \n     jittery. I noticed that one beer would have an unusual \n     intense effect on me. I was extremely tired much of the time. \n     I had to put my head down on my desk to rest while I was \n     working and I had to lie down at home before dinner after \n     work.\n       It wasn't until December 1995 that I started to have \n     trouble walking and experienced weakness in my right leg. It \n     was then that I decided, right after the holiday season, I \n     would go see the doctor. On the second of January 1996, I \n     went to the flight surgeon at Sheppard Air Force Base. When I \n     finished explaining my symptoms to him and mentioned that I \n     had been in the Gulf War, he immediately started to tell me \n     about the effects of stress. He told me that the other \n     problems--heart palpitations, breathing difficulties, \n     sleeplessness--were probably stress related, but that we \n     needed to look into the weakness in the leg more, and I was \n     referred to a neurologist.\n       During this first visit with the neurologist was when I \n     first heard the line that I would hear throughout the whole \n     Air Force medical system and that was: ``There's no \n     conclusive evidence that there's any link between service in \n     the Gulf and any illness.'' Each time I heard this line, it \n     was almost as if each person was reading from a script.\n       If an active duty field grade officer walks into a hospital \n     and says he's sick and that he was in the Gulf War, why does \n     the military not seize this opportunity to investigate \n     whether there is any connection between service in the Gulf \n     and this illness? How can they say they're looking for an \n     answer when they deny it's even possible? How can they say \n     there's no connection when they don't study the individuals \n     who present symptoms that might prove that connection? \n     Instead, he gets ``the line,'' which proves that no one is \n     looking to see whether there is a problem. Only to deny that \n     one exists. Why should I have to call and register for the \n     Gulf War Registry when I'm active duty? I should \n     automatically be put on the list as another person with a \n     chronic illness who served in the Gulf. Again, if they were \n     really looking for a problem, all they have to do is look.\n       My treatment included several trips to Wilford Hall Medical \n     Center in San Antonio for MRIs, CT scans, muscle tests and \n     multiple blood tests. Each time I mentioned I was a Gulf War \n     veteran, I got ``the line.'' At one point, a doctor in \n     Wilford Hall gave me a three minute dissertation on how my \n     illness absolutely could not be related to my service in the \n     Gulf. One thing I noticed during my four or five visits to \n     Wilford Hall was a room on the neurology ward labeled ``Gulf \n     War Syndrome Room.'' In none of my four or five visits was \n     the door to this room ever open or the light on. I started to \n     realize that because the military medical system would not \n     acknowledge my illness could be related to the Gulf War, I \n     would not get help.\n       Once I realized that, I began to seek help from civilian \n     doctors, many of whom had already made the connection between \n     service in the Gulf and the high incidents of unusual \n     illnesses among the war's veterans. They had all the proof \n     they needed: the thousands of veterans coming to them \n     desperate for medical treatment. Because the military has not \n     acknowledged this connection, my family and I have been \n     forced to spend over $40,000 of our own money in these \n     efforts. Our search led us to people around the country with \n     the same illnesses who were also Gulf War veterans. In the \n     last twelve months, I have traveled all over this country and \n     even to Germany looking for help.\n       Incredible as it may seem, the Air Force medical system \n     initially wanted to retire me with 50 percent disability and \n     temporary retirement with a diagnosis of ALS. Only after we \n     hired a lawyer, at our own expense, and went before the \n     medical board, were we able to change that determination to \n     100 percent and permanent retirement. All the while, I was \n     contending with my declining health and the trauma to my \n     family. I chose to not to fight over whether my illness was \n     combat related, because I'd already seen the stonewalling \n     that was going on and because I wanted to move my family back \n     home. That was my own personal decision, made at a time when \n     I knew I had other and far greater personal battles yet to \n     fight.\n       Upon my retirement from the Air Force, I found myself \n     worked into the VA medical system. What alternative did I \n     have after my 15 years of service? I guess I'm one of the \n     lucky ones, since I was:\n       1. still on active duty when I got sick; and\n       2. given a poor prognosis, which required them to treat me \n     and compensate me. What alternative did they have?\n       The VA bureaucracy is difficult and slow at best. I am \n     suffering from a fatal illness, where every month matters. I \n     can sit here today and tell you that despite my situation--\n     which you would think would warrant expeditious treatment and \n     action--I ran into a red tape and paperwork nightmare that \n     continues to consume my life today. However, once I finally \n     got to see them, the medical personnel who have treated me \n     have been very kind and understanding, despite the fact that \n     there isn't much they can do. Maybe if we hadn't had six \n     years of cover-up, there would be something they could do.\n       To this day, no one from the DOD or VA has contacted me \n     personally to involve me in any tests or studies. I myself \n     have found more than nine other Gulf War veterans, some who \n     have already come before you, who\n\n[[Page S3759]]\n\n     are also suffering from ALS, an unusual disease that rarely \n     strikes individuals under the age of 50. In fact, with the \n     ten of us who have ALS--and we are certain there are more out \n     there whom we just haven't found--the incidence of ALS \n     already far exceeds the normal incidence given the number of \n     soldiers who served in the Gulf. Why is there no special \n     emergency study of this outbreak? Why is no one worried about \n     what is obviously a frightening incidence of a terrible \n     neurological illness among such a young and healthy \n     population? One thing I can tell you: this is not stress.\n       With every other Gulf War veteran we have found who has \n     ALS, the common thread has been subsequent exposure to some \n     kind of strong chemical or pesticide, such as malathion, \n     diazinon, and lindane--which is used to treat head lice in \n     children.\n       Why aren't the DOD and the VA warning everyone else who \n     served in the Gulf War that they may get sick in the future, \n     just as I got sick four years after I returned to the US. How \n     many other people are out there waiting for that one exposure \n     that will put them over the top? Why is no one putting the \n     word out. A warning could save the lives and health of many \n     individuals, could save them from going through what I am now \n     going through. I'll tell you why, because that would take \n     admitting that something happened in the Gulf War that's \n     making people sick.\n       I wonder how many flight mishaps or accidents that have \n     happened since the war have involved Gulf War veterans. Those \n     numbers shouldn't be hard to find: the military keeps records \n     on all of that. In fact, I wager that someone out there \n     already knows the answer to that question and hasn't shared \n     it either because of a direct order not to or because the \n     right person has yet to ask.\n       How many other pilots are still out there--flying--who are \n     not quite feeling right? Just as I flew for four years after \n     I returned from the Gulf, how many other pilots fear for \n     their livelihood and the repercussions they know they would \n     encounter were they to speak up because they know ``There's \n     no conclusive evidence that there's any link between service \n     in the Gulf and any illness.''\n       Imagine my dismay when the DOD announces $12 million (a \n     drop in the bucket) to study the Gulf War illnesses and four \n     of those studies are centered around the effects of stress or \n     post-traumatic stress disorder. You would think that the DOD \n     and the VA would have an in-depth knowledge of the effects of \n     stress after all the wars this country has fought. Most of \n     them a lot more ``stressful'' than the Gulf War. Why \n     aren't they taking our illnesses seriously? I'll tell you \n     why, because that would take admitting that something \n     happened in the Gulf War that's making people sick.\n       Part of the ongoing cover up has been to trivialize the \n     illnesses that Gulf War veterans are suffering from. In the \n     press and from the VA, you hear about skin rashes and joint \n     aches, about insomnia and fatigue. There is no doubt that \n     these are real symptoms and are debilitating in and of \n     themselves. But what you don't hear about is the high \n     incidence of rare cancers, neurological illnesses such as \n     ALS, and immune-system disorders that are totally \n     debilitating. This is not stress. This is life and death.\n       Why is it impossible to get the right numbers from the DOD \n     and the VA about how many veterans are sick or have sought \n     treatment? Why is it more important to protect certain high-\n     placed government officials than to care for veterans who are \n     sick? When it comes time to fund the military, budget \n     concerns are usually set aside in the interest of defense and \n     the public good. Well, the national defense issue now is that \n     it's public knowledge that the DOD mistreats people who \n     serve. America will have no one to fight its wars.\n       The primary goal at this point is not to find out whose \n     fault all of this is. Someday, someone will need to \n     investigate what happened and why. The people responsible for \n     this tragedy should be found out and punished.\n       The top priority now for all of us is to help veterans and \n     their families get their health and their lives back. Or at \n     least that should be the goal. That should be your goal. All \n     I want is what I brought to the Air Force: my health.\n       I'm not interested in hearing how surprised General Powell \n     and General Schwartzkopf are about how we were all exposed to \n     chemical weapons, or that the CIA really did know Hussein had \n     these weapons, or that the CIA alerted the DOD to this fact. \n     It's obvious now that there's been a cover up going on all \n     this time as more and more information gets released or \n     discovered. It's time for those people who know something--\n     and they do exist--to come forward. And maybe we can save \n     some lives.\n       During and after the war, we proclaimed to ourselves and to \n     the world how we learned the lessons of Vietnam and fixed the \n     military. We learned the lessons of Vietnam and we did it \n     right this time. Last week, General Powell stated that we \n     suffered only 149 casualties in the Gulf War. Well, I am here \n     to tell you that the casualty count is still rising. Just \n     like in Vietnam with Agent Orange, it appears that we didn't \n     learn all the lessons. We still mistreat veterans. This \n     country has again turned its back on the people who fight its \n     wars, the individuals to whom it owes the most.\n       I want to thank you for what you are doing for the veterans \n     who went to war for this country. Many of whom were squeezed \n     out of the military right after the war and now find \n     themselves out on the street, fighting the very institution \n     they fought for. In the military, we have a tradition called \n     the salute and it's used to show admiration and respect for \n     an individual who has earned it. I salute you for what you \n     are doing here. You go a long way in restoring this soldiers \n     waning faith in a country that could so willingly desert it's \n     own.\n       Remember: I am not the enemy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/28/senate-section/article/S3758-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3759]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, APRIL 29, 1997\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL.
