Mr. President, am I correct in my understanding, the \nWarner-Hutchinson amendment is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 2737 is pending.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a few \nminutes about that amendment which I authored and which I anticipate \nSenator Warner will move, at 10:15, to table.\n  It has become evident to me that tabling motions in this institution \nat one time were far more meaningful; that in this case there will be \nan effort to vote against tabling, simply for the purpose of making \nthat vote meaningless. There are those who simply do not want a \nstraight up or down, clean vote\n\n[[Page S6834]]\n\non the substance of these amendments. What they want to do is cease \nembarrassing themselves by being seen voting against amendments that \nare supported broadly by the American people and are substantively what \nwe ought to do: condemn forced abortion, deny visas to those who are \nperforming them, condemn religious persecution, deny visas to those who \nare involved in it. Those are the kinds of things the American people \nsupport. But those who simply want to avoid having to cast that vote at \nthis time are going to vote against tabling it and, by so doing, \nprevent any kind of clean up or down vote on the substance of these \namendments.\n  There is no time agreement. We will have a cloture vote later today. \nSo they seem to have found a means by which, on a parliamentary basis, \nthey can avoid having to take a stand on what we need to be taking a \nstand about.\n  They will argue this is the wrong time; we should not do this on the \neve of the President's departure for China. I would simply say, this \namendment, really four amendments that have been now wedded together, \nthis amendment strengthens the hand of our President as he goes to \nChina. It gives him greater voice and it gives him a greater tool as \nboth the House and the Senate will then have been on record on the \nsubstance of these amendments. The President will be able to express to \nthe Chinese people, with the full backing of Congress, his deep concern \nabout these issues.\n  How important this is, and how much progress still needs to be made \nin China, was very evident today by the headline in the Washington \nTimes. The headline in the Washington Times this morning is: ``Beijing \nPulls Visas of Three U.S. Reporters: Move Targets Radio Free Asia.''\n  In a move that is absolutely astounding, it shows that China simply \ndoesn't get it. In a move that reflects the fact that they simply don't \nunderstand what freedom and liberty and a free press is all about, they \nhave denied visas to three reporters previously approved by this \nadministration to travel to China and to cover the events of the \nPresident's visit.\n  I have learned to appreciate more and more Radio Free Asia and the \noutstanding work they do and the outstanding job they perform and the \noutstanding coverage that they provide. Now we find that these three \nreporters are going to be denied the opportunity to go. The Chinese \nGovernment has refused to give them permission to come because--why? \nBecause, apparently, they are afraid that some of that coverage might \nput the Beijing government in a poor light.\n  As I mentioned yesterday, in my remarks on the floor, Newsweek \nmagazine chose this edition, on the eve of the President's trip, to \nhighlight the new China. In fact, the cover article is headlined, ``The \nNew China.'' I would only quote one portion of the article:\n\n       In large measure, the central question surrounding \n     Clinton's trip is whether China has really changed since \n     1989.\n       Walking around the glittering shopping malls of Beijing, \n     talking to the members of the newly affluent Chinese middle \n     class, it is plain that China is not the country it was 9 \n     years ago. Official language has changed; China's leaders no \n     longer deny what happened in Tiananmen Square, but focus on \n     what has happened since--an embrace of market economics and \n     new political and legal rights. More important, on the \n     streets and in the media, ``unofficial'' China is giving real \n     shape to such rights.\n\n  I will repeat that last sentence, ``Unofficial China is giving real \nshape to such rights,'' political and legal rights, that is.\n  The question before this Senate is what is official China doing? And \nit is obvious from the headline in the Washington Times today, the \nstory that they broke, that Beijing pulled the visas of three U.S. \nreporters, indicates what official China is doing today is yet, still, \nvery deplorable.\n  In the State Department report on China for 1997, the human rights \nreport on China, they have section 2, dealing with respect for civil \nliberties. In particular, they address this issue of a free press and \nour State Department's report says:\n\n       There are 10,000 openly distributed publications in China, \n     including 2,200 newspapers. During the year, the Central \n     Propaganda Department instructed all provinces and \n     municipalities to set up a special team to review \n     publications.\n\n  Now listen:\n\n       All media employees are under explicit, public orders to \n     follow [Chinese Communist Party] directives and ``guide \n     public opinion'' as directed by political authorities. Both \n     formal and informal guidelines continue to require reporters \n     to avoid coverage of sensitive subjects and negative news. \n     Journalists also must protect State secrets in accordance \n     with State Security Law. These public orders, guidelines, and \n     laws greatly restrict the freedom of broadcast journalists \n     and newspapers to report the news and leads to a high degree \n     of self-censorship. In October leading dailies in China \n     carried a translation of a major policy speech by a foreign \n     official; however, a lengthy section on human rights was \n     dropped from the translation.\n\n  I believe our State Department report on human rights conditions in \nChina once again reflects very clearly how far China has to go and how \ndeplorable civil rights and human rights conditions in China really \nare. And in the particular area of freedom of speech and press, we find \nthere is a very, very rigid censorship that controls the media in \nChina.\n  Nowhere was that censorship more evident than in Beijing's decision \nto pull the visas of these U.S. reporters seeking to provide coverage \non the President's trip. I urge all of my colleagues in the U.S. Senate \nto read in its entirety the China Country Report on Human Rights \nPractices for 1997. It is in fact, I believe, a great eye-opener and \ndeals not only with the area of the press, but deals with the issues of \nforced abortions and religious persecution which the amendment that is \npending before this body deals with explicitly.\n  Mr. President, as we will be voting on this motion to table at 10:15 \ntoday, and we think about the issue of forced abortions, I have heard \nin recent days China apologists explain that really what is going on in \nChina isn't all that bad. And the defense goes something like this: \nChina's official family policy, family planning policy, forbids \ncoercion; it forbids forced abortions or forced sterilizations. They \nwill say that is the official position of the Chinese Government. The \nproblem is, that has never been codified. It has never been written \ndown.\n  So while the Beijing authorities will say, ``Yes, we do not tolerate \nforced abortions or coercion in family planning practices,'' that has \nnever been codified and put into the law of the land in China.\n  The Chinese Government will acknowledge that local officials, under \ngreat pressure to meet population targets, sometimes utilize these \ncoercive practices. So while they will argue this is not the public \npolicy of China to permit coerced abortions, they will acknowledge, \nbecause such targets are placed and such financial incentives are \nplaced over local officials, that local officials sometimes go over the \nedge and will use these coercive practices in enforcing the one-child \npolicy in China.\n  In defense of the fact that these practices are tolerated, China will \nexplain that it is a very large country, and it is simply impossible \nfor the central Government to maintain and punish those who break the \nofficial ban on coercive family planning practices. That is the \nrationale that is given. China apologists, of which there are many in \nthis country, will say, ``We have to be understanding. They don't \nofficially permit this. It's local officials who get out of hand. And, \nafter all, China is a big country. We can't expect they're going to be \nable to enforce this consistently.''\n  When I hear that rationale, what I immediately think of is the fact \nthat, according to our State Department report, every known dissident \nin China has been rounded up and incarcerated. Somehow the central \nChinese Government manages to monitor and find those who might speak \nout for human rights or for democracy or for freedom in China today. \nThe central Government has no problem in enforcing their very rigid \ncontrol of the population. And yet they want to excuse themselves from \nany kind of enforcement in preventing coerced family planning practices \nin China.\n  If the one-child policy results in pressure for local officials to \nengage in force, then the central Government ought to change that \ncentral Government policy and simply remove the kinds of incentives \nthat have resulted from local officials coercing women to have \nabortions when they do not want to. If, according to our State \nDepartment, all dissidents have been silenced,\n\n[[Page S6835]]\n\nthen surely the central Government that can monitor democracy \ndissidents all over the vast country can surely monitor and control \nrogue officials who practice these very horrendous procedures on \nunwilling women in China.\n  The Chinese authorities, in 1979, instituted the policy of allowing \none child per couple, providing monetary bonuses and other benefits as \nincentives for that one-child policy. In subsequent years, it has been \nwidely reported that women with one living child, who become pregnant a \nsecond time, are subjected to rigorous pressure to end the pregnancies \nand undergo sterilization.\n  Forced abortions and sterilization, Mr. President, have not only been \nused in Communist China to regulate the number of children, but to \neliminate those regarded as ``defective'' under China's very inhumane \neugenics policy. They call their law the natal and health care law. \nWhat a misnomer. This law requires couples at risk of transmitting \ndisabling congenital defects to their children to use birth control or \nundergo forced sterilization.\n  China currently has legislation that requires women to be sterilized \nafter conceiving two children, and they even go so far as to demand \nsterilization of either the man or the woman if traces of a serious \nhereditary disease is found in an effort to eliminate the presence of \nchildren with handicaps, to eliminate the presence of children with \nillnesses or other characteristics they might consider to be \n``abnormal.'' That eugenics policy is abhorrent and it is morally \nreprehensible. It is the practice, it is the law of the land in China \ntoday.\n\n  The amendment that is before us would address this issue. It would \nput us on record in condemning this practice and be at least a symbolic \nstep in denying visas to those for whom there is credible evidence are \ninvolved in the practice.\n  Chinese population control officials, working with employers and work \nunit officials, routinely monitor women's menstrual cycles, incredibly \nenough. They subject women who conceive without Government \nauthorization--they do not have a certificate to conceive--to extreme \npsychological pressure, to harsh economic sanctions, including \nunpayable fines and loss of employment, and in some instances physical \nforce.\n  It has been estimated that China commits about a half a million \nthird-trimester abortions every year. Most of these babies are fully \nviable when they are killed. Virtually all of these abortions are \nperformed against the mother's will.\n  Steven Mosher, the director of Asian studies at California's \nClaremont Institute, can personally account to seeing doctors carrying \nchokers. These chokers are similar to the little garbage ties that we \nuse to tie up garbage bags. They are placed around the little baby's \nneck during delivery. The baby then dies of a painful strangulation \nover a period of about 5 minutes.\n  To my colleagues, I say a government that would force women to \nundergo these kinds of grisly procedures has no conception of and no \nrespect for human rights.\n  On June 10, my colleague in the House, Chris Smith, the chairman of \nthe Human Rights Subcommittee on International Relations, held a \nhearing on this ongoing practice in China. Gao Xiao Duan, the former \nhead of China's Planned Birth Control Office from 1984 to 1988, \nprovided powerful testimony about what she went through, what she was \ncalled upon to enforce, and her own nightmarish experience until she \nwas unable and unwilling to live with a guilty conscience because of \nwhat she was doing. She resigned. She left. She got out of that grisly \nbusiness.\n  Well, it is that kind of practice, along with what I have in the past \nelaborated on related to religious persecution that is ongoing in China \ntoday, on which this body needs to take a stand. The House of \nRepresentatives voted for these measures, and voted for them \noverwhelmingly. The forced abortion provision in the House of \nRepresentatives passed by a vote of 415-1. And it is time that the \nSenate quit stalling and quit dragging its feet, quit avoiding these \nissues.\n  It is time that we faced the abuses in China forthrightly and \nhonestly. And I believe, far from embarrassing the President as he \nmakes this trip to China, it is incumbent upon us to strengthen his \nability to address human rights issues at Tiananmen Square and in \ndealing and meeting with Government officials throughout China, \nthroughout his 8-day visit in China.\n  So I ask my colleagues to rethink the desire of many to avoid a clean \nup-and-down vote on the substance of these amendments, which, frankly, \nI have heard no one get up and argue that this is the wrong position to \ntake or this should not be the public policy of our country. Instead, I \nhave heard vague talk that we should not vote at this time with efforts \nto try to avoid taking a clear stand on this issue.\n  I commend the Washington Post on their editorial today of June 23. I \nask unanimous consent that editorial, ``The Case of Li Hai'' be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 23, 1998]\n\n                           The Case of Li Hai\n\n       Li Hai, 44, a former teacher at the Chinese Medical \n     College, is serving a nine-year sentence in Beijing's \n     Liangxiang Prison. His crime: assembling a list of people \n     jailed for taking part in pro-democracy demonstrations in \n     Tiananmen Square in 1989. From the Beijing area alone, he \n     documented more than 700. Of those, 158--mostly workers, \n     rather than students--received sentences of more than nine \n     years and are presumed still held. Many were sentenced to \n     life in prison, from a 22-year-old named Sun Chuanheng to a \n     76-year-old named Wang Jiaxiang. Li Hai himself was convicted \n     of ``prying into and gathering . . . state secrets.''\n       We thought of Mr. Li as we read President Clinton's \n     explanation in Newsweek yesterday of ``Why I'm Going to \n     Beijing.'' Mr. Clinton wrote of the ``real progress--though \n     far from enough'' that China has made in human rights during \n     the past year. That progress, according to the president, \n     consists of the release of ``several prominent dissidents''; \n     President Jiang Zemin's receiving a delegation of American \n     religious leaders; and China's announcement of its \n     ``intention to sign'' an important international treaty on \n     human rights. That's a rather threadbare litany, even before \n     you take account of the fact that two of the three releases \n     for which the administration takes credit relate to \n     dissidents who have been forced into exile, and that China \n     has not said when it will ratify the human rights treaty, \n     even if--as President Jiang stated in a separate Newsweek \n     interview--it signs the document this fall.\n       How meager these accomplishments in human rights really are \n     becomes clear when you stack them up against the \n     administration's own decidedly modest goals back in 1996, \n     when it already had downgraded the priority of human rights. \n     According to reporting by The Post's Barton Gellman, the \n     Clinton administration offered China a package deal in \n     November of that year: It would no longer support a United \n     Nations resolution calling attention to China's human rights \n     abuses if China would release seven prominent dissidents, \n     sign two international treaties on human rights, allow the \n     International Committee of the Red Cross to visit Chinese \n     prisons and establish a forum of U.S. and Chinese human \n     rights groups. When China failed to fully meet any of the \n     demands, and rebuffed the United States on two of them, Mr. \n     Clinton said that was good enough. This again calls to mind \n     what is disquieting about his China policy: not that he is \n     pursuing a policy of engagement but that the engagement too \n     often is on China's terms.\n       Tomorrow Mr. Clinton will leave for China, the first \n     president to visit since the Tiananmen massacre. His aides \n     promise that he will speak out on human rights while there, \n     and there is a chance he will meet with the mother of a \n     student killed in Tiananmen. The first could be valuable if \n     his remarks are broadcast on Chinese television; the second, \n     an important symbol, especially because many relatives of \n     Tiananmen victims continue to be persecuted and harassed. But \n     Mr. Clinton's remarks, above all, should be honest. For the \n     sake of Li Hai, the 158 he documented and the many he did not \n     find, Mr. Clinton should not trumpet ``real progress'' in a \n     human rights record where no such progress exists.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I will quote a portion of that editorial today from \nthe Washington Post:\n       Li Hai, 44, a former teacher at the Chinese Medical \n     College, is serving a nine-year sentence in Beijing's \n     Liangxiang Prison.

For the \n     sake of Li Hai, the 158 he documented and the many he did not \n     find, Mr. Clinton should not trumpet ``real progress'' in a \n     human rights record where no such progress exists.\n  Mr. President, exactly so. We should not create progress where it \ndoes not exist. We should not pretend that there is progress where it \nhas not been demonstrated. The exile of high-profile dissidents, their \nexile to the United States, people who are then told, you are free so \nlong as you never return to your homeland, your fatherland--this is \nwhat is hailed as human rights progress? I, for one, will say no, that \nis not true.\n  The abuses are great. It is time that the U.S. Senate took its stand. \nIt is time that the U.S. Senate quit avoiding our responsibility, as \nthe elected representatives, to the people of this country and that we \nbe willing to simply cast our own convictions on these amendments, that \nwe not, through parliamentary tactics, through what is now called \n``throwing a vote,'' try to make a vote meaningless by everyone voting \ncontrary to their own beliefs so as to avoid a clear up-or-down vote on \nwhich the American people can make a judgment.\n  Let there be no mistake. Let's all understand what we are doing when \nwe vote at 10:15 today. For those who are opposed to these amendments, \nto vote against tabling is a vote of deception to the American people. \nIt may, in the minds of many, make this vote meaningless. Let us be \nsure in this country in which freedom reigns, in which the American \npeople, I think, are quite discerning--they will be able to see through \nthe charade of simply circumventing a vote on substance. They will be \nable to see the pretense of voting one way when you believe another, so \nthat you can avoid voting on the substance and say this is a bad thing, \nfor us to condemn forced abortions, we shouldn't do that; it is a bad \nthing for us to deny visas for those involved in it; it is a bad thing \nfor the U.S. Government to condemn religious persecution, the \npersecution of minorities in China, Tibet. No one says that, and yet \nthe efforts were made to avoid a substantive vote on these amendments \ntoday.\n  I mentioned just a moment ago the high-profile dissidents who have \nbeen exiled from their homeland, none of those more prominent than Wei \nJingsheng. It has been my privilege and honor to get to know some of \nthose dissidents, who have been exiled, who now in this country \nadvocate for democracy in their homeland. The story of Wei Jingsheng is \none of the most intriguing and most inspiring.\n  I am quoting now from Orvile Schell's ``Mandate of Heaven'':\n\n       Wei Jingsheng, a young electrician working at the Beijing \n     zoo, and editor of a publication called ``Explorations,'' \n     became one of the most trenchant critics of the Chinese \n     Government. On December 5, 1978, he posted a critique of \n     Deng's Modernization Program that insisted that modernizing \n     agriculture, industry, science and technology and national \n     defense without also embracing a fifth modernization, namely, \n     democracy, was futile. That was his crime. He dared to \n     critique his leaders' philosophy by saying, ``We may \n     modernize agriculture, industry, science, technology, and \n     defense, but unless we have structural change in the area of \n     democracy, it will be futile.''\n\n  That was his crime.\n  Then Wei Jinsheng asked this:\n\n       ``What is true democracy?'' his wall poster asked. It means \n     the right of people to choose their own representatives, who \n     will work according to their will and in their interests. \n     Only this can be called democracy. Furthermore, the people \n     must have power to replace their representatives any time so \n     that these representatives cannot go on deceiving others in \n     the name of the people. We hold that people should not \n     give any political leader unconditional trust. Does Deng \n     want democracy? No, he does not, asserted Wei. Then as if \n     he were engaged in an actual face-to-face with Deng, Wei \n     Jingsheng added, we cannot help asking, what do you think \n     democracy means if the people do not have a right to \n     express their ideas freely? How can one speak of \n     democracy? If refusing to allow other people to criticize \n     those in power is your idea of democracy, then what is the \n     difference between this and what is euphemistically called \n     the dictatorship of the proletarian?\n       Wei was soon arrested. Wei was sentenced to 15 years in \n     prison on charges of having sold state secrets to a \n     foreigner. In jail, he became a troublesome reminder of the \n     party's arbitrary power to suppress political opposition, \n     until he was finally released in the fall of 1993 in an \n     effort by the Chinese government to enhance its chances of \n     bringing the 2000 Olympic games to Beijing.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a point of inquiry?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KERRY. We have a vote at 10:15, and there are a couple folks who \nhope to make a comments. Could the Senator perhaps indicate to the \nSenate when he might be concluding?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I was on the verge of concluding my remarks.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank my colleague. I apologize.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I was quoting from Orvile Schell's ``Mandate of \nHeaven,'' the background and inspiring story of Wei Jingsheng, who went \nto prison, spent many years in prison, because he dared to say \ndemocracy isn't democracy until there is freedom to criticize your \nelected officials.\n  The headline today in the Washington Time says it all: ``Beijing \nGovernment Denies Visas to Three Reporters.''\n  They do not understand freedom. We need to take a stand in this body \nto say that the practices and the human rights abuses that continue in \nChina are wrong. If they will say that, we will do what is within our \npower to truly engage the Chinese, the Chinese government, by \nconfronting them where they are wrong, encouraging them where they are \nmaking progress.\n  This administration has done too little. This amendment today can be \na step in the right direction. It can be a step in which we take a \nforthright stand for human rights and convey a message as our President \ngoes, convey a message to the Chinese Government, that human rights are \ntaken seriously in this country, that human rights will not take a back \nseat to trade.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendment before the Senate raises \nvery, very serious issues that I think all of us have some strong \nfeelings about, hopefully on the same side of the issue. I can't \nimagine there is a Member of this body who would support religious \nrepression, forced sterilization, forced abortion, or the other \nactivities which too often occur in this world, including in China.\n  It is because this amendment raises such serious issues that it seems \nto me there are going to be many people who, understandably, are going \nto want to pursue what those issues are and to see whether we should \nnot, indeed, address those activities, not just for China but for \nwherever they occur.\n  One of the questions which this amendment raises is religious \nrepression--intolerable, anywhere. Intolerable, whether it occurs in \nChina or in Saudi Arabia or any other country.\n  This amendment is aimed exclusively at China. The issues that it \nraises are incredibly serious; the activities that are described are \nincredibly reprehensible and deplorable, wherever they occur. The \nquestion is whether or not this country should adopt a policy of \ndenying visas and, if so, whether or not it is a policy which is \nmanageable; can we determine which of the hundred of thousands of visa \napplicants--for instance, which were issued to Chinese nationals--\nprobably millions in other countries--can be investigated. If so, by \nwhom and under what circumstances? Is it a practical policy?\n\n  On the Armed Services Committee, we have not held hearings on this. \nThis is not something that comes within our jurisdiction. This is a \nForeign Relations Committee issue, which they, hopefully, have either \nlooked at or will look at. This has to do with the State Department and \nJustice Department, not the Defense Department.\n  So we are sitting here with a defense bill, being presented with a \nvery serious issue that should be dealt with, I believe, generically, \nwherever the activity occurs, and it should be aimed at any country--\nnot just at one, but all countries where these activities occur--and it \nshould be a policy that can be implemented.\n  Does this amendment meet that test? I think there are people who feel \nthat,\n\n[[Page S6837]]\n\nno, it doesn't. But it raises such serious issues that we ought to find \na way to deal with these issues. I am one of those people. I am second \nto none in terms of my opposition to religious repression. My family \nhas felt enough of that through our generation. I am second to none in \nterms of what I believe is the reprehensible character of a forced \nabortion or a sterilization policy. We don't have to take second seats \nto each other in terms of our abhorrence of those kinds of activities. \nBut I would hope that, as a body that tries to deliberate on a policy \nand apply it wherever it should be applied, we would take enough time \nto ask ourselves if forced abortion is reprehensible, and do we want \nanybody who perpetrates it to have a visa. If so, apply it uniformly; \nif not, apply it uniformly.\n  We have an amendment which says the top leaders of the country--the \npolicymakers--are exempt from the denial of a visa. The Cabinet \nofficers in China, presumably, who make policy, can get visas; but any \n200,000 nationals of China are supposed to be investigated to see \nwhether or not they implemented a reprehensible policy. You let the \nCabinet officers off the hook, but the 200,000 nationals beneath the \nCabinet officers are the ones whose visa applications presumably are \nsupposed to be investigated. Why are we letting the policymakers off \nthe hook? Why do they get visas to come in here, but people who may or \nmay not have been implementing the policy are the ones whose visa \napplications will be investigated?\n  We have a 1,500-page book, ``State Department Analysis of Human \nRights Violations Around the World.'' It is a very useful book. Just \nopen to a page just about anyplace--on page 1,561 it relates to Saudi \nArabia: ``The Government does not permit public non-Moslem religious \nactivities. Non-Moslem worshipers risk arrest, lashing and deportation \nfor engaging in religious activities that attract official attention.''\n  Now, the policy of denying visas may or may not be workable, but we \nsurely ought to apply it uniformly where the activity is as \nreprehensible in one country as it is in another. But the amendment \nbefore us doesn't do that. It singles out a single country; it singles \nout 10 pages of those 1,500 pages and says that this is where we are \ngoing to apply the visa denial policy. Is that what we want to do as a \nSenate? Should we take the time to decide whether or not we want to do \nit that way? I think we ought to. Is a policy of religious persecution \nor forced abortion as reprehensible if it occurs there, as well as if \nit occurs elsewhere? I think it is.\n\n  So what we have before us is a very, very sincere effort to address a \nreal human rights problem--more than one--pages and pages of human \nrights problems in China. I said 10, but I wasn't sure; it could be 50 \nfor all I know. These are huge human rights violations in China--huge. \nThe Senator from Arkansas is correct in pointing them out, in my book. \nI give him credit for pointing them out. But there are issues that are \nraised, which must be addressed by a Senate that is serious about \naddressing these issues uniformly, generically, wherever they exist. In \nmy book, that is what we should try to find a way to do.\n  Can we do this on a defense authorization bill? I do not believe that \nwe are going to be able to resolve these issues here. Should we \nacknowledge that the issues are indeed real ones? I think we should \nfind a way to do that.\n  So there is going to be some real reluctance, in my judgment--honest \nreluctance, may I say to my friend from Arkansas--to table an amendment \nfrom those who nonetheless have questions as to whether or not this \namendment should apply to people who engage in activities wherever they \nengage in them, not just in China, and should apply to top level \nofficials, not just to the 200,000 nationals beneath them who applied \nfor visas. So however people vote on the motion--and I hope everybody \nis troubled by the activity equally and with the same commitment and \npassion as our friend from Arkansas--I believe that will reflect, in \ntheir judgment, a decision as to whether or not the issue is an \nimportant issue, as I believe and I think all of us believe it is, but \nalso how do we deal with it on a defense authorization bill. That is an \nhonest dilemma that people feel.\n  So the suggestion that people who will vote against tabling may \ndisagree with the Senator from Arkansas, I don't believe is a fair \naccusation about many of us who will vote against tabling. Many of us \nwho will vote against tabling have a lot of issues that we feel should \nbe resolved relative to the issue that has been raised by the Senator \nfrom Arkansas--honest, legitimate improvements that could be made or \nconsiderations that could be made on the points he has raised, \nincluding the few that I have just enumerated here. Do we want to apply \nthis to top officials? If so, why are they given exemption? Do we want \nto apply it wherever the activities occur, not just in China? If so, \nwhy is this limited to China? Is this a workable process when you have \nmillions of visa applications--200,000 from China alone? We don't know \non the Armed Services Committee. We have surely not had an opportunity \nto have a hearing into this subject, which I think would have been \nhighly useful prior to this amendment coming to the floor.\n  Mr. President, there will be an effort, I know, to table this, or a \nmotion that Senator Warner hopes to make around 10:15. I know there is \nat least one other speaker who wants to be heard.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, there is no more important role that the \nU.S. Senate plays than its role to advise and consent on treaties, as \nwell as its larger role on foreign policy. In the 14 years that I have \nhad the privilege of serving in the U.S. Senate, I have watched the \nSenate choose carefully, usually, how it exercises that authority.\n  We have had some great debates here in the Senate at appropriate \ntimes over issues of enormous consequence to our country. And our \nefforts have usually been--I can remember some of these debates very \nwell, whether it was over the Contras, or over the appointment of \nnuclear weapons in Europe, or over relationships with China \npreviously--that where Presidents have been executing their \nconstitutional authority on behalf of our country to engage in direct \ndiplomacy, the Senate has tried normally to exercise both restraint and \ngood judgment about what we choose to take up, when, and how as it \nmight affect those policies.\n  I know that there has always been a conscious effort in the Senate to \ntry to be judicious about respecting the ability of the President of \nthe United States to speak for the country. I know from personal \nhistory here that there were times when President Reagan, or President \nBush may have been poised to travel to another country and engage in \ndirect diplomacy, and we were beseeched by our colleagues not to raise \nX, Y or Z issue in a particular way, not to raise it but in a \nparticular way that might do mischief to the larger interests of the \ncountry.\n  I simply am confounded and disturbed and troubled by what is \nhappening here.\n  One might ask the question: What has happened to the U.S. Senate? \nWhat has happened to the disparate issues within this body where we try \nto reach across the aisle in the interests of our country and put \npolitics aside just for a few days and a few hours?\n  There isn't anybody in the U.S. Senate who doesn't understand how \nhorrendous the policies of China are with respect to human rights. And \nthere are 365 days a year where we can choose to make that clear in any \nnumber of ways, and we do, whether in hearings, or in press \nconferences, or even in legislation. But to be coming to the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate the day before the President of the United States \nleaves to speak for our country--not for a party, for our country--and \ndiminish the capacity of that President to go to China carrying the \nfull measure of support of the Nation is nothing less than mischievous \nand partisan.\n  I think it is entirely appropriate for any Senator to give any speech \nhe or she wants whenever he or she wants. Any Senator can come to the \nfloor at any time and raise an issue. That is appropriate. Any Senator \ncan have a series of press conferences. Any Senator can introduce \nlegislation. But what are we doing amending the Foreign Relations \nAuthorization Act on the Defense Act without even having hearings \nwithin the Foreign Relations Committee? And why is it that we are \nsuddenly\n\n[[Page S6838]]\n\ndiscussing satellite technology when everybody knows that about every \ncommittee in the U.S. Senate has an investigation going on and none of \nthem have reported back? None of them they have reported back. Yet, \nhere we are with legislation on satellite technology which has no \npurpose other than to try to play a partisan political hand.\n  What is horrendous about this is that it isn't just transparent. It \nisn't just partisan. It isn't just obvious. It is dangerous. It is \ndamaging.\n  It diminishes the ability of the President to go with a sense that he \nhas sort of a clear playing field, if you will, an ability to be able \nto play out what has been a carefully thought-out, several-month \nstrategy of how to engage in this particular summitry.\n  It has already been made difficult enough by another set of issues. \nIndia and Pakistan have altered 50 years of understanding with respect \nto nuclear weaponry. We have huge issues about Tibet, enormous issues \nabout the Asian flu. Holding China to its promise to maintain the \nvaluation on its currency, not to devalue; enormous issues with respect \nto Burma, Cambodia where they are trying to hold elections and restore \nwhat was a huge U.N. investment in democracy; enormous interests with \nrespect to the South China Sea; relationship with the Spratly Islands; \nChina and its aggressiveness within that region; a whole set of any \nissues with respect to North Korea as a consequence of what has \nhappened with respect to India and Pakistan and North Korea's \nstatements that they now want to move to abrogate the agreements that \nwe reached with respect to nuclear weaponry and nuclear power.\n  Those are substantive, significant, enormous issues that go so far \nbeyond day-to-day partisanship and concerns of party. It is mind-\nboggling.\n  So what excuse is there for turning the defense authorization bill \ninto a bonanza for political gamesmanship with respect to China on the \neve of the President leaving? I think it is inexcusable, \nnotwithstanding the merits of the amendment. No one is going to argue \nthe merits of the amendment. What American is going to stand up and \nsay, ``Oh. I am for forced abortion?'' I mean is this really the issue \nthat we ought to be dealing with in the context of DOD right now? No. \nIt certainly is an issue worthy of dealing with at any time. And I am \nconfident that the President of the United States could raise that and \na whole host of issues with the Chinese.\n  This morning we had a breakfast with the Secretary of State talking \nabout her trip to China. I didn't notice the Senators of concern here \nwith these amendments at that breakfast working on what she might be \nraising. I didn't notice them at a number of briefings recently with \nSandy Berger or other people working on the precursor effort to lay \ndown what might happen there. There is a world of difference between \ntrying to achieve these things, and in a realistic way, and playing out \nthe politics on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, I cannot say enough. This institution has a great \ntradition. And some of that tradition is a great part of history. \nSenator Vandenberg made a name that stays in history based on a \nwillingness to reach across the aisle. Traditionally, every time we \nhave ever seen a President go, I have heard talk on the floor of the \nSenate about how we ought to be judicious and how we ought to be \ncautious and how we ought to strengthen the hand of the President and \nnot engage in this kind of politics, as appropriate as the substance \nand merits may be. And they are. There is no issue about the substance \nand the merits here; none whatsoever. It is 100 to nothing as to what \nyou are going to do. But that is what even makes more of a mockery of \nthe politics of it because it is 100 to nothing, because this is so \nclear it even underscores more, I think, the meddling nature and the \npolitics of what is happening here.\n  Mr. President, I know there is a desire to try to have a vote now. I \nam saddened to see the Senate engage in this kind of activity in the \nhours before the President of the United States goes to engage the most \npopulous nation in the world and a nuclear power in the most serious \nset of discussions we have had in a long time, in my judgment. It is so \ninappropriate that I think we should just not have a series of votes on \nthis measure until we make up our mind that we are going to legislate \nintelligently and seriously about the issues of the defense \nauthorization bill and not a set of larger foreign policy goals.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know that everyone is expecting a vote \nshortly, and the distinguished Senator from Virginia has noted that he \nwill be making a motion to table in just a moment. But I want to take a \ncouple of minutes simply to applaud the two previous speakers.\n  Let me thank the distinguished Senator from Michigan and the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts both for their eloquence and their passion with \nwhich they articulated their views. Clearly these issues deserve a lot \nmore attention and consideration and careful thought than what they \nhave been given so far.\n  We have heard a couple of speeches; that is it. As the Senator from \nMichigan has noted, these deserve an opportunity to be heard and \nthoughtfully considered in ways that ought to include committee \nconsideration, ought to include other amendments, ought to include \nother countries. And that, in essence, is what argument the Senator \nfrom Michigan made, I think, with a great deal of authenticity and \nauthority this morning.\n  Then the issue of timing. Mr. President, if there was ever a question \nabout what it was these amendments were truly designed to do, it is \nsimply, as the Senator from Massachusetts noted, designed to embarrass \nthe President of the United States on the eve of his trip.\n  That is what this is about. And I hope Republicans and Democrats \nunderstand, what comes around goes around. And I hope everyone \nunderstands that, in the past moments of equal import, this isn't what \nthe Senate did, this isn't the way the Senate operated; on a bipartisan \nbasis, we would send the head of state off to another country with a \nclear understanding that we would stop at the water's edge when it came \nto sending the wrong message, that we would send President Bush to \nanother country with the realization that we were behind him, that we \nwould send President Reagan to Reykjavik with a clear understanding \nthat he had very big issues he had to deal with and we were going to \nprotect his right to stand united for this country in negotiations as \nimportant as they were.\n  Time after time, in situation after situation, we put politics aside. \nWe knew what we had to do. We knew there was a time for politics, there \nwas a time for issues, and there was a time to pull together as \nAmericans, saying, look, we don't support you, Mr. President, on \nvirtually anything, but when it comes to this, what could be more \nimportant?\n  Well, there are some in this Chamber who have come to the conclusion \nthat that is no longer the way we do business here. We do not care what \nmessage we send about the importance of American unity. We do not care \nwhether progress is going to be made on a historic trip of this kind. \nWe do not really care whether or not he comes back with a collective \nappreciation of new accomplishments having to do with trade and maybe \neven human rights and shipments abroad and abortion and all of the \nother issues dealing with human rights. That doesn't matter, because we \nwant to make our points on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. President, I hope we take a collective step back. I hope we take \na good look at what message this sends. And I will tell all of my \ncolleagues, I see this as a procedural vote. I am not going to vote to \ntable, because I am not going to allow one single vote on China this \nweek. And if we are going to play this game, we are not going to have \nany votes on defense either. I am going to be voting against cloture, \nbecause I don't want to see any votes on defense, any votes on China, \nany votes that are as reckless as they would be cast were we to have \nvotes this afternoon or on any other issue regarding China or other \nmatters pertaining to defense.\n\n[[Page S6839]]\n\n  So it is over. We might as well pull this bill. We are not going to \nhave those votes. We are not going to embarrass this President. We are \ngoing to stick to procedural votes, and we will let everybody make \ntheir own decision. But we are not going to have votes on substance \nwhen it comes to issues of this import.\n  So, Mr. President, that is my position. I hope my colleagues will \nsubscribe to it. I hope that we can come back to our senses and do the \nright thing, come together in a bipartisan way and send the right \nmessage. We are not doing that right now.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as one of the comanagers of this bill, \ntogether with the distinguished chairman of the committee, Mr. \nThurmond, I receive that news as very disheartening. It is imperative \nthat the defense bill go forward. As you know, Defense Appropriations \nis prepared to complete their work. And if you get out of sync the \nauthorizations/appropriations cycle, it does not work to the benefit of \nthe overall Department.\n  On this issue, there is a bipartisan feeling. I am going to move to \ntable, against the will of a considerable number of my colleagues, and \nI know that there are others here who are going to join me; I don't \nknow what in number. So it is not, I think, quite the political \nstructure as our distinguished Democratic leader has observed.\n  So, Mr. President, what I would like to do is to ask unanimous \nconsent that I be recognized in 5 minutes for the purpose of tabling, \nand that 5 minutes is to accommodate the Senator from California so \nthat she might make her remarks.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. COATS. Reserving the right to object, if there is going to be \nadditional time allotted--the Senator from Arkansas spoke; the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts spoke--if there is going to be additional time \nallotted, I believe it ought to be allotted on an equally shared basis. \nIf additional Senators are going to speak, this Senator would like to \nspeak for an equal amount of time, whatever that time is.\n  Mr. WARNER. I know the leadership is quite anxious to have this vote. \nWhy don't we just ask for--say I be recognized in 8 minutes--for 4 \nminutes on this side and 4 minutes on this side in the control of--does \nthe Senator from Indiana wish to control the 4 minutes?\n  Mr. COATS. I would be happy to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. LUGAR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Reserving the right to object, let me inquire of the \nmanager, the Rose Garden signing for our agriculture research bill \noccurs at 10:30. My hope had been that the vote would occur--I think \nthat perhaps was the manager's intent--so that those of us involved in \nthat legislation could be there. Therefore, the additional time gives \nsome of us a problem.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might just speak with the Democratic \nleader.\n  Mr. President, we did our very best to accommodate the Senator from \nCalifornia. The Senator from Virginia now moves to table amendment No. \n2737 and asks for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 2737. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

The amendment is divided.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered on division I.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I inquire of the Senator from \nCalifornia as to how long she would foresee speaking? There were a \nnumber of comments made as to my motivation on this amendment and \nquestioning the timeliness. I would like to have an opportunity to \nrespond.\n  In addition, we have a division on the amendment and I would like to \nspeak to that division of my amendment.\n  Rather than yielding for a lengthy speech, I think we need to proceed \nwith the division.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if I may respond, I will try to \ntruncate my remarks to the distinguished Senator.\n  This is a major interest of mine. I believe I have some things to say \nabout the resolution, the situation in general, which have some merit. \nThere is no time agreement at the present time, and I have been \nwaiting.\n  I would like to make my remarks in their entirety.\n\n\n               Division I Of amendment 2737, as modified\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, the pending business is the division, \nthe first amendment dealing with forced abortions. I would be glad to \nyield 5 minutes to the Senator from California to make some remarks, \nbut I would really like----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Presiding Officer would observe there is \nno time agreed to.\n  The Senator from Arkansas has the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nCalifornia be granted 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. An objection is heard.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, the amendment before the Senate deals \nwith forced abortions, forced abortions in China. Some of the comments \nearlier regarding this amendment questioned my motivation in offering--\n--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has the floor.\n\n[[Page S6840]]\n\n There was an objection to the request by the Senator from California \nin regard to her request, so the Senator from Arkansas has the floor \nand the Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank you, Mr. President.\n  Questions were raised as to my intention and motivation in offering \nan amendment on forced abortions in China. I would like to point out to \nmy colleagues who question my motivation of the timing of the \namendments, these are amendments, word for word, that passed the House \nof Representatives last year. They passed the House of Representatives \nlast year.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I will not yield for a question at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator declines to yield.\n  The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. The question was raised as to the timing of these \namendments being offered. The accusation was made this is strictly to \nscore political points. I have no desire to score political points. I \nwould have greatly desired to have the amendments voted on 1 month ago, \n2 months ago, or 6 months ago.\n  Those who have followed the China policy debate will be well aware \nthat these amendments passed the U.S. House of Representatives last \nyear, have been pending in the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Senate \nfor months, and have languished in that committee without having a \nhearing.\n  Therefore, I think it was perfectly appropriate to file these \namendments. The forced abortion amendment was filed more than a month \nago on the Department of Defense authorization bill. The provision in \nthe overall amendment dealing with religious persecution in China was \nfiled May 18, well over a month ago.\n  I remind my colleague there was never any intent that somehow this \ndebate, on the eve of the President's trip to China--if we had not had \na 4-week hiatus in debating tobacco in this Chamber, perhaps we would \nhave had DOD up a month ago and would have had an opportunity to have \nthese amendments voted on a month ago. But that wasn't the case. To \nquestion my motivation and the motivation of many of my colleagues who \nfeel very deeply about the human rights abuses that are ongoing in \nChina today, I think, is to do us a disservice; and to question our \npatriotism is wrong. In fact, to question our support for the President \nas he makes this trip is wrong, because I do support him. To the extent \nthat he will raise human rights issues, to the extent that he will \nengage Chinese leadership on nuclear proliferation and proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction, and to the extent that the President will \nengage the Chinese leadership on trade issues, I support him for that. \nI am glad for that. I believe the amendments I have offered will \nstrengthen the President's ability to deal with the Chinese Government \non these sensitive human rights issues.\n\n  We have talked somewhat about the forced abortion provision. I think \nit is an important part of this. The very powerful subcommittee hearing \nthat Congressman Chris Smith had only a couple of weeks ago, which \nreceived wide publicity, perhaps brought to a new level the awareness \nof the American people regarding the terrible practice of coerced \nabortions and coerced sterilizations in China today. That is the \namendment that is before us at this time.\n  People have questioned why we should deal with China and not deal \nwith the broader context of a host of human rights abuses that exist \naround the world. During the course of the debate on China, I have \nheard repeatedly that we should not try to isolate China and that one \nout of every four people in the world lives in China. That is why it is \nworthwhile for us to deal with the human rights abuses in this nation \nsingularly and specifically. And, truly, the kinds of practices that \nhave been all too commonplace in China deserve our attention.\n  I also point out to my colleagues that the issue before us in this \namendment is not one of being pro-life or being pro-choice, because \npeople on both sides of the life issue condemn the kinds of practices \nthat are going on in China today in which coerced abortions are used in \ntoo many cases, where the one-child family planning policy has not been \nadhered to.\n  So I believe that not only is this a timely amendment, in the sense \nthat it passed the House last year and has been languishing--we have \nnot had an opportunity. Amendments were filed over a year ago. It is \nquite appropriate that we deal specifically with the case of China and \nthe abuses that are going on there. Once again, had the President \ndelayed the trip, if he were going in November, I would still be \npushing for these amendments to be voted on now. I am not a Johnny-\ncome-lately to the China debate. We were involved in this during the \nMFN debates during my 4 years in the House. This is an issue I feel \nstrongly about. It is an issue I am simply not going to be quiet about. \nI think if we are to highlight the kinds of freedoms that we as \nAmericans cherish on the eve of our President's trip to a country that \nis repressed--and today we found out that even three reporters with \nRadio Free Asia are being denied visas--this is an opportunity for us \nto do it. We can do it in this country by even disagreeing, at times, \nwith the foreign policy of our country.\n  (Mr. GRAMS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield for two questions?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Yes, without losing the floor, I will be glad to \nyield for a question.\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator just mentioned the denial, or the reported \ndenial, of visas for three people from Radio Free Asia who, as I \ngather, wanted to be part of the trip to China and to accompany the \nPresident's entourage to report on defense. Do I understand that to be \nthe news report that the Senator from Arkansas was just referring to?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I say to the Senator, it is my understanding that \nthey had already been approved by the administration to travel to China \nand that it was only at the 11th hour that the Chinese Government \ndenied their visas and their right to go and provide coverage for the \nPresident's summit in Beijing.\n  Mr. KYL. Right. It seems to me--and this is the predicate for my \nsecond question--many of us are uncomfortable with some of the \nsanctions that we have automatically initiated. I personally have some \nconcern about the sanctions on India and Pakistan, for example, \nnotwithstanding the objection, of course, to what they did. The \nquestion has been asked: If not sanctions, then what?\n  I remember when I was in the House of Representatives asking the \nquestion of the then-Secretary of Defense, what kind of foreign policy \noptions do we have diplomatically, economically, militarily, and so on, \nif we are not going to invoke sanctions, trying to affect policies in \nother countries that we have deep disagreement with, including the kind \nof policies the Senator from Arkansas was talking about. One of his \nanswers was that there are literally hundreds of decisions each week \nthat are made by various Departments of the U.S. Government, as well as \nprivate entities, that have some impact on our relationships with \nanother country.\n  One of the things I recall having been mentioned was visa policy, for \nexample. Now, the Chinese Government appears to be using the granting \nor denial of visas to make points with respect to their foreign policy. \nIf the Senator from Arkansas is correct--and I recall the news report \nthis morning--they are actually denying the visas of three people whom \nthey have a beef with because they have been involved in sending \nsignals, radio transmissions about freedom, to their country, and \napparently they don't like that. One way of dealing with it is to deny \nthe visas of these three people--at least, if I have that correct.\n\n  My question to the Senator from Arkansas is: Is it his view that \npolicies such as dealing with visas of people wanting to travel from \nanother country to China are perhaps another more focused, more \ntargeted, more sophisticated way to deal with some of these policy \nissues than just slapping on sanctions--although there are appropriate \nsanctions--depending on what the situation is?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I appreciate the question. I think the Senator is \nexactly right, that visas and the denial of visas can be used to make a \npolitical point.\n\n[[Page S6841]]\n\n The irony of the vote we just cast has not been lost upon you. I hope \nit hasn't been lost upon the people of the United States. We basically \ndenied a vote and we rejected the possibility of voting up or down on \ndenying visas for those where there is credible evidence that they are \ninvolved in forced abortions or religious persecution. We do that on \nthe day that, as the news reported, the Chinese denied visas to those \nseeking to report on news events, to report to the people of China what \nis going on at the summit.\n  So it is highly ironic. I know Senator Kyl has been greatly involved \nin the broader reform of our sanctions laws. I think that is a \nworthwhile endeavor. But that effort does not preclude us from taking \nthese kinds of narrowly targeted actions. That is why the amendment \ndealing with forced abortions and the denial of visas to those involved \nin forced abortions and forced sterilization is an appropriate step for \nus to take, short of MFN, short of trade sanctions, but still with the \nability to send a very powerful message.\n  Mr. KYL. May I ask one other question?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I will yield for a question without losing my right \nto the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. The headline is ``Beijing Pulls Visas of Three U.S. \nReporters; Move Targets Radio Free Asia.''\n  Deep in the article, it is noted that the three reporters were not \nall American citizens, but that is really irrelevant to the point here. \nThe point is that the Chinese Government, apparently, uses the granting \nor denial of visas as a way to effectuate aspects of its foreign \npolicy. It would be difficult, therefore, it seems to me, for the \nChinese Government to argue that there is anything wrong with the \nUnited States Government using that same kind of visa authority to make \npoints with respect to our foreign policy.\n  My question is this: If it is United States policy that the kind of \nforced sterilization and abortion policy China has is inimical to the \nhuman rights and freedoms that we enjoy here in the United States and \nhave urged upon the Chinese people, then why would it be inappropriate \nfor the United States Government to use the very same--let me rephrase \nthe question. What would lead us to think that the Chinese Government \nwould have any right to object to the use of visa policy, since the \nChinese Government itself has used visa policy to effectuate their \nforeign policy considerations?\n  Why would there be any objection, per se, to the use of visa policy \nby the United States?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Your logic is compelling. There should be no \nobjection to the United States utilizing denial of visas as a \nfurtherance of our foreign policy and our belief in human rights, \nbecause it is now obvious that it is the practice of the Chinese \nGovernment, when they feel it is in their security interests or their \nnational interests, to deny visas. They have no compunction about doing \nthat. In fact, to me, as we look at the buildup to this trip, there has \nbeen a lot of give and take, a lot of negotiating that has gone on. It \nseems to me that we have made many concessions in leading up to this \ntrip. We have been concerned about embarrassing, about causing them to \nlose faith, about being insensitive to their situation. But for the \nChinese Government to deny visas for Radio Free Asia reporters I think \nis a tremendous kick in the teeth to the American Government and to the \nAmerican people, who value the freedom of the press so preciously and \nput such high esteem upon that freedom.\n  So it is unfortunate that this has happened, and it is, I think, all \ntoo reflective of the attitude of the Chinese Government toward the \nfreedom of the press and freedom in general to have made this \nclampdown. They just do not seem to get it--rounding up dissidents in \nTiananmen Square in preparation for the President. We would rather have \na protester there. How heartening it would be to the American people to \nsee someone holding up a sign saying ``Free Tibet'' there in Tiananmen \nSquare. But no. Their idea is stability at all costs, even if that \nmeans repression of the Chinese people.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I yield to the Senator from Missouri while \ncontrolling the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. If I am not mistaken, Congressman Smith held a pretty \ndramatic set of hearings, and there was testimony at the hearing about \nforced abortions in China. Is the Senator aware of that hearing?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I am quite aware of that hearing.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I suppose that the Senator is aware of the testimony \nthat was given at that hearing.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I say to the Senator from Missouri, in answering the \nquestion, that I am quite aware of the testimony. I have examined \nclosely the testimony that was presented, especially by Ms. Gao Xiao \nDuan.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Is this the woman who was there at the site, \nunderstanding exactly what was happening there?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. She was actually the director, it is my \nunderstanding, and supervised and implemented the one-child policy.\n  Further yielding for a question.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. So she was the person who was implementing a one-child \npolicy, which was a policy of forcing abortions for subsequent \npregnancies.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. That is my understanding. And she was quite accurate \nin her testimony.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Did she say there were techniques used to make people \nget abortions, that there was intimidation?\n  I have heard they threatened to burn houses and that they did other \nthings that would intimidate individuals.\n  Was that part of the testimony?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. It indeed was.\n  Let me read one statement that Ms. Gao Xiao Duan made in her \ntestimony. She said, ``In all of those 14 years I was a monster in the \ndaytime injuring others by the Chinese Communist authorities' barbaric, \nplanned birth policy. But, in the evening, I was like all other women \nand mothers enjoying my life with my children. I could not live such a \ndual life any more. To all those injured women, to all those children \nwho were killed, I want to repent and say sincerely that I am sorry.''\n  That was very powerful testimony that she presented that day.\n  She did talk about methods of intimidation and the fines that were \nenforced, as well as the physical intimidation, and the carrying them \noff to jail if they refused to have an abortion, and the very severe \nphysical methods that were used, as well as the financial.\n  Yielding for a question.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. There was incarceration. I am asking the Senator: If \nthe woman refused to get an abortion, she would be hauled off to jail?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. That is correct.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Beyond that, they would take the resources, by fining \nher, that she might otherwise use to support her family.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. The Senator is correct. They called them--\n``population jail cells'' was the terminology that she used. Women were \nrounded up, held in population jail cells, forced and coerced to submit \nto the killing of their children. There was, I think, an eye opener for \nthe American people to hear this very powerful testimony.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. This is the testimony of an individual who was involved \nin the practice. Is this some American reporter who has testimony or an \nindividual who was part of this operation?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. In responding to the question of the Senator from \nMissouri, she was the former head of China's planned birth control \noffice from 1984 to 1998. For 14 years she held that position. Only \nrecently did she leave.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Was her testimony such that this was an isolated \nincident, or was her testimony that this was the kind of pattern or \npractice that had been done over a term of years?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. It was presented as being a very common practice. I \nthink maybe that was part of what was so shocking. I say to the Senator \nfrom Missouri, in response to the question, that the presentation in \ndefense of China has been that these are isolated instances of coerced \nabortion and forced sterilizations, that they are in remote areas, \ndifficult areas to enforce, that the central Government doesn't approve \nof this, local forces simply do it on their own. I think the testimony \nof this person, who was the head of the office, actively involved in \nit, demonstrates this was a very systematic, planned program of \ncoercion that was used across the nation in villages and cities.\n\n[[Page S6842]]\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I take it the Senator doesn't use the word ``coercion'' \nlightly. This isn't just an abortion clinic; this is a place where \npeople were forced to go to have abortions.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. The Senator is correct. I did not use the term \n``coercion'' lightly. I think ``coercion'' has to be beyond merely \nfines, although fines can very be intimidating. Homes were wrecked and \ndestroyed, and the person wasn't able to pay the fine, if they violated \nthe one-child policy.\n  I yield for a further question.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Is the Senator telling me that if the person was jailed \nand fined and the fines somehow didn't deter the individuals, their \nhomes were destroyed?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. The Senator is correct. That is why I think the term \n``coercion'' is the proper term, because it involved physical force. \nThey would be physically removed. They would be taken to jail cells. \nThey would be forced to have an abortion.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The Senator's amendment is designed to say that the \nUnited States of America--I am asking the question--will not extend \nvisas to individuals who were involved in this kind of coerced abortion \nactivity?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Responding to the Senator, this amendment condemns \nthe practice, which I am sure everybody in this Chamber would. It goes \nfurther and says that visas will be denied to those individuals for \nwhom there is credible evidence that they have been involved in \nperpetrating the practice of coerced abortions. That credible evidence \nwould be determined by the Department of State, by the Secretary of \nState herself, if need be.\n  When we talk about enforcement, when we talk about the number of \npeople involved, we are talking here, speaking in this amendment, about \ncredible evidence, and there are human rights groups as well who \nmonitor the conditions in China, who monitor human rights abuses in \nChina, who come forward with reports. And there will be and has been \nfrom time to time evidence of individuals who are involved in this \nhorrendous practice. We would say those individuals for whom there is \ncredible evidence that they have been involved in forced abortions \nshould not be allowed to receive a visa and travel to the United \nStates.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. May I ask the Senator one more question?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I will be glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. So the Senator's amendment is not to deny a visa to \nsomeone who had an abortion or someone who has participated in an \nabortion clinic that wasn't a coerced abortion. You are just focused on \nthis situation where people were intimidated, coerced, sometimes \njailed, sometimes fined, sometimes actually had their homes demolished \nto force them to destroy an unborn child. Your amendment focuses on \npersons who are involved in that kind of coercive behavior to force \nindividuals--who want to preserve the life of the child--to destroy the \nchild. Those individuals are the ones that would be denied a visa to \nenter the United States by this amendment.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. In response to the Senator's question, it is the \nperpetrator that we are concerned about, it is the person who is \nenforcing this terrible inhumane policy, brutal policy, grizzly \npractice of the Government. This certainly isn't the victim. This is a \nvery pro-victim amendment. We want to defend the rights.\n  I might add again, as I said before, that this is not a pro-life, \npro-choice issue.\n  We are dealing here with a practice that is condemned by all \ncivilized societies and that is coerced; forced abortions using \nphysical force to compel a woman to have an abortion against her will. \nTo vote on this, whether it was a month ago, or whether it be 6 months \nago, or on this, the eve of the President's trip, in no way would \nundercut the ability of the Chief Executive of this country to speak \nabout our foreign policy and our values as a people. In fact, I believe \nsincerely this will strengthen the ability of our Chief Executive, our \nPresident, to go to China, to go to Beijing, to speak with Chinese \nofficials and to defend our values with the full support of the Senate \nand the House of Representatives and the American people.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. May I ask another question?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I will yield for an additional question.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The Chinese have intimated that they can't control \ncoercive abortion activity in remote regions. I think the testimony we \nhave heard belies that, but the Chinese officials say this is in remote \nareas. Would the Senator say that China also is unable to control \npolitical discussion and political dissent, or are they pretty good at \ncontrolling political dissent and just not very good at controlling \ncoerced abortions?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. In response to the Senator's question, what belies \nthe contention that this is a matter of enforcement, what belies the \ndefense that the China apologists make that these are remote areas, it \nis a vast country, that there is no possible way to prevent some of \nthese abuses, what belies that is, in fact, our own State Department's \nreport which indicates that all political dissidents have been rounded \nup; that they are--if you hold a protest in some distant province, I \nassure you the central Government is going to know about it and that \nyou are going to be dealing with the central Government. And so the \nability of the central Government to control free speech, free press, \nfreedom of expression really refutes the notion that they are unable to \nenforce a policy against coerced abortions.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Would the Senator say----\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I will yield for an additional question.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The Senator would say, then, that if the Chinese \nGovernment were as vigorous in its defense of the freedom of \nindividuals to have children without destroying them as it is to \nrepress the freedom of people to speak against the government, there \nwould be a far different situation in China today?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I certainly agree with that statement. I agree. In \nanswering the question, I think that is a correct assertion; that if as \nmuch intensity were placed on opening China, on encouraging free \nexpression, on encouraging dissent, as there is on the enforcement of \nrepressive family planning policies and coercive family planning \npolicies, then I think it would be a far different China, and there \nwould be a far different attitude by the American people and by our \nGovernment.\n  The President is correct. I do not believe we can reach our full \npotential in our relationship with China until we see a revolution in \nthe structure of China, until we see a revolution in freedom in China. \nI believe that will come. The question is does it come through the \ncurrent policy, which I think fails to fully engage.\n  You know, those of us who are critics of the current administration's \nChina policy have been called isolationists. I believe the real \nisolationists in this debate are those who want to turn a blind eye to \nthings like coerced abortions, those who want to pretend that religious \npersecution is not going on in China and don't want to address it. So \nwhen we find those today who say this is the wrong timing and we don't \nwant to vote on this, this isn't the appropriate time to vote on \ncoerced abortion, this isn't the appropriate time to vote on religious \npersecution, that appears to me to be something other than an \nengagement policy. That would seem to me to be an isolationist policy. \nWe don't want to engage them. We should. We should engage them on a \nfull range of issues, including human rights.\n\n  And my concern about this administration's policy is that human \nrights, which at one time was placed on the first tier, when President \nClinton, then candidate Clinton said he would not coddle dictators from \nBaghdad to Beijing, that now is dropped from the first tier to at least \nthe third tier, with trade being No. 1; security, to the extent it is \nbeing engaged, No 2; and human rights dropping down to No. 3. I \nbelieve, if we are going to have a policy of engagement--and truly have \na policy of engagement--we must fully engage them equally on all of \nthese fronts.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator from Arkansas yield for another \nquestion?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I yield for another question.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Does the Senator from Arkansas feel that the way China \ntreats its own citizens--its willingness\n\n[[Page S6843]]\n\nto coerce them into having forced abortions--reflects the way they feel \nabout human rights and the way they feel about the rights of citizens \naround the world? And would he care to comment on how that might \nreflect the rather callous view of the Chinese who are targeting \nAmerican citizens with what they call city-buster nuclear weapons on \ntheir ICBMs? Does the Senator think there is a relationship between \nthis disregard for life that is expressed in coerced abortion policy \nand the willingness to target peace-loving people in the United States \nwith city-buster nuclear weapons on long-range ICBMs?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. In response to the Senator's question, I would say to \nthe Senator from Missouri that, indeed, there is a relationship. I \nbelieve that when life is cheapened in one area, whether that is \ndemonstrated through forced labor, slave labor camps, laogai camps, as \nthey are called in China; whether it is demonstrated through religious \npersecution and the exile and execution of religious dissidents, \nreligious minorities, or whether it is demonstrated through coerced \nabortion practices, the cheapening of human life carries over into all \naspects of a nation's policy. So the willingness of the Chinese \nGovernment, according to the CIA report, to have 13 of their ICBMs \ntargeting the American cities--and as the Senator calls them, city-\nbusters, because the purpose is to have a wide devastation--I think it \nis related, directly related to that cheapening of human life and the \nlack of respect for the dignity of human life.\n  So I would respond to the Senator that way. I certainly think there \nis a relationship. I appreciate the Senator's question.\n  I would just say in concluding on this amendment that our own State \nDepartment in issuing its China Country Report for 1997 on Human Rights \nPractices in China addressed this issue of forced abortions. I will \nonly read a small portion of the State Department's report. I think it \nunderscores how serious the situation is. This isn't something that \nhuman rights activists on the left and the right in the United States \nare dreaming up. It is not some fiction that we have created. Our own \nState Department, in examining the human rights conditions in China, \nhas assessed it this way.\n\n       Penalties for excess births can also be levied against \n     local officials and the mothers' work units, thus creating \n     multiple sources of pressure. Fines for giving birth without \n     authorization vary, but they can be a formidable \n     disincentive. According to the State Family Planning \n     Commission 1996 family planning manual, over 24 million fines \n     were assessed between 1985 and 1993 for children born outside \n     family planning rules. In Fujian, the standard fine has been \n     calculated to be twice a family's gross annual income.\n\n  That is to violate the family planning rulings in China makes you \nsuspect, makes you vulnerable to a fine that would be twice your gross \nannual income. That is an incredibly difficult burden to place on this \nkind of a so-called violation.\n\n       Additional unauthorized births incur fines assessed in \n     increments of 50 percent per child. In Guangzhou the standard \n     fine is calculated to be 30 to 50 percent of 7 years' income \n     for the average resident. In some cases a ``social \n     compensation fee'' is also imposed. Unpaid fines have \n     sometimes resulted in confiscation or destruction of homes \n     and personal property by local officials. Central government \n     officials acknowledge that such incidents occur, but insist \n     that cases like these are not the norm nor in line with \n     official policy.\n       The government prohibits the use of force to compel persons \n     to submit to abortion or sterilization, but poor supervision \n     of local officials who are under intense pressure to meet \n     family planning targets can result in instances of abuse \n     including forced abortion and sterilization.\n\n  And the report goes on into great detail, and I think provides clear \ndocumentation for the need for this amendment.\n  I think also if you consider, once again, the testimony that was \npresented before the House Subcommittee on International Operations and \nHuman Rights, the testimony concerning the implementation of the \nabortion policy of China and the one-child policy of China is truly \nfrightening. I will simply read some of these points to establish the \nroutine the family planning bureau is following:\n\n       I. To establish a computer bank of all women of child-\n     bearing age in the town [whatever town size it might be], \n     including their dates of birth, marriages, children, \n     contraceptive ring insertions, pregnancies, abortions, child-\n     bearing capabilities, etc.\n       II. To issue ``birth-allowed certificates'' to women who \n     meet the policy and regulations of the central and provincial \n     planned-birth committees, and are therefore allowed to give \n     birth to children. . . . Without a certificate, women are not \n     allowed to give birth to children.\n\n  You have to apply. You have to get a certificate. You have to get \npermission to birth a child.\n\n       Should a woman be found pregnant without a certificate, \n     abortion surgery is performed immediately, regardless of how \n     many months she is pregnant.\n\n  I spoke earlier that estimates range as high as a half-million third \ntrimester abortions in China each year. And then, to issue ``birth not \nallowed'' notices. Such notices are sent to couples when the data \nconcludes that they do not meet the requirements of the policy and are, \ntherefore, not allowed to give birth. A couple whose first born is a \nboy, or whose first born is a girl but who give birth to a second \nchild, boy or girl, receives such a notice after a period of 3 years \nand 2 months. Such notices are made public. The purpose of this is to \nmake it known to everyone that the couple is in violation of the \npolicy, therefore facilitating supervision of the couple.\n  They issue birth control measure implementation notices. They impose \nmonetary penalties on those who violate the provincial regulations. \nShould they refuse to pay these penalties, supervision team members \nwill apprehend and detain them as long as they do not pay.\n  The PBO regularly supervises and examines how staff members of \nPlanned Parenthood offices in 22 villages perform their duties. They \nwrite monthly synopses of the planned birth reports, which are signed \nby the town head and the town Communist Party. They analyze informant \nmaterials. They have established, in China, a system of informants in \naccordance with the informing system, and have put these cases on file \nfor investigation.\n  They have planned birth cadres. There was testimony before \nCongressman Smith's subcommittee indicating that these cadres, and the \nnumber of people involved in this program, has increased dramatically \nin recent years, indicating that rather than retreating from this \ncoercive practice, they, instead, are pursuing it with new vigor.\n  We go on in this testimony. I think it should be a concern to all \nAmericans that this practice is being tolerated and that we have not \ntaken, as the foreign policy of our country, a strong, strong position \nwhich this amendment would allow us to do.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Arkansas for \nhis outstanding work in this respect. I believe this is an item upon \nwhich the Senate must vote, ought to vote, should vote. I am distressed \nthat the minority leader has indicated that votes on these issues would \nbe inappropriate. It seems like they are an embarrassment, potentially, \nto the President. I think the policy which we have pursued is an \nembarrassment to the United States of America, and I think we need to \nchange our policy to make clear that we reject the kind of activity \nwhich has been spoken of by the Senator from Arkansas.\n  With that particular thought in mind, and understanding the merit of \nthis particular division, which would deny visas to those who have been \nactively involved and for whom credible evidence has been developed in \nthe coerced abortion area, I move to table the first division of \nSenator Hutchinson's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion to table.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll to ascertain the \npresence of a quorum.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I further ask unanimous consent that the motion be \ntemporarily laid aside for Senator Feinstein to speak. Following her \nstatement, no later than 12:30, the tabling vote to occur.\n\n[[Page S6844]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is now recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise on this occasion to share \nseveral thoughts. Let me begin by saying, on the amendment before us, I \ndon't believe there is any Member of this body who is for forced \nabortion. I do not believe there is any Member of this body who would \ncountenance it, who believes it is good public policy and who is \nreserved about saying that. Therefore, I think we would all hope the \nPresident of the United States would come back with a specific \ncommitment in this area from China.\n  The question I have, that is deeply disturbing to me, is the Senate \nis being asked to consider amendments on China policy on the eve of, \nand even during, President Clinton's visit to China. There used to be a \nbipartisan consensus on foreign policy in this country. There used to \nbe an understanding that when the President is going overseas, Members \nof both parties would come together, would wish him well, and would \nsupport him. I think, certainly in the last 10 or 15 years, this has \nbeen the case. I am very concerned that some are using U.S. policy and \nChina as a political or a partisan issue.\n  I note, with some disappointment, that no Republican of either House \nhas agreed to accompany the President on his trip. To me, this gives \ncredibility to the assumption that the Republicans are going to use the \ntrip in a political way. And I think this is very, very dangerous. What \nI hope to point out in my remarks is some of the danger inherent in \nthis kind of policy.\n  Let me, for a moment, talk about the amendments that are before us. \nMany are controversial. Some would ban various officials from entering \nthe United States; others would prohibit the United States from \nsupporting international loans to China; many run counterproductive to \nachieving progress with China. Rather, they push division and they \nencourage China's historic isolationist tendencies.\n  Just yesterday, language was added that would move the jurisdiction \nof certain technological export controls from the Commerce Department \nto the State Department. This is a serious proposal. It is worth \nlooking at. But the majority and minority leaders have appointed task \nforces to study the issue and assign various committees to look into \nit.\n  The vote on this proposal today would be to render a verdict on an \ninvestigation when that investigation has barely gotten underway. \nAnyone who thinks the President's trip will be made more successful by \nthe Senate's consideration of these issues knows very little about \nChina.\n  I think the President's trip represents an important step forward in \nbuilding a healthy United States-China relationship. We have major \ninterests. Human rights? Of course, including religious freedom and \nautonomy for the people of Tibet.\n  For 9 years, I have been bringing messages from the Dalai Lama to the \nPresident of China asking that there be discussions between the two. I \nhope that the President will plead that cause, both with President \nJiang Zemin as well as in his public addresses in university settings.\n  But right now the times are extremely urgent. We have a kind of \neconomic meltdown going on throughout most of the Asian continent. And \nthis financial crisis is combined with the very serious situation with \nrespect to India and Pakistan.\n  To underline the dangers that India, Pakistan, and, indeed, the \nentire international community are faced with on the eve of this trip, \nI would like to take a few minutes here today to review what we know \nabout the Indian and Pakistani nuclear programs, their capabilities, \nand what would likely result in a nuclear exchange between India and \nPakistan if we are unable to forge a real and lasting peace in the \nregion and the current south Asian political and security environment.\n  First, what kind of nuclear weapons did India and Pakistan test?\n  The Indian Government claims to have tested three different designs \non May 11, 1998: a fission bomb with a yield of 12 kilotons, explosive \npower equivalent to 12,000 tons of TNT; a ``thermonuclear device,'' \nwith the yield of 43 kilotons; and a ``low-yield'' device. On May 13, \nIndia claims to have tested two additional devices that produced a \ntotal yield of less than 1 kiloton.\n  For comparison, the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945 produced an \nestimated yield of 18 kilotons. So one of these Indian tests was over \n2\\1/2\\ times the size of the Hiroshima bomb.\n  According to leading nongovernmental analysts, the low-yield device \ntested in May of this year was likely a compact design intended for \ndeployment on India's medium-range missiles. The subkiloton tests, \naccording to India, provided information needed to perfect computer \nsimulations of nuclear explosions that could be used in subsequent \nweapons design work, possibly without the need for future testing.\n\n  For its part, Pakistan claims to have detonated five simultaneous \nnuclear tests on May 28, of boosted devices made with highly enriched \nuranium, which Samar Mobarik Mand, head of their nuclear test program, \nclaimed produced a total yield in the range of 40 to 45 kilotons. Bear \nin mind again, Hiroshima was 18. Pakistan conducted an additional \nnuclear test on May 30. Mand claimed the yield was in the range of 15 \nto 18 kilotons.\n  Pakistan has stated that all six tests were boosted fission devices, \nsome of which are designed for deployment on the new Ghauri medium-\nrange missile. The head of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program, A.Q. \nKhan, claims that although Pakistan has not built a hydrogen bomb, it \nhas conducted research and is capable of building such a device should \nthe Government decide to do so.\n  U.S. intelligence, as well as independent analysts, have raised some \nserious questions about the claims made by both India and Pakistan \nregarding the number and yield of the tests each has claimed to have \nconducted. Although there is a certain reassurance to be found in these \nquestions--perhaps neither India nor Pakistan is as far along in \ndeveloping nuclear weapons as they might like us to believe--\nultimately, such quibbling rings hollow.\n  Regardless of the exact number or the exact yield of the Indian and \nPakistani tests, these tests have made it abundantly clear that both \nIndia and Pakistan must now be considered capable of developing and \ndeploying nuclear weapons, and that both hope to gain political and \nsecurity leverage from this capability.\n  Secondly, although neither India nor Pakistan are now nuclear weapons \nstates, given their demonstrated capabilities, how many nuclear weapons \ncould India and Pakistan make?\n  India's nuclear bombs are fueled by plutonium, a manmade byproduct of \nfissioning uranium in nuclear reactors. At the end of 1995, India had a \ntotal inventory of 315 to 345 kilograms of weapons-grade plutonium, \naccording to a study of world plutonium and highly enriched uranium \ninventories by independent analysts David Albright, Frans Berkhout, and \nWilliam Walker.\n  Assuming that 5 kilograms of plutonium are required to build a bomb, \nthis would give India enough plutonium for some 63 to 69 weapons. So \nlet us assume they have that ability.\n  Pakistan's bombs are fueled with highly enriched uranium, enriched at \nits unsafeguarded centrifuge facility at Kahuta. Under pressure from \nthe United States, Pakistan halted production of highly enriched \nuranium in 1991, but reportedly resumed highly enriched uranium \nproduction some months ago. After last month's tests, Pakistan still \npossesses 335 to 400 kilograms of weapons-grade uranium, enough for \nsome 16 to 20 nuclear bombs, according to the Institute for Science and \nInternational Security.\n  If Pakistan is using boosted warhead designs, as it claims, it would \nproduce a considerably larger number of weapons from the same amount of \nmaterial, depending on the considerations of yield and weight of \nindividual warheads.\n  In addition, earlier this year, Pakistan's unsafeguarded plutonium \nproduction reactor at Khushab went into\n\n[[Page S6845]]\n\noperation. It is estimated that this reactor can produce enough \nplutonium for at least one to three bombs a year.\n  Thirdly, how would India and Pakistan deliver these nuclear weapons? \nBoth nations possess advanced military aircraft that would be capable \nof delivering nuclear weapons. India's military deploys such aircraft \nas the Jaguar, the Mirage 2000, the MiG-27, and the MiG-29. Pakistan's \nmilitary aircraft include nuclear-capable, United States-supplied F-16 \nfighters.\n  Of greater concern, because of their speed and invulnerability to \nconventional air-defense systems, are both nations' ballistic missiles.\n  India's Privthi missile, based on the U.S. Scout, has a range of 150-\n250 kilometers, depending upon the size of the payload. The two-stage \nAgni missile, based upon Soviet and German technology, has a much \ngreater range, 1,500 to 2,500 kilometers. India claims the ability to \nhit targets anywhere in Pakistan with the Agni missile.\n  Pakistan is believed to have about 30 nuclear-capable M-11 missiles \nsupplied by China. This is a bad thing. The second load of M-11s, to \nall intents and purposes, have never been delivered. We believe it is \nimportant that the President secure, ratify, and maintain the \ncommitment that no further M-11s be sent by China to Pakistan. These \nmissiles have a range of 280-300 kilometers.\n  Pakistan's recently developed Ghauri missile, developed with the \nChinese' and North Korea's assistance, has a range of 1,500 kilometers. \nIts flight tests in early April may have been one of the factors that \nmoved India's Government to resume nuclear testing.\n  A.Q. Khan, father of the Pakistani bomb, claims that the nuclear \ndevices tested by Pakistan ``could very easily be put on our Ghauri \nmissiles.'' According to Kahn, Ghauri is the only nuclear-capable \nPakistani missile at this time but other missiles could be modified for \nthe mission if necessary. These missiles reduce warning time on both \nsides to nearly zero, making any nuclear crisis extremely unstable. \nIndia could hit targets in Pakistan in 4 minutes, and Pakistan could \nhit Indian targets in under 12 minutes.\n  All of this development has been going on, and we are debating forced \nabortion, but we have this ``macro'' situation evolving right on \nChina's doorstep.\n  Now, what would be the likely result of a nuclear exchange between \nIndia and Pakistan? In 1990, when President Bush was first unable to \ncertify under the Pressler amendment that Pakistan had not acquired \nnuclear capability, the Department of Energy requested the Program in \nArms Control, Disarmament, and International Security at the University \nof Illinois to conduct a study of nuclear proliferation in south Asia. \nOne of the papers commissioned for that study estimates what the \ncasualties of that war would be if India and Pakistan were to wage war. \nThe study, based on unclassified sources, projected damage for three \ndifferent scenarios, depending on the size and scale of a nuclear \nexchange between India and Pakistan, from a war with limited nuclear \nretaliation to a full-scale exchange.\n  The results are chilling. At the lowest level, the study determined \nthat there would be between 500,000 and 1 million immediate fatalities \non each side in a limited nuclear exchange where the only targets were \nmilitary centers--500,000 to 1 million people killed in a limited \nexchange of only military centers. At least another million people \nwould be injured in the attacks, and hundreds of thousands more could \nbe expected to die in the fallout and nuclear poisoning which would \nfollow.\n  In a larger exchange which would include an attack on urban centers \nin both countries, this study estimated that, at a minimum, there would \nbe 15 million Pakistani and 30 million Indian immediate fatalities, \nwith millions more injured and expensive economic disruption. South \nAsia would be reduced to a virtual wasteland.\n  These projections, I should point out, were based on a 1980 census \ndata projected to 1990. If these figures were recreated today, we could \nexpect the projections, with current census figures, to be that much \ngreater.\n\n  Think about the magnitude of such a disaster--45 million immediate \ndeaths within a matter of minutes, almost as many killed in India and \nPakistan in a few minutes as were killed around the world during the \nentire 6 years of World War II. It is a number that boggles the mind. \nIn fact, I find it difficult to believe that I find myself here on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate discussing such scenarios, such carnage, such \nloss of human life; it is not within the realm of reality. Yet today \nthis is precisely the danger which India and Pakistan face unless both \nstates, with the support and assistance of the international \ncommunity--and that includes both China and the United States--are able \nto take clear and immediate steps to end the current crisis and begin \nthe process of building peace in Asia.\n  This brings me to the final issue I would like to address: What is \nthe current security and political environment in south Asia?\n  In the aftermath of the tests, both India and Pakistan have indicated \na willingness to enter into peace talks. On June 12, the Indian Foreign \nMinistry stated, ``India is committed to fostering a relationship of \ntrust and friendship with Pakistan based on mutual respect and regard \nfor each other's concerns.'' Pakistan has also offered to resume peace \ntalks. Neither side, however, appears willing to act to back up this \nrhetoric. Despite their stated good intentions, as of yet there is no \nagreement on a time, a place, a format, to enter into discussions to \naddress either the nuclear crisis or other important security issues \nsuch as Kashmir or the south Asian security agenda.\n  This situation is especially troubling because without any confidence \nand security-building measures in place, without any dialog and \ndiscussion, India and Pakistan are especially vulnerable to an \ninadvertent crisis or to a relatively minor incident sparking a larger \nconflict.\n  On just this past Friday--let me give an example--June 19, the press \nreported an incident in which five armed men, suspected to be Muslim \nterrorists by Indian authorities, attacked a Hindu wedding party in a \nmountain village in Kashmir, killing 25 people. Just a week earlier, \nPakistani authorities held Indian intelligence to be accountable for \nplanting a bomb on a crowded train. These are two examples of the kinds \nof incidents which could well launch a nuclear episode. Without dialog, \nfor sure these are the sorts of events that are open to \nmisinterpretation, can lead to miscalculation, escalation, and tragedy \nof the most horrific sort.\n  The President of the United States tomorrow leaves for China. We can \ndebate forced abortion. You have an unprecedented currency crisis in \nAsia. You have major turmoil in Indonesia. You have a very serious \nsituation in Thailand, in South Korea. We see the Japanese yen \ncontinuing to deteriorate even after the weekend meetings. Many people \nthere felt that Japan has no formula to recover. And you have the \nsignificance and importance escalating now, that the Chinese renminbi, \nthe Hong Kong dollar, not be devalued. This, in itself, will take an \nunprecedented act of courage on the part of the Chinese.\n  I believe substantial diplomatic pressure must be brought by the \nPresident of the United States to convince the Chinese that against all \nof this they must hold firm. At the same time, in China, you have an \nalmost impossible situation for the Chinese to maintain. You have the \nclosure of the large state-owned industries taking place and forcing \ntens of millions of people into unemployment.\n  The President of China has recently said what he considers an \nacceptable rate of unemployment--3.5 percent. It would be very lucky if \nChina could confine themselves to that figure. But to have this growing \nunemployment and still refuse to devalue their currency is a major \ngesture to the Western World, because what most of these countries seek \nto do is cut off American markets further and flood our country with \ntheir consumer goods at a lower cost. And this is precisely the reason \nwe have the trade imbalance as it is today.\n\n  So these are the macro problems, Mr. President, that I respectfully \nsubmit to you are appropriate for the major policymaking body of the \nUnited States of America to be deliberating--the future of the world. \nAnd I really regret that we get into the kind of discussion that can \nonly have one effect: drive China to\n\n[[Page S6846]]\n\nbe less cooperative, more inclined to devalue, but hopefully not less \ninclined to care about their southern border or what North Korea is \ndoing over their northeastern border. But these are problems of life \nand death for millions and millions of people. I feel so strongly and I \nso strongly urge this body that this is not the time for divisiveness. \nThis is not the time for partisanship. This is not the time for some to \nmake hay when the President of the United States is going to Asia to \nmeet with the largest exploding country on Earth to try to chart a \nrelationship that can come to grips with the nuclear facts I have just \nspelled out.\n  Facts. Facts of life. Facts like, if there is one single \nmiscalculation, like a Muslim terrorist event, another train bombing, a \npremature launching of a nuclear missile, it could result in the loss \nof tens of millions of lives all across the Asian continent. This is \nwhat our leaders should be discussing --how to develop a strategic \npartnership, how to force India and Pakistan to the table, how to set \nup the kind of commitments that are necessary to forge a consensus on \nKashmir; how to solve India border problems with China; how to open \nmarkets so that the trade imbalance does not continue; how to maintain \nintellectual property rights in China; how to have China bring in a \nretail consumer market from the United States, which they have been \nreluctant to do; how to build on the rule of law.\n  You know, people in this body are great critics--particularly people \nwho have never been to China, don't know China, have never read a \nhistory book on China, don't understand that for 5,000 years China was \ndominated by one man, generally an emperor who, at a whim, at the snap \nof his fingers, could put millions of people to death if he so chose; \nand then the revolutionary war heroes, none of whom had any education; \nand now by its first group of really educated leadership in the 5,000-\nyear history of that country. I have heard the President of China say \ndirectly that, ``We will transition from a rule of man to a rule of \nlaw, but it cannot happen overnight.''\n  Mr. President, if not the first American mayor, I was certainly one \nof the first American mayors to visit China in June of 1979, just when \nthat country was coming out of the Cultural Revolution. I have often \nsaid that what I saw there was very sobering indeed, because one \nunderstands the body language of fear. The body language of fear was \nprevalent all throughout every city in China that I visited. I have \nvisited China, and I try to go every year; the last time was in \nSeptember. The changes I have seen are astonishing. Now, remember, this \nis still a Communist government. There is no prototype on Earth for the \nkind of change that this Chinese Government is now going through.\n  I truly believe, as they now try what they call the ``socialist \nexperience,'' which we call a market economy, and as they engage with \nthe West, and as our military leaders are able to engage them--I will \nnever forget when John Glenn and Sam Nunn and I met with the Minister \nof Defense, and at the end of the conversation I said, ``Do you have \nanything else on your mind?'' He said, ``Yes.'' He said, ``One of the \nthings that I am concerned about is that we have incidents of American \nfighter planes overflying Chinese borders.'' I said, ``Well, has \nanything been done about this?'' He said, ``No.'' So I went out and \ncalled Bill Perry on the phone, who was then Secretary of State, and \nthat was taken care of.\n  It has to be known by this body that, up to just less than a month \nago, there was no red telephone between our two leaders. As a matter of \nfact, the first time our two leaders spoke on that red telephone was \nfollowing the Indian nuclear explosion, where our President called the \nPresident of China on that red telephone and said, ``Look, this has \nhappened. Will you help?'' That is when Jiang Zemin said, ``We are of \nthe same mind on this.''\n  Now, don't we want this kind of dialog to take place? Sure, we want \nto make the Chinese know that forced abortion is repugnant to a \ncivilized society, repugnant to our values, and it is brutal and \nunfair. Sure, we want them to initiate talks with the Dalai Lama, go to \nthe rule of law, provide due process of law for every citizen in China. \nThat is the guarantee for positive human rights--due process of law. \nNobody can be arrested in the middle of the night and hauled to jail \nand kept there. The first change has already been made. The Chinese \nhave changed administrative detention, which is the summary placement \nof somebody in custody, and limited it to 30 days. We all know the \njudiciary of China is under the control of the political party. This \nneeds discussion. The judiciary of China must be independent, it must \nbe paid, it must be forbidden to take money on the side. There must be \na new criminal code, a new civil code, based on a new China, a China \nthat is reaching out and interacting with the Western World, such as \nChina never has before.\n  The history of China must be understood in this. It must be known \nthat after the Boxer Rebellion, in the incident where China lost Hong \nKong in the opium wars, China was so humiliated by the West that China \nturned into itself and never wanted any intercourse with the West. Now \nwe see China changing.\n  How China changes is the President's quest. Does China go back into \nitself, reinforce its totalitarian nature, or does China open further \ninteraction with the West; have an economic democracy that one day by \nthe Taiwan model a social democracy must emerge?\n  This, I say to you, Mr. President, is the fitting goal for the \nPresident of the United States, because that will change life as we \nknow it on the planet.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Unless there is objection, the motion to table \nthe previous division is set aside temporarily, and the Senator from \nSouth Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment which \nis designed to help find a solution to the recurring problem of the \nPentagon paying exorbitant prices for spare parts that are readily \navailable in the commercial marketplace.\n  In March, we were subjected once again to troubling press accounts of \nexcessive prices being charged the Pentagon for spare parts--in one \ncase the Pentagon's Inspector General found that the Pentagon was \ncharged 280 percent more for commercially available items than in the \nprevious few years. While it is true that such instances of \novercharging are now the exception to the rule, we must do everything \nwe can to ensure that our limited defense resources are used wisely. \nThis is essential if we are to maintain public support for, and \nconfidence in, our military establishment.\n  I commend Senator Santorum for the package of legislative reforms he \nhas included in the bill before the Senate. The ``Defense Commercial \nPricing Management Improvement Act'' will go a long way toward setting \nthe Pentagon on a path to correcting the problems identified in the \nrecent DoD Inspector General reports concerning the Department's errors \nwith respect to these overpricing cases.\n  My amendment will build on the legislation in the bill, but will \nfocus on the responsibility of the contractor for providing adequate \ncost and pricing data to the government. Under current law, in the case \nof sole-source contracts for commercially available items, the \ngovernment contracting officer ``shall require submission of data other \nthan certified cost or pricing data to the extent necessary to \ndetermine the reasonableness of the price of the contract.'' Although \nit was the intent of Congress that the contractor should supply such \ndata as might be requested, that was not explicitly stated in the law \nand has not always been the practice. In the Sundstrand case reviewed \nthis past February by the DoD Inspector General, the Inspector General \nfound that ``Sundstrand * * * refused to provide DLA contracting \nofficers with `uncertified' cost or pricing data for commercial catalog \nitems.'' Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident.\n  My amendment would clarify existing law to clearly reflect the \noriginal intent of Congress by putting a positive requirement on the \ncontractor to provide cost and pricing data if such data is requested \nby the government contracting officer. If--as in the Sundstrand case--\nthe contractor refuses to provide this information to the government, \nthe contractor would be disqualified from the contract.\n  If a government contracting officer is to accurately assess the \nreasonableness of a contract price for a sole-source commercial item, \nhe or she must have access to information on prices previously charged \nboth the government and commercial sector for such item. We must not \nallow contractors to refuse to provide such information to the \ngovernment. My amendment will close a loophole in existing law by \nrequiring the submission of such cost and pricing data as the \ngovernment contracting officer determines is necessary.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendment has been cleared by this \nside.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I urge the Senate to adopt the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to thank the distinguished chairman \nand ranking member. It is just an effort by one Senator to see what we \ncan do to further eliminate the ever-present problems associated with \nthe $250 hammer, the $50 screw, and things of this nature, which by \nvirtue of the enormity of the system of procurement, will happen. But \nthis is an effort to see whether or not we can further curtail the \nnumber of incidents.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the manager.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2942) was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMichigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2943\n\n  (Purpose: To recognize and honor former South Vietnamese commandos)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Kerry of \nMassachusetts, McCain, and Smith of New Hampshire, I offer an amendment \nthat would commend the Vietnamese commandos for their service to the \nUnited States during the Vietnam war.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan (Mr. Levin), for Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n     McCain, and Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, proposes an amendment \n     numbered legislative 2943.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1064. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE HEROISM, \n                   SACRIFICE, AND SERVICE OF FORMER SOUTH \n                   VIETNAMESE COMMANDOS IN CONNECTION WITH UNITED \n                   STATES ARMED FORCES DURING THE VIETNAM \n                   CONFLICT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) South Vietnamese commandos were recruited by the United \n     States as part of OPLAN 34A or its predecessor or OPLAN 35 \n     from 1961 to 1970.\n       (2) The commandos conducted covert operations in North \n     Vietnam during the Vietnam conflict.\n       (3) Many of the commandos were captured and imprisoned by \n     North Vietnamese forces, some for as long as 20 years.\n       (4) The commandos served and fought proudly during the \n     Vietnam conflict.\n       (5) Many of the commandos lost their lives serving in \n     operations conducted by the United States during the Vietnam \n     conflict.\n       (6) Many of the Vietnamese commandos now reside in the \n     United States.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress recognizes and honors the \n     former South Vietnamese commandos for their heroism, \n     sacrifice, and service in connection with United States armed \n     forces during the Vietnam conflict.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, two years ago Senator McCain and I offered \nlegislation, enacted as part of the FY 97 Defense authorization bill, \nto reimburse some 500 Vietnamese commandos who were funded and trained \nby the United States and infiltrated behind enemy lines to perform \ncovert operations during the Vietnam War. Many of them were captured \nand incarcerated by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for years and \nultimately removed from the payroll by the U.S. government. Our \nlegislation authorized $20 million for reimbursement of the commandos \nfor their years of imprisonment in North Vietnamese prisons and \nmandated that a lump sum be provided to each claimant determined \neligible by the Secretary of Defense.\n  Pursuant to this legislation a commission has been established in the \nDefense Department and is now in the\n\n[[Page S6848]]\n\nprocess of reviewing claims. Today I am offering three amendments, with \nSenators McCain and Smith (of New Hampshire) related to the commando \nissue.\n  The first amendment, number 2943, is identical to language in the \nHouse-passed Defense authorization bill for this year. This amendment \nrecognizes and honors the commandos for their heroism, sacrifice, and \nservice to the United States during the war.\n  The second amendment, number 2944, is largely technical and is \ndesigned to assist the commission by clarifying the intent of the \noriginal legislation with respect to the payment process.\n  The third amendment, number 2945, rectifies an oversight in the \noriginal legislation. Under current law, a commando can bring a claim, \nor if the commando is deceased, his spouse or children may bring a \nclaim. Through an oversight we failed to consider the possibility that \na commando may never have married. The amendment that I am offering \nresolves this problem by stipulating that the parents, or if they are \ndeceased, the siblings of an unmarried commando may bring a claim. \nSince the $20 million originally authorized and appropriated for \npayment of these claims was based on the entire known universe of \ncommandos, no additional funding will be needed to implement this \namendment. Nor will this amendment put an additional undue burden on \nthe commission. Our original intention in authoring the commando \nlegislation was to make restitution to all the commandos who served us \nso faithfully, even when we walked away from them. This amendment \nensures that we do that.\n  Mr. President, these amendments are straightforward and \nnoncontroversial. They are good amendments and I urge their adoption.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of an amendment \nsponsored by myself, Senator Kerry, and Senator Smith of New Hampshire \nto express the sense of Congress regarding the heroism, sacrifice, and \nservice of former South Vietnamese Commandos who fought with the United \nStates during the Vietnam war.\n  From 1961 to 1970, South Vietnamese soldiers were trained and \nrecruited by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Department of \nDefense to fight behind enemy lines on behalf of the United States. \nAlthough the majority of these individuals were captured alive and \ntaken prisoner by North Vietnam, the U.S. government declared them dead \nin order to avoid paying them for their services.\n  Senator Kerry and I sponsored legislation contained in the Fiscal \nyear 1997 Defense Authorization bill authorizing payment of up to \n$30,000 to each Commando determined eligible by the Secretary of \nDefense.\n  Our amendment to the FY 1999 Defense Authorization bill makes the \nfollowing findings:\n  South Vietnamese Commandos were recruited by the United States for \ncovert operations under OPLAN 34A or its predecessor, OPLAN 35, from \n1961 to 1970;\n  The Commandos conducted covert operations in North Vietnam during the \nVietnam conflict;\n  Many of the Commandos were captured and imprisoned by North \nVietnamese forces for periods of up to 20 years;\n  The Commandos served and fought proudly during the Vietnam conflict;\n  Many of the Commandos lost their lives serving in operations \nconducted by the United States during the Vietnam conflict;\n  Many of the Vietnamese Commandos now reside in the United Stats.\n  Consequently, our amendment recognizes and honors the former South \nVietnamese Commandos for their service to the United States. We are in \ndebt to these individuals for fighting valiantly on our side during the \nVietnam war. They deserve our continued support and gratitude. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2943) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment No. 2944\n\n(Purpose: To provide for payments to certain survivors of captured and \n  interned Vietnamese operatives who were unmarried and childless at \n                                 death)\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. On behalf Senators Kerry, McCain and Smith of New \nHampshire, I offer an amendment that would enhance the eligibility for \npayments to certain survivors of captured and interned Vietnamese \ncommandos who were unmarried and childless at death.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Thurmond], for Mr. \n     Kerry, Mr. McCain and Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2944.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 127, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 634. ELIGIBILITY FOR PAYMENTS OF CERTAIN SURVIVORS OF \n                   CAPTURED AND INTERNED VIETNAMESE OPERATIVES WHO \n                   WERE UNMARRIED AND CHILDLESS AT DEATH.\n\n       Section 657(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 1997 (Public Law 104-201; 110 Stat. 2585) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) In the case of a decedent who had not been married at \n     the time of death--\n       ``(A) to the surviving parents; or\n       ``(B) if there are no surviving parents, to the surviving \n     siblings by blood of the decedent, in equal shares.''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I join Senator Kerry and Senator Smith of \nNew Hampshire in offering this amendment to the Fiscal Year 1999 \nDefense Authorization bill to allow payment of funds to the surviving \nparents or siblings of deceased Vietnamese Commandos.\n  From 1961 to 1970, South Vietnamese soldiers were trained and \nrecruited by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Department of \nDefense to undertake covert operations behind enemy lines on behalf of \nthe United States. Although the majority of these individuals were \ncaptured alive and taken prisoner by North Vietnam, the U.S. government \ndeclared them dead in order to avoid paying them for their services.\n  In 1996, Congress passed legislation I sponsored with Senator Kerry \nauthorizing payment of up to $40,000 to each Commando determined \neligible by the Secretary of Defense. In the case of a deceased \nCommando, payment was authorized to be made to the surviving spouse or, \nif there was no surviving spouse, to the surviving children of the \ndecedent.\n  Unfortunately, we did not anticipate the case of deceased Commandos \nwho died unmarried and thus left no spouse or children to claim \npayment. Our amendment to the FY 1999 Defense Authorization bill would \nexpand eligibility for payments to include the surviving parents or, if \nthere are no surviving parents, to the surviving siblings by blood of \nthe deceased Commando.\n  Because Congress has already authorized and appropriated funds for \npayment to each Commando, this amendment has no cost. However, it \nserves the cause of fairness by entitling relatives of unmarried, \ndeceased Commandos to the payments authorized for those Commandos' \nservice to this country.\n  Although we did not intend to discriminate against unmarried \nchildless Commandos in our original legislation, our original \nlegislation unwittingly did just that.\n  Our amendment rights that wrong. I encourage my colleagues to support \nthis legislation on behalf of those Commandos who bravely served behind \nenemy lines on behalf of the United States.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I believe this amendment has been \ncleared by the other side.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendment has been cleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? Is there objection?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to adopt the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2944) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. THURMOND.

On behalf of Senators Kerry, McCain, and Smith of New \nHampshire, I offer an amendment that would ensure that the Vietnamese \ncommandos receive their rightful share of the funds authorized and \nappropriated by the Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for Messrs.

Mr. President, I join my colleagues Senator Kerry and \nSenator Smith of New Hampshire in sponsoring an amendment to the Fiscal \nYear 1999 Defense Authorization bill to ensure that the Vietnamese \nCommandos receive their rightful share of the funds Congress authorized \nand appropriated in return for their service to this country.\n  From 1961 to 1970, South Vietnamese soldiers were trained and \nrecruited by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Department of \nDefense to undertake covert operations behind enemy lines on behalf of \nthe United States.

These payments were intended to be \ndistributed directly to the Commandos, who could then use a portion of \nthe funds to cover attorney fees and other costs associated with \nreceiving their benefit.\n  Regrettably, our 1996 legislation did not fully clarify the \nrelationship between Commandos and their attorneys for the purposes of \npayments, with the result that payments have been flowing to the \nCommandos' attorneys for disbursement to their intended recipients. \nConsequently, our amendment seeks to clarify that the actual \ndisbursement of a payment under our 1996 legislation may be made only \nto the person eligible for the payment, notwithstanding any agreement, \nincluding a power of attorney, to the contrary.\n  It is my hope that this legislation will allow the Commandos to \nrightfully receive the full payments that are their due. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support this amendment on behalf of those Vietnamese \nCommandos who sacrificed so much for this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Conrad, Kempthorne, \nKennedy, Bingaman, and myself, I offer an amendment which would express \nthe sense of the Senate that the Russian Federation should live up to \nits commitments to reduce its massive tactical nuclear stockpiles as it \nagreed to in 1991 and 1992.

RUSSIAN NON-STRATEGIC NUCLEAR WEAPONS.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that\n       (1) the 7,000 to 12,000 or more non-strategic (or \n     ``tactical'') nuclear weapons estimated by the United States \n     Strategic Command to be in the Russian arsenal may present \n     the greatest threat of sale or theft of a nuclear warhead in \n     the world today;\n       (2) as the number of deployed strategic warheads in the \n     Russian and United States arsenals declines to just a few \n     thousand under the START accords, Russia's vast superiority \n     in tactical nuclear warheads--many of which have yields \n     equivalent to strategic nuclear weapons--could become \n     strategically destabilizing;\n       (3) while the United States has unilaterally reduced its \n     inventory of tactical nuclear weapons by nearly ninety \n     percent since the end of the Cold War, Russia is behind \n     schedule in implementing the steep tactical nuclear arms \n     reductions pledged by former Soviet President Gorbachev in \n     1991 and Russian President Yeltsin in 1992, perpetuating the \n     dangers from Russia's tactical nuclear stockpile; and,\n       (4) the President of the United States should call on the \n     Russian Federation to expedite reduction of its tactical \n     nuclear arsenal in accordance with the promises made in 1991 \n     and 1992.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than March 15, 1999, the Secretary \n     of Defense shall submit to the Congress a report on Russia's \n     non-strategic nuclear weapons, including\n       (1) estimates regarding the current numbers, types, yields, \n     viability, and locations of such warheads;\n       (2) an assessment of the strategic implications of the \n     Russian Federation's non-strategic arsenal, including the \n     potential use of such warheads in a strategic role or the use \n     of their components in strategic nuclear systems;\n       (3) an assessment of the extent of the current threat of \n     theft, sale, or unauthorized use of such warheads, including \n     an analysis of Russian command and control as it concerns the \n     use of tactical nuclear warheads; and\n       (4) a summary of past, current, and planned efforts to work \n     cooperatively with the Russian Federation to account for, \n     secure, and reduce Russia's stockpile of tactical nuclear \n     warheads and associated fissile material.\n       This report shall include the views of the Director of \n     Central Intelligence and the Commander in Chief of the United \n     States Strategic Command.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I share the growing concern over the \ncontinuing high levels of tactical nuclear weapons in the arsenals of \nboth Russia and the United States.\n  We have made substantial progress in reducing the levels of strategic \nnuclear weapons which threaten world peace and security. This progress \nhas been made through the cooperation and efforts of both our countries \nand I commend the Reagan, Bush and Clinton Administrations for their \nefforts.\n  We have reduced the number of strategic missiles on each side. We \nhave inventoried and controlled dangerous nuclear materials to prevent \ntheir theft. We have improved the safety and security of strategic \nnuclear weapons world-wide.\n  But, during this time, we have left another dangerous threat \nuntouched--the tactical nuclear weapons built and deployed for \nbattlefield use. These dangerous weapons have received far too little \nattention in our arms control efforts.\n  Although they are smaller than strategic nuclear weapons, tactical \nnuclear weapons are still a massive threat. In the wrong hands, in a \nterrorist or military attack, these weapons are almost as dangerous as \nstrategic weapons. The potential armed conflicts facing the world today \nwould be far more threatening if tactical nuclear weapons become an \noption for any side. The effect on stability and our own security could \nwell be catastrophic.\n  We must take every reasonable measure to ensure that such weapons are \nnever used--not in any armed conflict, not in a terrorist attack, \nnever.\n  The goal of the Conrad amendment is to reduce, and eventually \neliminate, the world's stockpile of tactical nuclear weapons. We must \ninventory the number and types of these weapons currently held in \nstockpiles, assess them, and work together to eliminate them.\n  It is not too much to ask that we pursue two tracks in the effort to \ndeal with the nuclear threat left by the legacy of the Cold War. \nReducing and eliminating both strategic and tactical nuclear weapons is \nthe right course for the United States and Russia, and the only one \nthat will ensure our future security.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the amendment has been cleared on this \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further discussion?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2947) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the \nDefense Authorization Bill. Having just celebrated Flag Day, June 14, \nthe symbol of our great country is vividly in mind. In close \nconjunction with that symbol of freedom, is our freedom guarded by \nthose who serve in our Military Services who have been willing to give \ntheir lives for our country.\n  It seems fitting to show our honor and respect to those who have \nvaliantly and fearlessly carried the banner of our flag into battle. \nEach one of these battle-ready patriots should carry a memento of their \nmilitary service home with them--to remind them of our gratitude and \ntheir great achievement in keeping the country free. My amendment would \npresent a U.S. flag to each active duty person who has served our \ncountry. I know that former Senator Robert Dole has supported this \neffort as well.\n  All components of the Military Services, the active duty, the \nNational Guard and the Reserves of the Army, Air Force, Navy and \nMarines, who have completed honorable tours of duty will be eligible \nfor this gift from a grateful nation.\n  It seems appropriate that an American flag be presented to those \nhonorably discharged while they are still with us, not just to spread \nover their caskets as they depart this world. This living symbol will \ndo much to re-invigorate and re-dedicated the whole nation to our \nreason for being--freedom and liberty for all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                      MTMC'S Reengineering Program\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today regarding an issue that \nis of great concern to myself and the military families in my state. I \nam referring to the Military Traffic Management Command's (MTMC) \nproposed re-\n\n[[Page S6852]]\n\nengineering of the personal property program. The MTMC is responsible \nfor moving service member's household goods when they receive Permanent \nChange of Station orders, and the current system for doing so has often \nbeen criticized for not providing the same quality service that is \navailable in the private sector.\n  The current system is a $1.1 billion a year industry that is awarded \nwithout competition and contains no provisions for the government to \nenforce quality standards. The status quo has produced a dismal 23% \ncustomer satisfaction rate, which is understandable when we consider \nthat one in four military moves results in a claim for missing or \nbroken household goods. To make the situation worse, it takes about 8 \nmonths to settle 80% of these claims with the service member, at a cost \nof $100 million to the government.\n  For over three years, the Department of Defense has been trying to \nbring elements of competition and corporate practice into the military \nprogram. MTMC's plans will permit full and open competition from all \ntypes of companies which provide corporate moving services, and will \nhold its contractors to standards of performance. It will streamline \nthe personal property program, and introduce accountability to the \nprogram through the use of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The re-\nengineered program will also make full replacement insurance value \navailable to service families for the first time, and will guarantee \nthat a minimum of 41% of the total contract will be performed by small \nbusinesses. The GAO has reviewed this proposal and found it to be \nsuperior to the current program.\n  However, I am concerned that an alternative to the MTMC's re-\nengineering program, referred to as the Commercial-Like Activities of \nSuperior Service (CLASS), has been included in the House FY99 Defense \nAuthorization bill. This alternative, which is opposed by the \nDepartment of Defense, the Military Coalition, the Business Executives \nfor National Security and the Military Mobility Coalition, does not \nimprove the quality of service for our personnel, does not take \nadvantage of current commercial practices, does not provide our \nmilitary families with a streamlined claims process, and offers no \nprotection for the interests of small business. It is estimated that \nthe CLASS program will cost the DoD about three years and an additional \n$6 million to implement. I am hopeful that my colleagues in the Senate \nwill reject the CLASS program during the conference committee \nnegotiations, and allow the DoD to move forward with its pilot program.\n  I urge my colleagues to support MTMC's re-engineering effort and to \nremember that this is simply a pilot program. It will take place in \nthree states and will encompass only 18,000 shipments out of a total of \n650,000 annually, or only three percent of DoD's total annual \nshipments. Congress has also charged GAO to review the pilot as it is \nconducted and report back to Congress. If, at the end of this test, \nthere are changes to be made, we can make them at that time.\n  Mr. President, our military families have waited long enough for us \nto improve the personal property program, and legislatively changing \nall of DoD's efforts for some other idea at the last minute would be \nextremely counterproductive. I look forward to removing this burden \nfrom our service personnel, and to working with my colleagues to ensure \nMTMC's re-engineering program becomes a reality.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the vote being taken on the tabling motion for Senator \nHutchison, I have 10 minutes to address a matter as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as to the earlier vote on tabling, I \ninitiated the tabling motion in my capacity as comanager of this bill, \ntogether with our distinguished chairman. I felt it was the proper \nthing to do because I attribute to this particular bill, the underlying \nbill, the annual Authorization Act, the highest priority. It is for the \nbenefit of those who serve in uniform all over the world. It sends a \nstrong message to our allies and enables this country to maintain its \nresponsibility as the sole superpower in the world today. And that is \nwhy I am going to do everything I can, together with our distinguished \nchairman and others, to see that this bill does move forward.\n  Now that the matter has been divided, then I think I am free to vote \nmy conscience as it relates to such votes as may be taken hereafter \nregarding the amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n        Vote on motion to table Division I of Amendment No. 2737\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to address \nthe situation regarding the policy of the United States and the way in \nwhich we relate to the nation of China. The President of the United \nStates is making a trip to the People's Republic of China, and there \nhas been significant debate about this trip, which provides us an \nopportunity to ask ourselves what kind of policy should we have toward \nthe world's most populous nation.\n  There have been a number of us who have questioned whether or not the \nPresident should go to Tiananmen Square, for example, to celebrate, in \nsome way, his arrival with those who pulled the triggers at the square \nto crush dissent in 1989. There are a wide variety of pluses and \nminuses about the Presidential trip. I want to try to put this trip and \nour policy toward China into a broader perspective in terms of the way \nforeign policy perhaps ought to be conducted.\n  First of all, the President has suggested that we either have to do \nit his way--to support the Presidential visit, welcomed by leaders at \nthe site of a tremendous violation of human rights--or else we have no \nengagement with China at all. I think this is a false choice. It is not \nnecessary, in order to have a relationship with countries, that we \nautomatically have to have a summit. As a matter of fact, we engage in \nrelationships with very important countries--countries far more \ninfluential in some respects than China--and we don't have summits with \nthem on a regular basis. This is the second summit in less than a year \nwith the nation of China.\n  So the first thing I would like to say is that it is not necessarily \nessential, in order to pursue a productive policy for a long-term \nconstructive relationship with China, that you have a summit. As a \nmatter of fact, it might be counterproductive. It might impair the \ndevelopment of the kind of healthy, long-term relationship we need if \nwe send the President unduly, or prematurely, to negotiate with or \notherwise concede to individuals whose conduct doesn't merit the \nPresident's dignifying presence--whose participation in world events is \nnot of a quality that should be legitimized by a visit from the \nPresident of the United States.\n  There has been a false dichotomy presented to the American people, \nand it has been the choice between either supporting the President's \ntrip to China or being labeled isolationists. That is simply an \ninappropriate framework to force upon the American people. Most \nAmericans understand that our objectives ought not to be involvement or \nisolation per se, but that the United States--the greatest Nation of \nthe world--would relate constructively with the People's Republic of \nChina on the basis of sound policy that leads to a constructive and \nmature relationship.\n  I believe that we have to have a policy toward China. While I \nquestion what the policies the President is pursuing, my reservations \nin no way suggest that I don't seek good relations with China. As a \nmatter of fact, I think the road to good relations would be paved with \nbetter policy and fewer summits.\n  Allow me to explain. Whether we are talking about the relationships \nbetween individuals, or businesses, or institutions, or countries, \nthere are principles that undergird and provide the foundation for good \nrelations. Integrity is one. Relationships have to be based on \nintegrity. People have to be able to trust one another. They have to \nknow that when one says something, it can be trusted. Another component \nof a good relationship is responsibility. Individuals have to act \nresponsibly. They can't threaten or otherwise endanger the other party \nif there are going to be sound relationships. Third, there has to be \naccountability. If we want long-term relationships, if we want a \nproductive relationship, if we want something that can be relied upon \nand built upon, we have to have the foundation of integrity, \nresponsibility, and accountability.\n  I suggest that our relationship with China is no different, an must \ninclude these kinds of building blocks. We have to have a relationship \nof integrity, responsibility, and accountability with China. If we \ndon't have it, the future of U.S.-China relations is not bright.\n  I have some real problems with the way the Chinese have dealt with \nus. It is a way that does not reflect integrity. It does not reflect \nresponsibility. It does not reflect accountability.\n  Take, for example, integrity. China last year, after almost 20 years \nof assuring the world that it doesn't proliferate weapons of mass \ndestruction, was labeled by our own CIA as the world's worst \nproliferater of weapons of mass destruction. In spite of that, the \nPresident said, ``We will invite them over for a summit.'' And the \nChinese were invited to the United States in October. As a matter of \nfact, there were nonproliferation assurances at that summit similar to \nthe assurances that have been made over the past two decades. China \npledged that it did not proliferate weapons of mass destruction. We \ndon't involve ourselves in that.\n  Frankly, just a few short months later, our intelligence resources \nintercepted negotiations between China and Iran for China to provide \nanhydrous hydrogen fluoride, a material used to upgrade industrial-\nstrength uranium to weapons-grade uranium. The material was destined \nfor Isfahan, one of Iran's principal sites for manufacturing the \nexplosive core of an atomic device.\n  It is pretty clear that the absence of integrity in the conduct of \nthe Chinese is dramatic. It is an absence of integrity prior to the \nlast summit, and it is an absence of integrity that followed on the \nheels of that summit. They will tell you one thing, and they do \nsomething else. That is not the basis of integrity that provides the \nfoundation for a sound relationship.\n  Responsibility is the second key ingredient. I think most Americans \nwere shocked--I was shocked; I was stunned--when it was revealed by our \nown intelligence sources that the nation of China had as many as 13 \nintercontinental ballistic missiles targeted on American cities, armed \nwith massive nuclear warheads, termed ``city busters.'' Every city in \nthe United States of America north of southern Florida is within range \nof these missiles, and they are targeted on the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I don't think that is the foundation for summitry. I don't think that \nis the foundation for a good relationship. We never appeased the Soviet \nUnion while it was targeting nuclear warheads on American cities. \nRonald Reagan had a sense of principle. He had a sense of determination \nthat you don't stand as a target, while at the same time offering \nprivileges to your adversary. That is not the kind of policy America \nhas pursued in the past. A policy which sells out America's long-term \nsecurity interests might facilitate a particular sale, it might obtain \na particular favor, but it is not in the long-term best interests of \nthe United States to stand as a target offering concessions to a \ncountry pointing nuclear weapons at our cities.\n  I think it is, of all things, terribly irresponsible of the Chinese \nto have 13 American cities targeted with their ``city buster'' nuclear \nweapons on intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching \nvirtually every city in the United States.\n  The third important element is accountability. Where do the Chinese \nstand on accountability? The trade barriers that China has toward the \nUnited States are incredible. In recent years, China's tariff levels \nhave been about six times as high on our goods as our tariffs are on \nChinese products. Not only that, China imposes nontariff barriers that \nmake it impossible for our companies to penetrate the Chinese market. \nChina treats American companies differently, so that U.S. firms don't \nhave the protection of law in Chinese courts commensurate with the \nprotection the United States extends to foreign investors in our \nmarket.\n\n[[Page S6854]]\n\n  The absence of integrity, the absence of responsibility, the absence \nof accountability--the absence of these cornerstones of what ought to \nbe U.S. policy means that the house of cards being constructed in \nsummitry with China is in danger of collapse. I think if we are really \ninterested in China policy over the long term, we ought to build the \nU.S.-China relationship on a foundation that demands integrity, \nresponsibility, and accountability.\n\n  When the President's presence implicitly accepts atrocities in China, \nand when the Administration continues to pursue a bankrupt policy of \nengaging the Chinese at any cost, the interests of the American people \nare not served and the United States is not served at its highest and \nbest. It is no wonder that individuals on both sides of the aisle have \nprotested this trip. It is no wonder that this is not a partisan issue. \nSure, there may be more Republicans who are willing to stand and talk \nabout this now. But in our news conferences together, we have brought \nthese concerns to the President, saying, you are making a mistake with \nthe kind of things that you are intending with this summit.\n  The President will likely try to come home with some transaction, or \nsome deal, to say that it was an achievement of the summit. But let us \nnot forget that the real purpose of summits ought to be the development \nof sound structural relations, the kind of underpinning and foundation \nthat will result in the potential for long-term, beneficial, \nconstructive relationships between countries. As long as we ignore the \nabsence of integrity, we ignore the absence of responsibility, we \nignore the absence of accountability, it seems to me that we are not \nbuilding the kind of relationship based on mutual respect.\n  I would say this: As a minimum, this summit must end with the \nPresident returning to the United States with an assurance that United \nStates cities are not targeted by Chinese ICBMs--with some kind of \nverification to ensure China's detargeting of American cities is \ngenuine.\n  The Chinese know that they have not acted with the requisite \nintegrity. They know that they have not acted with the requisite \nresponsibility. I think they understand that they have not acted with \nthe kind of appropriate accountability that would provide the basis for \nthe right foundation for a sound U.S.-China relationship. China, in \nsome ways, may not expect to get the kind of relationship that mature \nnations dealing with one another on the basis of these values would \nhave.\n  Maybe that is why the Chinese have attempted to influence elections \nin America with donations to buy the kind of respect they have not \nearned with good will.\n  Of all the things I would expect us to demand at the upcoming summit, \none is that illegal contributions from subsidiaries of the Chinese Army \nnot come to contaminate the political process in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I want to say with clarity that an important challenge for the United \nStates is to develop sound long-term relationships with important \nnations around the world. We cannot develop those relationships, \nhowever, without the fundamentals of integrity, responsibility, and \naccountability.\n  We have in China today a regime whose brutal repression at home \nbetrays its intentions abroad. America should be sounding liberty's \nbell, not toasting the tyrants who sent tanks to Tiananmen Square and \npulled the triggers there.\n  I believe we need to find a way to make sure that integrity, \nresponsibility, and accountability are the fundamental components upon \nwhich our China policy rests. To legitimize Chinese conduct absent \nthose values, those principles, is likely to result in a long-term \nU.S.-China relationship with more risk than reward, with more \ndifficulty than cooperation.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for this opportunity. I thank you for the \ntime you have spent in the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/23/senate-section/article/S6853-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about veterans' \nrights being bartered away. And I hope that my colleagues both here on \nthe floor and in the various parts of the Capitol will listen to what I \nhave to say, because it may be the last time this can be said.\n  These rights for veterans are being bartered away in back room deals; \nthey are being done without full Senate consideration; they are being \ndone without amendments; they are being done without the public's \nknowledge; they are being done in a way which is, to me, shocking. I am \nreferring to the denial of veterans' disability rights that was enacted \nas part of TEA 21 and the process which is now going on with regard to \nthe technical corrections bill, which is needed to amend drafting \nerrors that were made to TEA 21.\n  Mr. President, I have been in the Senate now for 13 years. I have \nbeen very honored to serve on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. It is \npart of my Senate service that has truly made me proud. I am proud to \nbe helping real people with genuine human needs. Coming from a great \nState like West Virginia, which, like the Presiding Officer's State, \nplaces great honor on military service, and in serving on the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, both of these things have allowed me the opportunity \nto learn a lot about the sacrifices that millions of our brothers and \nsisters have made to preserve the freedoms that we too often take for \ngranted. They have earned our respect in ways that many of us will \nnever know, God willing.\n  I am proud to serve veterans, and I hope to continue to serve them \nhowever I can. But I am not so proud of the way this Congress--this \nSenate--is treating disabled veterans this year, and I wish to talk \nabout it. I am, in fact, ashamed for all of us in the Senate. It is not \na pretty story. It makes me very angry, and it makes me very sad. \nAmerica's veterans--indeed, all Americans--are being subjected to an \nunprecedented money grab, a shell game, conducted behind closed doors, \nas part of the highway reauthorization process.\n  Mr. President, veterans have earned better treatment than they are \ngetting. They have earned more from their Government than a process \nthat denies them their rights without any accountability--They have \nearned more than a process that is out of control. I repeat, this is a \nprocess in which all of the American people are being harmed by what is \nbeing done to veterans behind closed doors.\n  My colleagues all need to know the truth of this. Why is it that we \nare now willing to look the other way when a conference report grossly \nexceeds the scope of the underlying original legislation? As my \ncolleagues know, I have been fighting for many months to correct the \ninjustice that we do this year\n\n[[Page S6855]]\n\nto veterans. It is my duty, Mr. President; it is my right to do so as a \nsingle U.S. Senator; and it is my obligation.\n  Mr. President, we bestow upon the Republican leader the power to \ncontrol the matters that are brought before this body. If the Democrats \ncontrol, then the Democratic leader does it. If the Republicans \ncontrol, the Republican leader has that authority. It is awesome \nauthority. It is an awesome responsibility. But the leader has failed \nveterans this year.\n  Why does the Republican leader continue to use his power to deny full \nSenate consideration of H.R. 3978, the highway corrections bill? What \nis he afraid of? Why has the leadership turned a deaf ear to America's \nveterans who have been calling and writing to all of us to petition to \nhave this bill brought to the floor? Why is it that the Republican \nleader will not give us the opportunity to offer an amendment to H.R. \n3978 which would restore veterans' disability rights that were cut off \nto pay for unprecedented increases in highway funding?\n\n  Instead of bringing this bill to the floor for debate and for a \nsingle amendment--30 minutes; that is all I ask for, 30 minutes equally \ndivided--the majority leader has simply said that he will find another \nway to pass this bill--quietly, covertly, out of the light of day and \nout of the sight of veterans. It is not a pretty sight. That other way, \nwe are now told, will probably be the Internal Revenue Service \nrestructuring conference report that is slated to come to the floor \nsoon.\n  Now, as all of my colleagues know, when a conference report comes, it \nis unamendable. So it is a winning tactic. You want to get something \npassed, you put it into a conference report--and nobody knows about it; \nand nobody even knows where the conference committee is getting its \ndirections--you put it in, then you bring it to the floor. Nobody can \namend it, because it is called a conference report. It is sacred on \nthis floor. It is unamendable, evading the usual process that would \nhave allowed this issue to be fully aired and debated in the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, the authorizing committee which has jurisdiction \nover veterans' compensation matters.\n  The highway bill conferees this spring took away a benefit that had \nbeen granted to disabled veterans under existing law--there is no new \nprogram here, it is under existing law. The conferees took something \naway from disabled American veterans--found disabled because of their \ninservice smoking addiction, having passed through a terrific series of \ntests which eliminate virtually all of them.\n  Now, once again sidestepping the regular process, the Internal \nRevenue Service restructuring conferees will fail to restore the \nbenefits cut in the highway bill. It will be done at the direction of \nthe Republican leader. And I know something whereof I speak, because I \nhave talked with some of the conferees. That is why I am here to share \nmy sense of outrage with my colleagues.\n  This is a critical issue of justice and fairness to people who are \naddicted because of the efforts of the U.S. Government in part, and in \nsome cases in full. And every moment that we wait to correct this \ninjustice, veterans and their families are irreparably harmed.\n  Right now, the Department of Veterans Affairs is holding veterans' \nsmoking-related disability claims in abeyance, just holding them until \nthis corrections bill is passed. And when I say this ``corrections \nbill,'' I am talking about a corrections bill we will probably never \nsee, we will never have a chance to debate; there will be no 30 minutes \nequally divided; there will be no up-or-down vote so Americans will \nknow where people in the Senate stand on this matter--because it is \nbeing done in quiet.\n  All of this means that the VA is not deciding any of these claims.\n  Some were filed over 5 years ago and those folks have already been \nwaiting all of this time for decisions. Their lives are on hold. Some \nclaimants will have died. In fact, I suspect a lot of them will have \ndied waiting for a decision. Some of their widows will have lost their \nhomes since they did not have a VA check to make ends meet because the \nveterans' disability compensation has been cut off in secret. Every day \nthat we wait, another veteran or a widow is irreparably harmed. We \ncan't go back, but we can help those who are still waiting.\n  Let's review the history of what happened here. I understand the \nSenate wishes to do other things. That is of no concern to me at this \nmoment. What I am concerned about is these people and their future. In \na disingenuously conceived fiction, the Clinton administration and the \nBudget Committee this year created some imaginary ``savings.'' It was a \nlovely scheme.\n  I had all the OMB people in my office coming to tell me about the \nwonderful things that they were going to do with this money and that it \nwould be used to help pay for all the President's projects in his \nbudget, but they were doing it at the expense of disabled American \nveterans who, until recently, under current law, had the right to file \ndisability claims if they are addicted to nicotine because of the U.S. \nGovernment. So they create imaginary savings. The Clinton \nadministration did this, first, by increasing the budget baseline by an \nartificially inflated, absolutely unrealistic, ridiculous estimate of \nthe cost of disability claims of veterans suffering from smoking-\nrelated diseases, and then at the same time by proposing to change \nexisting law to bar disabled veterans from receiving this compensation. \nWell done, well done. The paper savings they created were then used to \nfund a huge increase in the highway bill.\n  Now, these savings, Mr. President, you have to understand, are not \nreal. This is a big shell game. They exist on paper only. They are \nbased on an estimate of 500,000 veterans who would file tobacco-related \nclaims each year. As I have said, so far a total of 8,000 have applied \nand only 300 claims have been granted. So you can now grasp the \nridiculousness of the estimates on the part of the Clinton \nadministration--but still, they came over and argued this. There were \ncalls from the White House, calls from OMB, visits from the White \nHouse, visits from OMB.\n  Experience indicates there is no factual basis for this ridiculous \nestimate. The reality, as I will say again, is that only 8,000 veterans \nhave filed such claims over the past 6 years. So you can see these \nnumbers are totally pie in the sky, merely a self-interested guess, a \nself-promoting guess by OMB.\n  Make no mistake about this, the huge increase in highway spending is, \nin fact, being paid for by make-believe savings, paid for by a devious \nfiction which is really spending of the surplus which we all so \njealously claim to be protecting. Shame on every one of us, all 100 of \nus. Shame on us for perpetrating the fiction and then for cutting off \nof the current law for disabled American veterans who are disabled due \nto tobacco-related illnesses.\n  Although based on fiction, the impact of this number shuffling is \nvery hurtful and real. The benefit that has been granted to disabled \nveterans under existing law has been summarily eliminated by a sleight-\nof-hand action, without consideration by the authorizing committee--\nwhich has jurisdiction, I might add, over compensation issues--in a \ncomplete mockery of our budget process and of regular order in the \nSenate.\n  We have created new ways of doing things in this body in order to \navoid this issue. Now this is what I have called a midnight raid on \nveterans' benefits. I have used these and other words in the past and I \ncould use stronger words. To put it bluntly, America's veterans have \nbeen wronged by back-door trickery. Funding for the veterans' benefits \nhave been cut; imaginary savings have been diverted to pay for \nhighways; and veterans' disability rights have been placed in jeopardy.\n  No, it is not too late to correct this. It is not too late to correct \nthis injustice done to disabled American veterans. The necessity of \npassing a technical corrections bill to the highway bill provides the \nopportunity to do just that. Those interested in the highway projects \nlisted in the corrections bill are very interested in passing this \nbill. So believe me, we are going to pass it. It is probably going to \ncome to the floor attached to the IRS Restructuring conference report. \nOr it will come attached to something else. In any case, there will be \nno chance for the disabled veterans, but plenty of chances for more \nFederal dollars for highways.\n\n  The amendment I offer would strike the veterans' disability \ncompensation\n\n[[Page S6856]]\n\noffset from the underlying conference report on H.R. 2400. I have \nrequested that it be put to an up-or-down vote so that America's \nveterans can see, in the light of day, where their elected \nrepresentatives choose to stand on this issue.\n  Now, let me be clear what my amendment would and would not do. First \nand foremost, be assured my amendment strikes no highway project. These \nprojects are already in law. My amendment would fully preserve each and \nevery highway dollar and project that was included in the highway bill. \nI voted for the highway bill. I support highway funding. I come from \nWest Virginia. Only 4 percent of the land is flat. You think that we \ndon't need roads? Not a single project in West Virginia or any other \nState will be affected in any way, shape or form by this. Why? Because \nthe projects will be funded through the appropriations process.\n  Second, my amendment would not trigger a sequester. That is one of \nthe contentions of those who would deny disability benefits to \nveterans. It is untrue. My amendment is protected by the same budget \ntrickery, to be honest, that covered the TEA 21 bill and that waived \ncertain provisions of the Gramm-Rudman Act.\n  Third, the amendment I propose does not provide any new benefit to \nany veteran. It merely restores the state of the law prior to the \nenactment of the highway bill. The law was based on interpretation of \nVA's existing obligation to veterans to provide compensation for \nsmoking-related illnesses. Veterans who file claims for smoking-related \nillnesses would have to meet the same legal and evidentiary \nrequirements as claimants for any other service-connected disability. \nThe test to establish these claims is, as I have indicated, very tough. \nI remind you, only 300 have passed so far.\n  The veteran must prove that the addiction to use tobacco began in the \nmilitary service, that the addiction continued without interruption, \nand that the addiction resulted in an illness, and that the addiction \nresulted in a disability. He must prove all of that. Eight-thousand \nhave tried and 300 have been successful. Easy test? Not quite.\n\n  It is imperative that the correction bill be brought to the floor \nwhere it can be debated and amended. If TEA 21 is permitted to stand \nuncorrected, an entire category of veterans' disability rights will be \neliminated. Even claims of veterans who became ill with tobacco-related \nillnesses while on active duty will be cut off. And smokers' claims for \nconditions that may be associated with tobacco use, but are also \npresumptively service connected--please hear this--based on exposure to \nAgent Orange or radiation, may also be cut off. What are we doing here?\n  Moreover, in a provision that truly adds insult to injury, the \nconference report makes tobacco use in the military an act of ``willful \nmisconduct.'' Do you know what that means, Mr. President? It means that \nveterans are justifiably outraged that smoking could be considered \n``willful misconduct,'' equating smoking with alcohol or substance \nabuse. They feel betrayed by a Government that encouraged smoking \nduring their service, and now would turn its back on the health \nproblems that resulted.\n  If H.R. 3978, the corrections bill, is allowed to go forward as \ndrafted, and unamended, veterans and their survivors will forever lose \ntheir ability to seek compensation for tobacco-related deaths or \nillnesses resulting from nicotine dependence that was incurred in \nservice. These veterans will lose their ability to get VA health care. \nVeterans with service-connected conditions receive priority free health \ncare. If you add it up, if service connection for compensation purposes \nis barred, using CBO numbers, there will be about 700,000 veterans who \nwill very possibly be turned away from access to VA health care.\n  The Government's role in fostering veterans' addiction to tobacco \nduring their military service is well known and much ``untalked'' about \nin current weeks. Smoking was thought to calm the nerves. I had lunch \nwith one of my best friends the other day, and he told me that back in \nWorld War II he was given free cigarettes in C rations and K rations, \nand discounted cigarettes--cigarettes which didn't have any warning on \nthem until 5 years after the FDA required that they be put on civilian \npacks of cigarettes. No; they were encouraged to ``take a smoke break, \nrelax, calm yourself. Sure, this is battle and training and it is \nstressful, but this cigarette will help you.'' The voice of the U.S. \nGovernment was speaking.\n  So all of this represents a shameful abuse of the trust of our young \nservice members. How can we now turn around and call a behavior \nencouraged by our Government ``willful misconduct''? How do we do that? \nHow can we turn our back on these veterans' need for health care? Well, \nwe are doing it by ignoring the consequences of the highway bill and by \nignoring America's veterans.\n  There has been a lot of talk about veterans and smoking in the last \nfew months. As you know, this Chamber adopted an amendment to direct a \nportion of the proceeds from the tobacco bill--if we can remember that \nfar back--to VA health care. That action, of course, is now \nmeaningless. Senator McCain was for the amendment and so was I. The \namendment was for health care, not compensation for the disability of \nveterans made ill by tobacco that was foisted upon them by the U.S. \nGovernment in service to their country.\n  So we have no tobacco bill now. Those of my colleagues who sought \nrefuge in the tobacco legislation now are going to have to look for \nsome other place for refuge.\n  Some may also point to the provisions in the highway bill that \nprovide enhancements to some very important VA programs. It was said to \nme early on, ``Senator Rockefeller, you have to understand that we put \na lot of things in this technical corrections bill that are for \nveterans. You can't be against these, because that will cut those \nthings out.'' And so they put in some enhancements to the GI bill, \ngrants for adaptive automobile equipment, and a few other programs.\n  I am sorry, but veterans are not to be bought off. Veterans are \nunanimous in their view of this. This is $1.6 billion in benefits that \nveterans could have. But the price is the abolition of the right for \ndisabled veterans to seek compensation for tobacco-related illnesses--I \nam sorry, Mr. President, that price is too dear. Our friends in the \nveterans community speak with one voice on this issue, and I agree, \nthey cannot support the increase in benefits to one set of veterans, to \nbe paid by the cutting of essential benefits to another class of \nveterans who already have those benefits under law. Veterans across \nthis Nation reject this attempt to buy them off.\n  So I repeat--and I am not ordinarily this partisan, and I hope that \nthe Presiding Officer understands that--what is the majority leader \nscared of on this? Why can't we have a vote on this? This is a basic, \nmoral issue--to determine the way that the U.S. Government chooses to \npresent itself to the American people. There is a fundamental, moral \nprinciple involved--undoing current law, under a budget fiction, \nstarted by the Clinton administration, and joined in by the majority. \nSo the result of all of that power is that veterans are shut out, \ndumped, and then cut out of the law from this point forward. Why does \nthe Leader not bring this bill to the floor so it can be debated and \namended? Why does he have to move this in the dark of night? Once \nagain, I urge the majority leader to bring this corrections bill to the \nfloor.\n  I participated in a conversation at the back of this Chamber with one \nof the conferees on the IRS bill, describing how, oh, yes, it was \nprobable that this technical corrections bill would be put into the IRS \nconference report. That sounds positive, doesn't it? No, it is highly \nnegative. That means that when it comes to the floor, it cannot be \namended or debated. It can only be voted up or down, and the veterans \nlose on all fronts from that action.\n  My colleagues need to understand that there is a huge problem with \nthe majority leader's tactic. American veterans will not be fooled by \nwhat he and others do here. American veterans are not stupid, and they \nare angry. They will see through this charade, but most of the Members \nof the Senate do not see through this charade--the charade of how the \nfunding process began and how the highway money comes out of the \nsurplus and the phony savings. I bet there wouldn't be 12 Senators on \nthis floor, who would understand exactly what happened, how absurd the\n\n[[Page S6857]]\n\nwhole thing is, how embarrassing the whole thing is, and how wrong it \nis for veterans to not even be given a chance.\n  America's veterans are justifiably losing their faith in Government. \nThis will accelerate that process for American veterans. They no longer \nbelieve that the Government that they fought to preserve intends to \nmeet its obligation to them. I share their fear.\n  What is obscene about all of this is that this denial of disabled \nveterans' benefits occurred just before Memorial Day, when everybody on \nthis floor and in the other body was pouring out words of patriotism, \nappreciation, love, respect, reverence to veterans for all they have \ndone for their country. But in the Halls of Congress, actions often \nbelie these words. If we do not take care of America's veterans now, \none might say, who will take care of us in the future? To secure the \nsoldiers we will need in the future, we must maintain the promises made \nto those who protected us in the past.\n\n  Thirty minutes equally divided up or down, Mr. President, I submit is \na fair request on behalf of disabled American veterans.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nUtah is recognized to speak for up to 20 minutes as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senator from Utah has \n20 minutes and the Senator from California has 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. He will be followed by \nthe Senator from California, who has 20 minutes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. If the Senator will yield, may I have a few minutes from \neither Senator?\n  Mr. HATCH. We will be happy to do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/23/senate-section/article/S6854-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6857-S6861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TOBACCO LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to announce that--contrary to press \nreports that tobacco legislation is dead--in fact, a strong, bipartisan \neffort to enact meaningful tobacco legislation is very much alive and \nwell in the Senate today.\n  Last week's action by the Senate on the Commerce Committee tobacco \nbill should not be viewed as a failure by this Senate to pass tough \ntobacco legislation.\n  Nor should it be viewed as a victory by tobacco companies and tobacco \nlobbyists to kill tobacco legislation and deny the public health \nbenefits from a strong bill.\n  To be fair, there were many criticisms of the Commerce bill. It \nsuffered from a myriad of legal problems, including several \nunconstitutional provisions. Its costs were very high, perhaps as high \nas $800 billion. It could have provided enhanced opportunities for \nblack market sales, with accompanying crime and violence.\n  And, a bad bill was made worse on the floor with adoption of several, \nadditional competing spending priorities which--however well-\nintentioned--diverted from the primary focus of the bill [e.g. child \ncare, illegal drug abuse, tax cuts.]\n  In my opinion, the four weeks that the Senate spent on the tobacco \nbill were a critical and useful exercise in educating ourselves--and \nthe American public--on the numerous complexities of the tobacco issue. \nBy and large, we now have a better understanding of this issue and what \nCongress should do to develop a good bill.\n  Accordingly, Senator Feinstein, Senator Breaux and I have come to the \nfloor today to announce our bipartisan effort to work toward a strong \ntobacco bill that, we believe, will be acceptable to the vast majority \nof our colleagues.\n  There are eight cosponsors on our side and three cosponsors thus far \non the Democrat side. And it is bipartisan.\n  We must not lose sight of the fact that we have a very real \nopportunity, a compelling opportunity to act on tobacco this year.\n  We believe the best framework for legislation clearly remains in the \nprovisions of the June 20, 1997 global tobacco settlement that was \nagreed to by 40 State Attorneys General and the tobacco industry.\n  This document should serve as the blueprint on which the Senate \nshould act. It should be clean of extraneous provisions and programs \nand targeted to the overwhelming need to educate our nation's youth on \nthe hazards of tobacco use.\n  I call upon my colleagues--both Republicans and Democrats--to join us \nin this bipartisan effort to protect the lives of American youth.\n  I call upon the President to work with us in a bipartisan effort to \nforge meaningful tobacco legislation. Without your active participation \nand support, Mr. President, there can be no tobacco bill. Together we \ncan make a positive and defining difference.\n  Senator Feinstein, Senator Breaux and I are prepared to move forward \nwith tobacco legislation that is constitutionally sound and that will \nprotect millions of Americans, both young and old, from the enticement \nof the deadly tobacco habit. We simply cannot lose this opportunity.\n  We do not intend to remain on the sidelines while this issue \nlanguishes and political rhetoric is thrown back and forth.\n  Some of my colleagues have stated they intend to offer the Commerce \nCommittee tobacco bill as an amendment to all appropriate legislation \non the floor of the Senate. Let me say to my friends that I share your \nconcern that the Senate should pass legislation this year.\n  I ask that you join us in our bipartisan effort to enact a \nsettlement-based bill. Together we can realize enactment of tobacco \nlegislation that has seemed so illusive over the past several weeks.\n  I would like to outline this legislation so that my colleagues will \nunderstand the basics of the bill that we will file in the future.\n  Number one, the key to an effective program, according to public \nhealth experts, is that it must be comprehensive.\n  The Hatch-Feinstein bill accomplishes this goal with major provisions \nthat build upon the June 20, 1997, agreement and the plaintiffs' \nattorneys' settlement proposal. Ours would require $428.5 billion in \npayments over 25 years. That is $60 billion more than the June 20, 1997 \nproposal.\n  Our bill will focus on antitobacco activities, including prevention \nand research efforts, and give full FDA authority over tobacco \nproducts. This is important because no comprehensive, antitobacco bill \ncan be passed without the voluntary cooperation of the tobacco \ncompanies.\n  When the proposed settlement was announced last June, with a record \n$368.5 billion in industry payments, we were all astounded that the \ntobacco companies would agree to pay that whopping amount of money. \nThat record amount, that ``ceiling'' as it were, was astounding. Now \nthere are those who talk like that is nothing.\n  Our bill will add another $60 billion to that $368.5 billion in \nrequired industry payments over 25 years.\n  I am hopeful our bill will bring the tobacco companies back.\n  Yes, they will be kicking and screaming. They will be angry. They \nwill be upset. But, I predict they will come back.\n  There has been considerable debate in this body about the adequacy of \nthe industry payments. I wish we could require $1 trillion in payments.\n  The plain fact is that we have to be reasonable. If we want a \ncomprehensive and constitutional bill, then we will have to insert \nprovisions to bring the industry back to the discussion. Only with \ntheir participation can we have a truly constitutional, comprehensive \nbill.\n  Of the $428 billion in industry payments, $100 billion will be \ndevoted to biomedical and behavioral research.\n  These significant new revenues are devoted to efforts to prevent, \ntreat, and cure tobacco-related and other illnesses. We have included \nfunds for behavioral research as well, so that we can determine the \ncauses for youth tobacco use and determine how best to address them.\n  Let me emphasize, we provide $100 billion over 25 years, or $4 \nbillion a year, for biomedical and behavioral research, with no \npossibility the funds will be diverted for other, non-tobacco-related \npurposes. That is something that will benefit the public health of this \ncountry significantly.\n  We also provide $92 billion for important public health programs to \ncombat\n\n[[Page S6858]]\n\nyouth tobacco use, including counteradvertising, smoking cessation, and \npublic education. Again, this is all for tobacco-related public health \nprograms.\n  We also include $18.7 billion for tobacco farm families, by melding \nthe Lugar bill and the best of the LEAF Act, Senator Ford's bill, other \nthan continuing the subsidies.\n  Public health authorities insist that increasing tobacco prices is an \nimportant weapon in our anti-youth-tobacco-use arsenal. Law enforcement \nis equally adamant that price increases will lead to greater \nopportunities for black market sales. Our bill will substantially \nenhance law enforcement resources at all levels--Federal, state and \nlocal--and will also provide new criminal penalties for trafficking in \ncontraband. The Hatch-Feinstein-Breaux bill will provide $9.4 billion \nfor law enforcement efforts, which will be essential in the eyes of law \nenforcement.\n  Turning to another provision, our bill includes $5 billion for \ntobacco-related programs for Native Americans, who are particularly \nhard hit by some of the problems that come from tobacco. We provide \n$200 million a year for these Native American programs.\n  Let me add that we also give FDA strong and new authority over \ntobacco products, authority that is in question in light of current \nlitigation over this issue. We also include strong look-back \nassessments, which, without the tobacco companies on board, will not be \nconstitutional.\n  In addition, when I say we give FDA strong new authority, we mean it. \nWe not only give them the authority, we give them the authority to ban \ntobacco products, with the consent of Congress, right from day one. And \nwe require them to issue strong performance standards that industry \nmust meet so that we can be assured that any tobacco products sold in \nthe future, meet government-mandated standards with respect to their \ncritical components, such as tar and nicotine and all other additives. \nSo that is important. That is quite a bit different from what was \nincluded in the Commerce bill, where the performance standards were \npermissive, not mandatory. We keep the industry's feet to the fire by \nincluding a strong look-back provision which will provide the industry \nwith the incentives to be good actors, but which will provide stringent \npenalties if they are not.\n  We provide $204 billion to the States to settle their suits and \nprovide reimbursement for their Medicaid costs. We waive Federal \nrecoupment of these funds under Medicaid law.\n  The challenge for Congress is to design a program which works and \nwhich will withstand legal challenge. The problem with the Commerce \nbill, had it passed, is that it would have been litigated for probably \n10 years, because it was unconstitutional.\n  Senator Feinstein, the other cosponsors, and I, have worked very hard \nto avoid constitutional and other legal pitfalls which handicapped the \nCommerce bill.\n  So, to sum up, our bill contains constitutionally permissible \nadvertising and marketing provisions, advertising restraints well-\nbeyond those contained in the FDA rule. We have strong look-back \nassessments--up to $5 billion in penalties in 2004 and up to $10 \nbillion by the year 2009 if the industry does not meet the reductions \nin youth-smoking that we set in the bill.\n  And our bill mandates establishment of a documents depository in a \ncentral location, Washington, DC, where all of the tobacco companies \nwill deposit critical industry documents. This will be done by \nvolition, since the companies will have agreed to the protocol \ncontained in the bill. This should make it easier for individual \nclaimants to sue and to recover. And that is no small thing.\n  Now, under Hatch-Feinstein, the manufacturers, State governments, the \nCastano litigants, and the Federal Government voluntarily execute a \nbinding and enforceable contractual agreement, so that tobacco \ncompanies will have agreed, voluntarily to meet the requirements of the \nbill.\n  Similarly, with the industry voluntarily consenting to the agreement, \nthis obviates any constitutional problems with the look-back provision.\n  We have included several limited liability provisions, which is the \none prerequisite to the industry voluntarily agreeing to a bill; this \nwill give the industry greater predictability in their financial \nexposure due to lawsuits, and which in turn will provide the Federal \nGovernment with a more predictable revenue stream to operate its new \nantitobacco program.\n  Now, with respect to the limited liability provisions, we settle all \nFederal, State and local suits, including class actions, in line with \nthe settlement nature of the legislation. That is what the attorneys \ngeneral did. Shutting off the State litigation allows us to provide the \nStates, counties and cities with guaranteed payments of up to $204 \nbillion, without the need for costly and time-consuming litigation and \nwithout Federal Medicaid recovery.\n  Specifically, we provide $204 billion to the States. Forty percent of \nthe State funds are untied; 60 percent of the State funds are targeted \nfor 14 specific programs.\n  We fully preserve all individuals' rights to pursue their injury \nclaims, and all individual suits will be preserved and allowed to \nproceed except for those making claim for treatment only of addiction \nor dependency.\n  We settle all past punitive damages in exchange for an unprecedented \n$100 billion which will be used for biomedical and behavioral research. \nFuture judgments against the industry, with the exception of claims for \naddiction and dependence, will be subject to punitive damages, but they \nwill also be subject to a cap on total awards during any given year.\n  May I ask, Mr. President, how much of my time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Utah has 8 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just proceed a few minutes more before I turn to my \ncolleagues, and then I will reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The Hatch-Feinstein-Breaux bill contains many provisions that mirror \nthose contained in the proposed settlement of June 20 of last year.\n  We are trying to accomplish the art of the impossible. We want to \nenact this astounding settlement, this unprecedented agreement wherein \nthe tobacco companies voluntarily concur in making large annual \npayments in exchange for unprecedented new advertising bans and future \nlook-back penalties.\n  If we cannot maintain the consensual nature of the original \nsettlement, then we lose the ability to accomplish many of the key \nelements of any comprehensive anti-tobacco legislation.\n  I want us togo home this year proud that we have enacted a good bill, \nnot ashamed of our inaction or our action on a faulty bill.\n  I thank my colleagues for being willing to support this bill. On the \nRepublican side it is myself, the Senator from Oregon, Mr Smith, \nSenator Jeffords, Senator Gorton, Senator Bennett, Senator Hutchison, \nSenator Kempthorne, and Senator DeWine; on the other side, Senators \nFeinstein, Torricelli and Breaux. Let me reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, the Senator from \nCalifornia has up to 20 minutes.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. I would ask that I be notified \nwhen 10 minutes of my time has gone by, and I will try to share it with \nthe distinguished Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. President, Senator Hatch and I have prepared our bill based on \nsome ten hearings in the Judiciary Committee and is based on, we \nbelieve, would create a consensus to create a bill which would do the \nfollowing: Create a pure tobacco bill with no additional tax measures, \nno drug enforcement programs, no voucher programs, but which would \nprovide some incentives for the tobacco industry to agree, while \nincreasing the per-pack price, and this is a gross figure, to about a \n$1.50 over 10 years. This would include excise and State taxes, \nwholesale and retail markups, manufacturers take. This bill would also \nban all tobacco advertising geared toward children and ensures that the \nFDA has the necessary regulatory authority to regulate the consents, \nand to limit nicotine. It would also provide, as Senator Hatch has just \nsaid, some $92 billion over 25 years for tobacco-related public health \nprograms, and $100 billion over 25 years for research, with tough look-\nback provisions that require the industry to reduce youth smoking by 67 \npercent in 10 years.\n\n[[Page S6859]]\n\n  It would also require States to negotiate an allocation of tobacco \nfunds to counties that filed lawsuits before the June 20, 1997, \ndeadline.\n  As you know, the McCain bill as it came out of the Commerce \nCommittee, required a total payment of $516 billion over 25 years. The \nHatch-Feinstein proposal requires $428.5 billion over the same period. \nUnder the McCain bill, as amended, it would have diverted about half \nthe funds to programs unrelated to tobacco or public health. Under the \nMcCain bill, there was less money going to public health programs and \nto the States than under Hatch-Feinstein, since 26 percent of the funds \nright off the top went to an election year tax cut. For instance, for \nthe first five years, $47.2 billion would be left over after the tax \ncut, the Coverdell amendment then takes the great bulk of funds \navailable for public health programs and uses it for drug enforcement, \nborder patrol and school vouchers. That bill allocated 40 percent of \nthe remaining funds available for State programs, while Hatch-Feinstein \nallocates 50 percent of the funds directed to the State.\n  Under our proposal during the first five years, there would be $10 \nbillion more money for Federal public health research and antitobacco \nprograms. There would also be $7 billion more money for State public \nhealth and antitobacco programs. The public health aspect, we believe, \nis the most important part of this legislation. Additionally, one of \nthe most critical areas which must be addressed for any tobacco \nlegislation to be successful in reducing youth smoking, I believe, is \nadvertising. The tobacco industry knows that millions of smokers quit \nannually and approximately 400,000 Americans die from smoking-related \ndiseases each year. They also understand that 89 percent of all new \nsmokers are adolescents, and for their market share to continue they \nmust continue to market cigarettes to children, and they do.\n  So, advertising plays a central role in leading young people to \nsmoke.\n  We know that tobacco companies can no longer advertise on television \nor radio, so they use alternative forms of advertising and promotion to \npersuade teens to start smoking. We know that, despite endless promises \nby the tobacco companies that they have not and would not market to \nchildren, that they would not use advertising to appeal to children, \nthey have done exactly what they promised not to do. And the evidence \nis staggering.\n  Mr. President, 87 percent of adolescents could recall seeing one or \nmore tobacco advertisements and half could identify the brand name \nassociated with one of four popular cigarette slogans. As a matter of \nfact, in 1986 Camel cigarettes ranked seventh in popularity among the \nyoungest age group of smokers, with less than 1 percent of all children \nsmoking Camels. One year after Joe Camel was introduced, the brand \njumped to No. 3 among teenage smokers--from No. 7 to No. 3--because of \nJoe Camel. This shows a clear relationship between advertising and teen \nsmoking.\n  Three months ago, I saw a tape of a television news report where a \nbeautiful 3-year-old girl was able to match the cartoon Joe Camel with \nthe photo of a cigarette. It was chilling. Even a 3-year-old could \nassociate Joe Camel with cigarettes, and it was a positive association. \nSome have even said more children recognize Joe Camel than Mickey \nMouse. It should not be this way in the United States of America.\n  Our provisions in this bill with respect to advertising are as \nfollows: The companies would have to agree to ban all outdoor \nadvertising; all Internet advertising; all stadium/arena advertising; \nsponsorship of athletic, music, and other cultural events; human images \nin ads; cartoon characters in ads; product placement in movies, TV, \nvideo games, youth publications, and live performances; placing tobacco \nlogos on nontobacco merchandise such as hats and T-shirts; color and \nimage advertising except for adult-only locations; all adult magazines \nand newspapers; music and sound effects in audio and video advertising.\n  So, if a company wants to advertise in media other than periodicals, \npromotional material, and point-of-sale materials, it must give a 30-\nday notice to the FDA. These are broad, far-reaching restrictions which \nwill severely limit exposure of children to tobacco advertising.\n  Senator Hatch has laid out the liability provisions very well. \nSomething I think we have all learned from this debate is that there \nshould be some form of liability cap. That is the incentive--part of \nit--for the tobacco companies to comply. Our bill caps liability at \n$5.5 billion. As Senator Hatch stated, it would terminate all Federal, \nState, and local suits, Castano action, class action, individual \npreventive addiction and dependency claims.\n  But all individual suits will be preserved and allowed to proceed, \nwith the exception of those making addiction or dependency treatment \nclaims for past conduct by the companies. They could continue the \naddiction and dependency treatment as long as an illness was related. \nConsolidation would be allowed by court action or by motions to join \ncases filed by individuals.\n  Additionally, as I have mentioned, the Joe Camel suit was actually \nbrought by a county, and yet that suit was jettisoned in the prior \nlegislation. So we require that the states with those counties who have \nfiled suit before 6/20/97--San Francisco, Los Angeles, Cook County, New \nYork City, and Erie county--that they would all be recognized and \nprovided for in this particular bill.\n  I want to speak to the look-back provisions for a moment, because we \nset tough industry targets to reduce youth smoking and they are the \nfollowing: 15 percent in 3 years, 30 percent in 5 years, 50 percent in \n7 years, and 67 percent in 10 years. And the penalties are actually \nstronger in our bill. The McCain bill, for example, had $40 million \npenalty per point when the industry is 1 to 5 percent short; we would \nhave $100 million per point. Under McCain, if an industry is 6 to 20 \npercent short, their penalty would be $120 million per point plus $200 \nmillion. Ours impose $200 million per point. Under McCain, it imposes a \npenalty cap of $2 billion per year industry-wide and $5 billion per \nyear company-specific cap; in our bill, it is $5 billion per year for 5 \nyears and $10 billion thereafter industry-wide.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I might have 1 minute to sum up and then yield to \nthe distinguished Senator from Louisiana?\n  Another provision in our bill that I want to speak to is the \nantismuggling provision. I heard so many people say, you don't have to \nworry about a black market, it is not going to happen. There is a black \nmarket today in California based on the present $2-per-pack price. The \ntrick really is how the bill phases in per-pack pricing increases plus \nFDA's regulation of content and nicotine to see that it is done in a \nway that does not create an increased black market or increased \nsmuggling. We provide in our bill an additional $9.4 billion over 25 \nyears for enforcement of antismuggling provisions.\n  So, if the ultimate goal of tobacco legislation is to reduce teen \nsmoking and smoking overall, we believe this bill will pass scrutiny by \nour colleagues. We offer to work with anyone who cares to work with us.\n  I would like very much to thank the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. I very much enjoyed working with him on this bill.\n  I now yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding some of \nher time. As well, I thank Chairman Hatch for the work that he did on \nthis legislation. I think the two previous speakers really need to be \ncongratulated for bringing to the Senate a commonsense approach to what \nhas become a very tragic situation. I would like to make just a few \ncomments about it.\n  You know, in Louisiana, where I am from, there is an old saying that \nif you like the end product, there are two things you should never \nwatch being made; one is sausage, and the other is laws; because if you \nlike the end product, you don't like the process that you go through to \nmake either laws or sausage. If you observe it too carefully, you will \nnever like the end product, perhaps is what they are trying to say.\n  The point I am trying to make today is, what has happened on the \ntobacco legislation, I think, is indeed very,\n\n[[Page S6860]]\n\nvery tragic, because what started out with very good intentions has \nended up with a very serious loss for all Americans who are concerned \nabout trying to do something about tobacco. There was a poll by one of \nthe television networks on Friday night. It said that 47 percent of the \nAmerican people were pleased that the tobacco legislation that came up \nin the Senate was defeated; 46 percent said that they were disappointed \nit was defeated. The American people have to be horribly confused about \nthe situation, where we are and what has transpired.\n  Do you know what we are engaged in now? We are now engaged in Monday \nmorning quarterbacking. Members of both parties are trying to figure \nout how we can blame each other for the defeat of something that \nstarted off so pure and so good, with the best of intentions. Now all \nyou see is spinmeisters saying, well, it is the Republicans' fault, \nbecause they are trying to load it up with marriage penalties and \nvouchers and they made it a tax bill and then they decided it was too \nloaded up after they loaded it up.\n  There are some on our side who said, ``Well, no, this legislation \nwasn't nearly enough and wasn't tough enough on tobacco. We can be \ntougher on the tobacco companies than anybody else. Just watch what we \ncan do when we want to be tough on tobacco companies.'' So we started \nwith a product that was a good product in the beginning. Then, we made \nit so difficult that you broke the cooperation between all of the \nparties that is essential to get any kind of good agreement.\n  I suggest there is plenty of blame to go around on both sides. That \nis why 47 percent of the American people believe they are glad the \ntobacco bill is defeated; 46 percent do not feel happy, that the Senate \nshould have passed it. The American people have to be horribly \nconfused. I think now we have to take a look at where we are. What do \nwe do? Do we continue to play the blame game for the rest of the year? \nDo we continue to see who can get the most political advantage? Or do \nwe try to make one last desperate but incredibly important effort to \nput something together that we can pass and that will work?\n  It is really interesting if you look at what happened. You have to \nstart from where we started. The June 20 attorneys general agreement \nwas a compromise that really got the job done. People have come to the \nfloor of the Senate and said, ``I can't be for that because this bill \nwas written by the health groups.'' Others have said, ``I can't be for \nthis bill because this bill was written by the tobacco companies.'' Or \nthey can't be for this because it was written by the attorneys general \nor it was written by the plaintiffs' lawyers.\n  The truth, in fact, is the reason the June 20 attorneys general \nagreement was so good is because it was written by everyone involved. \nIt was written by the attorneys general, who filed suit on behalf of 40 \nStates against the tobacco companies. It was written by the tobacco \ncompanies, who were the ones being sued. It was written by the lawyers \nfor all of the injured plaintiffs who had suffered injuries from \nsmoking-related activities. That is why it worked, because it was not \nwritten by just one group, but it was written by everybody who had an \ninterest in trying to get a realistic settlement passed.\n  Now, all of the people who have now said that what we had on the \nfloor was not nearly enough, I think they thought the June 20 agreement \nwas pretty good. I was just looking at some of the old press releases \nabout the June 20 agreement. One caught my attention the most. It was \nfrom the Campaign For Tobacco-Free Kids, which has been one of the \nstrongest advocates for more, more, more, more, more. I understand \nwhere they are coming from, and I understand their position.\n  But when the June 20 agreement came out with the attorneys general \nand the tobacco companies, which was far less than the bill they \nopposed on the floor from their perspective, here is what they said \nabout the June 20 agreement:\n\n       The agreement with the tobacco industry announced by the \n     state Attorneys General has the potential to save millions of \n     lives, prevent children from starting to smoke, and help \n     break the cycle of addiction for both children and adults.\n\n  They continued:\n\n       This agreement has the potential to achieve more than could \n     be realistically gained by any other means. The agreement can \n     be a historic turning point in the decades-old fight to \n     protect children from tobacco addiction and bring about a \n     fundamental change in the role of tobacco and the tobacco \n     industry in our lives.\n\n  They continued by saying:\n\n       The agreement goes well beyond the provisions of the FDA \n     Rule in terms of reducing youth access to tobacco products \n     and curbing tobacco marketing.\n\n  It goes on and on and on praising the June 20 agreement. The bill on \nthe Senate floor was far better than this agreement, which they said \nsuch wonderful things about, yet because of a desire for more and more \nand who can be tougher, we ended up getting less and less and less. And \nwhere we are today is very unfortunate.\n\n  Where we are today is, there is no settlement of any of the lawsuits. \nNo plaintiff has ever put a nickel in their pocket as a result of suing \na tobacco company. This would have provided that. No settlements \nbecause of where we are; no money for the States for their Medicaid \nprograms; no money for the States for tobacco-related expenses; no \nmoney for the National Institutes of Health to do research in this \narea; no additional authority for FDA to regulate nicotine as a drug; \nno advertising and marketing restrictions; no targets for reducing teen \nsmoking, with penalties if these targets are not met. There is no help \nfor farmers for getting out of the business.\n  And what we have now is a debate about whose fault it is. We are \narguing about failure. We are arguing that, ``It's your fault nothing \nwas done''; ``No; it's your fault nothing was done,'' instead of trying \nto put together a compromise where we can argue about success, where we \ncan argue about a bill that would provide all of these things that I \nhave just outlined, and the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee outlined and about which the Senator from California spoke. \nWe have none of that now. And we have none of that because of this rush \nto see who can be tougher and tougher and tougher.\n  I am suggesting that what Senator Hatch and Senator Feinstein have \nbrought before the Senate is a major undertaking. And we are at the \npoint where it is time for cooler heads to prevail. We have had the \npolitical debate. We have had the political arguments. We have had the \npollsters talk about who comes out the best. And in fact, the truth is \nwe all come out, I think, looking pretty bad.\n  So I conclude by thanking Senator Hatch and Senator Feinstein for \ndoing what they are doing. The status of the tobacco legislation now, \nbecause of the Senate's action, is that it has been sent back to the \nCommerce Committee. I think we ought to take this legislation and bring \nit back to the full Senate.\n  Now that we have had the political discussion, perhaps we can find a \nway to come together and do something where everybody can get credit. \nBoth sides can get credit, and the American people will win. Right now \nwe have a situation where I am afraid that everybody is a loser. This \nis a good, solid, balanced approach that needs to be enacted. Thank \nyou.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield the last couple minutes of my time to \nthe distinguished Senator from California, if she would like.\n  Mr. President, let me just bring one other point to the Senate's \nattention. Press articles in the past few days make it abundantly clear \nthe need to enact a national settlement.\n  Yesterday, the Washington Post had a front page article: ``Tobacco \nPays for Crusade Against Itself.'' Think about that for a minute. This \narticle highlights what it calls an ``all-fronts attack'' on tobacco, a \nmassive counteradvertising campaign paid for by the industry itself. \nThose potent tools would be used by all 50 States if we enacted a \nnational settlement. The article highlights the strong counter-\nadvertising message that is being delivered in Florida because of the \nsettlement.\n  Then today, the Post ran another article that was entitled: ``Appeals \nCourt Voids Award in Tobacco Suit.'' This article describes the Florida \ncourt of appeals action to overturn a $750,000 judgment against the \nBrown and Williamson tobacco corporation for a smoker who lost part of \nhis lung to cancer.\n\n[[Page S6861]]\n\n  Experts agree that the ruling, which overturned a judgement termed by \nthe AMA as a ``milestone,'' has important national implications. This \njury award was just the second jury award against a tobacco company in \nall of our history in this country.\n  Now, you can go back to the 1960s, when I became a young lawyer in \nPittsburgh, PA. The first antitobacco cigarette cancer case in the \nhistory of the world was brought to the Federal district court by none \nother than Jimmy McArdle, one of the greatest plaintiffs' attorneys who \never lived, the lead partner in the law firm McArdle, Harrington, \nFeeney, and McLaughlin.\n  That was a big battle. This case was publicized all over the country. \nIt was the first loss of literally hundreds of cases.\n  The ruling in the Florida case was just the second awarded against \ntobacco companies, and its reversal once again demonstrates how hard it \nis to successfully sue the tobacco industry.\n  This ruling affirms the vitality of the common law doctrine of \nassumption of risk which bars recovery if the plaintiff knew the risk \nof his action. Because of the assumption of risk doctrine, the tobacco \ncompanies win almost all their cases.\n  A national settlement bill, such as Hatch-Feinstein, would assure an \norderly and rational payout of funds by earmarking annual payments. It \nwould avoid the so-called ``race to the courthouse'' that has so many \nof us concerned.\n  These two Washington Post articles point out the need for a \n``global'' approach in the words of the Attorneys General.\n  I would happily yield the remainder of my time to my friend from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the chairman. And I thank him very much for \nall his work in this area.\n  I think, just to summarize--and I recognize there is a lot of \nterritorial imperative resounding around this issue. And I hope that \ncan be put into perspective and that we can look to find something \naround which we can rally.\n  True, this is a compromise proposal. I hope it will not be dismissed \nout of hand. It has a liability cap, yes. It has strong look-back \nprovisions. It provides $428 billion over 25 years. It does divide the \nmoney 50-50 to federal and state. The money that goes to the State can \nbe used for 14 specific programs. The money that goes to the federal \nfund is used for tobacco-related research and public health programs. \nIt does have the FDA provisions. It does have strong advertising \nprovisions.\n  Now, as I have talked to people, there is a kind of purist attitude \nthat ``Unless a bill is this or that, I won't vote for it.'' Well, \nthere are a lot of strong feelings on behalf of all of us. I could \nsay--and it is true--my calls on tobacco reform have run dominantly in \nthe negative, those people opposed to reform. And yet I think there \nisn't a Member in this body who does not understand that tobacco reform \nis something that is important, just forged from one statistic--and \nthat is 3,000 young people a day beginning to smoke, and 1,000 of them \ndying from tobacco-related illnesses.\n  We know we have to do something. We do know when you raise the price, \nteenagers stop or are deterred from buying. If you combine that with a \nstrong no-advertising provision and a strong look-back provision to \nkeep the companies honest, I think you have a bill that is about as \ngood as one can get.\n  So I'm very pleased and proud to join with the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, once again, to offer to work with whomever in this \nbody so that we might be able to introduce a bill that will be looked \nupon with favor by a majority.\n  I thank Chairman Hatch and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, we are here to debate one of the most \nsignificant components of our foreign relations policy, and that is the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill.\n  There is often a great temptation to exploit foreign policy debates \nfor partisan political purposes. We all are tempted. But I believe that \nwhen we do--that is, on a foreign policy debate--it is a mistake. Such \npartisan fighting over critical issues of worldwide importance is both \ndangerous and counterproductive, and that is why I see engaging in \ncongressional debates over China policy at this time, particularly \namendments which are perceived as mischievous, is not a good idea. \nAlthough China does not manage its affairs as we would like, it makes \nlittle sense to base our relationship entirely on that concern. We \nshould base our relationship, rather, with China on a clear view of \nUnited States interests, a\n\n[[Page S6862]]\n\nfoundation of basic American values, and appropriate methods that will \nsecure those interests and advance those values.\n  China is the fastest growing country in the world. It is the world's \nmost populous country.\n  It has the largest army in the world, is a nuclear power. China is a \nforce to be reckoned with. And of all the areas our foreign policy must \naddress--peace and security in Asia, prosperity and open trade, \nenvironmental protection, the prevention of climate change, and human \nrights--we will achieve our goals more easily through a cooperative \nrelationship with China than with a destructive one of confrontation, \none that seeks common ground and addresses differences frankly rather \nthan through a policy limited to sanctions and confrontations. That is \nan approach that has succeeded with China over the past 25 years.\n\n  China is a large country. The most progressive regions of the country \nare those engaged in trade with the West. That is no accident. Our \npresence in China has an enormously positive influence--one that would \nbe lost if we cut off trade or cut off discussions with China.\n  This relationship with China has grown out of the foresight and the \ncooperative efforts of those who have gone before us.\n  Our modern relationship with China began over 25 years ago with a \nvisit to China by President Nixon. President Nixon anticipated the \ndifficult nature of this relationship. But he also recognized the \nimportance of establishing a sound working relationship with the most \npopulous nation in the world.\n  As Envoy to China, former President Bush continued the efforts to \nopen China to the rest of the world. His work set the stage for the \nU.S.-China relationship we have today. Perfect, it is not. But it is a \nrelationship, and it can be improved. And it calls to mind other \nrelationships which we have encouraged over the years.\n  Fifty years ago, we had no relationship with Japan. Since then we \nforged an enduring alliance with that important nation. It is the work \nof statesmen like Douglas MacArthur and Yoshida Shigeru after the end \nof World War II; Dwight Eisenhower and Kishi Nobusuke, who steered the \nU.S.-Japan Security Treaty through the Senate and Diet in 1960; and \nMontana's own Mike Mansfield, who served for years as our Ambassador to \nJapan.\n  This relationship was not--and is not--a partisan issue. Its \nchampions came from the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. And \nwe have all benefited from their hard work.\n  This relationship has weathered great adversity in the last half \ncentury--the Chinese Revolution, the Korean war, Vietnam, and 40 years \nof the cold war. Through it all, this relationship has helped many of \nthe nations in the Pacific give their people better lives.\n  It is important to remember that we spent years engaged in a standoff \nwith the former Soviet Union. But by engaging that nation, we witnessed \nthe end of the cold war, the end of the conflict and the birth of a new \nrelationship with Russia. It took hard work and cooperation to make \nthis new Russia a reality. The same is true in our dealings with China.\n  A policy of engagement--tough, frank, hard-nosed engagement--is \ncorrect, not because it is in the interest of China, but because it is \nin the interest of America.\n  There are still great strides to be made with China, particularly on \nhuman rights. It is a mistake to focus only on our differences and to \nostracize China.\n  We must ask ourselves whether we should seek to reform China by \ncontinuing engagement in a positive manner, or, instead whether we \nshould seek to force the Chinese to change course by isolation.\n  I think we ought to pursue the first choice--engagement.\n  Mr. President, some have suggested that we are appeasing, even \ncoddling, China, that we are ignoring their human rights abuses and \nother egregious acts, that somehow they are being given undue special \ntreatment. I disagree.\n  Obviously, there are problems with the way China cracks down on \npolitical dissent and treats its dissidents. However, I think the \ninsinuation that there is double standard for China is not correct.\n  We must continue to speak up when China acts contrary to \ninternational norms. Simply put, we cannot and should not look the \nother way when China disregards its commitments.\n  However, we cannot have much say in these matters if we do not talk--\nif we do not engage in constructive dialogue. After all, China's most \nrepressive periods have occurred when China was isolated from the rest \nof the world.\n  During the debate on this bill, as we consider amendments we should \nask ourselves one question.\n  Does the amendment strengthen America's hand, and improve our \nrelationship, or will it make things worse?\n  If the latter, I would urge my colleagues to vote it down.\n  Let me apply this question to the pending, divided, amendment.\n  The distinguished Senator from Arkansas has proposed a series of \namendments to the DOD authorization bill which aim to change China's \nbehavior through a series of minor but bothersome sanctions.\n  I deeply appreciate the Senator's reservations with some of China's \npolicies. We all have reservations with some of China's policies. But, \nI believe this amendment goes about changing them in the wrong fashion.\n  Surely every member of Congress would take issue with forced \nabortions--I would; we all would--religious persecution the same, and \nthe imprisonment of individuals for the expression of political \nbeliefs. That is clear.\n  Americans hold as their most cherished freedoms the right to worship \nas they please and speak their minds. It is a measure of the country's \ngreatness that we are allowed to speak freely.\n  We expect this freedom on this Senate floor and indeed we have it. We \nexpect it in our homes and throughout our workplaces.\n  It is therefore natural that we extend these freedoms to peoples in \nother lands. We object strongly when those rights are denied. Clearly, \nthere are other issues concerning China that Americans can disagree \nwith.\n  Despite significant progress, today's China is still too repressive \nand too restrictive. Those who would speak out against the government \nstill risk imprisonment, house arrest and the denial of political \nrights. I wish to change that. We all wish to change that, and change \nthat eventually with the right policies we will.\n  We must hold China accountable to the human rights agreements it has \nsigned, most notably the universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n  But alienating China will not convince China. Ostracizing China will \nnot endear it to the practices we would most like to see implemented.\n  We can continue to facilitate China's transformation through \nengagement and dialogue or we can give in to the isolationist \nsentiments that these amendments represent.\n  As we near the President's departure for China tomorrow, I urge the \nSenate to express its support for continued engagement of the Chinese \nGovernment.\n  No doubt about it, the President has much to discuss when he gets to \nBeijing. But it is both important and appropriate that the discussions \noccur. They must occur. Frank discussions of necessary improvements in \nChina should be forthcoming.\n  The success of the trip will be enhanced with the endorsement of this \nbody.\n  Mr. President, today's debate illustrates an even more important \npoint--the need for a bipartisan approach to foreign policy. It has \nbeen said that politics ends at the water's edge. When it comes to \nforeign policy there are no Democrats, there are no Republicans, there \nare only Americans.\n  In this world today, there are many serious, global issues: India and \nPakistan exploding nuclear bombs, the expansion of NATO, the collapse \nof the Asian economy. To the maximum extent possible, we must work \ntogether to address these issues. But often, partisan actions hinder \nprogress on important issues of national importance.\n  One such instance is the conflict over funding for the International \nMonetary Fund.\n  The attempt to link family planning policy and international \nfinancial assistance is an effort to conduct a debate for the benefit \nof a domestic constituency. If a debate on the IMF is in\n\n[[Page S6863]]\n\norder, then we should debate the IMF on its merits. But to stall the \npassage of this important legislation may weaken the hand of the U.S. \nGovernment and it may allow real problems to get worse. This is a \nsituation where cooperation is critical.\n  Last week, I invited my colleagues to join me in an effort to \nestablish a more cooperative, bipartisan approach to our foreign policy \nmatters.\n  I, along with Senator Hagel of Nebraska, am working to focus more \nenergy seeking constructive solutions to American foreign policy \nproblems. We intend to work together, to help reduce the rancor that \npartisan bickering tends to produce.\n  Just as engagement is the proper way of working with China, so too \nmust we engage each other in order to better articulate Americans' \ninterests and needs aboard.\n  We are many voices. We represent many ideas. Making progress requires \nconstructive dialogue by all parties, and I encourage my colleagues \nengage in that discussion.\n  One final note, Mr. President. When President Clinton travels--when \nany American President travels overseas--he is the President of the \nUnited States of America. He is not a Republican President. He is not a \nDemocratic President. He is the American President. When he travels, we \nin the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives must give him our \nfull cooperation. There are other times when he returns when we can \ndebate what our foreign policy should be. But when it comes to foreign \npolicy, we Americans will do much better, our stature in the world will \nbe much higher, if we work out these differences among ourselves so \nthat in the end we truly have a bipartisan foreign policy, a foreign \npolicy that the Congress and the President have worked out together so \nthat we stand taller and get more done than we otherwise might.\n\n  There is plenty of room here in domestic politics for partisanship. \nThere is more than enough here for partisanship in domestic politics. I \ndeplore most of it, even in domestic policy, but when it comes to \nforeign policy, we must stand together.\n  I urge Senators who have amendments to think twice before offering \nthem, and perhaps bring up that issue when the President returns from \nhis trip to China, because then the country is much better off.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/23/senate-section/article/S6861-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6863-S6867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I understand that Senator Hutchinson is now \nin a position to have the pending China human rights issue withdrawn.\n  However, before the Senator is recognized, let me put the Senate on \nnotice as to where the bill is going, hopefully, for the next few days, \nwhich will take some cooperation, but I believe we are going to get it. \nI certainly hope so.\n  Following the withdrawal of the China issue and a statement by \nSenator Hutchinson--and I believe he is on the floor and ready to \nproceed--the Senate will resume consideration of the DOD authorization \nuntil approximately 5 p.m. At that time, the Senate will turn to the \nCoverdell A+ conference report for approximately 2 hours of debate \ntonight. The Senate will resume the conference report consideration on \nWednesday at 9:30 and, therefore, the vote on final passage will occur \naround 11:30 on Wednesday on the Coverdell A+ education bill.\n  The Senate will then resume the DOD authorization bill. It is the \nhope of both leaders that the bill can move forward and be concluded by \nthe close of business on Wednesday. I realize that is a big order, but \nwe are calling on our leadership.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Wednesday of this week?\n  Mr. LOTT. Wednesday of this week, or Thursday at the latest, because \nwe do have a lot of other work to do.\n  I realize there are some, I don't know, 150 amendments pending. Who \nare we kidding? That is not only not serious, that is totally \nlaughable. This is the Department of Defense authorization bill which \nwe need to do for our country. This is a bill that the Armed Services \nCommittee has already done the bulk of the work on. While I realize \nthere are a lot of policy issues, a lot of amendments that Senators \nwould like to offer, I hope they will cooperate and we can get this \nbill completed in a reasonable period of time. This is the fifth day \nthat we have been on the DOD authorization bill. Tomorrow will be the \nsixth day. So we need to get it concluded. I do now put the Senate on \nnotice that I intend to call up H.R. 2358, relative to the China human \nrights issue, sometime after July 6, 1998. I will notify all Members \nwhen the date has been finalized so all Members will have time to \nprepare for it. This is an important issue for our country. Senators on \nthe Democratic side have said we should not debate this while the \nPresident is going to China. I think, as a matter of fact, that the \nreverse is the case--that we should make our point, express the \nSenate's concern on these very important issues before the President \ngoes, but not necessarily while he is there. It is an issue that we \nneed to address further, and we are going to do that sometime after \nJuly 6.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, following a brief \nstatement by Senator Hutchinson, the motion to recommit be \nautomatically withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for the \nopportunity to work with him on this issue. I believe the China \namendments I have offered have great value. The debate has been \nhealthy, and the debate has been necessary. I, frankly, am willing to \nstand here and talk about human rights in China in general this week \nand next week, or as long as it takes. My great objective is to see \nthese provisions become the public policy of this land.\n  In my opinion, the opponents of these amendments do not have a \nsubstantive leg to stand on. The only reason they have brought up to \noppose these amendments involves the timing of the offering of these \namendments. I remind my colleagues, once again, that I offered these \nand filed these amendments over a month ago. They have sought to \nobfuscate the issues, obscure the motivations, and place obstacles in \nthe path of clean and substantive votes. The hollowness of the \nadministration's policy is evident in their unwillingness to embrace \nthese very modest human rights amendments.\n  Mr. President, if I might say again, the hollowness of the \nadministration's China policy is evident in their unwillingness to \nembrace even those modest human rights amendments, and the length to \nwhich they have gone to block them from a vote on their merits, I \nthink, speaks to the weakness of the policy. The policy has failed. The \nlack of outrage by this administration over the news today that China \ndenied visa approval for Radio Free Asia reporters, I think, gives \npowerful testimony to the kind of acquiescence and concessionary spirit \nthat characterizes this administration's policies. It is all too \ntypical.\n  These issues will not go away, I assure you. Slave labor conditions, \nforced abortions, forced sterilizations, religious persecution, and \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction are real issues. They are \nnot fiction or partisan weapons; they are not used for some kind of \npolitical brownie points or ``got-you'' points. These are real issues \nthat need to be debated, and we need to change our foreign policy in \nrelation to these abuses that are ongoing in China.\n  If history teaches us anything, history teaches us that appeasement \nnever works. The fact that this administration has refused even to \noffer the annual resolution at the U.N. convention in Geneva on human \nrights, I think, is indicative that even the smallest stands for human \nrights have gone by the wayside. I think it was Edmund Burke who said, \n``All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do \nnothing.''\n  What the Senate has done today on China policy is nothing. The fact \nthat these bills passed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives, \nthe fact that this body voted not to table them by 80-plus votes, \nindicates there is strength in their appeal. I want to express my \nappreciation to the majority\n\n[[Page S6864]]\n\nleader for the commitment he has made today to bring up H.R. 2358 in \nJuly for a vote and that the China issue will be addressed, and \nthat whether it is Senator Abraham or Senator Wellstone, or others, who \nhave issues regarding bills regarding China, they will have an \nopportunity to debate them and to offer them. I compliment and commend \nthe majority leader for that public commitment today. I will continue \nto press for votes on these provisions. I will look for legislative \nvehicles, if necessary.\n\n  These concerns that I have expressed are not, as they have been \nportrayed, partisan politics. This afternoon, I attended a press \nconference in which there were more Democrats than Republicans \nexpressing their concern about the human rights policy of this \nadministration toward China. This is not partisan politics. This has \nnothing to do with Republicans trying to make points. I probably have \nas much difference on some of them on my side of the aisle as I do on \nsome of them on the other side of the aisle. So people can stand and \nsay that we should not use foreign policy as an instrument of partisan \npolitics. Well, this is not. This is a bipartisan concern about human \nrights abuses in China that have not improved under the policy of this \nadministration.\n  There is much more that we need to do, on a bipartisan basis, to \npress the cause of basic human rights and democracy in China. It is my \nsincere hope that President Clinton will take every opportunity to \nelevate these issues during his trip, which he embarks on tomorrow.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to recommit is withdrawn.\n  The motion to recommit was withdrawn.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2407, as modified\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I believe my amendment No. 2407 is now \nthe pending business. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2407), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted by the \n     amendment, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF SENATE ON NUCLEAR TESTS IN SOUTH ASIA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) on May 11 and 13, 1998, the Government of India \n     conducted a series of underground nuclear tests;\n       (2) on May 28 and 30, 1998, the Government of Pakistan \n     conducted a series of underground nuclear tests;\n       (3) Although not recognized or accepted as such by the \n     United Nations Security Council, India and Pakistan have \n     declared themselves nuclear weapon states;\n       (4) India and Pakistan have conducted extensive nuclear \n     weapons research over several decades, resulting in the \n     development of nuclear capabilities and the potential for the \n     attainment of nuclear arsenals and the dangerous \n     proliferation of nuclear weaponry;\n       (5) India and Pakistan have refused to enter into \n     internationally recognized nuclear non-proliferation \n     agreements, including the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the \n     Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and full-\n     scope safeguards agreements with the International Atomic \n     Energy Agency;\n       (6) India and Pakistan, which have been at war with each \n     other 3 times in the past 50 years, have urgent bilateral \n     conflicts, most notably over the disputed territory of \n     Kashmir;\n       (7) the testing of nuclear weapons by India and Pakistan \n     has created grave and serious tensions on the Indian \n     subcontinent; and\n       (8) the United States response to India and Pakistan's \n     nuclear tests has included the imposition of wide-ranging \n     sanctions as called for under the Arms Export Control Act and \n     the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--The Senate--\n       (1) strongly condemns the decisions by the governments of \n     India and Pakistan to conduct nuclear tests in May 1998;\n       (2) supports the President's decision to carry out the \n     provisions of the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of \n     1994 with respect to India and Pakistan and invoke all \n     sanctions in that Act;\n       (3) calls upon members of the international community to \n     impose similar sanctions against India and Pakistan to those \n     imposed by the United States;\n       (4) calls for the governments of India and Pakistan to \n     commit not to conduct any additional nuclear tests;\n       (5) urges the governments of India and Pakistan to take \n     immediate steps, bilaterally and under the auspices of the \n     United Nations, to reduce tensions between them;\n       (6) urges India and Pakistan to engage in high-level \n     dialogue aimed at reducing the likelihood of armed conflict, \n     enacting confidence and security building measures, and \n     resolving areas of dispute;\n       (7) commends all nations to take steps which will reduce \n     tensions in South Asia, including appropriate measures to \n     prevent the transfer of technology that could further \n     exacerbate the arms race in South Asia, and thus avoid \n     further deterioration of security there;\n       (8) calls upon the President to seek a diplomatic solution \n     between the governments of India and Pakistan to promote \n     peace and stability in South Asia and resolve the current \n     impasse;\n       (9) encourages United States leadership in assisting the \n     governments of India and Pakistan to resolve their 50-year \n     conflict over the disputed territory in Kashmir;\n       (10) urges India and Pakistan to take immediate, binding, \n     and verifiable steps to roll back their nuclear programs and \n     come into compliance with internationally accepted norms \n     regarding the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; \n     and\n       (11) urges the United States to reevaluate its bilateral \n     relationship with India and Pakistan, in light of the new \n     regional security realities in South Asia, with the goal of \n     preventing further nuclear and ballistic missile \n     proliferation, diffusing long-standing regional rivalries \n     between India and Pakistan, and securing commitments from \n     them which, if carried out, could result in a calibrated \n     lifting of United States sanctions imposed under the Arms \n     Export Control Act and the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention \n     Act of 1994.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, we have a short period of time to be \nable to discuss this, because at 5 o'clock we go to the Coverdell \namendment. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield. I think there \nis some discussion going on now that would enable 10 or 12 minutes on \nthis very important amendment. I would like to take 2 minutes to join \nwith my colleagues who are opposed to it. I would like to speak to it a \nlittle bit.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first of all, have the yeas and nays been \nordered on this issue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, they have not.\n  Mr. LOTT. On the Brownback amendment, the yeas and nays have not been \nordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. I understand there is a possibility we can go ahead and \ncomplete action on the Brownback issue after a statement by the Senator \nfrom Kansas and Senator Warner, and perhaps Senator Levin would have \nsomething to say. If we can get that completed in a reasonable period \nof time, we can complete that and then go over to the Coverdell \neducation issue.\n  Do we have any agreement on the time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I don't know the length. I want to make inquiry on the \nyeas and nays issue. Is it not correct that the yeas and nays were \nordered on the Feinstein first-degree amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So the question is, if there is a need for the yeas and \nnays, we would leave it. If there is no need for a rollcall vote on \nthat, we would need to vitiate, as I understand it, the yeas and nays \non the first-degree Feinstein amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I urge the leadership of the committee to \npursue this issue and, hopefully, get to a conclusion, and then we \nwould go to the Coverdell education conference report immediately after \nthat.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, is there a need for the yeas and nays on \nthe first-degree Feinstein amendment? I ask whether the leader would \nhave any objection, if there is no need for it, to vitiating the yeas \nand nays on the underlying Feinstein first-degree amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, in response to the comment of the \nSenator from Michigan, there is no need for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me inquire again about the time so we \ncan get a time agreement. Do we have some indication of how much time \nis needed? The Senator from Kansas needs how much?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I think we can do all of this in 15 minutes, with all \nparties being able to speak. That would be\n\n[[Page S6865]]\n\nmy sense. I think I can get my comments done in about 7 minutes or so.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it sounds to me like 20 minutes, equally \ndivided, should be sufficient.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time be limited to 20 minutes, \nequally divided, on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have an inquiry of the Chair. Then there are no yeas and \nnays requested on either the first- or second-degree amendments at this \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not yet been vitiated.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the leader have objection to vitiating the yeas and \nnays on the Feinstein amendment at this time?\n  Mr. LOTT. No.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and \nnays be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, if I could inquire briefly of the \nSenator from Virginia who asked to speak on this amendment how much \ntime he might desire on this?\n  Mr. WARNER. Three minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask that I be yielded 7 minutes of \nthe 10 minutes allotted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, last month, following India's nuclear \ntests, I offered legislation to repeal section 620(e) of the Foreign \nAssistance Act of 1961 (otherwise known as the Pressler amendment). The \nPressler amendment concerns restriction on the provision of military \nassistance and other transfers to Pakistan. When Pakistan blundered \ninto responding to India's nuclear tests with tests of its own, this \namendment not only became pointless symbolically, but because of \nexisting sanctions law it was no longer relevant.\n\n  How rapidly events change. Last month when I proposed to repeal \nPressler, the world was reacting in stunned disbelief to India's \nnuclear tests. At the time it seemed our only hope in stalling an all \nout nuclear arms race in South Asia was to offer Pakistan some security \nassurances, while at the same time urging them in the strongest terms \nnot to be drawn into this dangerous display of nuclear saber rattling. \nUnfortunately, Pakistan did test, and we are now imposing sanctions \nrather than lifting them.\n  The month of May 1998 will be remembered as a time of nuclear \nanxiety. Tensions were high as the world watched India and Pakistan \nplay nuclear roulette. June has brought some respite; India and \nPakistan have declared a moratorium on further nuclear testing, and \nthey are discussing bilateral talks this month. I pray that this \nnuclear nightmare will pass.\n  The question of South Asia's regional security and our future \nrelations with India and Pakistan remain issues of abiding concern. \nWhat has happened in South Asia is in many ways an indictment of the \nadministration's failed foreign and nonproliferation policies. Consider \nthat, at this very moment Congress is investigating the administration \nfor its export control policies, particularly as they relate to China. \nThese policies have made possible the wholesale proliferation of \nmissile and nuclear technology, not only to Pakistan, but to others, \nsuch as Iran.\n  Mr. President, the testing of nuclear weapons by India and Pakistan, \nand the resulting security crisis in South Asia should be of grave \nconcern to all of us. We must continue to condemn India and Pakistan's \nnuclear tests, and urge them to enact confidence and security building \nmeasures to reduce the likelihood of armed conflict. We must encourage \na more involved role by the United States in seeking a diplomatic \nsolution, and in providing leadership to resolve the conflict over the \ndisputed territory in Jumma Kashmir. We should urge India and Pakistan \nto roll back their nuclear programs, and to come into compliance with \nthe NPT. In addition the United States should develop policies which \nwill promote stable, democratic, and economically thriving economies in \nIndia and Pakistan.\n  Last week the administration implemented sanctions against India and \nPakistan. Although the scope of these sanctions is limited--ending \neconomic aids, loans, and military sales--they will cast a negative \npall on our relations until they are lifted. We should not \nunderestimate the symbolic and economic impact of these sanctions. In \nIndia, America-bashing has taken the form of boycotting American \nproducts and vandalizing establishments selling them. There are reports \nthat foreign capital is fleeing India and Pakistan, and financial \nmarkets there have already been badly hurt.\n\n  It is premature today to talk about lifting these sanctions, but I \ndon't believe it is too early to begin planning for their gradual \nremoval. For that reason I am considering legislation which could \nprovide for the conditional removal of sanctions against India and \nPakistan, based upon progress as outlined in the Geneva Communique.\n  I think the communiques issued after the P-5 meeting in Geneva, and \nthe G-8 meeting in London are reasonable appeals to India and Pakistan \nby the nuclear powers. Eighty other nations have joined the P-5 and the \nG-8 in denouncing these nuclear tests and calling for action by India \nand Pakistan. But, these appeals will not be met by India and Pakistan \nsimply because they were announced in official communiques.\n  The Geneva communique said that confidence building measures, \nincentives, disincentives, and other actions are steps the \ninternational community can take in its relations with India and \nPakistan. There are a number of actions we in Congress can take to move \nthis process forward. Here are just a few.\n  We can listen to the concerns put forward by the Indian and Pakistani \npeople. This week I will be leading a delegation to India and Pakistan \nto hold meetings with their leaders. My goal in visiting India and \nPakistan is to hear, first hand, the views and concerns of their \nleadership. I also want to give assurances that this issue is very much \non the front burner for the U.S. Congress. As I said in a hearing two \nweeks ago, it would be folly to isolate India and Pakistan at this \ntime. We must be engaged. Unfortunately, in recent years U.S. foreign \npolicy in India and Pakistan has been one of estrangement, not \nengagement.\n  We can work closely with the administration. This week I plan to \ninvite the State Department Special Coordinator for India and Pakistan \nand interested members to a round table to explore how we might \nconstructively engage India and Pakistan. I look forward to the results \nof those meetings.\n  In all of this--our meetings, our travel to the region, and our \ndiscussions with allies--our goal is to halt the proliferation of \nnuclear weapons in South Asia, restore regional security, and put our \nbilateral relationships with India and Pakistan back on track. We \nshould settle for no less.\n  Mr. President, at the appropriate time I will ask for the passage of \nthese bills. I do not believe that we will need a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. President, how much time is left on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator has 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to retain the remainder of \nthat.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Terry Williams, a fellow in my office, \nbe permitted privilege of the floor today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, although the Senator didn't say this, \nI am a cosponsor.\n  I want to speak briefly about it. I don't believe in the last decade \nthat there has been a more disturbing fact and change of events on the \nsubcontinent of Asia than the detonation of these nuclear tests. They \nhave taken two countries, and indicated to the world that each has a \nlethal capacity which is far in excess of the bomb that exploded at \nHiroshima.\n  This morning I detailed the unclassified analyses of what each of \nthese countries has in the type of nuclear weapons, the type of \nlaunching devices, the type of plane, and the potential damage in terms \nof loss of life of humans that could occur. And it is quite mind-\nboggling.\n\n[[Page S6866]]\n\n  This resolution essentially calls upon all freedom-loving countries, \nall members of the international community, to support the United \nStates in its sanctions against both India and Pakistan. It calls for \nthe Governments of India and Pakistan to commit to no further \nadditional nuclear test, and it urges them to take immediate steps \nbilaterally, and under the auspices of the United Nations, to reduce \ntensions between them.\n  This morning I indicated how easy these tensions could increase. I \nmentioned the bomb on a train. I mentioned 25 people killed at a Hindu \nwedding, a product of Moslem terrorists. Any one of these events could \nbring about a miscalculation and produce a nuclear holocaust.\n  We also in this resolution urge India and Pakistan to take immediate \nbinding and verifiable steps to roll back their nuclear programs and \ncome into compliance with internationally accepted norms regarding \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. And we urge our country \nto reevaluate our bilateral relationship with India and Pakistan in \nlight of the new regional security realities in south Asia with the \ngoal of preventing further nuclear and ballistic missile proliferation, \ndiffusing longstanding regional rivalry between India and Pakistan, and \nsecuring commitments from them, which, if carried out, could result in \na calibrated lifting of U.S. sanctions imposed under the Arms Export \nControl Act and the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this resolution has been cleared on all \nsides. I would certainly urge its passage by voice vote.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I likewise ask to be made a cosponsor of \nthis amendment. I think it is a very responsible effort by our \ndistinguished colleagues, the principal sponsors, and I think the \nSenate will endorse this, as it will in a voice vote momentarily.\n  But I would just bring to the attention of colleagues, if we do not \nhandle responsibly this crisis--we, the United States--together with \nour principal allies, it will signal to other nations that they should \nbegin to look towards the development of weapons of mass destruction. \nIn all likelihood, they cannot afford the expense associated with \nnuclear weapons, but it will propel them into further areas of chemical \nand biological.\n  So that, to me, is the seriousness of this problem, if we do not \nhandle it fairly, evenhandedly, and with a note of understanding. And \nthat brings me to my question, because section (b)(3) urges other \nnations to impose sanctions. I just wondered, listening very carefully \nto the Senator from Kansas, who said he is going to travel over there \nto try to work out greater confidence-building measures and also to try \nto increase engagement, am I misreading that section as being possibly \nin conflict with what I hear my two distinguished colleagues as saying?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If I may respond to the Senator from Virginia, it was \nour intent that the United States has put on a set of sanctions via the \nGlenn amendment that were automatic, and we thought it important to \nstate that if we are going to take that position, we should be urging \nother nations to do so as well. Yet, in the longer term, as we get \nfurther out here, I think we should be dealing in a dialog of, how do \nwe get these lifted on a step-by-step, confidence-building measure?\n  At the present time, we are in a unilateral sanctions position, and I \nthink we should urge other nations to join us in that statement, but at \nthe same time I want us to start building the confidence and moving \naway from those if we can't get other nations to join us in this \neffort.\n  Mr. WARNER. I would certainly urge that be done because, in reality, \nwe are not here to say who is at fault; both bear a heavy sense of \nculpability. Unfortunately, India initiated it. I don't know--as time \ngoes on, perhaps there will be an answer--what recourse Pakistan had. \nHad not the current leadership taken that action, they might well have \nbeen either run out of office or forced out of office. So we cannot be \nunmindful of the political instabilities in these nations and the \nreality that if one did it, what recourse the other had other than to \ndo it.\n  Now, two wrongs do not make a right, but I will listen carefully, and \nI hope that this section does not send a signal of any rigidity as we \nshould be pursuing greater engagement.\n  I hope the international community would offer to arbitrate the \ncomplexity of the Kashmir problem. It has been there for a long time, \nand very often, an outside, unbiased, objective collection of nations \ncould come in and render some helpful assistance to alleviate that \nproblem, which is an absolute crisis. Talk about human rights and \nsuffering. There is a war taking place every day--shelling, killing--\nand it must be brought to a stop.\n\n  So I wish to associate myself with the remarks of my two colleagues \nfrom Kansas and California. I congratulate them. I think it is a very \nimportant measure for the Senate to adopt. But I do hope that you will, \non your mission, and others will do what we can to increase engagement \nand provide for solutions.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I appreciate the comments and wisdom of the Senator \nfrom Virginia. We are attempting further engagement.\n  I also want to recognize my colleague from California, Senator \nFeinstein, who has been a leader in this overall effort, as well as \nSenator Harkin and Senator Robb. The whole Senate, hopefully, will be \nengaged in this matter.\n  Mr. President, if no one else seeks to speak--I guess perhaps there \nis somebody else. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, how much time on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will not use it all. I just want to congratulate the \nSenators from California and Kansas for their energy, for their \npersistence, their efforts. It is a very significant statement for the \nSenate and, I believe, for the world. The concern that is reflected in \nthis resolution--this amendment now--is very significant in terms of \nwhat our fears and concerns are. These tests have not brought security \nto India and Pakistan; they have brought insecurity to the region. They \nhave made the world a lot less secure place. And now we must both state \nthat and seek to try to put this genie back in the bottle to the extent \nthat those tests have helped to release it.\n  The modifications are important modifications to make sure this is an \nevenhanded resolution, which it is, following the tests by the two \ncountries. And our staffs have worked very closely with your two \nstaffs. We wish to thank you again for your efforts in pursuing this, \nand we hope that this resolution is promptly and totally adopted by \nthis Senate.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern with the \npending amendment.\n  I deeply regret the circumstances regarding India's decision to \ndetonate nuclear devices. But the increased instability in South Asia \nhas been caused by China's proliferation policies, a U.S. foreign \npolicy which favors China over India, and the licensing of technologies \nby the United States which enhances China's military capabilities.\n  So I wonder why we would consider strongly condemning the Indian \ngovernment--the democratically elected Indian government--for taking \nlegal actions in its perceived self interest. And I further question \nthis amendment occurring on a day in which the Senate could not vote to \nexpress our concerns with the reprehensible actions taken by the \ncommunist party officials running the People's Republic of China.\n  Mr. President, India has broken no international laws or agreements \nby choosing to test nuclear devices, and India is not a known \nproliferator of weapons or weapons technology. We know, however, that \nChina is a proliferator. Of particular concern is Chinese proliferation \nof weapons and technologies to Pakistan. But today the Senate will vote \nto condemn India and fail to vote to condemn China.\n  India and China went to war in 1962. To this day, China continues to \noccupy 15,000 square miles of Indian territory\n\n[[Page S6867]]\n\nin Ladakh and it claims sovereignty over the entire 35,000 square miles \nof India's Northeastern most province. The pending amendment rightly \npoints out that India has not joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation \nTreaty. But the amendment fails to recognize that the NPT seeks to \nensure the current five nuclear powers alone are able to possess \nnuclear weapons. This means that China can maintain its arsenal, but \nIndia cannot. India has not signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty \nfor similar reasons.\n  Mr. President, there appears to be a serious contradiction \nrepresented in our foreign policy which makes no sense to me. It is for \nthis reason that I cannot support this amendment and will vote against \nit. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2407), as modified, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now is on agreeing to the first-\ndegree amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2405), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I just say one final thing. I \nappreciate the committee working with us, the ranking member and \nchairman of the committee; I thank them very much.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I did not hear whether there was a motion \nto reconsider. If not, I move to reconsider that vote.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. As I understand, we are due back on this bill at 12 \no'clock tomorrow. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That has not yet been ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. The defense authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not yet been ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Do we anticipate being back at 12 o'clock tomorrow?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the answer to the question.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I would like for Members who have any amendments to \noffer to come down and offer these amendments. We have got to push this \nbill. This is a vital bill. It concerns every citizen in this country. \nThis defense bill is very, very important, and we do not want to be \ndelayed in carrying it on and on. Let's act promptly and show the world \nthat we stand for a strong defense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me join the chairman of the committee \nin urging our colleagues to bring amendments to the floor tomorrow, as \nwe anticipate, when we return to this bill at around noon. We now have \nremoved a major roadblock to considering other amendments, so the floor \nwill be open at that time for other amendments to be considered, and we \nhope our colleagues will bring those to the floor.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I now ask that the Chair lay before the \nSenate the conference report to accompany H.R. 2646, the Coverdell A+ \neducation bill, and it be considered under the provisions of the \nearlier consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2646), have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their \n     respective Houses this report, signed by majority of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of June 15, 1998.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, first I would like to commend the \nconferees. I would like to commend Chairman Archer of the conference \ncommittee. I believe they have brought to the Senate, as they did the \nHouse, a sweeping education reform proposal that will affect millions \nupon millions of American children trying successfully to obtain a \nquality education. They have obtained a bipartisan approach that has \nbeen embraced by some of the more distinguished Members of the other \nside who will speak to this. To paraphrase Senator Lieberman in the \npress conference at the announcement of the conference report, he said \nit was clear to him that the Republican leadership had reached out to \nhis party and to the President, and he thought the time had come for \ntheir side to reach out as well. And, therefore, we now begin a \ndiscussion of the conference report on education reform in the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, first I would like to talk, just briefly, about the \nnumber of people who will be affected if what is clearly going to pass \nthe Senate with a very strong vote and has passed the House already and \nwill be sent to the President to consider, is signed by the President. \nIn the first case, some 14 million families will open education savings \naccounts who are the parents of 20 million children. Think about it. \nThat is about half of the school population in kindergarten through \nhigh school that would be the beneficiary--half of the school \npopulation of the United States. These are precarious times. As we come \nto a new century, we have a new tool to use to help parents see to the \nneeds of their children.\n  What has always been amazing to me about this proposal--which the \nother side has pointed out almost ridiculously, but I will come to \nthat--is that it is a very modest form of tax relief because it allows \nthe interest buildup on these savings accounts to accrue without being \ntaxed so long as the account is used for an educational purpose. The \ntax relief, therefore, for these education savings accounts over the \nnext 5 years, is a little over $1 billion, $1 billion to $1.3 billion.\n  What is amazing is how little incentive it takes to make Americans do \nhuge things, because that limited tax relief will cause those 14 \nmillion families on behalf of their 20-plus million children to save \nover $5 billion. Over 10 years it will cause them to save over $12 \nbillion. It is just amazing.\n  I was just reading a report where the savings rate in the United \nStates has plunged to 3.9 percent, one of the lowest levels in a half a \ncentury. So this becomes win/win, because not only does it cause \nAmericans to save, and large sums of money, but it is for education, \nthe Nation's No. 1 problem by everybody's account as we come to the new \ncentury.\n  It does a lot of other things as well. The conference report will \nhelp over 1 million students deal with the costs of higher education \nbecause it helps qualified State tuition programs and protects them \nfrom tax burdens, and that makes them more valuable. Over 1 million \nstudents will benefit from this; 21 States already have these plans and \n17 have them under consideration. It has a component in the conference \nreport which came out of the Senate Finance Committee, which will help \nover 1 million employees expand their continuing education. It will \nhelp 1 million employees seek continuing education because it will \nallow employers to spend up to $5,250 on behalf of an employee's \ncontinuing education, and it is not seen as taxable income to the \nemployee. So over a million employees will benefit from it.\n\n  It has an arbitrage rebate exception for public school bonds, which \nwill help the construction of public schools.\n  The provision that was inserted in the Finance Committee from Senator \nGraham, which I believe is a very good provision which would be broader \non school construction, did not become a\n\n[[Page S6868]]\n\npart of the conference report, I am sorry to say. I hope I will be able \nto work with the Senator from Florida to expand that at another day.\n  It includes a provision that was adopted by the Senate with 100 \nvotes, the Reading Excellence Act, which authorizes a literacy program \nwhich focuses on training teachers to teach reading with scientifically \nproven methods like phonics. The House passed similar language \nunanimously, and the President of the United States endorsed this bill. \nSo here we have a provision that received total bipartisan support and \nhas been endorsed by the President of the United States.\n  It retains the same-sex school provision of Senator Kay Bailey \nHutchison of Texas, which makes it an allowable use of Federal \neducation dollars to fund education reform projects that provide same-\ngender schools and classrooms as long as comparable educational \nopportunities are offered for students of both sexes.\n  It keeps the Senate-passed measure, Teacher Testing Merit Pay, by the \nSenator from New York; Dollars to the Classroom, which requires 95 \npercent of Federal education dollars to find their way to the \nclassroom, by the Senator from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson; the \nStudent Improvement Grant Program, offered by the Senator from Idaho, \nSenator Kempthorne; a multilingualism study, by Senator McCain; and \nSAFE Schools, by Senator Dorgan.\n  Mr. President, in deference to the chairman of the Finance Committee, \nwho has now arrived, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I thank very much the distinguished Senator \nfrom Georgia for his courtesy. Let me once again applaud and \ncongratulate him for the leadership he has provided in this matter of \neducation, of helping us to show our parents throughout this country it \nis within reach financially. I think this legislation would never have \nreached this point had it not been for his active leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the Federal Government has a responsibility \nto promote policies and programs that make quality education accessible \nto students, to their parents, and to their families. Today, students \nand parents are under an enormous burden when it comes to paying for \neducation. There is serious and legitimate concern about the \naccessibility of quality schools and teachers and materials necessary \nfor success.\n  And costs continue to rise.\n  With the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 we succeeded in helping parents \nand students prepare for and even offset some of the escalating costs \nassociated with higher education. For example:\n  We created an education savings IRA to allow parents to save for \nhigher education.\n  We expanded the tax-deferred treatment of State-sponsored prepaid \ntuition plans.\n  We restored the tax deduction on student loan interest.\n  We extended the tax-free treatment of employer-provided educational \nassistance.\n  And, we established tax credits--the HOPE scholarship and the \nLifetime Learning Credite--for students to use in connection with their \neducation.\n  Each of these measures goes a long, long way toward helping our \nstudents and their families handle the financial burden associated with \ncollege life.\n  But, Mr. President, we did not go far enough. Personally, I would \nlike to have seen more powerful measures. The Senate version of the \nTaxpayer Relief Act of 1997 actually contained stronger provisions, but \nthey were dropped as part of the conference agreement.\n  I firmly believe in those stronger measures and so I introduced them \nas a separate bill on the very day that we passed the Taxpayer Relief \nAct. My objective then was the same as it is today--to help American \nfamilies afford the costs of a quality education.\n  I proposed to push the education IRA from its $500-a-year limit to \n$2,000 a year, and to allow withdrawals for elementary and secondary \nschool; to make tax-free treatment of employer-provided educational \nassistance permanent and to reinstate it for graduate education; and to \nmake State-sponsored prepaid tuition programs tax free, not just tax \ndeferred. These were my objectives as 1997 came to a close, and I am \nhappy to say that we have succeeded in adopting many of them with this \nbill, the Education Savings and School Excellence Act of 1998.\n  This bill comes out of the Senate Finance Committee with bipartisan \nsupport. As I already indicated, the distinguished Senator from Georgia \nhas played a leading role in helping shepherd this important piece of \nlegislation through the Senate. Our bill allows families to increase \ntheir contributions to education IRAs from $500 to $2,000 per year. Not \nonly will the $2,000 per year IRA contributions be available for \ncollege, but they can be used for students at any level--from \nkindergarten all the way through college.\n  As such, the education IRA will be a tremendous asset to parents and \nstudents in grade schools and high schools. The money will be available \nto help cover the costs associated with both public and private \nschools. And the money can be used for a multitude of necessities--from \nbuying school uniforms or books to purchasing a new computer.\n  The bill also makes prepaid tuition programs tax free, meaning that \nstudents will be able to withdraw on a tax-free basis the savings that \naccumulate in their prepaid tuition accounts. Parents will have the \nincentive to put money away today, and their children will have the \nfull benefit of that money tax free tomorrow.\n  These innovative proposals will be a boon to higher education--to our \nstudents and families. Already, 44 States have prepaid tuition programs \nin effect.\n  The other six have legislation to create a State plan, or they have \nimplemented a feasibility study. Such programs will become increasingly \nmore attractive to parents and students, as will individual retirement \naccounts that allow them to meet the educational needs of their family.\n  As I have said before, these measures are an important step forward. \nThey are important for our families--for our students--for the future. \nWith this legislation, Congress is demonstrating its leadership on \neducation.\n  It is a very, very important step in the right direction. And I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  Again, let me thank my distinguished colleague for his leadership and \nhis courtesy in letting me make my statement at this time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I also extend my thanks to the chairman \nof the Finance Committee for his untiring support and patience \nthroughout the long deliberations and for his contributions not only to \nthis education program we have before us but in the area of financial \nrelief and encouragement to American families for years and years and \nyears.\n  Mr. ROTH. Thank you.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am going to yield up to 10 minutes to \nmy distinguished colleague from New Jersey. Let me just say, as the \nprincipal cosponsor of this education reform package we now have before \nthe Senate, he has worked tirelessly, and not always under the best of \ncircumstances, and has been a remarkable contributor to both the form \nand the shape and the final substance of the legislation we now have \nbefore us.\n  I yield up to 10 minutes to my distinguished colleague and friend \nfrom New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for \nyielding me time, but more than that, for his leadership in the course \nof this Congress to bring to the floor of the Senate, in its final \nform, the A+ savings accounts.\n  I also congratulate the conferees for settling what were some real \ndifferences in bringing now, in this final form, the A+ savings \naccounts in such a manner, I believe, that on a bipartisan basis \nSenators can be both pleased and proud to lend their support in final \npassage.\n  Mr. President, upon passage in the Senate of the A+ savings accounts, \nseven Democratic Senators joined with me in writing the majority \nleader, expressing our concern that amendments offered by Senator \nAshcroft and Senator Gorton presented some real difficulties to \nDemocratic Members of the Senate in being able to vote for the \nconference report.\n\n[[Page S6869]]\n\n  These two amendments would have either prohibited national school \ntesting, which has been a priority of the Clinton administration, or \ntransformed educational funding by the Federal Government into block \ngrants to the States.\n  Many of us have believed that block granting many of these worthwhile \nprograms would have placed in jeopardy important Federal initiatives in \nsecondary education. And eliminating testing would have prevented \nmilestones in education which the Clinton administration thought were \nso important.\n  It is important for Democratic Senators to know both amendments, in \nan effort to obtain genuine, broad-based bipartisan support, both \namendments are not contained in the conference report. The conference \nreport for A+ savings accounts now is the Coverdell-Torricelli bill as \noriginally proposed. That is why I believe, as we are coming to a vote \ntomorrow, this legislation deserves bipartisan support.\n  There is nothing here that every Democratic Member of this Senate \ncannot enthusiastically support and embrace. Indeed, with all respect \nto my friend, the senior Senator from Georgia, in its purist form this \nis an idea consistent with Democratic Party philosophies. It is, in \nfact, everything that President Clinton offered last year with regard \nto the financing of higher education. Senator Coverdell is simply now \napplying that to grade school and secondary school education.\n  What a simple idea. How basic. American families can save their own \nmoney, in their own savings accounts, without taxation, to educate \ntheir own children in the school of their choice. What possible \nargument could anyone have with that proposal? And yet people have \nfound reason to object: first, that it undermines the public schools. \nOn the contrary, not only does it not undermine the public schools, the \nJoint Committee on Tax is arguing that 70 percent of all of the \nfamilies who will save money in these accounts for their own children \nwill use it on behalf of public school students. As designed by Senator \nCoverdell, this money will be available for afterschool tutoring of \npublic school students, ironically, hiring public schoolteachers, \nafterschool activities, computers, school supplies, uniforms of public \nschool students.\n\n  This does not only not undermine the public school system, it \nstrengthens it by bringing new resources.\n  The second argument is that, if this is done, it may not hurt the \npublic schools but it is done to help a privileged few. On the \ncontrary; the income limitations used in this legislation of $110,000 \nto $140,000 are the same the Senate used last year in establishing \nsavings accounts for colleges. It is believed that 75 percent of all \nthe money in these savings accounts will be saved by families with \nincomes of less than $70,000 a year. This is a middle-income program to \nhelp working families educate their children--public or private.\n  Then the argument is made, maybe it doesn't undermine the public \nschools, maybe it isn't just for a privileged few, but it doesn't help \neverybody. It doesn't help everybody. It doesn't help high-income \npeople who are not below the income limitations, and if truth be told, \nfamilies with no income, the very poor, will not be able to save money.\n  One warning I received upon entering a career in the U.S. Congress \nis, never make the perfect the enemy of the good. I know of no \nlegislation in any form, in any endeavor, by any Senator, which helps \neverybody all the time. Any Senator who comes to this floor looking for \nthat legislation will live a frustrated life in the U.S. Senate.\n  Suffice it to say, millions of American families, millions of modest \nbackground who simply have a child in a public school but would like \nthem to have a home computer, their child is in public school but they \nwould like them to be able to stay in after school and participate in \nactivities that cost money; they are in an urban school but they would \nlike, under mandatory programs, to get their child a school uniform, \nbuy extra books--this program does work for them. And for those 10 \npercent of American families that send their child to a private school, \na parochial school, the yeshiva, because they believe that is best for \ntheir circumstances, it helps to ease the burden of their tuition, it \nis straightforward, it is direct, and, mostly, it is right for the \ncountry.\n  I will concede that, while I enthusiastically support this proposal, \nthis Congress has not been everything it should have been for \neducation. The President challenged the Senate that, from school \ntesting to the reconstruction of our schools to class size, this \nCongress should have dedicated itself to improving the quality of \nAmerican education. And it did not. But it has produced this one idea. \nIt may not be the best idea, it is certainly not the only idea, it will \nnot transform American education, but that does not mean it is not a \ngood idea that can help.\n  I have often believed, in the current state of American education, \nthat everybody has something to offer and there are many good ideas. \nEverything is defendable in American education except one thing--the \nstatus quo. This challenges the status quo. For the first time in a \nlong time, we are opening the possibility that American families can \nall see themselves as involved again. If you could change one thing, in \nmy judgment, in education today, it would be the belief that families \nare relevant again to educating their own children. This is no longer \nsimply something in the hands of government, a school board, a union, \nWashington, or a State capital; we are responsible for the education of \nour own children.\n  Senator Coverdell has established that on every child's birthday, \nevery grandparent, every aunt and uncle, can be relevant again. They \ncan look at a child they care about and, rather than a meaningless toy, \nrather than some worthless gift, there is an account. Perhaps you would \nlike that child to have a computer, reading materials, participate in \nafterschool activity; they are struggling in math or science and they \nwould like to have a tutor. Put money in their account, at Christmas or \nat any time of the year. Let the extended family be involved on the \nfront lines of educating that child.\n  Beyond that family, when a labor union sits across the table from a \ngreat American industrial employer and they have settled on pension \nbenefits and they have settled on health benefits, let that labor union \nleader have one more question: How about a contribution to the savings \naccount to help educate the children of my membership?\n  No, it is not going to solve every problem, but we estimate that this \nproposal will bring $12 billion of private resources to the education \nof American children. That can't be wrong. It cannot be wrong--$12 \nbillion of new money is now available to help our children in their \nsecondary school education.\n  If, at the end of the day, its critics are right and all this money \nis not used for public education or private education but remains in \nthese accounts, then we believe, our critics taken at face value, the \nworst that could happen is, this money is rolled over into savings \naccounts for college--meaning that not only will we be provided this \noption for secondary school education, but the money will then become \navailable for college education--ironically, in accounts established \nunder the leadership of President Clinton and supported on a bipartisan \nbasis in this Senate.\n  I believe this will pass the Senate. But more significantly, Senator \nCoverdell has introduced this Senate into an important and dramatic new \ndebate. We Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservative, will \nbe in a competition in the redesign of American education. No better \nopportunity, no more timely debate, could be visited upon this Congress \nthan this new competition. It is important. It is worthwhile. If we \nsucceed, we will redesign American education.\n  Senator Coverdell has made a valuable addition in beginning this \ndebate. I congratulate him for it. I look forward tomorrow, when we \nboth will return to this floor, to introduce this final debate in \nenacting A+ savings accounts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, before the Senator from New Jersey \nleaves, there has been no more eloquent spokesperson for these reforms \nthan he.\n  You alluded, Senator, to the gift from the grandparent, but you \nintroduced the debate with the suggestion this could be a form of union \nnegotiations, which I think it would.\n\n[[Page S6870]]\n\n  I just want to point out two points: The $12 billion we cite is not a \ncalculation of the first dollar that would come from outside sources, \nwhich makes this savings account unique--that a union, a company, a \nneighborhood, a church, anything, could adopt a child with a savings \naccount. None of that money is in the calculation of the $12 billion, \nand there is no way to estimate, but I believe it will match ultimately \nthe parents' contribution of the $12 billion.\n  The second point I make is that those who have more difficulty saving \nbecause of their income strata will have these outside sources, which \nis one of the reasons for the sponsor contributions that will help open \nthose accounts for those families who have more difficulty.\n  As the Senator said, we will not get to all of them, no, but a lot \nthat otherwise would have no opportunity for one of these kinds of \naccounts to be opened.\n  The last thing I mention, you talk about parent involvement. What \nbetter reminder to the parent about the condition of the child than \nwhen they get that booklet and look at it once a month and get a notice \nfrom the savings and loan, or from the bank, that says how much is in \nthe account, how much is building up for Johnny or Susie, once a month \nor once a quarter? Fourteen million-plus families will be reminded that \nwe have some work to do here. I think the benefits of that cannot be \ncalculated, and that the bonding begins to occur every time one of \nthose accounts is open. I thank the Senator.\n\n  I yield up to 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I commend Senator Torricelli for his \ncomments on this bill and for his efforts, as well, throughout this \nentire process. I say to my friend, Senator Coverdell, again, that this \nwould not have happened if it hadn't been for his commitment to this \nidea, his persistence, and his willingness to, in essence, say it will \nnever end until we pass it. So I commend him for the effort he has made \nall throughout these months.\n  This bill will enable working families to keep more of what they \nearn, and it includes a number of other important education provisions.\n  My focus during this debate has been on providing every classroom in \nAmerica with a competent, caring, and qualified teacher. In my opinion, \nteachers make all the difference in the learning process.\n  America's classrooms are staffed with many dedicated, knowledgeable, \nand hard-working teachers. Nevertheless, in classrooms all over \nAmerica, teachers are being assigned to teach classes for which they \nhave no formal training.\n  Consider these statistics: Twenty percent of English classes were \ntaught by teachers who did not have at least a minor in English \nliterature, communications, speech, journalism, English education, or \nreading education. That is one out of five. Twenty-five percent of \nmathematics classes were taught by teachers without at least a minor in \nmathematics or mathematics education. That is one out of four. Thirty-\nnine percent of life sciences or biology classes were taught by \nteachers without at least a minor in biology or life science. Fifty-six \npercent of physical science classes were taught by teachers without at \nleast a minor in physics, chemistry, geology, or earth sciences. More \nthan 50 percent of history or world civilization classes were taught by \nteachers who did not have at least a minor in history. Students in \nschools with the highest minority enrollments have less than a 50-\npercent chance of getting a science or mathematics teacher who holds a \nlicense and a degree in the field that he or she teaches.\n  The amendment I introduced, along with Senator D'Amato, provides \nincentives for States to test their teachers on the subject matter they \nteach and to pay their teachers based on merit and proven performance. \nIn light of the statistics I mentioned before, it is clear that teacher \ntesting is necessary and important.\n  Our amendment passed the Senate by a vote of 63-35, and I am pleased \nthat it is included in this conference report. The Congress should be \nproud of this bill and the efforts we have made to promote responsible \neducation policy. I hope this bill will receive broad bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Georgia for his hard work and \ndedication on this bill.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida for \nhis contribution to the legislation that passed the Senate and the \nlegislation before us in the conference report. He has made the point \nrepeatedly that the No. 1 tool for effectiveness in a classroom is a \nteacher. His work, with regard to perfecting who that teacher is, is to \nbe noted. I thank the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. President, I now yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from \nColorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report \nto the Educational Savings and School Excellence Act. First of all, \nbefore I make my comments, I recognize the leadership of the Senator \nfrom Georgia, as my previous colleagues have done. I think he has done \na tremendous job in bringing forward the issue of education and what we \ncan do as parents, as Senators, what we can do as school board members, \nas State legislators, or whatever, to begin to think of innovative ways \nin which we can improve our educational system. There is no doubt in my \nmind that we need to have some innovative solutions.\n  The reason I am supporting this conference report is because this is \nan innovative approach that involves parents, as well as school board \npeople. It is going to broaden the effort in education. It is going to \nbenefit all schools, whether it is private schools or public schools.\n  I want to take a few moments to sort of review the history of the A+ \naccounts. Maybe my colleague has already done that, but I think it is \nvery important that we do that. In doing this, I am going to urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting these new opportunities that we are \ngoing to be creating for children and their families to receive the \nbest possible education.\n  Now, reviewing the history a little bit, last year, we authorized \neducational savings accounts for those individuals who were going to \npostsecondary education, going on to colleges and vocational schools \nafter graduating from high school. Beginning last June, we introduced \nthis opportunity to more American families by adopting an amendment to \nthe Taxpayer Relief Act, which established education savings accounts. \nNow, this amendment passed, but it was dropped from the Taxpayer Relief \nAct bill, due to a veto threat.\n  Senator Coverdell's A+ savings account was introduced as a separate \nbill, and it was passed this spring by a vote of 56-43. I was delighted \nwith the outcome of that vote. Following the recent conference \nagreement on the Educational Savings and School Excellence Act, I am \nconfident that we have before us a bill that makes sense for all \nfamilies and children--those who seek private or public education.\n  The conference report was passed by the House last week, and it is \nour turn to pass this bill and hand the President a new opportunity to \nimprove education.\n  I would like to go over a few provisions of the Educational Savings \nand School Excellence Act, putting forth the A+ accounts. Our \nlegislation increases the dollar amount from $500 to $2,000, the amount \nthat parents can set aside to save for their children's education for \nboth public and private elementary and secondary school expenses.\n\n  With the education savings account, the money is never Government \nmoney, so issues of Government intervention and the constitutionality \nof using Government funds for religious schools is not a real argument \nin this debate.\n  This bill would empower parents with the financial tools to provide \nfor all of the needs they recognize in their children--needs that \nteachers or administrators should not be trusted to address in the same \nway that a parent can.\n  This bill would allow families, single parents, or anyone earning \nless than $95,000 annually to deposit up to $2,000 per child in after-\ntax income into those interest-bearing savings accounts each year.\n  The option for using these funds are simply endless. Raising a child \nis expensive--we all know that as parents--\n\n[[Page S6871]]\n\nwhether the child is attending a private school or a public school. My \nchildren happen to have attended public schools and I will be the first \nto admit that education is expensive. This bill will help parents save \nfor computers, tutoring expenses--if you have a child with special \nneeds--uniforms, transportation--if you are in rural areas and you have \nspecial transportation needs out there--SAT prep courses, so they can \nget ready for higher education, postsecondary education, or even \ntuition for private schools.\n  Now I would like to go over a few reasons why I am supporting this \nlegislation. I think this bill is simply good news for all students--\nespecially those in public schools.\n  This legislation does not ignore any school whatsoever. Numerous \nprovisions have been included to improve public education, as well as \nprivate education. It assists smaller schools by increasing the amount \nof school construction bonds that smaller school districts can use. It \nprovides incentives for public schools to strive for higher academic \nachievement. It encourages teachers to improve literacy programs by \ntraining them to use proven methods, such as phonics. It will help \nstudents stay in school by authorizing a national dropout prevention \nprogram. To make schools more safe, we have included a provision that \nallows weapons brought to school to be used as evidence in any internal \nschool disciplinary proceedings.\n\n  In addition, the bill includes the provision to make savings in \nqualified State tuition plans completely tax free. These tuition plans \nare powerful incentives for parents to save for their children's \ncollege education.\n  My State of Colorado is one of 21 States that has already implemented \nthis kind of program. I can tell you from what I have observed in my \nState of Colorado, it is catching on, and it is popular.\n  This bill would free up plan holders from having to pay Federal tax \non interest buildup. This means more savings for tuition, room, board, \nand books or supplies. Tax relief for these plans offers yet one more \nreason to support this conference report.\n  This bill is about freedom. It is about education. Let's take a step \nforward in improving our Nation's education system for all American \nchildren. I encourage my colleagues to join me in passing the Education \nSavings and School Excellence Act today and to support the conference \nreport.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield to the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The Senator was describing the chronology of the \naccount. He hit on a very important point that I want to reinforce. The \nSenator from New Jersey did it well. That is, last year, with the \nPresident's cooperation, Congress initiated and he signed an education \nsavings account that was only $500, and only for higher education. This \nproposal, according to the description of the Senator from Colorado--\nwhich is correct, I might add--says that we will make the $500 go up to \n$2,000. You can save four times as much. You can use it for higher \neducation or for any grade, kindergarten through high school.\n  This has taken what we celebrated with bands and celebrations on the \nWhite House Lawn last year and made it broader. It is not just $500 for \nhigher education now, it is $2,000. It is not just for higher \neducation, it can be used for kindergarten all the way through high \nschool, or higher education. We use the identical criteria that we used \nto determine which middle-class families could use it. It is the same.\n  Am I properly describing the point that the Senator made?\n  Mr. ALLARD. The Senator has properly described it.\n  Again, the thing that excites me so much about this particular piece \nof legislation is, it is for all students. Traditionally, this has \nalways been thought of in terms of postsecondary--actually, through \ngraduation from high school. But now in this particular piece of \nlegislation, we are thinking in terms of kindergarten, first grade, \nsecond grade, which gives a lot of flexibility to parents to decide \nwhat is the best educational plan for their students, by bringing this \nplan and incorporating the money that can be used for many, many \ndifferent purposes. It might be that there is a special-education \nstudent out there who needs some special help because of some \ndeficiencies, needs some special help because of deficiencies in \nhearing or maybe sight; maybe a rural family has some problem with \ntransportation.\n  This flexibility is going to help education, whether it is private or \npublic schools. I think it is going to improve the general educational \neffort. The real benefactor in all of this is going to be public \neducation, because it is going to be supportive of what we are already \ndoing in education. It doesn't take away from public education, it adds \nto it.\n\n  I want to compliment the Senator from Georgia on working so very hard \non this issue and his leadership. I think it is something that we can \nall be proud of.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, just to expand on what the Senator from \nColorado said, we talked earlier about the 14 million families that \nwould save up to $12 billion. And those dollars can be used for any \neducational purpose. As the Senator from Colorado alluded, it can be a \ncomputer, it can be a special learning problem that requires special \nattention, or it can be an afterschool program. I call this money \n``smart money.'' What I mean is that this money will ultimately go \nright to the target of the child's needs. A lot of money in public \neducation can't do that, understandably, with buildings, turning on \nlights, and paying salaries. But this money will be guided almost like \na missile system right to the problem the child has. And it is being \nguided by those who know best what that problem is--their parents. So \nthe exponential value of this money is much greater than most education \ndollars can achieve.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take just a few minutes to sort of \nunderscore why education has become the No. 1 issue in our country and \ntake us back 15 years ago to Secretary Bell, who was President Reagan's \nfirst Education Secretary. He had this Department of Education publish \na book that became known as ``A Nation At Risk.'' That is the name of \nthe publication. It described a general condition and warned the Nation \nthat we are developing a vast problem in our academic system. But it \nfocused primarily on kindergarten through high school.\n  It is interesting to look at where we have come since he notified \nAmerica and the education community that we have a problem.\n  In that report, ``A Nation At Risk,'' it said international \ncomparisons of student achievement reveal that on 19 academic tests, \nAmerican students were never first and never second; and, in comparison \nwith other industrialized nations, we were last seven times.\n  In 1998, 15 years later, a recently released study shows that \nAmerican 12th graders ranked 19th out of 21 industrialized nations in \nmathematics and 16th out of 21 in science. In other words, we were \nnever first 15 years ago, we were never second, and we were last seven \ntimes. After 15 years of effort, we are 19th out of 21; we are not even \nclose to first or second. And we are 16th out of 21. In other words, we \nhave gone backwards.\n  Fifteen years ago, 23 million American adults were functionally \nilliterate, according to the report. And in 1992, 20 percent of the \nadult population had only rudimentary reading and writing skills. That \nis going in the wrong direction. Fifteen years ago, 13 percent of all \n17-year-olds in the United States were considered functionally \nilliterate, and functional illiteracy among minority youth may run as \nhigh as 40 percent. The literacy level of young adults aged 15 to 21 \ndropped 11 points from 1984 to 1992, and 25 percent of all 12th graders \nscored below basics in reading on the 1994 National Assessment of \nEducational Progress.\n  Fifteen years ago, ``A Nation At Risk'' reported that between 1975 \nand 1980 remedial mathematics courses in public 4-year colleges \nincreased 72 percent and then constituted one-quarter--25 percent--of \nall mathematics\n\n[[Page S6872]]\n\ncourses taught in these institutions. They were saying, in 4-year \ncolleges, one quarter of all mathematics courses dealt with remedial \neducation. In 1995, 30 percent of first-time college freshmen enrolled \nin at least one remedial course and 80 percent of all public 4-year \nuniversities offered remedial courses.\n\n  In other words, Mr. President, in every one of these categories, one \nafter the other, the warning given to us in 1983, 15 years ago, has not \ncaused us--I know it has caused us to spend millions and billions of \nour dollars, but the point is, as the Senator from New Jersey said a \nmoment ago, the status quo is unacceptable, and the status quo produced \nresults, after having received the warning 15 years ago, that are worse \nthan they were 15 years ago. It is very alarming, the recent study that \nsaid only 4 out of 10 students in inner-city schools can now pass a \nbasic math exam, and if you take all the schools and put them together, \nwe get it up to only 6 out of 10.\n  We cannot accept this. Innovation is being begged for.\n  If we allow this to continue, for the first time in America--America \nhas never had a caste system. There has always been massive mobility in \neconomic achievement--people on the bottom rung moving up, people on \nthe top moving down. It has been the story of America. But if we keep \nputting people on the street who cannot read and write, and if we spend \nanother 15 years like we have the last 15, we will produce a permanent \neconomic caste system in the country and we will forever change the \nnature of this great Republic. We will forever change it if we ever \naccept a condition by which thousands upon thousands, millions of \nstudents come out of high school and cannot effectively read or write.\n  How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Georgia has 1 \nhour remaining on his side.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. That cannot be correct. We had 2 hours equally \ndivided, and I think we began at about 5:20. So I would estimate we \nhave about 5 minutes remaining on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Today he has 5 minutes \nremaining. Tomorrow he has 1 hour.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I see. OK. I understand the point. Tomorrow we have \nanother 2 hours equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I see we have been joined by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, who will be arguing the other side, and for his \nbenefit I will go on another several minutes here.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts will endeavor to infer \nthat this undermines public education, and the Secretary of the \nadministration has inferred as much. It is just absolutely incorrect. \nMr. President, 70 percent of the 14 million families, 11 million \nfamilies who open these accounts will have students in public schools, \nas the Senator from New Jersey noted. Because they are in public \nschools at the end of the day and this money is divided, the families \nwho have children in public schools will represent about half the $12 \nbillion that is saved over the next decade, and the families who have \nchildren in private schools will save the other half.\n  That is understandable, because the families who have made a decision \nto send their child to a private school know they have to save more. \nBut the bottom line is, 70 percent of the families will have kids in \npublic schools, 30 percent in private. Fifty percent of the money will \nsupport children in public schools, and 50 percent will support \nchildren in private schools or home schools.\n  The other side will try to infer that this is a voucher. Vouchers are \nthe redistribution of public money. The money going into these savings \naccounts is aftertax dollars, and the only tax benefit available is \nthat the interest earned would be forgiven of tax so long as the \ndollars were used for an educational purpose. This is not a voucher.\n  Several people on the other side have suggested that this is \ninsignificant, that it is not a great amount of money, and they are \nright. The tax incentive is minimal over the 10-year period, but what \nis stunning about it is how much it causes these American families to \nsave on their own--new money. No board of education has had to raise \nthe millage rate. There is no new State income tax. There is no new \nFederal income tax. This is the flow of the volunteer money to help \nstudents in public, private, and home schools.\n  The other side likes to infer from time to time that this only \nbenefits the wealthy. Seventy percent of the money would go to families \nearning $75,000 or less, and we get into all kinds of arguments over \nwhich families are what. But I would only make this point, that the \ndetermination of who can open these accounts and who benefits from them \nis middle class driven, and in this legislation we are discussing in \nthe Chamber right now, the criteria are identical to the criteria that \nwere designed by the other side last year, for what really was a \nminimal savings account of up to $500 to help families for higher \neducation only. And we have said, well, let's expand that; let's let \nthem at least save $2,000, and let's let them use it for any school \nyear--kindergarten all the way through college; let's give them more \nopportunity and more flexibility.\n  But the families involved are identical to the families who \ncelebrated last year on the White House lawn when the President signed \nlegislation that created a $500 savings account just for college. And \nhere we are today, saying, let's make it $2,000 for college or any \nother grade.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from the great State of Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Senator from \nGeorgia in bringing the legislation to where it is at the present time \nout of the conference. I admire his persistence, but I believe he is \nfundamentally wrong in his approach to education.\n  I want to just mention very briefly, when I arrived over here, the \ngood Senator was talking about the Nation At Risk report. I was in the \nSenate when the Nation At Risk study was done. We had very extensive \nhearings on it. The Nation At Risk was primarily a report done by a \nsuperb group of education leaders. While I was listening to my friend \nfrom Georgia, I was harkening back to the various recommendations of \nthose who had done that extensive study to which the Senator referred.\n  The fact of the matter is, the Nation at Risk report authored by a \nbipartisan commission, made recommendations that mirror the \nrecommendations that were made by the President of the United States \nthis year. With all respect to the Senator from Georgia, there is no \nreference in there about the tax breaks and voucher programs that he \nhas described. What was recommended in the report is the hard work that \nhas been recommended by, not only the Nation At Risk panel, but most of \nthe educators since that time.\n  What we need is more and better teachers. This is very important, \nparticularly given the fact we are going to need some 2 million more \nteachers over the period of the next 10 years. The Nation At Risk \ncommission thought that upgrading the skills of teachers is one of the \nmost important things we can do. They also said that raising standards \nfor children so they will be challenged to meet their highest \neducational ability, instead of dumbing down the curriculum to the \nlowest expectations.\n  The Nation At Risk report recommended that we devote more time for \nlearning. That means afterschool programs and extended day programs. \nAnd we know that spending more time on learning works. In my own State \nof Massachusetts, the Timility Middle School in Roxbury, MA, was long \nknown for its low test scores and high suspension rates for students. \nUnder Project Promise, the school extended learning time by 90 minutes \n4 days a week and opened for 3 hours on Saturday. The result is more \nstudents receive the help they need, parents are more involved, student \nattendance is up, student absence is down, reading and math scores have \nimproved--by investing in public schools, not abandoning them.\n  In addition, there is general recognition that you cannot teach \nchildren in antiquated schools or schools that are falling apart--yet \nso many of the nation's schools are. In fact, the GAO\n\n[[Page S6873]]\n\nfound that over $100 billion is needed for help and assistance to \nrebuild and modernize our schools in our cities, suburbs, and rural \ncommunities.\n  But the Coverdell bill will spend $1.6 billion over 10 years. Is that \ngoing to solve all of the problems that have been outlined by my friend \nfrom Georgia? That is quite a stretch, particularly because it doesn't \nhelp the public schools.\n  The Coverdell bill is not trying to give support for these kinds of \ninitiatives that are facing communities across this country, with many \nof these children who are sons and daughters of working families who do \nnot have the ability and resources to be able to put aside the money \nthat would be necessary in this program.\n  In Waltham, MA, 215 math teachers are learning innovative techniques \nin teacher training programs. They are working with bankers, engineers, \nhigh-tech experts, and college math professors to learn more about \nmath, how to teach it well, and how to link it to the real-world \nexperience of the students.\n  The early indications are that when these teachers go back to their \nschools, they are seeing improved academic achievement from the \nstudents. But under the Coverdell bill, we won't get any kind of help \nand assistance for these kinds of innovative programs that are taking \nplace. This legislation does nothing to support innovative programs \nlike these. It does nothing to strengthen public schools. Instead, it \nuses a regressive tax policy to subsidize vouchers for private schools \nand gives no significant financial help to working families and no help \nto children in the Nation's classrooms. What it does is provide an \nunjustified tax giveaway to the wealthy and to private schools.\n  Public education is one of the great success stories of American \ndemocracy. It makes no sense for Congress to undermine it. Yet this \nbill turns its back on the Nation's longstanding support for public \nschools and earmarks tax dollars for private schools. It is an \nunwarranted step in the wrong direction for education, for public \nschools, and for the Nation's children. It would spend the $1.6 billion \nover the next 10 years on subsidies to help the wealthy pay the private \nschool expenses they already pay and do nothing to help the children in \nthe public schools get a better education.\n\n  It is important to continue the national investment in children and \ntheir future. We should invest more in improving public schools by \nrepairing crumbling facilities, by recruiting more and training better \nteachers, by reducing class size, by developing responsible afterschool \nactivities, and by taking many other steps.\n  If we add $1.6 billion to spend on elementary and secondary \neducation, we should spend it wisely on these problems, not waste it on \nbad education policy and bad tax policy. We should rebuild our public \nschools, not build new tax shelters for the wealthy.\n  According to the Joint Tax Committee, over half of the benefits--$800 \nmillion--will go to 7 percent of the families with children in private \nschools. Did you note when my friend from Georgia was here he said: 70 \npercent of the families that can use this tax break will be making \nunder $70,000. But let's find out where the money is going, Senator. We \nare not just talking about who may be able to use the program. Let's \nlook at what the Joint Tax Committee says. Let's read the next line. \nLet's ask where the money is going, not who ``may benefit.'' I heard \nthat out here four or five times in the last hour, look who is going to \nbenefit, all of these families below $70,000--``may benefit.'' May \nbenefit. The fact is, the Joint Tax Committee has indicated that $800 \nmillion, half of all the money, will go to the 7 percent of families \nwhose children are already in private schools.\n  If you are going to fight for a particular program, at least have the \nintellectual honesty to state what it is going to do and try to defend \nit. I can understand why those who support this program run from all \nthe details, try to really say it's doing something that it does not \ndo. With all respect, when I listen to those who have been supporting \nthe program, I have to wonder how this program is going to solve the \neducation problems for the young people? Proponents use the National at \nRisk as a starting point, but they, again, don't tell you the next \nline. The Nation at Risk gave recommendations on how to improve \neducation, but they are not the ones included in the Coverdell bill. \nHere it is. The Joint Tax Committee: 93 percent of the children in the \ncountry go to the public schools; 7 percent go to private schools; and \n48 percent of the monetary benefit that will come from here will go to \nthe public schools; but 52 percent--more than half--will go to the 7 \npercent of the children who go to the private schools.\n  You can say 70 percent of the families that are eligible for this tax \nbreak go to the public schools. But that's not where the money goes. \nAnd we all know that where the money goes is what counts around here. \nThe money goes to families who already send their children to private \nschool. We believe that we should not abandon the public schools. We \nought to commit ourselves to helping and assisting the public schools \nand the children who attend them.\n  The bottom line is clear. The scarce tax dollars should be targeted \nto public schools. They don't have the luxury of closing their doors to \nstudents who pose special challenges, such as children with \ndisabilities, limited English-proficient children, or homeless \nstudents. This bill will not help children who need help the most.\n  Parental choice is a mirage. Private schools apply different rules \nfrom public schools. Public schools must accept all children. Private \nschools can decide whether to accept a child or not. The real choice \nbelongs to schools, not to the parents. It belongs to schools, not to \nthe parents. Public schools must accept all children and develop \nprograms to meet their needs. Private schools only accept children who \nfit the guidelines of their existing policy. So, if we are talking \nabout public funds that are contributed from working families, we ought \nto be using those funds where the children of those working families go \nto school.\n  And that means supporting the public schools. But the majority of the \nmoney goes to the seven percent of families sending their children to \nprivate schools.\n  We have a series of recommendations that have been made by the top \neducation community in this country. They are common-sense \nrecommendations: Smaller classrooms, modernizing schools, upgrading \nteacher training, and expanding afterschool programs. These have all \nbeen outlined here, and they were all rejected on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate. Then we are asked to accept this bill to support private \nschools or nothing. We are asked to accept this or nothing.\n  We even had a modest rehabilitation program by our friend and \ncolleague, the Senator from Florida, Senator Graham, that was dropped \nin the conference, to try to increase assistance for school \nconstruction.\n  Another program that the President talked about is the Educational \nOpportunity Zones to provide support to those school districts that are \nwilling to invest in major restructuring, reorganization, and \ninnovation in order to improve student academic achievement. The \nprogram provides some incentives for those exciting programs.\n  You can say, what is an example where that program would work? \nChicago is the example for that. Chicago is really doing a very \nimportant and effective job to try to give some help and assistance to \nits schools and to its parents and teachers who are trying to do the \njob of educating children, to do it right. We recognize that there are \nmany communities that are trying to improve their schools, and we \nshould support them.\n  I am proud of what the city of Boston is doing, Mr. President. We saw \njust yesterday the Boston Globe was reporting on the most recent math \nand reading tests in that city and how, for the first time in many \nyears, there was increased performance of students across the board in \nreading and math, and in some of the most difficult schools with high \nsuspension rates, dropouts rates--the most troubled schools--how they \nhave been able to see a significant improvement in academic achievement \nand accomplishment.\n  That is happening in the public schools among some very needy \nchildren in a major city. Why? Because we have had a superintendent and \na mayor who are committed to providing resources and discipline to \nenhance the education of the public schools--not abandon them.\n\n[[Page S6874]]\n\n  We have nothing against the private schools. There are many wonderful \nprivate schools. But we are talking about, in a budget with scarce \nresources, funds paid in by working families through their taxes. And, \nin the consideration of the budget, after the President's programs--\nsmaller class size, upgrading the skills for teachers, modernizing our \nschools, expanding afterschool programs--have been defeated, we are \nforced to consider this program that does what? Benefits the private \nschools--benefits the private schools.\n  So, Mr. President, this proposal does not deserve to go into law. The \nPresident is right to veto this proposal. He is right to send it back \nto the Congress and say, ``Start over again. Start over again.'' We \nhave time to do that. We have been fussing around here for 4 weeks \ndebating the tobacco bill and then find that the point of order was \nmade on it. It could have been made 4 weeks earlier in order to dismiss \nthat as a result of big tobacco.\n  We are not debating the education priorities of the American people. \nWe are not debating the health care priorities of the American people, \nsuch as the Patients' Bill of Rights. People in this country want to \nsee the reform of our health care system to eliminate the abuses of \nHMOs. Managed care too often means mismanaged care. The American people \nwant these decisions made, that are affecting their health, by doctors \nand not insurance company accountants. We ought to be debating that. \nBut we cannot debate that. It is nowhere on the Republican leader's \nschedule.\n  And we ought to start over here, after the President's veto, and \ndebate, what we can do as a legislative body, with scarce resources, \nthat will make the best, most effective impact on improving the quality \nof education and achievement and accomplishment for the 90 percent of \nchildren in the public schools? Public money for public schools--that \nis the central challenge. And this particular measure fails on all \naccounts.\n\n  So I hope, Mr. President, that we can get about the business in the \nremaining days of this Congress and support what we know is being done \nin rural, urban, and suburban communities, with scarce resources, by \ncreative, dedicated people who are absolutely committed to their \nchildren in those communities, who are working tirelessly, \nexhaustively, to raise academic achievement and improve public schools.\n  Do we have a ways to go? Yes. Will $1.6 billion solve the whole \nproblem? No, and we should invest more--much more--in improving our \npublic schools. But the question for us today is, Is this the best way \nto spend $1.6 billion of the American taxpayers' dollars to improve \npublic schools? The answer is no. And for that reason, I believe that \nthis measure should not win the support of the Members of this body.\n  Mr. President, I know we are under a time fix. Whatever time remains \non our side I yield to the good Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 16 minutes 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, in the spirit of debate, let me just say to my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle that I just do not think this \npasses the credibility test as an education program for our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator from Minnesota will yield for a \nminute, the Chair misspoke. The Senator from Minnesota has \napproximately 40 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we are talking about a $1.7 billion initiative, and \nthat is over a period of 5 years. The idea is that you can take $2,000 \nand you can put it in a special account, education account.\n  Now, for those who are following this debate, I would ask this \nquestion: How many families are in a position to take $2,000 out and \nput it in a savings account for education? This just kind of misses the \nessence of the reality of the vast majority of families in this \ncountry. And that is why the Joint Tax Committee said that this $1.7 \nbillion, over 5 years, which is touted as a major education program for \nour children, will amount to about $96 for wealthy parents for private \nschools, and this bill will give the rest of the parents about $7.\n  So there is the question as to whether or not we want to take public \ntaxpayer money and put it into private schools, but there is also the \nquestion, as my colleague from Massachusetts was focusing on, as to who \nexactly it is going to benefit.\n  Mr. President, above and beyond the problem that the vast majority of \nfamilies get no benefit from this, there is another problem. This is, \nagain, a kind of tax policy; it is not an education program. I will get \nto that in a moment. And the tax benefits go, by and large, to the \nwealthiest citizens. I guess this is my Republican colleagues' \ndefinition of justice or fairness. But I do not think most of the \npeople in the country agree with that.\n  Where this proposal, however, I think is really most flawed has to do \nwith what it does in education. I have tried to, to the best of my \nability as a Senator from Minnesota, about every 2 weeks, to be in a \nschool teaching somewhere. And I see nothing at all in what my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle call an education proposal \nthat deals with the real needs.\n  Will there be any funding to rebuild crumbling schools? No. And, by \nthe way, let me say this again on the floor of the Senate: I have seen \ntoo many schools in the South, in the East, in the North, and in the \nWest, where the ceilings are crumbling, they are asbestos laden, with \ndecrepit toilets, without adequate heating systems; and we are not \nputting any money to help rebuild these crumbling schools.\n  I would say the pages who are here, the students--what kind of \nmessage do we communicate to students who go to those schools about \nwhether we value them or not? There is not one penny in this \nlegislation that does anything about these crumbling schools. That \nwould really be a commitment to public education.\n  Is there any funding in this amendment--which is, by the way, \npitifully inadequate in the first place--that will do anything to \nreduce class size? Well, no.\n\n  If you were to believe that students know a little bit about their \nown education--I haven't been to one school anywhere in Minnesota or in \nthe country where when I asked students, What do you think would be \nsome of the best things we could do to make education better for you, \nthat students haven't talked about smaller class sizes. Is there \nanything in this pitifully inadequate proposal in the first place that \ndeals with reducing class size? No.\n  By the way, colleagues, I have been to too many high schools where \nstudents tell me that they are in classes with 45 students. I was in a \nLos Angeles meeting with some wonderful high school students. They \nsaid, ``Part of the problem is we are not even missed. Nobody even \nknows we are there.'' The school is so overcrowded, the class size is \nso large, how can any teacher do a good job with 45 students in a \nclass?\n  Is there anything here that reduces class size? No. Is there anything \nhere that will help make schools safer? No. Is there anything in this \nlegislation that will help train teachers to use new technologies? No. \nIs there anything in this piece of legislation that will invest in some \nfunding for summer institutes where teachers can meet, compare notes, \nfire one another up, talk about new ways of teaching and learning? No. \nIs there anything in this education proposal, or what my colleagues \ncall an education proposal that deals with the learning gap that tries \nto come to terms with students, by the time they come to kindergarten \nthey are ready to learn; she knows how to spell her name; she knows the \nalphabet; he knows colors, shapes and sizes; he has been read to \nwidely, and they have that readiness to learn? No. Is there anything in \nwhat is called this education legislation that makes a commitment to \nearly childhood development? No. Is there anything in this legislation \nthat helps working families--after all, as my colleague from \nMassachusetts said, it is their taxpayer money--is there anything in \nthis legislation that speaks to the ordeal that so many young families \ngo through?\n  I thought we had made some progress. But we really haven't. When \nSheila and I were first married, age 19 --I don't advise that, by the \nway, for everyone; we had our first child when we were barely 20, about \na year and a half later, David. We had hardly any money. I do advise \nit--we have been married 35 years; it can work well. My\n\n[[Page S6875]]\n\npoint is--as I get myself in more trouble as I speak--we had our child \nDavid, and we hardly had any income. After, I think, six weeks, Sheila \nhad to go back to work.\n  Now we have family medical leave, but it is unpaid leave. If you \ndon't have much money, you have to work. It was a wrenching experience, \na wrenching experience to not be able to spend more time with your \ninfant. She had to work, and I was a student and I was working. So then \nwhat happens? As it turns out, we look for what we can afford. There \nwas a woman, a child-care giver, and she takes care of children, and we \ntake him to her. We thought she would be good. But then after a couple \nof days of picking him up and he was just sort of limp, he had no \nexpression in his face, and he had been so lively before, so we don't \nknow what has happened. So I drop by this home in the middle of the \nday, and I see all these infants in playpens with pacifiers. They are \nnot being picked up. They are not being touched. I felt so guilty I \ncalled my mom and dad and said I am going to quit school; I am going to \nwork. I can't have him put in this situation. And we got some help from \nmy parents. They were able to help us. I don't know how they did it on \ntheir income.\n\n  Do you think that young parents who have the same experience today \nlike the fact that they know they have no other choice but to drop \ntheir infant off in a child-care center? They know that maybe the \npeople there aren't real well trained. People make precious little \nmoney that are involved in this area, but what choice do they have? \nThey can't afford $12,000 a year if they have two small children.\n  Is there anything in this piece of legislation or anything my \nRepublican colleagues are doing in this session, in the Senate, that \nspeaks to this question of how parents can do better by their children; \nhow we can make sure that children come to kindergarten, ready to \nlearn? That is a big education initiative. The answer is no. What do we \nhave instead? $1.7 billion over 5 years, amounting to about $7 per \nfamily, and that is called a major education initiative?\n  Is there anything in this piece of legislation that speaks to \nafterschool care? Let's have some sympathy with parents--single parents \nor both parents. Do you think parents like the fact that their 11-year-\nold--it is astounding, and I forget the percentage, how many 11 and 12-\nyear-olds are home alone; it is a very high percentage. Do you think \nthe parents like the fact they both have to work--they have no other \nchoice--in order to have income. Some of them are working two jobs. \nThey don't even have enough time to be with their children at home they \nare working so hard.\n  Do you think a person likes the fact that his or her daughter age 11 \nor age 7, goes home alone and watches trash TV talk shows and eats junk \nfood and there is nobody to take care of them? Do you think a parent \nlikes the fact when we hear so many things that are not so good that \nhappen between 3 o'clock in the afternoon and 6 p.m.--do you think the \nparents like that? Wouldn't they like to have some really good school \nprograms, some community programs, where their kids could be doing \npositive things and wouldn't be home alone, and the only reason they \nare home alone is because both parents have to work? No, they don't \nlike it. So why don't we help these parents with a real education \ninitiative. There is not a thing in this piece of legislation that \ndeals with that at all.\n  Mr. President, I have to say that this proposal, which is supposed to \nbe the major education initiative of the Republican Party, provides \nhelp in inverse relationship to need, does zero for public education, \ndoes practically zero for working families, doesn't represent a step \nforward, but represents a great leap backward. The President is right \nto veto this piece of legislation. We must start all over again.\n  I will just say to my colleagues that I think you are playing with \nfire. You are playing with fire with a piece of legislation that you \ntout as a major education reform bill that does next to nothing to make \nsure that we expand educational opportunity for all of our children in \nour country.\n  I thought that children were 100 percent of our future. So I want to \nknow, colleagues, where is our commitment to making sure that there is \nreally good care for children before they even get to kindergarten? \nWhere is our commitment to making sure if we are to follow the advice \nof all these studies that are coming out, all of this medical evidence \nabout the development of the brain, to make sure that children have \nreally good developmental child care? The answer is there is no \ncommitment here. My colleagues in the majority of the Republican Party \nhave no initiative at all.\n\n  Where is the commitment to rebuild the crumbling schools and to have \nthe teacher training and to have smaller class size and to make sure \nthat the Internet and all this new technology means that all the \nschools are wired and teachers know how to work with it and children \nand young people become literate in this area? The answer is there is \nno commitment whatsoever.\n  Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak against this piece \nof legislation. I hope my colleagues will vote against it. I hope the \nPresident will veto it. Then we must come back to education again.\n  Colleagues, it is not enough to be giving speeches about this. I \napply that to myself, as well. It is not enough to have photo \nopportunities with small children. We all love to have our pictures \ntaken with children. It is not enough to be in the schools once in a \nwhile. And it is not enough to say that young people are our future. If \nwe don't make the commitment, backed by solid legislation, with \nresources to get to communities so we can do well for all the children \nin our country, then from my point of view, we will not have been \nhonest. We will not have done all that we should do. By the way, when I \nsay ``honest,'' I don't mean as in personally honest. Senator \nCoverdell, the author of this bill, is a friend and I respect him. But \nI think in terms of the effect of this, it doesn't honestly reach \nchildren in our country; it doesn't honestly contribute to public \neducation; it doesn't honestly contribute to the education of the vast \nmajority of young people in the United States of America. Therefore, \ncolleagues ought to vote against it.\n\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has approximately 30 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, before reserving the balance of our \ntime, I want to just comment on one other matter, which I have tried to \nspeak on every week.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/23/senate-section/article/S6867-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6875-S6876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF JAMES HORMEL\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, it has been--I am trying to remember \nnow--almost a year since James Hormel was voted out of Foreign \nRelations Committee by a 16-2 vote. I have said this a number of times \non the floor of the Senate, and I want to keep saying it.\n  James Hormel, I think, is eminently qualified to be Ambassador to \nLuxembourg. He has a very, very, very distinguished record as an \neducator, as a businessman, as a philanthropist, and as somebody who \nhas given to many, many communities in our country. I see no reason \nwhatsoever why we do not have an up-or-down vote on this on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, I have said it to colleagues directly. I don't say it \nindirectly. I want to make terribly sure that the reason Mr. James \nHormel's nomination has not been brought to the floor is not because of \ndiscrimination against him because of his sexual orientation. I hope \nthat is not the case, but I do believe that we need to have an honest \ndiscussion about this nomination. We need to have a full-scale debate, \nand we need to have an up-or-down vote.\n  I think we should judge people by the content of their character. I \nthink we should judge people by their vision and by their leadership \nability. It is my fervent hope that the majority leader will bring this \nnomination to the floor. I have said that I am looking for a vehicle--\nwe have things kind of snarled up here right now--on which to bring an \namendment out that in one way or another will put an even sharper focus \non this question.\n\n[[Page S6876]]\n\n  I do intend to speak out and I intend to use whatever leverage I have \nas a Senator to continue to push on this question. If Senators have \nreasons for objecting to Mr. Hormel's nomination, let them come out \nhere and speak. Let us have an honest debate. If, God forbid, there are \nobjections to him based upon his sexual orientation, then I think the \nU.S. Senate needs to look at itself in the mirror, because I think we \ncan do better than that.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the balance of our time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to mark a special date in \nthe lives of two of my friends, Clement and Jessie Stone, who \ncelebrated their 75th wedding anniversary this past weekend.\n  Mr. Stone is well known to people throughout the world as a \nsuccessful executive, a generous philanthropist, and for his writings \non topics related to business, management, and positive thinking. \nMillions of people have read his inspirational books, and his \ninsightful advice on the above topics has changed countless lives for \nthe better. Few people are as well known, well read, or well regarded, \nas Clement Stone and he can truly be proud of all that he has \naccomplished in his rich and long life.\n  Despite his considerable wealth, his many awards and recognitions, \nand his international fame, I am certain that the one thing Clement \nStone values and treasures more than anything else in life is his \nmarriage to his high school sweetheart, a union that has lasted three-\nquarters of one century. It is almost unheard of for two people to be \nmarried for 75-years, but Jessie and Clement have not only done so, but \nI am told that their affection and regard for one another has not waned \none bit since they exchanged vows on June 16, 1923. Without question, \nthey are an inspiration to one and all.\n  As Clement and Jessie mark this auspicious milestone in their lives \nand their marriage, they will be doing so with friends and family, \nincluding a large number of grandchildren and great grandchildren. I \njoin all of them in wishing the Stones a happy anniversary and many \nmore years of health and happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/23/senate-section/article/S6876-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, since S. 10 was voted out of the Judiciary \nCommittee almost one year ago, I have spoken on the floor of the Senate \nand at hearings on numerous occasions to urge its Republican sponsors \nto work with me in a bipartisan and open manner to improve this \njuvenile crime bill. Instead of dialogue, the sponsors of this \nlegislation have played games of ``Hide and Seek'' with the revisions \nthey were making to the bill.\n  I am delighted to see reflected in the brief ``DRAFT'' summary \ncirculated by the sponsors of the bill that they are finally and \nbelatedly making certain changes that they voted down during the \nCommittee's consideration of this bill. The ``devil is in the \ndetails'', however, so I and my Democratic colleagues are eager to see \nthe full text of this revised bill.\n  Unfortunately, the sponsors of this bill were not willing to work \nwith me last year when we would have had a much better chance of moving \nthis important legislation. Now, as we head toward the end of this \nCongress and still face a number of vital appropriations matters to \nconsider, time is running out to complete action on a juvenile crime \nbill. Those who will suffer from the dilatory manner in which this bill \nwas handled are the children of this country and America's law \nenforcement officers and prosecutors who are eager for the additional \nresources available in this bill.\n  I am delighted to see that the legislation is being revised to \ninclude changes proposed by Democrats that the Republican sponsors \npreviously rejected, including:\n  Retention of State Presumption to Prosecute Juveniles: The revised S. \n10 will apparently preserve the ``presumption in favor of state \nprosecution'' for juveniles who face concurrent state and federal \njurisdiction over the offense committed. This language is clearly based \non amendments I and others proposed to avoid the federalization of \njuvenile crime that has prompted expressions of concern by Chief \nJustice Rehnquist and the Judicial Conference States have had primary \nresponsibility for handling juvenile cases, and they should continue to \ndo so.\n  Death Penalty: The new S. 10 apparently would not subject juveniles \nto the federal death penalty, another policy which Democratic members \nof the Committee insisted upon during Committee debate. As introduced, \nS. 10 allowed the imposition of the death penalty for juveniles as \nyoung as sixteen.\n  Increased Flexibility for the Incentive Block Grant program: The \nstrict earmarks in this block grant for building more juvenile \nfacilities, drug testing juveniles and enhancing State recordkeeping \nsystems would have imposed a one-size-fits-all strait jacket on the \nStates. The sponsors of the bill, apparently, have finally recognized \nhow critical it is to provide flexibility to the States because State \nand local officials are much better able to determine how to reduce \njuvenile delinquency rates in their own communities.\n  Revised Recordkeeping Provisions: For over a year, I have repeatedly \ntold my colleagues that no State in the nation would be eligible for S. \n10's Incentive Block Grant, since none currently complies with the \nstrict recordkeeping requirements. Moreover, at my request, the \nDepartment of Justice conducted a study which concluded that the \nextensive recordkeeping requirements in this bill would cost States \n``hundreds of millions of dollars.'' I urged the authors of this bill \nto narrow the focus of the recordkeeping to those juveniles who are \nmost likely to be repeat offenders, namely, those who commit acts which \nwould be a felony if committed by an adult. The sponsors have \napparently finally heeded these common sense concerns and promise to \ncorrect these flaws--even though they voted down amendments I proposed \nto make these corrections.\n  Increased Funding for Prosecutors: The sponsors have also finally \nagreed to double the funds available to prosecutors. It is unfortunate \nthat they refused to work this out in Committee last year so that \nadditional prosecutors could be at work right now.\n\n[[Page S6877]]\n\n  Improved Sight and Sound Separation Requirement: Last year, I joined \nwith Senators Biden and Kohl and other Democrats to urge the adoption \nof the more protective federal standards for juveniles in State \ndetention facilities but the Republican sponsors of S. 10 rejected \nthese changes to the bill. I am delighted to see that this mean-\nspirited provision may be modified, and that juveniles held in state \nfacilities will have the same protections from adult inmates as \njuveniles in federal custody.\n  Dedicated Prevention Funding: Despite being repeatedly rebuffed when \nI and my fellow Democrats insisted that prevention programs needed \ndedicated funding, I am pleased that the sponsors of S. 10 apparently \nhave changed their tune and are promising to dedicate funding to \nprevention programs. A dedicated fund of $50 million per year is a \nstart.\n  Revisions to the Federal Firearms Code: I warned my colleagues over a \nyear ago that certain provisions the ``Federal Gang Violence Act,'' \nincorporated in Title II of S. 10, would lead to the largest increase \nin the federal regulation of firearms in the history of our nation. No \none heeded my advice then, but the sponsors of this bill have \napparently finally realized they need to modify these provisions. The \nrevised S. 10 has more than halved the number of firearm offenses that \ncan serve as predicates for gang-related offenses or under the RICO \nstatute.\n  I remain eager to review the actual text of this revised bill. I also \nremain hopeful that the sponsors of S. 10 will commit to working openly \nwith me and other Democrats to craft common sense, reasonable \napproaches to reduce juvenile crime while there is still time in this \nCongress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/23/senate-section/article/S6876-4", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6877-S6879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       OMNIBUS PATENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, now that we have passed legislation to \nimplement the WIPO copyright treaties, it is time for the Senate to \nconsider another bill of critical importance to America's businesses: \nThe Omnibus Patent Act of 1997, S. 507.\n  The patent bill has been stalled by Republican holds for over a year. \nIt is time that the Senate turn to it and reform our patent laws. The \npatent bill was based on a proposal submitted by the Clinton \nAdministration several years ago. It was reported out of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee on May 22, 1997, with a favorable vote of 17-1 and \nhas the support of every Democrat on the Committee. Its co-sponsors, in \naddition to myself, include Senators Daschle, Bingaman, Cleland, Boxer, \nHarkin and Lieberman.\n  The patent bill would reform the U.S. patent system in important \nways. It would slash red tape in the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO); \nensure that American inventors are not disadvantaged as compared to \nforeign inventors by requiring patent applications to be published in \nthe U.S. at the same time they are published abroad; reduce legal fees \nthat are paid by inventors and companies; and require the PTO to \ndevelop statewide computer networks with remote library sites to \nenhance access to electronic patent information for independent \ninventors and small businesses in rural states.\n  In Vermont, we have a number of independent inventors and small \ncompanies. It is, therefore, especially important to me that this bill \nbe one that helps them just as much as it helps the larger companies. I \ntalked to independent inventors and representatives of smaller \ncompanies to see what reforms they recommended. I invited the President \nof the Vermont Inventors Association to testify before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee on this bill, and I have tried to make sure that \nthe sound recommendations of small businesses and independent inventors \nwere incorporated in the Hatch-Leahy substitute that the Judiciary \nCommittee reported to the Senate over one year ago.\n  The White House Conference on Small Businesses, which consists of \nover 2,000 delegates elected from hundreds of thousands of active small \nbusinesses nationwide; the National Association of Women Business \nOwners; the Small Business Technology Coalition; National Small \nBusiness United; the National Venture Capital Association; and the \nAmerican Small Business Coalition for Patent Reform have concluded \nthat, if enacted, this bill will be of great benefit to small \nbusinesses.\n  What is holding up floor consideration of the bill? I think it is \ntime to debate this bill on the merits. The Senate Republican \nleadership should schedule prompt action on this important measure.\n  Our nation's economic prosperity in the coming years will depend on \nour abilities to invent and protect those inventions through our \nintellectual property laws. American innovators face global \ncompetition, and they need updated laws to continue to lead the world. \nThis modernization of our patent laws is an important component of that \nessential effort. Along with the legislation the Senate recently \napproved to implement the WIPO copyright treaties, this bill goes a \nlong way to protecting American ingenuity in the next century. \nDemocrats have been ready to proceed to consider this measure for over \na year. With less than 53 legislative days left in this session, I urge \nthe Republican leadership to work with us to schedule action on this \nimportant bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of letters of support for the \npatent bill and a few examples from those letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  List of Letters of Support of the Omnibus Patent Act of 1997, S. 507\n\n       White House Conference on Small Businesses.\n       The National Association of Women Business Owners.\n       The Small Business Technology Coalition.\n       National Small Business United.\n       The National Venture Capital Association.\n       21 Century Patent Coalition--signed by CEOs of 48 American \n     companies.\n       The Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America.\n       Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, \n     PhRMA.\n       American Automobile Manufacturers Association.\n       The Software Publishers Association.\n       Semiconductor Industry Association.\n       3M.\n       IBM.\n       Intel Corporation.\n       Caterpillar.\n       AMP Incorporated.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   The White House\n\n\n                                 Conference on Small Business,\n\n                                                      May 7, 1998.\n     Hon.

We believe that S. 507, \n     as amended, will lower the litigation costs for small \n     business, make it easier to know what areas of technology are \n     open for innovation, and will go a long way towards giving us \n     a more level playing field vis-a-vis our foreign competitors. \n     We wholeheartedly support passage of the bill and appreciate \n     the attention and support you have given to small business.\n           Sincerely,\n         The White House Conference on Small Business Technology \n           Chairs: Pat McDonnell, Region I; Ed Wenger, Region II; \n           Jim Woo, Region II; Bill Budinger, Region III; Wanda \n           Gozdz, Region IV; Rob Risser, Region V; Wayne Barlow, \n           Region VIII; Marianne Hamm, Region IX; Chuck Harlowe, \n           Region X.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                        Women Business Owners,\n\n                                     Silver Spring, June 23, 1998.\n     Hon.

This letter expresses the position of NAWBO, on \n     behalf of our membership, regarding S.507 and its impact on \n     small business.

Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: The National Association of Women \n     Business Owners (NAWBO) and its alliance The Small Business \n     Technology Coalition (SBTC) met with the White House \n     Conference on Small Business (WHCSB) Technology Chairs to \n     review S. 507 and its impact on small business. NAWBO \n     supported intellectual property protection as one of the \n     issues at the White House Conference.\n       The issue of patent reform is one of great concern to small \n     manufacturers and technology enterprises and to all small \n     businesses in general. When a new patent is filed it provides \n     the potential for a new product to come to market. This in \n     turn gives small and medium size businesses the opportunity \n     to be awarded contracts that generate and provide jobs that \n     stimulate our economy.\n       America's 8 million women business owners are primarily \n     small and medium size companies that generate $2.3 trillion \n     dollars in sales and employ 18.5 million people in the United \n     States. Therefore, in order to insure the growth of the \n     American economy we need to protect our inventors.\n       It is, therefore, our belief that the proposed series of \n     amendments to S. 507 which if enacted, would make this bill \n     of great benefit to small businesses.\n       There are three amendments:\n       1. Title IV--Prior Domestic Commercial Use. We offer an \n     amendment in the form of a substitution. The amendment \n     reorganizes, clarifies and simplifies the wording. The \n     substantive difference is that the amendment removes the \n     opportunity which is presently in S. 507 to use a PDCU \n     defense when the prior user has only made ``effective and \n     serious preparation'' to commercialize the invention. With \n     this section removed, the prior use defense only applies to \n     technology that was actually reduced to practice at least one \n     year prior to the patent priority date and in commercial use \n     before the patent's priority date. With this amendment, PDCU \n     performs its important function of preventing patents from \n     being mis-used to take the property of others.\n       2. A new title adding language to 102(g)--Section 104 of \n     the existing U.S. patent law arguably allows a foreign \n     inventor to dodge the restrictions that 102(g) places on a \n     U.S. inventor. The suggested change to 102(g) will make it \n     clear that foreign inventors are also subject to the \n     restriction of 102(g) so that they cannot claim priority \n     dates to inventions that they have abandoned, suppressed or \n     concealed.\n       3. Title I--The make-up of the Management Advisory Board. \n     We add language to ensure that the proportion of \n     representatives on the board from small and large entities \n     reflects their respective proportion of patent applications \n     filed.\n       With these changes, we believe that S. 507 will lower the \n     litigation costs for small business, make it easier to know \n     what areas of technology are open for innovation, and will go \n     a long way toward giving us a more level playing field vis-a-\n     vis our foreign competitors.\n       With these changes, we will enthusiastically support S. \n     507.\n           Sincerely,\n         Barbara Kasoff, VP, Public Policy Council; Carol Barrows, \n           Secretary, Public Policy Council; Janie Emerson, \n           Director, Public Policy Council; Joan W.

Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The Small Business Technology Coalition \n     is made up of research-intensive, technology-based small \n     business leaders. We serve as a voice for the interests of \n     small high-technology firms both in Washington, DC and \n     throughout the United States.\n       The issue of patent reform is one of great concern to our \n     members. Since our formation 2 years ago, we have spent a \n     great deal of time examining the various patent bills in both \n     Houses. We have met with several groups including the IPO, \n     21st Century Patent Coalition, NAM and AIPLA and have come to \n     consensus on issues surrounding the bill.\n       We understand that an amendment has been offered and \n     believe that S. 507, as amended, will lower the litigation \n     costs for small business, make it easier to know what areas \n     of technology are open for innovation, and will go a long way \n     towards giving us a more level playing field vis-a-vis our \n     foreign competitors. We wholeheartedly support passage of the \n     bill and appreciate the attention and support you have given \n     to small business.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     James T.

Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: National Small Business United is \n     America's oldest, bipartisan, advocacy association and \n     represents the interests of 65,000 small businesses. Many of \n     our member companies are in the high-technology sector. The \n     issue of patent reform is one of great concern to small \n     manufacturers and technology enterprises. We have worked \n     closely with both the White House Conference on Small \n     Business (WHCSB) Technology Chairs and the Small Business \n     Technology Coalition, and share their views on pending patent \n     reform legislation.\n       We are pleased to hear that an amendment, incorporating the \n     changes requested by the WHCSB Technology Chairs, has been \n     offered addressing small business concerns with S. 507. We \n     believe that S. 507, as amended, will lower the litigation \n     costs for small business, make it easier to know what areas \n     of technology are open for innovation, and will go a long way \n     towards giving American small business a more level playing \n     field vis-a-vis our foreign competitors.\n       Again, as a representative of small business who rely on \n     the patent system, NSBU wholeheartedly supports and urges the \n     passage of the bill and appreciates the attention and support \n     you have given to small business.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Todd McCracken,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  National Venture\n\n\n                                          Capital Association,\n\n                                                     May 29, 1998.\n     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Shelby: Over the past several years the \n     National Venture Capital Association has actively worked to \n     enhance the existing patent term in a manner that would \n     permit biomedical companies to enjoy full 20 year patent \n     protection. In this regard, NVCA has long supported S. 507, \n     the patent reform bill which, in part, would give biomedical \n     companies a greater opportunity to fall within the full 20 \n     year patent protection granted under the GATT/TRIPS law \n     enacted in 1994.\n       A significant portion of venture capital investments in the \n     United States are made in the biopharmaceutical and medical \n     device fields. In fact, almost one-quarter of the $12 billion \n     invested by venture capitalists last year in emerging \n     companies went into these fields. These companies are the \n     cutting edge of biotechnology and medical innovation. They \n     are giving new and renewed hope for people across virtually \n     the entire spectrum of diseases and afflictions.\n       To venture capitalists, patents play a fundamental and \n     critical role in the availability of capital and our \n     willingness to invest in biotechnology and medical devices. \n     The reason for such dependency upon patents is that they \n     provide the favorable economics required to justify \n     substantial capital investment for successful product \n     development. The lack of, or the shorter the term of, a \n     patent decreases the attractiveness of a company from the \n     investors' perspective.\n       S. 507, voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on a \n     17-1 vote, gives the NVCA members the confidence to invest in \n     medical-based companies. The bill is vital to biotechnology \n     patents. NVCA, as well as many in the high technology and \n     inventor communities believe that the few remaining issues \n     can be quickly resolved. Questions regarding contentious \n     matters such as prior user rights can be addressed and \n     debated on the Senate floor through a carefully planned time \n     agreement. Moreover, the prior user rights provision could be \n     modified on the Senate floor to address the concerns of those \n     who still have questions about the provision. However, none \n     of this can be accomplished without an agreement to bring S. \n     507 to the Senate floor for debate and a vote.\n       It was unfortunate that S. 507 could not have been part of \n     the highly successful Senate ``Technology Week'' that \n     Majority Leader Lott orchestrated several weeks ago, as S. \n     507 truly is of concern to the high technology community. \n     Moreover, the overwhelming support witnessed in the House \n     combined with the clear mandate the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee voiced in approving this patent legislation \n     demonstrates the wide and bi-partisan support for patent \n     reform.\n       On behalf of emerging growth companies, we urge you to \n     support S. 507 and work to see that it can be brought to the \n     Senate floor for debate and a vote as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              M. Kathleen Behrens,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      21st Century\n\n\n                                             Patent Coalition,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 22, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Majority Leader, Capitol Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: We, the chief executives of 48 American \n     companies, are writing to express our strong support for S. \n     507 (Hatch/Leahy), the ``Omnibus Patent Act of 1997'', and to \n     urge you to schedule a vote before the Senate adjourns this \n     fall.\n       S. 507 makes several major improvements in U.S. patent law \n     that will greatly benefit American companies and inventors. \n     The bill (1) insures at least 17 years of exclusive rights to \n     diligent patent owners, (2) eliminates wasteful duplication \n     of R by requiring early publication of patent applications\n\n[[Page S6879]]\n\n     that are also published in foreign countries, (3) protects \n     investments in processes and factory equipment of American \n     manufacturers by creating a prior user defense, (4) provides \n     a low-cost, speedy alternative to district court litigation \n     by strengthening the Patent and Trademark Office's \n     reexamination procedure, and (5) improves efficiency of the \n     Patent and Trademark Office.\n       The substance of this bill has been debated in many \n     Congressional hearings since the beginning of the 104th \n     Congress. The House passed a companion bill earlier this year \n     and S. 507 was favorably reported by the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee by a vote of 17 to 1.\n       S. 507 enjoys strong bipartisan support, despite the \n     substantial misinformation that has surrounded it. It is time \n     for the Senate to vote on this bill, which will strengthen \n     the U.S. economy and keep jobs in America.\n           Sincerely,\n         Grant Saviers, Chairman, CEO and President, Adaptec, \n           Inc.; H.A.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; to the \n     Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 216\n\n       Whereas, The Delaware River represents one of \n     Pennsylvania's and one of the nation's most important water \n     resources, serving as a water supply for 17 million persons \n     in the states of New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and \n     Delaware; and\n       Whereas, The Delaware River is an interstate stream forming \n     the boundary between states for its entire length of 330 \n     miles; and\n       Whereas, Two major sections of the Delaware River have been \n     designated under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act; and\n       Whereas, The remaining section of the Delaware River has \n     been studied and is now in the process of being designated \n     under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act; and\n       Whereas, The Delaware River and the Pennsylvania \n     tributaries serve as a major recreational facility for the \n     large population of the New York/Pennsylvania Metropolitan \n     Area; and\n       Whereas, The Congress of the United States created the \n     Delaware River Basin Compact (Compact) in recognition of the \n     need to coordinate the efforts of the four states and Federal \n     agencies and to establish a management system to oversee the \n     use of water and related natural resources of the Delaware \n     River Basin; and\n       Whereas, The Compact was enacted by the legislatures of New \n     York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware and by Congress \n     and was signed into law on September 27, 1961, to provide a \n     mechanism to guide the conservation, development and \n     administration of water resources of the river basin; and\n       Whereas, The Compact established the Delaware River Basin \n     Commission (Commission) as the agency to coordinate the water \n     resources efforts of the four states and the Federal \n     Government and provided the Commission with authority for \n     management and protection of flood plains, water supplies, \n     water quality, watersheds, recreation, fish and wildlife and \n     cultural, visual and other amenities; and\n       Whereas, The Commission has provided for equitable \n     treatment of all parties without regards to political \n     boundary; and\n       Whereas, The Commission includes both the Delaware River \n     and Delaware Bay, which serve the port of Pennsylvania, a \n     port that handles the largest volume of petroleum of all \n     United States' ports; and\n       Whereas, Sections 3.3 and 3.4 of the Compact specifically \n     provide for the Commission, with the consent of the parties \n     in the matter of state of New Jersey v. state of New York et \n     al. 347 U.S. 995 (1954) to apportion the water to and among \n     the states; and\n       Whereas, The Commission has successfully negotiated all \n     disputes or conflicts between parties without any appeal to \n     the United States Supreme Court; and\n       Whereas, Section 13.3 of the Compact calls for the adoption \n     and apportionment of the Commission's annual expense budget \n     among the signatory parties to the Compact; and\n       Whereas, The United States is a duly constituted signatory \n     party to the Compact; and\n       Whereas, In fiscal years 1996, 1997 and 1998, the \n     Commission duly submitted its approved budgets to the \n     President's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and \n     Congress; and\n       Whereas, The Federal Government failed to provide full \n     funding in fiscal year 1996 and failed to provide any funding \n     in fiscal years 1997 and 1998 for the Commission's current \n     expense budget and has, therefore, not met the funding \n     requirement of section 13.3 of the Compact; and\n       Whereas, The Commission also has adopted and duly submitted \n     to OMB a current expense budget for fiscal year 1999 that \n     includes an apportionment for the Federal Government in the \n     amount of no dollars; and\n       Whereas, The fair share apportionment of the Commission's \n     annual expense budget for the Federal Government for fiscal \n     year 1999 is $628,000; and\n       Whereas, The cumulative shortfall of Federal funding for \n     the Commission since fiscal year 1996 to $1.716 million; and\n       Whereas, The Commission pays the Federal Government \n     approximately $1.3 million per year to purchase storage in \n     the Blue Marsh and Beltzville multipurpose reservoirs; and\n       Whereas, The Commission is the agent of Congress in the \n     allocation of the waters of the basin among the signatory \n     states; and\n       Whereas, The Commission, through its regulations and \n     programs, protects interstate waters and the Delaware Bay and \n     provides a forum for the prevention and settlement of \n     interstate disputes that arise over the use of interstate \n     waters; and\n       Whereas, Through these interstate functions and many other \n     programs and activities, such as the coordination of the \n     basin flood and drought forecasting and warning system, the \n     Commission saves the Federal Government time, resources and \n     money, thus advancing the welfare of the nation;

and\n       Whereas, The Susquehanna River provides 50% of the \n     freshwater flowing to the Chesapeake Bay and is classified by \n     the Federal Government as a navigable waterway, factors which \n     emphasize its significance to state, regional and national \n     interests; and\n       Whereas, The Congress of the United States created the \n     Susquehanna River Basin compact in recognition of the need to \n     coordinate the efforts of the three states and Federal \n     agencies and to establish a management system to oversee the \n     use of water and related natural resources of the Susquehanna \n     River; and\n       Whereas, The Compact was enacted by the legislatures of New \n     York State, Pennsylvania and Maryland and Congress and was \n     signed into law on December 24, 1970, to provide a mechanism \n     to guide the conservation, development and administration of \n     the water resources of the river basin;

and\n       Whereas, Section 14.3 of the Compact calls for an equitable \n     apportionment of the Commission's annual expense budget among \n     the signatory parties to the Compact; and\n       Whereas, The United States of America is a duly constituted \n     signatory party to the Compact; and\n       Whereas, In Fiscal Years 1996, 1997 and 1998, the \n     Commission duly submitted its approved budgets to the \n     President's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and \n     Congress; and\n       Whereas, The United States failed to provide full funding \n     in Fiscal Year 1996 and failed to provide any funding in \n     Fiscal Years 1997 and 1998 for the Commission's current \n     expense budget and has therefore not met the ``equitable'' \n     funding requirement of section 14.3 of the Compact; and\n       Whereas, The Commission also has adopted and duly submitted \n     to OMB a current expense budget for Fiscal Year 1999 that \n     includes an apportionment for the Federal Government in the \n     amount of $400,000; and\n       Whereas, The cumulative shortfall of Federal funding to the \n     Commission since Fiscal Year 1996 is $1.218 million; and\n       Whereas, The Commission pays the Federal Government \n     approximately $3.8 million per year to purchase storage in \n     the Cowanesque and Curwensville Flood Control Reservoirs; and\n       Whereas, The Commission is the agent of Congress in the \n     allocation of the waters of the basin among the signatory \n     states; and\n       Whereas, The Commission, through its regulations and \n     programs, protects interstate waters and the Chesapeake Bay \n     and provides a forum for the prevention and settlement of \n     interstate disputes that arise over the use of interstate \n     waters; and\n       Whereas, Through these interstate functions and many other \n     of its programs and activities such as the coordination of \n     the basin flood forecasting and warning system, the \n     Commission saves the Federal Government time, resources and \n     money, thus advancing the welfare of the nation; and\n       Whereas, On January 15, 1998, the members of the Commission \n     adopted Resolution No. 98-01, authorizing the Commission to \n     offset from payment of moneys made to the Federal Government \n     a sum not to exceed the amount apportioned to the United \n     States in the Commission's officially adopted current expense \n     budget and unpaid by the Federal Government since Fiscal Year \n     1996; and\n       Whereas, Resolution No. 98-01 provides that this offset \n     authority will continue in force as long as the United States \n     fails to fund the amount apportioned to the Federal \n     Government in the Commission's current expense budget; and\n       Whereas, Resolution 98-01 stipulates that the amount to be \n     withheld in the current fiscal year is $1.218 million; \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of Pennsylvania support the \n     Commission's decision is withhold from the Federal Government \n     a portion of its reservoir storage payments equal to the \n     amount owed by the Federal Government for its share of the \n     Commission's operating budgets for Fiscal Years 1996, 1997, \n     1998 and 1999 until such time as the Federal Government \n     provides these funds; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Senate of Pennsylvania urge the \n     President of the United States and Congress to provide the \n     Commission with funding in amount equal to what is owed for \n     the Federal Government's share of the Commission's operating \n     budgets for Fiscal Years 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Senate of Pennsylvania urge the \n     President of the United States and Congress to fulfill the \n     Federal Government's obligation under the Susquehanna River \n     Basin Compact to annually contribute an equitably apportioned \n     share of the Commission's future operating budgets, and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, to the presiding officers \n     of each house of Congress and to each member of Congress from \n     Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-489.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 218\n\n       Whereas, The Marine Corps' Iwo Jima Memorial honors the \n     marines who fought on that island during WWII; and\n       Whereas, The memorial depicts six men as they struggle to \n     raise an American flag atop a mountain, signaling defeat to \n     their enemy and hope to their comrades below; and\n       Whereas, The battle was the most costly in Marine history. \n     The 36 days of fighting led to 25,851 casualties, over a \n     third of the landing force, including more than 1,000 dead \n     per square mile. More Medals of Honor were won on Iwo Jima \n     than during any other battle in United States history. \n     Admiral Nimitz remarked that among the sailors and marines on \n     Iwo Jima, ``uncommon valor was a common virtue''; and\n       Whereas, The Iwo Jima Memorial may be obscured by an Air \n     Force Memorial--a sprawling 20,000 square-foot, five-story, \n     high-tech, interactive multimedia complex. Such a structure \n     would be appropriate in front of the heavily trafficked Air \n     and Space Museum, the site first approved for the structure; \n     and\n       Whereas, During National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) \n     hearings, the location changed abruptly to ground 500 feet in \n     front of the Marines' memorial. Though the NCPC originally \n     noted twice, 7-4 against the site, it reversed its decision \n     in a little-publicized meeting; and\n       Whereas, The Marine Corps was only informed after the fact. \n     No public hearings were held. The proposal clearly violates a \n     United States law that says, ``A commemorative work shall \n     (not encroach) upon any existing commemorative work.''; \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of Pennsylvania urge the Congress \n     of the United States to consider and pass S-1284, HR-3188 or \n     HR-2313, each of which would prohibit future memorials in the \n     area desired by the Air Force; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of each house of Congress and to each \n     member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-491.

A \n     nongovernmental organization has requested the CEC to prepare \n     a report addressing the cumulative effects of groundwater \n     pumping, grazing and mining on the San Pedro River, the San \n     Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area and the wildlife \n     species that live in this southeastern Arizona area. The CEC \n     has agreed to this petition and has undertaken an independent \n     report examining alleged water problems in the San Pedro \n     River watershed; and\n       Whereas, this study of the San Pedro River watershed does \n     not in any way relate to the trade relations between Canada, \n     Mexico and the United States that are the stated purpose of \n     the NAFTA environmental arm. Further, the Congress of the \n     United States specifically addressed the San Pedro watershed \n     in 1988 when it passed federal legislation establishing the \n     San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area to protect the \n     riparian habitat and the area's wildlife, scientific, \n     educational and recreational resources; and\n       Whereas, although the objectives behind NAFTA are sound and \n     the agreement will continue to create tremendous economic \n     opportunity for this state, the NAFTA environmental side \n     agreement, or any other international treaty or negotiation, \n     should not place states' environmental rights under \n     international authority nor override the states' jurisdiction \n     over their own environmental matters. the CEC study and \n     report represent an unnecessary intrusion of an international \n     environmental entity into state matters that excessively \n     limits the use of both private and public lands in this \n     state; and\n       Whereas, in 1997 President Bill Clinton established, by \n     Executive Order 13061, the American Heritage Rivers \n     Initiative with three objectives, including natural resource\n\n[[Page S6882]]\n\n     and environmental protection. The initiative requires \n     executive agencies to coordinate federal plans, functions, \n     programs and resources to preserve, protect and restore \n     rivers and their associated resources that are important to \n     our nation's history, culture and natural heritage; and\n       Whereas, various federal and state authorities are already \n     charged with regulating water resources within the State of \n     Arizona, and numerous grassroots organizations across the \n     nation have been founded to protect and conserve the nation's \n     rivers and watersheds. Designation of additional areas \n     subject to federal involvement in land use management would \n     be unduly restrictive on both the privately and publicly \n     owned land bordering rivers, much of which is already \n     restrictively managed for perceived environmental benefits \n     through designation or proposed designation as wilderness \n     areas, primitive areas, critical habitat or potential habitat \n     for endangered species, conservation areas, areas of critical \n     environmental concern and wild or scenic rivers; and\n       Whereas, riparian and general conservation efforts are best \n     administered and managed at state or local levels of \n     government, not by an international council or federal entity \n     that is neither familiar with nor affected by the areas in \n     question.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of \n     Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring, prays:\n       1. That the Congress of the United States take any steps \n     within its power to rectify the situation in southeastern \n     Arizona regarding the intrusion by the international CEC into \n     the affairs of the San Pedro River watershed.\n       2. That the Congress of the United States refuse to ratify \n     or adopt future treaties making the states of this nation \n     subject to international intrusion or authority over states' \n     environmental matters.\n       3. That the President of the United States not authorize or \n     endorse the designation of any river, watershed or river \n     segment within the State of Arizona as an American Heritage \n     River.\n       4. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona \n     transmit copies of this Memorial to the President of the \n     United States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and \n     each Member of Congress from the State of Arizona.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-492. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; to the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations.\n\n                              Resolution--\n\n       Whereas, The United States is a signatory to the 1992 \n     United Nations Framework Convention on Global Climate Change \n     (FCCC); and\n       Whereas, Protocol to expand the scope of the FCCC was \n     negotiated in December 1997, in Kyoto, Japan (Kyoto \n     Protocol), requiring the United States to reduce emissions of \n     greenhouse gases by 7% from 1990 levels during the period \n     2008 to 2012, with potentially larger emission reductions \n     thereafter; and\n       Whereas, The Kyoto Protocol would require other major \n     industrial nations to reduce emissions from 1990 levels by 6% \n     to 8% during the period 2008 to 2012, with potentially larger \n     emission reductions thereafter; and\n       Whereas, President William J. Clinton pledged on October \n     22, 1997, that ``The United States will not assume binding \n     obligations (in Kyoto) unless key developing nations \n     meaningfully participate in this effort''; and\n       Whereas, On July 25, 1997, the United States Senate adopted \n     Senate Resolution No. 98 by a vote of 95-0 expressing the \n     Sense of the Senate that, inter alia, ``the United States \n     should not be signatory to any protocol to, or other \n     agreement regarding, the Framework Convention on Climate \n     Change . . . which would require the advice and consent of \n     the Senate to ratification, and which would mandate new \n     commitments to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions for the \n     Developed Country Parties, unless the protocol or other \n     agreement also mandates specific scheduled commitments within \n     the same compliance period to mitigate greenhouse gas \n     emissions for Developing Country Parties''; and\n       Whereas, Developing nations who are exempt from greenhouse \n     gas emission limitation requirements in the FCCC refused in \n     the Kyoto negotiations to accept any new commitments for \n     greenhouse gas emission limitations through the Kyoto \n     Protocol or other agreements; and\n       Whereas, The Kyoto Protocol fails to meet the tests \n     established for acceptance of new climate change commitments \n     by President Clinton and by United States Senate Resolution \n     No. 98; and\n       Whereas, The United States relies on carbon-based fossil \n     fuels for more than 90% of its total energy supply; and\n       Whereas, Achieving the emission reductions proposed by the \n     Kyoto Protocol would require more than 35% reduction in \n     projected United States carbon dioxide emissions during the \n     period 2008 to 2012; and\n       Whereas, Developing countries exempt from emission \n     limitations under the Kyoto Protocol are expected to increase \n     their rates of fossil fuel use over the next two decades and \n     to surpass the United States and other industrialized \n     countries in total emissions of greenhouse gases; and\n       Whereas, Economic impact studies by the Federal Government \n     estimate that legally binding requirements for the reduction \n     of United States greenhouse gases to 1990 emission levels \n     would result in the loss of more than 900,000 jobs in the \n     United States, sharply increase energy prices, reduce family \n     incomes and wages and cause severe losses of output in energy \n     intensive industries such as aluminum, steel, rubber, \n     chemicals and utilities; and\n       Whereas, The failure to provide for commitments by \n     developing countries in the Kyoto Protocol creates an unfair \n     competitive imbalance between industrial and developing \n     nations, potentially leading to the transfer of jobs and \n     industrial development from the United States to developing \n     countries; and\n       Whereas, Increased emissions of greenhouse gases by \n     developing countries would offset any environmental benefits \n     associated with emissions reductions achieved by the United \n     States and by other industrial nations; therefore be it\n       Resolved (the House of Representatives concurring), That \n     the General Assembly memorialize the President of the United \n     States not to sign the Kyoto Protocol; and be it further\n       Resolved, That in the event he signs the Kyoto Protocol, \n     the President promptly submit the Kyoto Protocol to the \n     Senate of the United States for its timely consideration; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the United States reject any \n     proposed protocol or other amendment to the FCCC that is \n     inconsistent with this resolution or that does not comply \n     fully with United States Senate Resolution No. 98; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the presiding officers of \n     each house of Congress and to each member of Congress from \n     Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-493.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Michigan; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 42\n\n       Whereas, In many situations, the difficulties facing family \n     farming operations are numerous and challenging. The number \n     of farms has declined steadily for many years, both in \n     Michigan and throughout the entire country. For Black farmers \n     across this nation, however, the obstacles to survival are \n     staggering. Recent investigations through the Congressional \n     Black Caucus and organizations like the National Black \n     Farmers Association have revealed the extent of \n     discrimination against African American farm operations. \n     These civil rights violations were contained in \n     recommendations of a task force within the United States \n     Department of Agriculture; and\n       Whereas, Access to capital, vital component of any farming \n     operation, has been denied to many Black farmers. When not \n     denied outright, through loans refused and ultimate \n     foreclosures, loans for Black farmers often take far longer \n     to be approved. The result of a delay for a farm loan is \n     often financial ruin; and\n       Whereas, According to the National Black Farmers \n     Association, the USDA foreclosed on 1,000 Black farms in the \n     last several months. Black farmers are losing land at a rate \n     of 9,000 acres a week. At this rate, according to the chair \n     of the Congressional Black Caucus, Black farms will vanish by \n     the year 2000; and\n       Whereas, The USDA, through it civil rights study group, has \n     identified specific legislative changes to combat \n     discrimination in its policies and programs. Any delay in \n     implementing needed changes and in revamping the department's \n     response to Black farmers is too long; and\n       Whereas, In April 1998, the Justice Department ruled that \n     most of the approximately 2,000 cases brought by Black \n     farmers with complaints of discrimination between 1983 and \n     1996 would expire due to the statute of limitations. It is \n     essential that Congress take actions to enable the federal \n     government to respond appropriately to the legitimate claims \n     of these citizens; now, therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S6883]]\n\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring), That we urge the United States Department of \n     Agriculture to take strong steps to halt all discrimination \n     against Black farmers, to settle pending claims, and to \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact \n     legislation to waive the statute of limitations for the \n     discrimination cases brought against the Department of \n     Agriculture between 1983 and 1996; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the United States Department of Agriculture, the President of \n     the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/23/senate-section/article/S6880-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. JEFFORDS, from the Committee on Labor and Human \n     Resources, with an amendment in the nature of a substitute:\n       S. 1754.

A bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act to ensure that all \ndogs and cats used by research facilities are obtained legally; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n               the pet protection and safety act of 1998\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Pet \nProtection and Safety Act of 1998, a bill to close a serious loophole \nin the Animal Welfare Act.\n  Congress passed the Animal Welfare Act over 30 years ago to stop the \nmistreatment of animals and to prevent the sale of family pets for \nlaboratory experiments. Despite the Animal Welfare Act's well-meaning \nintentions and the enforcement efforts of the Department of \nAgriculture, the Act routinely fails to provide pets and pet owners \nwith reliable protection against the actions of USDA-licensed Class B \nanimal dealers, also known as ``random source'' dealers.\n  Medical research is an invaluable weapon in the battle against \ndisease. New drugs and surgical techniques offer promise in the fight \nagainst AIDS, cancer, and a host of life-threatening diseases. Animal \nresearch has been, and continues to be, fundamental to advancements in \nmedicine. I am not here to argue whether animals should or should not \nbe used in research; rather, I am addressing the unethical practice of \nselling stolen pets and stray animals to research facilities.\n  There are less than 40 ``random source'' animal dealers operating \nthroughout the country who acquire tens of thousands of dogs and cats. \nMany of these animals are family pets, acquired by so-called \n``bunchers'' who resort to theft and deception as they collect animals \nand sell them to Class B dealers. ``Bunchers'' often respond to ``free \npet to a good home'' advertisements, tricking animal owners into giving \naway their pets by posing as someone interested in adopting the dog or \ncat. Random source dealers are known to keep hundreds of animals at a \ntime in squalid conditions, providing them with little food or water. \nThe mistreated animals often pass through several hands and across \nstate lines before they are eventually sold by a random source dealer \nto a research laboratory for $200 to $500 each.\n  Mr. President, the use of animals in research is subject to \nlegitimate criticism because of the fraud, theft, and abuse that I have \njust described. Dr. Robert Whitney, former director of the Office of \nAnimal Care and Use at the National Institutes of Health echoed this \nsentiment when he stated, ``The continued existence of these virtually \nunregulatable Class B dealers erodes the public confidence in our \ncommitment to appropriate procurement, care, and use of animals in the \nimportant research to better the health of both humans and animals.'' \nWhile I doubt that laboratories intentionally seek out stolen or \nfraudulently obtained dogs and cats as research subjects, the fact \nremains that these animals end up in research laboratories--and little \nis being done to stop it. Mr. President, it is clear to most observers, \nincluding animal welfare organizations around the country, that this \nproblem persists because of random source animal dealers.\n  The Pet Protection and Safety Act strengthens the Animal Welfare Act \nby prohibiting the use of random source animal dealers as suppliers of \ndogs and cats to research laboratories. At the same time, The Pet \nProtection and Safety Act preserves the integrity of animal research by \nencouraging research laboratories to obtain animals from legitimate \nsources that comply with the Animal Welfare Act. Legitimate sources are \nUSDA-licensed Class A dealers or breeders; municipal pounds that choose \nto release dogs and cats for research purposes; legitimate pet owners \nwho want to donate their animals to research; and private and federal \nfacilities that breed their own animals. These four sources are capable \nof supplying millions of animals for research, far more cats and dogs \nthan are required by current laboratory demand. Furthermore, at least \nin the case of using municipal pounds, research laboratories could save \nmoney since pound animals cost only a few dollars compared to $200 and \n$500 per animal charged by random animal dealers. The National \nInstitutes of Health, in an effort to curb abuse and deception, has \nalready adopted policies against the acquisition of dogs and cats from \nrandom source dealers.\n  The Pet Protection and Safety Act also reduces the Department of \nAgriculture's regulatory burden by allowing the Department to use its \nresources more efficiently and effectively. Each year, hundreds of \nthousands of dollars are spent on regulating 40 random source dealers. \nTo combat any future violations of the Animal Welfare Act, the Pet \nProtection and Safety Act increases the penalties under the Act to a \nminimum of $1,000 per violation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 2207. A bill to amend the Clayton Act to enhance the authority of \nthe Attorney General to prevent certain mergers and acquisitions that \nwould unreasonably limit competition; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                   antitrust improvements act of 1998\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know that consumers are becoming \nmore and more concerned about the merger mania that has hit the United \nStates--they see the potential for higher prices to consumers and \npoorer service as industries become far more concentrated in fewer \nhands.\n  I am also concerned about this trend, particularly when mergers take \nplace between incumbent monopolies. Specifically, the mergers among \nRegional Bell Operating Companies, which continue to have a virtual \nstrangle-hold on the local telephone loop, pose the greatest threat to \nhealthy competition in the telecommunications industry.\n  Indeed, incumbent telephone companies still control over 99% of the \nlocal residential telephone markets. In other words, new entrants have \ncaptured less than 1% of local residential phone service.\n  The Telecommunications Act's promise of competition was a sales pitch \nthat has not materialized to benefit American consumers. Instead of \ncompetition, we see entrenchment, mega-mergers, consolidation and the \ndivvying up of markets. Even Edward Whitacre, Jr., the Chairman and \nChief Executive Officer of SBC Communications, testified several weeks \nago before the Antitrust Subcommittee that ``The Act promised \ncompetition that has not come.''\n  At a recent judiciary committee hearing on mergers, Alan Greenspan \nacknowledged that the Act has not lived up to its promises of lower \nconsumer costs and more competition.\n  Since passage of this law, Southwestern Bell has merged with PacTel \ninto SBC Corporation, and Bell Atlantic has merged with NYNEX. Now, SBC \nCorporation is seeking to purchase Ameritech. What once had been seven \nseparate local monopolies will soon be\n\n[[Page S6887]]\n\nfour, with the possibility of more on the horizon. One of my home state \nnewspapers--the Rutland Daily Herald--commented in an editorial that, \n``It might even seem as if Ma Bell's corpse is coming back to life.''\n  I voted against the Telecommunications Act because I did not believe \nit was sufficiently procompetitive. I raised a number of concerns as \nthat Act was being considered by the Senate. I said in my floor \nstatement on the day the new law passed:\n\n       Mega-mergers between telecommunications giants, such as the \n     rumored merger between NYNEX and Bell Atlantic, or the \n     gigantic network mergers now underway, raise obvious concerns \n     about concentrating control in a few gigantic companies of \n     both the content and means of distributing the information \n     and entertainment American consumers receive. Competition, \n     not concentration, is the surest way to assure lower prices \n     and greater choices for consumers. Rigorous oversight and \n     enforcement by our antitrust agencies is more important than \n     ever to insure that such mega-mergers do not harm consumers.\n\n  I am very concerned that this concentration of ownership in the \ntelecommunications industry is currently proceeding faster than the \ngrowth of competition. We are seeing old monopolies getting bigger and \nexpanding their reach.\n  Upon completion of all the proposed mergers among the Bell companies, \nmost of the local telephone lines in the country will be concentrated \nin the hands of three to four companies. This will affect not only the \nmillions of people who depend on the companies involved for both basic \ntelephone service and increasingly for an array of advanced \ntelecommunications services, but also competition in the entire \nindustry. The Consumers Union recently testified before the Judiciary \nCommittee's Antitrust Subcommittee that the mergers between Regional \nBell Operating Companies could lead to even more mega-mergers within \nthis industry.\n  I know personally that at my farm in Vermont and here at my office in \nthe District of Columbia and at my home in Virginia, I still have only \none choice for dial-tone and local telephone service. That ``choice'' \nis the Bell operating company or no service at all. The current mantra \nof the industry seems to be ``one-stop shopping.'' But if that stop is \nat a monopoly that is not competing on price and service, I do not \nthink it is the kind of ``one-stop shopping'' consumers want.\n\n  I have been concerned that the distraction of these huge mergers \nserve only to complicate and delay the companies' compliance with their \nobligations under the Telecommunications Act to open their networks. \nThat is not good for competition in the local loop. Consolidation is \ntaking precedence over competition. We need to reverse that priority, \nand make opening up the local loop the focus of the energies of the \nBell Operating Companies. Then consolidation, if it happens, would not \npose the current risk of creating additional barriers to effective \ncompetition.\n  Big is not necessarily bad. But the Justice Department in the late \n1970's worked overtime to divide up the old Ma Bell to assure more \ncompetition and provide customers with better service at lower rates. \nIt is ironic that the Telecommunications Act, which was touted as the \nway to increase competition, is having the reverse effect instead of \npromoting consolidation among telephone companies.\n  Before all the pieces of Ma Bell are put together again, Congress \nshould revisit the Telecommunications Act. To ensure competition among \nBell Operating Companies and long distance and other companies, as \ncontemplated by passage of this law, we need clearer guidelines and \nbetter incentives. Specifically, we should ensure that Bell Operating \nCompanies do not gain more concentrated control over huge percentages \nof the telephone access lines of this country through mergers, but only \nthrough robust competition.\n  As the Consumers Union recently testified, ``If Congress really wants \nto bring broad-based competition to telecommunications markets, it must \nrewrite the Telecommunications Act, giving antitrust and regulatory \nauthorities more tools to eliminate the most persistent pockets of \ntelephone and cable monopoly power.''\n  Today I am introducing antitrust legislation that will bar future \nmergers between Bell Operating Companies or GTE, unless the federal \nrequirements for opening the local loop to competition have been \nsatisfied in at least half of the access lines in each State. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on this legislation to make the \nTelecommunications Act live up to some of its promise.\n  The bill provides that a ``large local telephone company'' may not \nmerge with another large local telephone company unless the Attorney \nGeneral finds that the merger will promote competition for telephone \nexchange services and exchange access services. Also, before a merger \ncan take place the Federal Communications Commission must find that \neach large local telephone company has for at least one-half of the \naccess lines in each State served by such carrier, of which as least \none-half are residential access lines, fully implemented the \nrequirements of sections 251 and 252 of the Communications Act of 1934.\n  The bill requires that each large local telephone company that wishes \nto merge with another must file an application with the Attorney \nGeneral and the FCC. A review of these applications will be subject to \nthe same time limits set under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust \nImprovements Act of 1976.\n  The bill also provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed to \nmodify, impair, or supersede the applicability of the antitrust laws of \nthe United States, or any authority of the Federal Communications \nCommission, or any authority of the States with respect to mergers and \nacquisitions of large local telephone companies.\n  The bill is effective on enactment and has no retroactive effect. It \nis enforceable by the Attorney General in federal district courts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2207\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Antitrust Improvements Act \n     of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to enhance the authority of the \n     Attorney General to prevent certain mergers and acquisitions \n     that would unreasonably limit competition in the \n     telecommunications industry in any case in which certain \n     Federal requirements that would enhance competition are not \n     met.\n\n     SEC. 3. RESTRAINT OF TRADE.\n\n       The Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12 et seq.) is amended by adding \n     at the end the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 27.

A bill to amend title IX of the Public Health Service Act to \nrevise and extend the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n               HEALTHCARE QUALITY ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to advocate better healthcare \nfor Americans and to introduce legislation strengthening the scientific \nfoundation of healthcare quality improvement efforts. Let me make a few \nintroductory comments before summarizing the ``Healthcare Quality \nEnhancement Act of 1998.''\n  First, I want to make it clear: all patients deserve better \nhealthcare quality, not just HMO enrollees as recent discussions have \nmost frequently focused on regarding consumer protections.\n  All Americans deserve better healthcare. We need healthcare quality \nimprovement that reaches everybody through better healthcare plans, \ntertiary care centers, fee-for-service solo practices, and all other \nkinds of patient care.\n  We should not wait for another movie like the one titled ``As Good as \nIt Gets'' to talk about healthcare quality for 70% percent of employees \nand 86% of Medicare beneficiaries who are not traditional-HMO \nenrollees.\n  Quality of care fundamentally rests on the achievements of biomedical \nresearch. We all know that sound science is the best way to improve \nquality in patient care. All components of the outcome of healthcare \ncan be effectively improved by statistically valid science: health \nstatus can be turned around by transplantation when someone's life is \nin jeopardy due to a diseased organ; social functioning can be improved \nby shock wave lithotripsy that leads to faster recovery; and patient \nsatisfaction can be better when children with moderate or severe asthma \nget proper anti-inflammatory treatment.\n  While being amazed by the promise of new scientific achievements, few \npatients realize the implications of abundant and growing production in \nbiomedical research.\n  Over the past 20 years, the number of articles indexed annually in \nthe Medline database of the National Library of Medicine nearly \ndoubled.\n  Randomized clinical trials are considered sources of the highest \nquality evidence on the value of a new intervention. Over the past two \ndecades, the number of clinical trials in my own field of cardiology \nhave increased five-fold.\n  In health services research, 10 times more clinical trials are \npublished today than 20 years ago (e.g., clinical trials comparing \ninpatient care with outpatient care, trials of physician profiling and \nother information interventions).\n  But we are falling short in our success to disseminate our findings \nand influence practice behavior.\n  In spite of all these scientific achievements, we cannot further \nbuild up biomedical research production for the next millennium if our \nnetwork for sharing it with practitioners remains on a nineteenth's \ncentury level.\n  The landmark Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study was published \nin 1985. This randomized controlled clinical trial validated a \nscientific achievement almost a decade earlier. The American Diabetes \nAssociation published its eye care guidelines for patients with \ndiabetes mellitus in 1988. Today, the national rate for annual diabetic \neye exam is still only 38.4%.\n  There are more scientific discoveries than ever before, but practical \nintroduction of new scientific discoveries does not seem to be much \nfaster today than it was more than 100 years ago. We need to close the \ngap between what we know and what we do in healthcare. That requires a \nfederal role in sharing information about what works to improve \nquality.\n  All Americans want better healthcare and the federal government must \nrespond by offering helpful information on quality, channeling \nscientific evidence to clinicians, and investing in research on \nimproving health services.\n  For this reason, today I am introducing legislation to establish the \n``Agency for Healthcare Quality'' which builds on the platform of the \ncurrent Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research, but refocuses it on \nquality to become the central figure in our efforts to improve the \nquality of healthcare.\n  Healthcare quality is a matter of personal preference--it means \ndifferent things to different people. We all remember when healthcare \nquality became a political showdown, the low back pain guidelines \nbackfired because they were viewed as an attempt to mandate ``cook \nbook'' medicine, and the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research had \na near death experience.\n  Over the past three years, since I first came to the United States \nSenate, I have looked very closely at this agency. The Subcommittee on \nPublic Health and Safety, which I chair, has held three hearings to \ninvite public input on this agency. As a result, this legislation \nresponds to many of the past criticisms of the agency. This legislation \nwill take AHCPR--under a new name--to new heights and will establish it \nas the center of healthcare quality research for the country.\n\n  The new Agency for Healthcare Quality will:\n  1. promote quality by sharing information. While proven medical \nadvances are made daily, patients are waiting too long to benefit from \nthese discoveries. We must get the science to the people by better \nsharing of information and more effective dissemination. In addition, \nthe Agency will develop evidence-rating systems to help people in \njudging the quality of science.\n  2. build public-private partnerships to advance and share true \nquality measures. Quality means different things to different people. \nIn collaboration with the private sector, the Agency shall conduct \nresearch that can figure out what quality really means to patients and \nto clinicians, how to measure quality, and what actions can improve the \noutcome of healthcare.\n  3. report annually on the state of quality, and cost, of the nation's \nhealthcare. Americans want to know if they receive good quality \nhealthcare. But compared to what? Statistically accurate, sample-based \nnational surveys will efficiently provide reliable and affordable data \n--without excessive, overly intrusive, and potentially destructive \nmandatory reporting requirements.\n  4. aggressively support improved information systems for health \nquality. Currently, quality measurement too often requires manual chart \nreviews for such simple data as frequency of procedures, infection \nrates, or other complications. Improved computer systems will advance \nquality scoring and facilitate quality-based decision-making in patient \ntreatment.\n\n[[Page S6889]]\n\n  5. support primary care research, and address issues of access in \nunderserved areas. While most policy discussions this year are \ntargeting managed care, quality improvement is just as important to the \nsolo private practitioner. The Agency's authority is expanded to \nsupport healthcare improvement in all types of office practice--not \njust managed care. The agency shall specifically address quality in \nrural and other undeserved areas by advancing telemedicine services \nwhich share clinical expertise with more patients.\n  6. facilitate innovation in patient care with streamlined evaluation \nand assessment of new technologies. Patients should benefit from proven \nbreakthrough technologies sooner, while inefficient methods should be \nphased out faster. Today, manufacturers and distributors of new \ntechnologies face major hurdles in trying to secure coverage. The \nMedicare technology committee has been particularly criticized for its \nprocess. Criteria are unclear, delays are long, and decisions are \nunpredictable. The Agency will be accessible to both private and public \nentities for technology assessments and will share information on \nassessment methodologies.\n  7. coordinate quality improvement efforts of the government. Most of \nthe many federal healthcare programs today support some kind of health \nservices research and conduct various quality improvement projects. The \nAgency shall coordinate these many initiatives to avoid disjointed, \nuncoordinated, or duplicative efforts.\n  In summary, we need to practice, not just publish, better patient \ncare. We all want to see better quality.\n  Real improvement can come from progress in health sciences, from \npromoting innovation in patient care, and from better practical \napplication of new scientific advances. The Agency for Healthcare \nQuality will focus on overall improvement in healthcare and enable us \nto judge the quality of care we receive.\n  Americans want better healthcare and the federal government shall \nrespond by offering helpful information on quality, channeling \nscientific evidence to clinicians, and investing in research on \nimproving health services.\n  Mr. President the ``Healthcare Quality Enhancement Act of 1998'' will \nreduce the gap between what we know and what we do in healthcare. The \nrefocused Agency for Healthcare Quality is the right step forward and I \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation to improve healthcare \nfor all Americans.\n\n

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Political Freedom in China \n     Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC.   . FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Congress concurs in the following conclusions of the \n     United States State Department on human rights in the \n     People's Republic of China in 1996:\n       (A) The People's Republic of China is ``an authoritarian \n     state'' in which ``citizens lack the freedom to peacefully \n     express opposition to the party-led political system and the \n     right to change their national leaders or form of \n     government''.\n       (B) The Government of the People's Republic of China has \n     ``continued to commit widespread and well-documented human \n     rights abuses, in violation of internationally accepted \n     norms, stemming from the authorities' intolerance of dissent, \n     fear of unrest, and the absence or inadequacy of laws \n     protecting basic freedoms''.\n       (C) ``[a]buses include torture and mistreatment of \n     prisoners, forced confessions, and arbitrary and \n     incommunicado detention''.\n       (D) ``[p]rison conditions remained harsh [and] [t]he \n     Government continued severe restrictions on freedom of \n     speech, the press, assembly, association, religion, privacy, \n     and worker rights''.\n       (E) ``[a]lthough the Government denies that it holds \n     political prisoners, the number of persons detained or \n     serving sentences for `counterrevolutionary crimes' or \n     `crimes against the state', or for peaceful political or \n     religious activities are believed to number in the \n     thousands''.\n       (F) ``[n]onapproved religious groups, including Protestant \n     and Catholic groups . . . experienced intensified \n     repression''.\n\n[[Page S6904]]\n\n       (G) ``[s]erious human rights abuses persist in minority \n     areas, including Tibet, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia[, and] \n     [c]ontrols on religion and on other fundamental freedoms in \n     these areas have also intensified''.\n       (H) ``[o]verall in 1996, the authorities stepped up efforts \n     to cut off expressions of protest or criticism. All public \n     dissent against the party and government was effectively \n     silenced by intimidation, exile, the imposition of prison \n     terms, administrative detention, or house arrest. No \n     dissidents were known to be active at year's end.''.\n       (2) In addition to the State Department, credible \n     independent human rights organizations have documented an \n     increase in repression in China during 1995, and effective \n     destruction of the dissident movement through the arrest and \n     sentencing of the few remaining pro-democracy and human \n     rights activists not already in prison or exile.\n       (3) Among those were Li Hai, sentenced to 9 years in prison \n     on December 18, 1996, for gathering information on the \n     victims of the 1989 crackdown, which according to the court's \n     verdict constituted ``state secrets''; Liu Nianchun, an \n     independent labor organizer, sentenced to 3 years of ``re-\n     education through labor'' on July 4, 1996, due to his \n     activities in connection with a petition campaign calling for \n     human rights reforms; and Ngodrup Phuntsog, a Tibetan \n     national, who was arrested in Tibet in 1987 immediately after \n     he returned from a 2-year trip to India, where the Tibetan \n     government in exile is located, and following a secret trial \n     was convicted by the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China of espionage on behalf of the ``Ministry of Security of \n     the Dalai clique''.\n       (4) Many political prisoners are suffering from poor \n     conditions and ill-treatment leading to serious medical and \n     health problems, including--\n       (A) Gao Yu, a journalist sentenced to 6 years in prison in \n     November 1994 and honored by UNESCO in May 1997, has a heart \n     condition; and\n       (B) Chen Longde, a leading human rights advocate now \n     serving a 3-year reeducation through labor sentence imposed \n     without trial in August 1995, has reportedly been subject to \n     repeated beatings and electric shocks at a labor camp for \n     refusing to confess his guilt.\n       (5) The People's Republic of China, as a member of the \n     United Nations, is expected to abide by the provisions of the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n       (6) The People's Republic of China is a party to numerous \n     international human rights conventions, including the \n     Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or \n     Degrading Treatment or Punishment.\n\n     SEC.   . CONDUCT OF FOREIGN RELATIONS.\n\n       (a) Release of Prisoners.--The Secretary of State, in all \n     official meetings with the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China, should request the immediate and \n     unconditional release of Ngodrup Phuntsog and other prisoners \n     of conscience in Tibet, as well as in the People's Republic \n     of China.\n       (b) Access to Prisons.--The Secretary of State should seek \n     access for international humanitarian organizations to \n     Drapchi prison and other prisons in Tibet, as well as the \n     People's Republic of China, to ensure that prisoners are not \n     being mistreated and are receiving necessary medical \n     treatment.\n       (c) Dialogue on Future of Tibet.--The Secretary of State, \n     in all official meetings with the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China, should call on that country to begin \n     serious discussions with the Dalai Lama or his \n     representatives, without preconditions, on the future of \n     Tibet.\n\n     SEC.   .

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING DEMOCRACY IN HONG KONG.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the people of Hong Kong \n     should continue to have the right and ability to freely elect \n     their legislative representatives, and that the procedure for \n     the conduct of the elections of the legislature of the Hong \n     Kong Special Administrative Region should be determined by \n     the people of Hong Kong through an election law convention, a \n     referendum, or both.\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, I rise to report to the Senate \nthat on June 18, 1998 in Geneva, at the conclusion of the 86th \nInternational Labor Conference, the International Labor Organization \nadopted by an overwhelming margin an important new ``Declaration on \nFundamental Principles and Rights at Work.'' The vote was 273 in favor \nof the new Declaration, zero opposed, with 43 abstentions. The adoption \nof this measure is a singular achievement and holds great promise for \nadvancing core labor standards in the international community.\n  Our distinguished Secretary of Labor, the Honorable Alexis M. Herman, \ndeserves much credit, as does Andrew Samet, her able Deputy Under \nSecretary for International Labor Affairs. Over the last three weeks, \nSecretary Herman energetically pursued this agreement throughout \ndifficult and long negotiating sessions, and in critical corridor side-\nbars. Ultimately, she succeeded.\n  Secretary Herman has characterized the new Declaration and its \nfollow-up mechanism as ``a big step forward for the ILO and its members \nas we enter the 21st Century.'' In the statement that she issued on \nJune 18, 1998, upon the adoption of the new Declaration, she said:\n\n       With the passage of this declaration, the ILO underlined \n     and clarified the importance of the fundamental rights of \n     workers in an era of economic globalization. It firmly \n     demonstrates that we can and will move forward in an effort \n     to see trade and labor concerns as mutually supportive--not \n     mutually exclusive.\n\n  Another of the United States' Delegates to the International Labor \nConference, AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney, called the Declaration \n``an historic breakthrough that dramatically underscores the importance \nof basic rights for workers in the global economy.'' And to emphasize \nthe tripartite nature of the ILO, it should be noted for the record \nthat the U.S. Council for International Business, which is the United \nStates' employer representative to the ILO, was a principal supporter \nof this new initiative, and has been from the beginning. The Council's \nPresident, Abraham Katz, called the new Declaration ``a major \nachievement for the ILO.''\n  In essence, the ILO has bunbled together, in a single declaration, \nfour sets of fundamental rights--the core labor standards embodying the \nbroad principles that are essential to membership in the ILO. Having \ndeclared that those rights are fundamental, the document then provides \nfor a monitoring system--a ``follow-up'' mechanism, to use the ILO's \nterm--to determine how countries are complying with these elemental \nworker rights.\n  The four sets of fundamental rights are: (1) Freedom of association \nand the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; \n(2) the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labor; (3) the \neffective abolition of child labor; and (4) the elimination of \ndiscrimination in respect of employment and occupation.\n  These rights flow directly from three sources. First, from the ILO \nConstitution itself, which was drafted by a commission headed by Samuel \nGompers of the American Federation of Labor and became, in 1919, part \nXIII of the Treaty of Versailles. Second, from the immensely important \nDeclaration of Philadelphia, which reaffirmed, at the height of World \nWar II, the fundamental principles of the ILO, including freedom of \nexpression and association and the importance of equal opportunity and \neconomic security. Adopted in 1944, the Declaration of Philadelphia was \nformally annexed to the ILO Constitution two years later. And, not \nleast, these four groups of core labor standards flow from the seven \nILO conventions that are recognized as Core Human Rights Conventions.\n  These seven conventions are not the highly technical agreements that \nmake up the vast majority of the ILO's 181 conventions. Rather, they \ndirectly address the rights of working people.\n  They are:\n  No. 29--the Forced Labor Convention of 1930;\n  No. 87--the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right; to \nOrganize Convention, 1948;\n  No. 98--the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention, \n1949;\n  No. 100--the Equal Remuneration Convention of 1951;\n  No. 105--the Abolition of Forced Labor Convention, 1957;\n  No. 111--the Discrimination in Employment and Occupation Convention \nof 1958; and\n  No. 138--the Minimum Age Convention of 1973.\n  They are extraordinary conventions. The Social Summit in Copenhagen \nin\n\n[[Page S6908]]\n\n1995 identified six of these ILO conventions as essential to ensuring \nhuman rights in the workplace: Nos. 29, 87, 98, 100, 105, and 111. The \nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has classified them \nas ``International Human Rights Conventions.'' The Governing Body of \nthe ILO subsequently added to the list of core conventions Convention \nNo. 138, the minimum age convention, in recognition of the importance \nof matters relating to child labor. These conventions embody the broad \nprinciples that are basic to membership in the ILO.\n  But what makes this year's Declaration so significant, Mr. President, \nis its second component--the monitoring mechanism, the element that \nwill, if implemented properly, ensure that something will come of all \nthis. For example, the follow-up mechanism will take a look at how \nChina is doing on prison labor, how Pakistan is doing on child labor, \nhow the United States performs with respect to freedom of association. \nYes, we will be examined, too.\n  I spoke to the Senate at some length about this matter during our \ndebate last Fall on the fast track legislation. Indeed, the fast track \nbill that the Finance Committee reported to the floor contained an \nexplicit endorsement--which was included in the Administration's draft \nproposal at this Senator's suggestion--of the ILO's efforts in this \nregard. That section of the Committee's bill, S. 1269, reads as \nfollows:\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to reinforce the \n     trade agreements process by--promoting respect for worker's \n     rights by--(ii) seeking to establish in the International \n     Labor Organization . . . a mechanism for the systematic \n     examination of, and reporting on, the extent to which ILO \n     members promote and enforce the freedom of association, the \n     right to organize and bargain collectively, a prohibition on \n     the use of forced labor, a prohibition on exploitative child \n     labor, and a prohibition on discrimination in employment. . . \n     .\n\n  In January of this year, I traveled to Geneva to discuss this new \ninitiative with ILO Director General Michel Hansenne and his deputies. \nI did so because I believe that this new Declaration has great \npotential. Its monitoring mechanism could evolve into an effective tool \nfor upgrading global compliance with these core labor standards. I have \nargued that the monitoring system ought to include inspections, an idea \nthat could gain acceptance over time.\n\n  The ILO is the only League of Nations organization that has survived \ninto the era of the United Nations. It arose at a time when the idea of \nsending inspectors into a country to see whether that country was \nkeeping an agreement would have been thought much too radical. That all \nchanged in the aftermath of World War II, with the creation of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency in 1957.\n  With the IAEA, inspections have become established practice over a \nrange of international concerns and international organizations, \nincluding the ILO. Although not explicitly provided for in the ILO \nConstitution, several ``inspection'' mechanisms have in fact evolved in \nthe organization since the early 1960's. Two are of particular note. \nILO Commissions of Inquiry, which investigate members' compliance with \nratified conventions in accordance with Article 26 of the ILO \nConstitution, have conducted on-site investigations since 1961. And the \nspecial procedures established under the ILO for examining matters \nrelating to freedom to association have, since 1965, included on-site \ninspections. Thus it would seem reasonable to suggest that such \ninspections might eventually be an effective means of reviewing \ncountries' compliance with core labor standards. With this Declaration \nand its follow-up mechanism, we have a very good beginning.\n  In fact, this new Declaration and its follow-up mechanism might just \nbe the key to getting our international trade policy back on track. \nLast November, the trade policy that has guided this country for the \npast 64 years--since the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934--was \ncalled sharply into question when the Congress considered the \nreauthorization of the so-called ``fast track'' negotiating authority \nfor trade agreements. After a promising start in the Senate, where two \nprocedural votes demonstrated strong support for the measure (68 votes \nin favor, including a solid majority on both sides of the aisle), the \neffort foundered in the House when it became clear that there were not \nenough votes to pass it.\n  One of the central issues that surfaced during that debate was \nwhether trade agreements should include provisions--in effect, \nstatutory requirements--concerning labor and the environment.\n  At first, this might should like a good idea. Upon reflection, \nhowever, it simply will not work. Developing countries will not accept \nthe proposition that they must reduce their tariff and non-tariff \nbarriers (discriminatory product standards, import licensing \nrequirements, and the like) and, at the same time, willingly adopt \nstricter environmental and labor standards. Their reaction is \nunderstable: they view such proposals as putting them at a double \ndisadvantage--lowering their protection against foreign goods and at \nthe same time increasing their production costs, thus eroding their \ncompetitive advantages.\n  The ILO has a role to play here. Indeed, it was created in 1919 for \nthe express purpose of providing an avenue for governments that wanted \nto do something to improve labor standards, but were reluctant to do so \nunilaterally because they feared it would put them at a competitive \ndisadvantage in world commerce.\n  For 79 years, the ILO has sought to address these matters. Certainly \nboth President Roosevelt and his Secretary of Labor, Frances Perkins, \nunderstood well the connection between the ILO and our trade policies, \nhaving launched both the Reciprocal Trade Agreements program and the \nUnited States' membership in the ILO--two parallel but distinct \nmeasures--in the same year, 1934.\n  The ILO is the one League of Nations organization that we were least \nlikely ever to join, and the only one we did. Even so, the United \nStates has never been an active ratifier of international labor \nconventions. Of the 181 ILO conventions agreed thus far, the United \nStates has ratified only 12. Indeed, until 1988, the United States had \nonly ratified 7 conventions--6 maritime and one technical--the seventh \nconvention having been ratified in 1953. Then an interval of more than \n35 years with no action on the subject.\n  In 1988, however, a new era commenced: the United States began to \nratify substantive labor conventions. Altogether, the United States has \napproved five ILO conventions since 1988:\n  Convention No. 144, the 1976, convention on Tripartite Consultation \non International Labor Standards, which approved by the Senate on \nFebruary 1, 1998; Convention No. 147, the Merchant Shipping Convention \non Minimum Standards, adopted in 1976, and approved by the Senate \nFebruary 1, 1988; Convention No. 160 on Labor Statistics, adopted by \nthe ILO in 1985 and approved by the United States Senate on February \n20, 1990; Convention No. 105, the Abolition of Forced Labor Convention \nof 1957, which the Senate approved on May 14, 1991; and Convention No. \n150 on Labor Administration, adopted by the ILO in 1978, and approved \nby the Senate on October 6, 1994.\n\n  I was the floor manager for four of these. In all five conventions, \nwe lost the votes of only two Senators on the floor: both on Convention \nNo. 144 regarding tripartite consultation. The other four conventions \npassed unanimously. Most notable was the Senate's ratification in 1991, \nby a vote of 97-0, of the first of the ``core'' human rights \nconventions--Convention No. 105 on the Abolition of Forced Labor \n(1957), an area where the ILO has made vital contributions.\n  As the President announced May 18th, in his historic address to the \nWorld Trade Organization at the commemoration of the 50th anniversary \nof the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, he has now transmitted \nto the Senate for ratification a second ``core'' convention--Convention \nNo. 111, the Discrimination in Employment and Occupation Convention of \n1958, which calls for a national policy to eliminate discrimination in \naccess to employment, training and working conditions.\n  It may be that there is new life in the ILO, that we have entered a \nperiod in which we can look to the ILO for leadership as the United \nStates and our trading partners reap the rewards--and adjust to the \nchallenges--of globalization. In the area of worker rights, the ILO \nought to be the place to do it. To remind the Senate, the World\n\n[[Page S6909]]\n\nTrade Organization, at the conclusion of its first ministerial meeting \nin Singapore in December 1996, reaffirmed that the ILO was the \n``competent body'' to set and deal with internationally recognized core \nlabor standards. The Director-General of the WTO, Renato Ruggiero, with \nwhom I discussed the ILO initiative at length in January, has lent his \nstrong support. As Ambassador Ruggiero put it in a speech in Bonn on \nDecember 9, 1997, the WTO's members agreed at Singapore that ``the ILO \nwas the relevant body where the issue of labor standards should be \naddressed.'' He noted:\n\n       The fact that the ILO is now making important strides in \n     these areas demonstrates, not only that consensus on the most \n     difficult issues is possible, but that consensus is \n     absolutely critical to real and lasting progress. Supporting \n     the current efforts in the ILO toward reaching a declaration \n     on Fundamental Workers Rights is the best way of \n     demonstrating that the real objective is to promote labor \n     standards and not to seek protectionist measures.\n\n  It is possible, Mr. President, that this new Declaration on \nFundamental Principles and Rights at Work, together with its monitoring \nprovisions, will give new energy to the ILO at a time when new energy \nand direction are sorely needed to guide us out of the muddle in which \nwe find ourselves with respect to trade.\n  I offer my great congratulations to Secretary Herman, to John J. \nSweeney, President of the AFL-CIO, and to Abraham Katz, President of \nthe U.S. Council for International Business for this singular \nachievement, and I ask that the full text of the declaration and its \nfollow-up mechanism, as well as the text of Secretary Herman's \nstatement, be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n    International Labour Conference--86th Session Geneva, June 1998\n\n\n      ilo declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work\n\n       Whereas the ILO was founded in the conviction that social \n     justice is essential to universal and lasting peace;\n       Whereas economic growth is essential but not sufficient to \n     ensure equity, social progress and the eradication of \n     poverty, confirming the need for the ILO to promote strong \n     policies, justice and democratic institutions;\n       Whereas the ILO should, now more than ever, draw upon all \n     its standard-setting, technical cooperation and research \n     resources in all its areas of competence, in particular \n     employment, vocational training and working conditions, to \n     ensure that, in the context of a global strategy for economic \n     and social development, economic and social policies are \n     mutually reinforcing components in order to create broad-\n     based sustainable development;\n       Whereas the ILO should give special attention to the \n     problems of persons with special social needs, particularly \n     the unemployed and migrant workers, and mobilize and \n     encourage international, regional and national efforts aimed \n     at resolving their problems, and promote effective policies \n     aimed at job creation;\n       Whereas, in seeking to maintain the link between social \n     progress and economic growth, the guarantee of fundamental \n     principles and rights at work is of particular significance \n     in that it enables the persons concerned to claim freely and \n     on the basis of equality of opportunity their fair share of \n     the wealth which they have helped to generate, and to achieve \n     fully their human potential;\n       Whereas the ILO is the constitutionally mandated \n     international organization and the competent body to set and \n     deal with international labour standards, and enjoys \n     universal support and acknowledgement in promoting \n     fundamental rights at work as the expression of its \n     constitutional principles;\n       Whereas it is urgent, in a situation of growing economic \n     interdependence, to reaffirm the immutable nature of the \n     fundamental principles and rights embodied in the \n     Constitution of the Organization and to promote their \n     universal application;\n       The International Labour Conference,\n       1. Recalls: (a) that in freely joining the ILO, all Members \n     have endorsed the principles and rights set out in its \n     Constitution and in the Declaration of Philadelphia, and have \n     undertaken to work towards attaining the overall objectives \n     of the Organization to the best of their resources and fully \n     in line with their specific circumstances; (b) that these \n     principles and rights have been expressed and developed in \n     the form of specific rights and obligations in Conventions \n     recognized as fundamental both inside and outside the \n     Organization.\n       2. Declares that all Members, even if they have not \n     ratified the Conventions in questions, have an obligation \n     arising from the very fact of membership in the Organization, \n     to respect, to promote and to realize, in good faith and in \n     accordance with the Constitution, the principles concerning \n     the fundamental rights which are the subject of those \n     Conventions, namely: (a) freedom of association and the \n     effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; \n     (b) the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory \n     labour; (c) the effective abolition of child labour; and (d) \n     the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment \n     and occupation.\n       3. Recognizes the obligation on the Organization to assist \n     its Members in response to their established and expressed \n     needs, in order to attain these objectives by making full use \n     of its constitutional, operational and budgetary resources, \n     including by the mobilization of external resources and \n     support, as well as by encouraging other international \n     organizations with which the ILO has established relations, \n     pursuant to article 12 of its Constitution, to support these \n     efforts: (a) by offering technical cooperation and advisory \n     services to promote the ratification and implementation of \n     the fundamental Conventions; (b) by assisting those Members \n     not yet in a position to ratify some or all of these \n     Conventions in their efforts to respect, to promote and to \n     realize the principles concerning fundamental rights which \n     are the subject of those Conventions; and (c) by helping the \n     Members in their efforts to create a climate for economic and \n     social development.\n       4. Decides that, to give full effect to this Declaration, a \n     promotional follow-up, which is meaningful and effective, \n     shall be implemented in accordance with the measures \n     specified in the annex hereto, which shall be considered as \n     an integral part of this Declaration.\n       5. Stresses that labour standards should not be used for \n     protectionist trade purposes, and that nothing in this \n     Declaration and its follow-up shall be invoked or otherwise \n     used for such purposes; in addition, the comparative \n     advantage of any country should in no way be called into \n     question by this Declaration and its follow-up.\n\n                                 Annex\n\n                      Follou-up to the Declaration\n\n\n                           i. overall purpose\n\n       1. The aim of the follow-up described below is to encourage \n     the efforts made by the Members of the Organization to \n     promote the fundamental principles and rights enshrined in \n     the Constitution of the ILO and the Declaration of \n     Philadelphia and reaffirmed in this Declaration.\n       2. In line with this objective, which is of a strictly \n     promotional nature, this follow-up will allow the \n     identification of areas in which the assistance of the \n     Organization through its technical cooperation activities may \n     prove useful to its Members to help them implement these \n     fundamental principles and rights. It is not a substitute for \n     the established supervisory mechanisms, nor shall it impede \n     their functioning; consequently, specific situations within \n     the purview of those mechanisms shall not be examined or re-\n     examined within the framework of this follow-up.\n       3. The two aspects of this follow-up, described below, are \n     based on existing procedures: the annual follow-up concerning \n     non-ratified fundamental Conventions will entail merely some \n     adaptation of the present modalities of application of \n     article 19, paragraph 5(e) of the Constitution; and the \n     global report will serve to obtain the best results from the \n     procedures carried out pursuant to the Constitution.\n\n\n  ii. annual follow-up concerning non-ratified fundamental conventions\n\n                          A. Purpose and scope\n\n       1. The purpose is to provide an opportunity to review each \n     year, by means of simplified procedures to replace the four-\n     year review introduced by the Governing Body in 1995, the \n     efforts made in accordance with the Declaration by Members \n     which have not yet ratified all the fundamental Conventions.\n       2. The follow-up will cover each year the four areas of \n     fundamental principles and rights specified in the \n     Declaration.\n\n                             B. Modalities\n\n       1. The follow-up will be based on reports requested from \n     Members under article 19, paragraph 5(e) of the Constitution. \n     The report forms will be drawn up so as to obtain information \n     from governments which have not ratified one or more of the \n     fundamental Conventions, on any changes which may have taken \n     place in their law and practice, taking due account of \n     article 23 of the Constitution and established practice.\n       2. These reports, as compiled by the Office, will be \n     reviewed by the Governing Body.\n       3. With a view to presenting an introduction to the reports \n     thus compiled, drawing attention to any aspects which might \n     call for a more in-depth discussion, the Office may call upon \n     a group of experts appointed for this purpose by the \n     Governing Body.\n       4. Adjustments to the Governing Body's existing procedures \n     should be examined to allow Members which are not represented \n     on the Governing Body to provide, in the most appropriate \n     way, clarifications which might prove necessary or useful \n     during Governing Body discussions to supplement the \n     information contained in their reports.\n\n\n                           iii. global report\n\n                          A. Purpose and scope\n\n       1. The purpose of this report is to provide a dynamic \n     global picture relating to each category of fundamental \n     principles and rights noted during the preceding four-year \n     period, and to serve as a basis for assessing the \n     effectiveness of the assistance provided by the Organization, \n     and for determining priorities for the following period, in \n     the form of action plans for technical cooperation designed \n     in particular to mobilize the internal\n\n[[Page S6910]]\n\n     and external resources necessary to carry them out.\n       2. The report will cover, each year, one of the four \n     categories of fundamental principles and rights in turn.\n\n                             B. Modalities\n\n       1. The report will be drawn up under the responsibility of \n     the Director-General on the basis of official information, or \n     information gathered and assessed in accordance with \n     established procedures. In the case of States which have not \n     ratified the fundamental Conventions, it will be based in \n     particular on the findings of the aforementioned annual \n     follow-up. In the case of Members which have ratified the \n     Conventions concerned, the report will be based in particular \n     on reports as dealt with pursuant to article 22 of the \n     Constitution.\n       2. This report will be submitted to the Conference for \n     tripartite discussion as a report of the Director-General. \n     The Conference may deal with this report separately from \n     reports under article 12 of its Standing Orders, and may \n     discuss it during a sitting devoted entirely to this report, \n     or in any other appropriate way. It will then be for the \n     Governing Body, at an early session, to draw conclusions from \n     this discussion concerning the priorities and plans of action \n     for technical cooperation to be implemented for the following \n     four-year period.\n\n\n                       iv. it is understood that:\n\n       1.

The Conference shall, in due course, review the \n     operation of this follow-up in the light of the experience \n     acquired to assess whether it has adequately fulfilled the \n     overall purpose articulated in Part I.\n       The foregoing is the ILO Declaration on Fundamental \n     Principles and Rights at Work and its Follow-up duly adopted \n     by the General Conference of the International Labour \n     Organization during its Eighty-sixth Session which was held \n     at Geneva and declared closed the 18 June 1998.\n       IN FAITH WHEREOF we have appended our signatures this \n     nineteenth day of June 1998.\n\n                              The President of the Conference,\n\n                                       The Director-General of the\n     International Labour Office.\n                                  ____\n\n       ``This is a big step forward for the ILO and its members as \n     we enter the 21st Century. With the passage of this \n     Declaration, the ILO has underlined and clarified the \n     importance of the fundamental rights of workers in an era of \n     economic globalization. It firmly demonstrates that we can \n     and will move forward in an effort to see trade and labor \n     concerns as mutually supportive--not mutually exclusive.\n       As we have said and as President Clinton stated in his \n     speech to the World Trade Organization on May 18, we must \n     continue to forge a working relationship between the ILO and \n     the WTO. We continue to see it as vitally important to a \n     strengthened trading system that we advance the effort to \n     protect basic workers rights. That remains our policy and our \n     commitment.\n       This Declaration and its follow-up procedure furthers our \n     abilities to pursue these objectives. Nothing in this \n     Declaration restricts our ability to advance together the \n     liberalization of international trade and the protection of \n     basic worker rights. As the ILO has stated, the Declaration \n     does not impose any restrictions in this regard on members.\n       It is also clear, with this recommitment to core values, \n     that the ILO members have accepted the need to be \n     accountable. And with this action, there will now be a \n     process within the ILO to demonstrate that accountability.\n       I was honored to be a part of this historic ILO meeting and \n     to work with my colleagues to adopt this crucial Declaration \n     that outlines a vision for the next century for this \n     organization. Clearly we proved in these weeks in Geneva, \n     that a consensus can be reached among governments and between \n     employer and worker groups.\n       There were long and difficult negotiations over this \n     Declaration, but I was always confident about the outcome \n     because, from the beginning, there was a consensus among us, \n     a shared objective and an historical obligation to do what we \n     have done.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/23/senate-section/article/S6907-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6910-S6911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                UNSHACKLE LEADERS OF AMERICA'S EDUCATION\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the results of the 1998 Stanford \n9 tests--better known as the SAT's--are now available. Overall, the \nresults are dismal. No matter what improvements may be noted here and \nthere, the bottom-line numbers reveal a failing education system that \nshortchanges the students and parents who rely upon it.\n  In each of the four categories of performance--below basic, basic, \nproficient, and advanced, the story is the same. As a group, the kids \nfall farther behind as they progress through the system. That's the \ncase with regard to both math skills and reading.\n  That disturbing news is all the more reason for those of us who are \ncommitted to structural reform of this country's schools to redouble \nour efforts, especially in providing education alternatives for low-\nincome families.\n  In the process, we should not overlook the need for sound management \nin our schools. Indeed, managerial reforms, implemented on the State \nand local level, will be crucial to the success of education reform. \nThat is the point made by Donald Bedell, Chairman of the Bedell Group \nand a long-time consultant in management and organizational structure \nfor major corporations.\n  Mr. Bedell has outlined his thinking along those lines in a brief \npaper that exhorts Congress to ``unshackle leaders of American \neducation.'' His insights are on target, and I ask that they be printed \nin the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                Unshackle Leaders of America's Education\n\n       The never-ending and often contentious national debate over \n     the future course of public education disguises the negative \n     impact excessive administrative control exerts on student \n     academic achievement. How?\n       It concentrates on finding ``solutions'' in Washington and \n     in state capitols, year after year after year, for each of \n     the endless number of individual school functions that yearn \n     for assistance. Yet, bureaucracies in all four management \n     levels unnecessarily complicate and slow decision-making, \n     cause costs to rise, burden classroom teachers with \n     intolerable administrative burdens, and share responsibility \n     for student academic scores that have stayed flat for a \n     generation. The overhang of irresponsible mandates continues \n     to plague efficient management efforts.\n       A detailed study of Indianapolis public schools budgets \n     (IPS) by the Friedman Foundation, for example, indicated that \n     annual cost per student was $9,886, (double the U.S. \n     average), school enrollment between 1990 and 1996 dropped \n     from 52,000 to 43,000, while administrative costs rose from \n     $370 to $500 per pupil and little more than 30% of its budget \n     paid for teacher salaries. Its student scholastic record, \n     compared to state, national and IPS results, an average of \n     10% below the national average, 25% below the state results \n     and 35% below the Catholic school average in Indianapolis.\n       It seems clear that The Friedman Foundation, and Mayor \n     Goldsmith, believe that the IPS current condition demands a \n     thorough management restructuring including reduction of \n     administrative overhead, including additional voucher \n     programs and turning over several dozen non-education \n     support services to private sector contractors. On any \n     professional cost-benefit analysis, development of \n     effective managers and leaders wins by an overwhelming \n     margin.\n       Meanwhile, attention of many leaders has been diverted from \n     focusing on laying the foundation, and nurturing it, for more \n     efficient school organization structures at all four levels--\n     each state, local school boards, district superintendents and \n     school principals. They are the management ``balance wheel'' \n     function that must be charged with primary responsibility for \n     improved education--not Congress, not the Education \n     Secretary, not the President.\n       Those four entities alone bear the total responsibility to \n     deliver an improving body of high school graduates--not \n     curriculum experts, not standards experts, not teacher \n     selection experts, not police surveillance of students. On \n     the quality of public school leadership and management, as in \n     the business community, rests the future of public schools, \n     in the words of the Educational Research Service as early as \n     1992.\n       Unfortunately, organization and management matters are \n     still viewed by some as an overpowering, fearsome, \n     inscrutable, unchanging and monolithic structure manipulated \n     by unknown backroom shadowy characters. Nonetheless this \n     command and control management culture survived world wide \n     for 100 years! Initiated by the King of Prussia in the 1880s, \n     it has served America's military and business organizations \n     well through wars, depressions, industrial revolutions and \n     bloody foreign revolutions. It got the job done and brought a \n     successful conclusion to World War II that left America at \n     the top of the heap in international economic and political \n     affairs.\n       But, beginning in the 1960s, the emergence of the most \n     stunning and enormous revolutions in the volume and depth of \n     all scientific inquiry, improved product manufacturing, \n     expanded global trade and investment, and vast communications \n     demands, swamped business operations. It forced business \n     management to devise new operational procedures that adjusted \n     to this new reality. It demanded a new flexibility to manage \n     the data, and, to provide opportunities for individuals to \n     increase their contributions to a more productive society.\n       Organization structure became organic and specific to each \n     institution and its purpose. In business historian Alfred \n     Chandler's words, ``Structure follows strategy. But it must \n     be flexible to allow for changes. Organization design and \n     structure require thinking, analysis and a systemic approach. \n     The new organization paradigm turns a monumental relic of the \n     past into a living current organism.''\n       What are the dynamics of such new flexible structures? \n     Maximize personal and financial resources. In Peter Drucker's \n     words, leaders can't allow organization structure to remain \n     static, or ``just evolve. The only things that\n\n[[Page S6911]]\n\n     evolve are disorder, friction, malperformance.\n       What then is the driving force of strategy and tactics? \n     Recognition that all institutions, including public \n     education, are subject to competition. There is no specific \n     structure to strategy development that leaders should follow. \n     But not until a decision is made at the top of the four \n     levels of management to construct a well-articulated purpose, \n     and then to accept discovering, understanding, documenting, \n     and exploiting insights as a means to create more value than \n     competing organizations, can be solid basis of strategy be \n     laid.\n       Would the education sector face the sometimes painful \n     adjustments of restructuring as the private sector? Not \n     necessarily. Once a long range schedule and target \n     established, the time frame could extend over 5 or even 10 \n     years, taking advantage of personnel attrition and \n     retirements and the influx of new students. Firing 30% of the \n     District of Columbia central office, announced recently, in \n     one fell swoop, could easily be avoided except in severe \n     financial crises.\n       What are possible Congressional education strategies?\n       (1) Encourage state governments to unshackle state \n     education leaders by deregulating school boards and by re-\n     invigorating school district superintendents, school boards, \n     principals, and teachers by releasing them from state \n     mandates, statutes, rules and regulations, as former Motorola \n     Chairman Galvin suggested.\n       (2) Promote an ``Executive Scholarship Fund'' for 3,000 \n     eligible education sector managers at various levels each \n     education year, for 5 years, for training in business \n     management practices. The cost? At $5,000 each, maximum cost \n     would amount to $15 million to be borne 20% by grantees, or a \n     net $12 million.\n       (3) Promote a ``Teacher's Management Improvement Fund,'' \n     for 12,000 eligible teachers each school year for 5 years @ \n     $1500 for a total of $18 million to be borne 20% by grantees \n     or a net of $14.4 million.\n       (4) Continue to consider funding a wide variety of \n     education programs to states and local entities, despite \n     continuing evidence that student academic remains flat or \n     worse.\n       (5) Withhold support for a $22 billion 2-year federal \n     funding program for local school building programs, and a $12 \n     billion plan over 7 years to hire 100,000 teachers as \n     proposed by the President.\n       On any credible professional measurement, the development \n     of effective managers and leaders wins by an overwhelming \n     vote. They can and do make mistakes, but without them, \n     society wanders about in an amorphous atmosphere of confusion \n     and indecision--without positive results. Such an environment \n     would contribute nothing to the development of \n     America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/23/senate-section/article/S6910-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6911-S6912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE U.S. COAST GUARD AUXILIARY\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to call the attention of \nmy colleagues to the distinguished record of the United States Coast \nGuard Auxiliary, which today marks its 59th year of operation.\n  Most of us know this fine group of men and women only as the civilian \narm of the Coast Guard--a volunteer group of friends and neighbors who \noffer safe boating and navigation classes, and perform courtesy \ninspections to ensure that our boats are equipped the way they should \nbe.\n  However, Mr. President, there is far more to the Auxiliary. The \nAuxiliary was formed when the clouds of war threatened all the \ncivilized world, and when war came to the United States, the members of \nthe Auxiliary served their country well.\n  Recently, the commander of United States Coast Guard Group San \nFrancisco, Captain Larry Hall, spoke to Auxiliary Flotilla 5-7 on the \n55th anniversary of its formation. His address is a capsule history of \nthe Auxiliary in general, and of San Francisco's ``Diablo'' flotilla as \na specific example, as well as a look at how the Auxiliary and the \nactive-duty Coast Guard work together to keep Americans safe.\n  Mr. President, I ask to have Captain Hall's remarks printed in the \nRecord.\n  The remarks follow:\n\nRemarks to Commemorate the 55th Anniversary of ``Diablo'' Flotilla 5-7 \n                         Coast Guard Auxiliary\n\n                  (By Captain Lawrence A. Hall, USCG).\n\n       Immediate Past District Commodore Marilyn McBain, Vice \n     Commodore Mike Maddox, District Rear Commodore Jack O'Neill, \n     Flotilla Commander Bill Graham, Members of Diablo Flotilla 5-\n     7, fellow members of Team Coast Guard, and friends:\n       You have honored me with the kind invitation to speak to \n     you on this special occasion * * * to share this important \n     piece of Coast Guard History--of the Coast Guard Auxiliary \n     and the role Flotilla 5-7 played in it. Needless to say, the \n     Auxiliary has been an important part of our Service's history \n     during this century, and as an active-duty Coast Guard \n     member, I'm honored to be associated with you all.\n       I realize that many of you here tonight have personal \n     memories of World War II, and that some of you served our \n     country with distinction during those years of trial for our \n     nation. Of course, I'm but a youngster, and wasn't even a \n     gleam in my parents' eye until nine years after the war \n     ended! I don't share any of those memories, and had to borrow \n     from someone else. So, before I get too far along in talking \n     about the Auxiliary's early years, let me credit Malcolm \n     Willoughby's book The Coast Guard in World War II, published \n     in 1957 by the U.S. Naval Institute. It's an excellent \n     reference.\n       Let me start at the beginning * * * The forerunner of the \n     Coast Guard Auxiliary, originally called the Coast Guard \n     Reserve, was created on June 23, 1939. Its missions were to:\n       Promote safety of life at sea and upon navigable waters,\n       Disseminate information relating to the laws, rules and \n     regulations concerning motorboats and yachts,\n       Distribute information and knowledge concerning the \n     operation and yachts, and,\n       Cooperate with the Coast Guard\n       It seems that we were just yesterday celebrating the \n     Auxiliary's 50th anniversary--I know we're not getting any \n     older, but shudder to think that somehow time's flown, and \n     next year we'll actually be celebrating the Auxiliary's 60th!\n       To continue * * * With war underway in Europe, on February \n     19, 1941, Congress passed the Auxiliary and Reserve Act. The \n     Act in effect created a real military Coast Guard Reserve as \n     we have today, added the uniformed but unpaid Coast Guard \n     Temporary Reserve, and gave you, the civilian arm of the \n     Coast Guard, your present name. Then war broke out * * * and \n     you jumped into action. I've read that Seattle flotillas \n     actually commenced patrols on the evening following the Pearl \n     Harbor Attack. Many patrols were quickly established \n     elsewhere, with Auxiliarists putting in countless hours \n     patrolling in their own vessels. By June 1942 the Auxiliary \n     had grown to about 11,500 people, with 9,500 boats organized \n     into 44 flotillas.\n       At first any Auxiliary member could volunteer the services \n     of his boat, himself, and crew for temporary service in the \n     Temporary Reserve. In this way, the Coast Guard drew on \n     trained Auxiliarists for the performance of regular Coast \n     Guard duties afloat on a military basis, and the Auxiliary \n     became chiefly a source of military supply.\n       The program for temporary reservist on full-time duty with \n     pay was originally established to aid the acquisition of \n     badly needed reserve boats and people from the Auxiliary \n     because the need for small craft in the early days was \n     extremely urgent. Men were enrolled for temporary duty for \n     specific periods such as three or five months, and usually \n     assigned to their own vessels. They were not transferred from \n     their particular boat or out of District. Their duty was \n     chiefly with the Coastal Picket Fleet from June through \n     November 1942, when this type of duty was discontinued.\n       As the war tempo increased and port security \n     responsibilities grew, the Coast Guard leadership realized \n     that the Auxiliary's civilian status prevented their \n     effective wartime use. Not only did Auxiliarists lack \n     military authority, but when going out on anti-submarine \n     warfare patrol, they risked, if captured, being executed as \n     spies! The need for militarization was obvious, the result \n     being that the majority of Auxiliarists were eventually \n     enrolled in the Coast Guard Temporary Reserve. This final \n     setup for the Temporary Reserve, enacted on 29 October 1942, \n     included Auxiliarists in a part-time no-pay status. The \n     Temporary Reserve gradually took over patrol responsibilities \n     from the Auxiliary, with Auxiliary patrols finally being \n     discontinued in 1 January 1943. In the various configurations \n     of the Temporary Reserve, the Auxiliary provided a nucleus of \n     men well-qualified in small boat handling, along with their \n     boats. This force, which by war's end numbered 30,000 \n     Temporary Reservists and 1,000 boats recruited from the \n     Auxiliary, allowed our more able-bodied men to be sent to the \n     combat theaters, and performed a service on the home front \n     which was vital to our national security.\n       So, it was in this context that the Diablo flotilla was \n     created in 1943. Though I don't have access to much in the \n     way of Flotilla historical records, your Flotilla Commander \n     Bill Graham tells me that, depending on how you count it, the \n     Diablo flotilla was either the sixth flotilla--or one of the \n     first nine flotillas--formed in the Northern Region of the \n     Eleventh District. I'm sure that your predecessors in this \n     Flotilla had a large part in patrolling the lower Sacramento \n     and San Joaquin Rivers as well as the upper San Francisco and \n     San Pablo Bays. People from Diablo Flotilla undoubtedly gave \n     their service to the Temporary Reserve, making a vital \n     contribution to the security of the Bay and Delta areas. I \n     have to think this was no insignificant task, given the \n     strategic sites at the Naval Weapons Station and Port \n     Chicago, Mare Island Naval Shipyard, and the oil refineries \n     of the area. This, and they still performed all their usual \n     boating safety functions.\n       Now I'll fast forward from the forties to modern times. \n     Flotilla 507 has been an active force in promoting safe \n     boating in the Delta. I note that:\n       In 1994, under Jack O'Neill's leadership, you were lauded \n     as the District Eleven (Northern Region) outstanding \n     flotilla.\n\n[[Page S6912]]\n\n       In 1996, with Michael Hays as Flotilla Commander, you were \n     given the award as Outstanding Flotilla in Division 5.\n       In 1997, led by Tim Martell, you collected two of seven \n     District awards for flotillas, for public affairs and for \n     highest number of vessel examinations.\n       Looking at recent Auxiliary Management Information System \n     (AUXMIS) reports, which I thank your Immediate Past Commodore \n     and District Staff Officer for Information Systems, Marilyn \n     McBain for making happen, I see you're still building good \n     numbers:\n       I see strength in your membership--77, which includes 14 \n     Auxiliary Operators!\n       I see strength in your public education: two Boating Skills \n     and Seamanship (BS) and three Sailing and Seamanship (S) \n     courses in 1996; four BS, one S and four Boating Safely \n     courses given in 1997; and 19 class sessions in various \n     courses given so far this year.\n       I see strength in your vessel examination program: 20 \n     examiners conducting 459 CME's in 1997, up from 210 in 1996--\n     and you've already completed 210 exams so far this year.\n       I see strength in your Marine Dealer Visit Program, with \n     between five and seven Marine Dealer Visitors making 66 \n     visits in 1996, 88 visits in 1997, and still building numbers \n     this year.\n       In these and all your other programs--Operations, Public \n     Affairs, Member Training--you show that the Diablo Flotilla \n     is active, is connecting with the public, is making a \n     difference. I hope you still have room on your trophy shelf, \n     since you'll no doubt be adding more ``hardware'' to it!\n       This brings us to today. I stand here as the Group \n     Commander within whose area of responsibility you spread the \n     gospel of safe boating. I'm here to tell you that I am your \n     partner in serving the public--the Coast Guard's customers in \n     the lower Delta and Suisun Bay. Our safety missions are \n     mutually dependent, and firmly linked together. Since taking \n     command of Group San Francisco last Summer, I have embarked \n     the Group on the strategy of community interaction. Yes, we \n     in the Group do exist to provide critical search and rescue \n     resources to the citizens of Central California and to \n     enforce Federal laws where necessary. But the greatest of our \n     missions is in protecting the safety of recreational boaters \n     in the area we serve. I see the recreational boater's life as \n     a continuum, starting when they buy and equip their vessel, \n     continuing hopefully with some good education. Then comes the \n     voyage, which usually, hopefully ends safely, but sometimes \n     ends in a search and rescue case or an adverse Coast Guard \n     boarding. In the past we at the Group dwelled too much on \n     that far end of the continuum, especially in our huge number \n     of law enforcement boardings--and I'm sure you read about it \n     in the local maritime press. Where I am guiding our efforts \n     now is to the start of that continuum--before the boater gets \n     underway. To that end, I've directed Group personnel to steer \n     their efforts at meeting and getting to know the boaters:\n       We're walking the docks, boat ramps, and marinas, seeing \n     the boaters with their vessels, answering their questions, \n     giving advice, steering them toward the products you offer--\n     vessel exams and boating safety courses.\n       We're making more public appearances: at boat shows, yacht \n     clubs, service clubs, and schools.\n       We're making friendly contacts with boaters on the water, \n     commending them for safe boating practices, for wearing their \n     personal floatation devices (PFDs), for being conscientious.\n       We're listening to the boaters, constantly looking for \n     better ways we can serve them.\n       Finally, to show my regard for your vessel exam program, I \n     have directed Coast Guard crews to not conduct random \n     boardings on recreational vessels showing a current Courtesy \n     Marine Examination sticker. We'll still board all vessels, \n     including those with current CMEs, any time we can articulate \n     a valid reason, such as for unsafe operation. But again, we \n     will not randomly board vessels showing the sticker--proof of \n     their commitment to equip their boats properly. I believe in \n     your vessel exam program, and want to give boaters all \n     possible motivation to let you aboard!\n       In all our efforts, while we won't ever give up our \n     responsibility to enforce boating safety law when necessary, \n     we're out to show the boating public that we're a partner \n     with them in maximizing success and enjoyment in their \n     boating experience. In face-to-face contact I want them to \n     see that we're real people, just like them, who have an \n     important job to do.\n       Now, here's where our fortunes really are linked. It's no \n     surprise that we all have been searching for good measures of \n     effectiveness in our boating safety programs--for ways that \n     we can relate our hours of effort into the desired outcome of \n     safer boating. Knowing that the Commandant has established a \n     goal that we save at least 90 percent of distressed boaters \n     after Coast Guard notification, I think we can make a \n     difference there. To that end, I am measuring the number of \n     person hours and personal contacts made by Group San \n     Francisco people. This hopefully will translate in the next \n     couple years to an increase in the number of people coming to \n     you for vessel examinations and registering for safe boating \n     courses--whether Coast Guard Auxiliary or U.S. Power \n     Squadron. Finally, increased vessel exams and boating course \n     students should translate to both a reduction in search and \n     rescue cases among recreational boaters and better outcomes \n     for the cases we do respond to. We're making the effort to \n     encourage boating safety, and hope that our future numbers \n     bear it out.\n       With this, I ask a couple things of you, the Diablo \n     Flotilla. First, keep up the great work. You've got a rich \n     tradition, going back to earliest days of the Auxiliary. \n     You've got the strength in numbers to keep it going. Second, \n     work to ensure that the quality of your vessel exam and \n     public education programs is second to none, along with your \n     Marine Dealer Visit Program, which is yet another way that we \n     can direct boaters to the services we offer. I'm depending on \n     it and I'm doing the same with the services that we in Group \n     San Francisco perform.\n       In closing, I'm extremely proud to call you partners, \n     members of Team Coast Guard and Team Group San Francisco. Be \n     proud of where your Flotilla has come from, of the missions \n     you've performed, and of your excellence yet to come. We'll \n     be there with you. May we all be--Semper Paratus. Thank you. \n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/23/senate-section/article/S6911-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RETIREMENT OF MR. A. GERALD ERICKSON\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few \nminutes today to recognize a gentleman who is retiring from a \ndistinguished career as President of the Chicago-based Metropolitan \nFamily Services, Mr. A. Gerald Erickson. In his 27 years as President \nof this valuable agency, Jerry Erickson has demonstrated an outstanding \nlevel of commitment to under-served families and individuals in \nChicago. Under his leadership, Metropolitan Family Services has a \nrecord of great accomplishments in improving the opportunities and \nquality of life for thousands of low-income Chicagoans.\n  In 1958, Jerry Erickson began his career with the agency, then known \nas United Charities, as a social worker fresh out of school and a two \nyear stint in the Army. After earning a Master's Degree in Social Work \nfrom the University of Chicago in 1960, Jerry remained with United \nCharities full time, and in 1971 became President.\n  Two and a half years ago, and a quarter of a century into Mr. \nErickson's tenure, United Charities changed its name to Metropolitan \nFamily Services. Through this and many other organizational changes \nover the years, Jerry Erickson has remained steadfastly committed to \nserving the under-privileged residents of the Chicago metropolitan \narea.\n  As Chicago's oldest and largest non-sectarian social services \norganization, Metropolitan Family Services provides services ranging \nfrom family counseling to financial education for more than 100,000 \nfamilies in the Chicago area. The agency operates on an annual budget \nof approximately $22 million, and has recently concluded a successful \n$15 million private fundraising campaign. The success of the \norganization can be attributed to the committed hard work of all of the \nagency's staff, and to great leadership from Jerry Erickson. Through \ntheir efforts, the agency's future will be bright and long-lasting.\n  Through out his career, Jerry Erickson has carried himself in a soft-\nspoken, modest manner which has led many of his colleagues in the field \nof social work to refer to him as the ``Jimmy Stewart of social \nservices.'' Now, in classic Jerry Erickson character, he is quietly \nretiring as the President of Metropolitan Family Services and is \npassing the reigns on to a successor he helped choose.\n  Those who know and work with Jerry Erickson should be heartened by \nhis promise to continue to work as a consultant to social service \nagencies. And Jerry's successor, Richard Jones, Ph.D., is highly \nqualified and committed to continuing and expanding the great work of \nMetropolitan Family Services.\n  Through his work with Metropolitan Family Services, as well as his \nparticipation and leadership in various national social services task \nforces, associations, and alliances, Jerry Erickson has well earned his \nreputation as a national leader in social work. Jerry Erickson's work \nis a model of service for all Americans to follow, and I commend his \nlasting commitment to serving the most vulnerable in our society.\n  On behalf of all the lives he has touched in his outstanding career \nwith Metropolitan Family Services, I want to thank him and wish him \ngood luck and Godspeed in all of his new endeavors.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/23/senate-section/article/S6912-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S6913]]\n              ALPHA SIGMA TAU CELEBRATES 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an \nimportant event that will take place in the state of Michigan. Alpha \nSigma Tau, a national sorority, will be celebrating its 100th \nanniversary this summer.\n  Alpha Sigma Tau was founded at Michigan State Normal College, (now \nEastern Michigan University) Yspilanti, Michigan on November 4, 1899. \nThe Founding Sisters were: Helene M. Rice, Adiance Rice, May Gephart, \nRuth Dutcher, Mayene Tracy, Eva O'Keefe, Mabel Chase and Harriet Marx. \nAlpha Sigma Tau aims to attract women of good character and spirit. One \nof the sororities' main goals is scholastic achievement.\n  Alpha Sigma Tau was nationalized in 1925. There are 59 active \ncollegiate chapters and 3 active existing colonies in the United \nStates. In 1949, the sorority became a National Panhellenic Council \nmember and was represented on the Executive Committee from 1979 until \n1985. Alpha Sigma Tau was honored to have a member serve as President \nfrom 1983-85. Alpha Sigma Tau National Foundation, founded in 1985, \noffers a wide variety of scholarships, awards, grants and loans to the \nsorority sisters. Additionally, the sorority contributes \nphilanthropically to several causes.\n  The celebration of the 100th anniversary will take place at the \nCentennial Convention at the Sheraton Inn in Ann Arbor, Michigan from \nTuesday, June 23 until Saturday, June 27. The celebration will include \nover 300 collegiate and alumnae women and their guests. Alpha Sigma Tau \nwill be presenting Eastern Michigan University with a gift to \ncommemorate the occasion. I extend my warmest regards to all who are \ninvolved with this celebration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/23/senate-section/article/S6913-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MRS. ELLIE MCNAMARA\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today with great pleasure to \nrecognize Mrs. Ellie McNamara for a career of exemplary service in \nVermont public schools. Her career spans four decades, beginning in \n1958 as a fourth grade teacher, and for the last 17 years as principal \nof the C.P. Smith primary school in Burlington. She will retire at the \nclose of this school year.\n  There is no better evidence than the work of Mrs. McNamara to the \ntruth of the adage, ``There is no substitute for a good teacher.''\n  The devotion with which she met the challenges of teaching and then \nas a principal won her the hearts and minds of students, faculty and \nparents alike. She has made a difference.\n  Even as she moves into retirement she continues to serve as a role \nmodel for all of us. I wish her well as she moves into the next stage \nof her life.\n  Marcelle and I have known Ellie McNamara, her husband Jim who is a \ndistinguished lawyer and her wonderful family for decades. Burlington \nand Vermont are proud of her and her family.\n  I ask that an article regarding her retirement from the Burlington \nFree Press be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, May 28, 1998]\n\n                      Retirement Is Principal Loss\n\n                            (By Anne Geggis)\n\n       Guests, gifts and tokens celebrating Ellie McNamara's 17 \n     years leading Burlington's C.P. Smith School keep pouring in \n     as the days of her career run out.\n       The message they all bring: Don't go.\n       Wednesday, community members ranging from kindergartners to \n     her now-grown students to Gov. Howard Dean gathered to admire \n     the longtime principal's accomplishments. Janet Breen, a \n     mother of three, wasn't the only wistful attendee.\n       ``She's a wonderful woman, wonderful,'' Breen said. ``I \n     wish she'd retire after my toddler left, but that would be 10 \n     years.''\n       Dean told the assembled crowd that McNamara is the reason \n     his kids are in Burlington schools. Faculty members got \n     teary-eyed talking of the fun she has brought to the New \n     North End elementary school.\n       ``It's a huge loss,'' sighed Leslie Kaigle, a School Board \n     member from the Old North End who has worked with McNamara on \n     school committees. ``Her connections with families, with \n     people . . .''\n       McNamara, however, remains firm that a career started in \n     1958 teaching his fourth-grade at the now-demolished Converse \n     School, should come to an end now.\n       ``You should leave while the audience is still clapping,'' \n     she said, flashing her trademark toothy smile.\n       The force of a personality that can memorize the names of \n     all 358 of her students and their siblings and parents, is \n     something to be reckoned with. In the space of a half hour \n     Wednesday, she examined a scraped knee, started a purple \n     fleece jacket on the road to a reunion with its owner and \n     watched more than 100 wriggling bodies during lunch.\n       There's a devilish side, too: She's been known to take her \n     hairdresser's phone calls before the superintendent's. \n     Holding a conversation with her requires that eyes remained \n     fixed on her. Look away for a moment and she's gone around a \n     corner. She's often quoted as saying, ``I've got to see you. \n     I'll be back on a minute.''\n       But ask what's planned for C.P. Smith's final assembly on \n     the last day of school, and the frenetic pace of this 62-\n     year-old grandmother of six stills.\n       ``The final assembly . . .'' she said, a catch in her \n     voice. Eyes suddenly turn misty. ``That's when . . . well, I \n     can't talk about it now.''\n       Linda Dion, who has been school secretary for 16 of \n     McNamara's 17 years, picked up where McNamara left off: ``At \n     the end of the assembly, the fifth-graders march out as we \n     sing the C.P. Smith song. This time, Ellie will be marching \n     out behind them.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/23/senate-section/article/S6913-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   IN RECOGNITION OF THE SESQUICENTENNIAL OF THE VILLAGE OF DIMONDALE\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nVillage of Dimondale, located in Eaton County, Michigan, which will \nhold its Sesquicentennial celebration from June 26-28, 1998.\n  Dimondale was established in 1848 by Isaac Dimond, a wealthy former \nNew York resident who had purchased 4,000 acres of land in Michigan in \n1837. Mr. Dimond and his wife, Sarah, left New York for his ``wild \nland'' in Michigan in 1840, after poor investments caused them to lose \nmost of their possessions. In 1848, Mr. Dimond built his house on \nJefferson Street, and the Dimondale School District was formed, \nsignifying the establishment of the community. Isaac Dimond founded \nseveral businesses in Dimondale, including a saw mill, a general store \nand a grist mill. In 1860, Isaac Dimond returned to New York, where he \ndied in 1862.\n  Today's residents of Dimondale are proud to celebrate the history and \nheritage of Isaac Dimond and the village he created 150 years ago. \nDuring the Sesquicentennial festivities, Dimondale residents are \nencouraged to dress in period clothing while participating in a family \npicnic and watching a baseball game featuring the Kent Base Ball Club \nof Grand Rapids, Michigan, which has been in existence for 130 years \nand which plays by the rules the game followed in the 1800s.\n  Mr. President, I know my colleagues will join me in congratulating \nthe residents of Dimondale, Michigan, on this special occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/23/senate-section/article/S6913-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6913-S6914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   JOEL BARLOW, DIPLOMAT AND PATRIOT\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to honor one of America's \nearliest diplomats and a distinguished native of Connecticut, Joel \nBarlow. On June 28, in a modest ceremony, a bronze biographical tablet \nwill be dedicated to Barlow in the churchyard of the tiny village of \nZarnowiec, Poland, where Barlow died and was laid to rest in 1812. The \nevent is organized and the tablet donated by the Joel Barlow Memorial \nFund, in cooperation with the American Center of Polish Culture and \nDACOR, Diplomatic and Consular Officers Retired (of the U.S. State \nDepartment).\n  Joel Barlow was born in 1754 and raised in Redding, Connecticut. His \nancestors were among the earliest settlers of the region. After \ngraduating from Yale University in 1778, he took an additional Divinity \ncourse and joined George Washington's army as a chaplain, serving for \nthree years until the end of the Revolution. He slipped home from his \narmy duties long enough to marry Ruth Baldwin, the sister of a Yale \nclassmate. They married in secret because of her father's initial \nobjection.\n  At the close of the war in 1782, the couple moved to Hartford, where \nBarlow helped publish the magazine ``American Mercury,'' writing \npolitical pamphlets, satires, and poetry. He was one of a group of \nsatirical writers, mostly Yale men, known as the ``Hartford Wits.'' At \nthat time, he also completed and published the first version of his \nAmerican verse epic, ``The Vision of Columbus.'' It is said that in \nthis work, he was the first writer in English\n\n[[Page S6914]]\n\nto use the words ``civil,'' ``civic,'' and ``civilization'' in their \nmodern senses. He also envisioned a future international council very \nmuch like today's United Nations, dedicated to peacekeeping, cultural \nexchange, and development of the arts.\n  In 1786, Barlow studied law and was admitted to the Bar. He worked as \na promoter for the Scioto Land Company. In 1788, Barlow went to Paris \nto promote the sale of the Scioto Land, a huge tract of Ohio wilderness \nopened by the government for settlement, to European emigrants. A large \ngroup of bourgeois French refugees traveled to Ohio to settle in the \nland, but the American promoters had not made any preparations for \ntheir reception, and they met terrible privations in the wilderness. By \nthe time Ruth joined her husband in Paris in 1790, American organizers \nof the Scioto company were exposed as profiteering frauds; Barlow, \nhowever, was proven innocent. The colony, called Gallipolis, survived \ndespite the hardships, but Barlow's reputation with his countrymen had \nbeen seriously damaged.\n  Barlow was in Paris during the fall of the Bastille on July 14, 1789. \nHe was a friend of Thomas Paine and other Revolutionary sympathizers, \nEnglish and American. He wrote his major tract ``Advice to the \nPrivileged Orders'' and his verse-satire ``The Conspiracy of Kings'' in \nLondon, where he and Ruth had gone to avoid the Jacobin disorders. The \n``Advice'' so offended the British government that it banned the book \nand tried to arrest Barlow, who fled into hiding in Paris. His ``Letter \nto the National Convention of France,'' a proposal for a new French \nconstitution, so impressed the Assembly delegates that in 1792, they \nmade him an honorary citizen of the new Republic, an honor he shared \nwith Washington, Hamilton, Madison, and Paine. In the final throes of \nthe Terror, when Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette were executed in 1793, \nBarlow was in southeast France helping organize the Savoy, newly \ncaptured from Italy, as a political division of the new Republic.\n  Fluent in French, sympathetic to the Republic, and successful in \nbusiness, the Barlows were popular with the reformers and \nintelligentsia, as well as such scientific innovators as the balloonist \nMontgolfier. They were also close to Robert Fulton, who arrived in \nFrance in 1797, and worked for some years on prototypes of his \nsteamboat, torpedo boat, and other engineering projects. Fulton later \ndid the illustrations for a large, handsome second version of Barlow's \nepic, heavily revised and retitled ``The Columbiad,'' published in \nPhiladelphia in 1807.\n  In 1796, during Washington's second term, Barlow resolved our first \nhostage crisis. He was sent to Algiers as consul to help with \nimplementation of our peace treaty with that state and to secure the \nrelease of over one hundred American seamen, some of whom had been held \ncaptive by Algerian corsairs since 1785. This required great patience \nand diplomatic skill on his part, not to mention payment of substantial \nsums to local officials, but he succeeded where others had failed. He \nstayed on as consul for a year after the hostages were freed before \nreturning to Paris in 1797.\n  After 18 years abroad, the Barlows returned to America in 1805, \nhoping to spend the rest of their lives at home. Thomas Jefferson \nwanted Barlow to write an American history, and in 1807, at Jefferson's \nurging, the Barlows moved to a house and small estate in Washington \nthat Barlow named Kalorama, ``beautiful view'' in Greek. However, in \n1811, President James Madison appointed Barlow as Minister to France. \nHis task was to negotiate for compensation for French damages to \nAmerican shipping and to make a trade treaty. Reluctant, but always \nready to serve his country, Barlow took his wife, as well as his nephew \nThomas as secretary, and returned to France in 1811. Once there, \nhowever, Barlow met nothing but delays because of Napoleon's wars in \nEurope.\n  Finally, the Emperor, engaged in a winter campaign against Russia, \nsummoned Barlow to meet with him in Poland, in Wilna (now Vilnius). But \nthe French armies were utterly defeated by the Russians and the winter. \nNapoleon fled south, ignoring his appointment. With Thomas, his staff, \nand other diplomats, Barlow fled through the freezing weather toward \nGermany to escape the pursuing Cossacks, missing Napoleon, who hurried \nstraight to France. Barlow died of pneumonia in Zarnowiec, between \nWarsaw and Krakow, on December 24, 1812. (There is a disagreement about \nthe date; the existing church tablet in Poland gives it as December \n26.) It took his nephew more than two weeks to bring news of his death \nto Ruth in Paris, and it was three months before the news reached \nAmerica. Joel Barlow was mourned widely in France, but back at home, \nPresident Madison was more distressed by the loss of the treaty than of \nthe man. Perhaps this diplomat, patriot, and man of letters had stayed \naway for too long.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/23/senate-section/article/S6913-4", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6914-S6915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO U.S. DISTRICT COURT JUDGE MATTHEW PERRY\n\n   Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of \nSouth Carolina's most beloved citizens and one of the nation's most \neminent jurists: U.S. District Court Judge Matthew Perry.\n  Matthew Perry grew up under ``Jim Crow,'' yet he overcame every \nbarrier to his betterment that society threw up. He relied on his \nloving and supportive family as well as his own inner strength, \nwholesome ambition, and unerring moral compass to persevere in the face \nof naked hatred and discrimination. As one South Carolina newspaper \nrecently noted, he ``had the benefits of good guidance and a good head, \nand the difficult challenge of growing up under a great adversity.''\n  Matthew Perry put this adversity to good use. ``Jim Crow'' forged his \ncharacter in steel, and his experience of unjust laws drove him to \ndevote his life to justice. Against long odds, and with much greater \neffort than that required of more privileged students, he obtained his \nlaw degree and set to work to tear down the structure of segregation in \nSouth Carolina.\n  As a lawyer in the 1960s, Matthew Perry was a leading figure in the \nCivil Rights Movement. He was instrumental in advancing black South \nCarolinians' rights and played a leading role in many important legal \ncases, particularly in defending civil rights activists who were \nprosecuted for their participation in non-violent demonstrations and \nsit-ins.\n  Among the significant cases Matthew Perry helped prepare and argue \nwere Edwards v South Carolina, in which the U.S. Supreme Court \nestablished important First Amendment protections for demonstrators; \nPeterson v City of Greenville, in which the Court enlarged the \njurisdiction of federal constitutional protections over premises that \nhad previously been considered outside federal anti-discrimination \nrules; and Newman v Piggie Pork Enterprises, one of the Court's \nearliest interpretations of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n  Mr. President, today it is difficult to appreciate the courage of \nMatthew Perry's convictions and devotion to the cause of civil rights \nfor black Americans. He worked long hours without pay, but money was \nthe least of his concerns. In the 1950s and '60s, his advocacy of equal \nrights for all and an end to segregation earned him the visceral hatred \nof many, and his activism sometimes placed his life in danger. Yet the \nlessons of his childhood served him well, and he endured threats and \ntaunts to triumph over a corrupt and fundamentally unjust system. In \nthe end, Matthew Perry's idealism, intelligence, and integrity helped \nput an end forever to segregation and to firmly establish the universal \nprinciple of equality for all.\n  Mr. President, it was my privilege to recommend to President Jimmy \nCarter that he nominate Matthew Perry to a seat on the U.S. District \nCourt in South Carolina. In 1979, Matthew Perry was officially \nappointed to the Court. He was the first and to date only black judge \non the Federal District Court in South Carolina.\n  As always, Judge Perry is a pioneer. His example is an inspiration \nnot just to black attorneys but to aspiring jurists of all classes and \nraces. His life proves that with courage, conviction, and hard work, \none can surmount even life's greatest challenges and contribute to \nsociety's lasting improvement.\n  Mr. President, Princeton University recently awarded Judge Perry an \nhonorary Doctor of Laws degree. This moment was one of great pride for \nJudge\n\n[[Page S6915]]\n\nPerry as well as for all South Carolinians. The citation which \naccompanied the degree is an eloquent tribute to Judge Perry's example \nand legacy. I ask that the Princeton University's tribute to Judge \nMatthew Perry be printed in the Record.\n  The tribute follows:\n\n                         Matthew J. Perry, Jr.\n\n\n                             Doctor of Laws\n\n       Senior United States District Judge South Carolina. Matthew \n     Perry was appointed in 1979 to the U.S. District Court by \n     President Carter and is the first and only African-American \n     in South Carolina history to hold that position. As a lawyer \n     during the 1960s he was a major force in the Civil Rights \n     Movement in South Carolina. He played a leading role in a \n     number of significant legal cases, especially to assist \n     activists who participated in sit-ins and other \n     demonstrations and who were being criminally prosecuted. \n     Among the cases he helped prepare were Edwards v. South \n     Carolina, in which the United States Supreme Court \n     established significant first amendment protections for \n     demonstrators; Peterson v. City of Greenville, in which the \n     Supreme Court enlarged the jurisdiction of federal \n     constitutional protections over premises that had previously \n     been thought to be outside federal antidiscrimination rules; \n     and Newman v. Piggie Pack Enterprises, one of the Supreme \n     Court's early interpretations of the Civil Rights Act of \n     1964. For many years he was the only lawyer available in \n     South Carolina to represent African-American defendants in \n     capital cases. South Carolina State University (B.S. 1948; \n     LL.B., 1951).\n       A pioneer whose tireless and skillful adovocacy helped \n     protect and propel the pioneering actions of others, he was \n     the leading attorney for the Civil Rights Movement in South \n     Carolina. Often without pay, he provided knowledgeable, \n     timely, and wise counsel to young activists we now rightly \n     view as heroes. Inside and outside the courtroom, his legal \n     acumen and his social vision helped to secure Constitutional \n     protections for such freedoms as speech and assembly, and \n     helped to replace discrimination with opportunity.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The messages of the President are as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, for advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, the Treaty Between the Government of the United States of \nAmerica and the Government of Niue on the Delimitation of a Maritime \nBoundary. The Treaty was signed in Wellington May 13, 1997. The report \nof the Department of State is enclosed for the information of the \nSenate.\n  The sole purpose of the Treaty is to establish a maritime boundary in \nthe South Pacific Ocean between the United States territory of American \nSamoa and Niue. The 279-mile boundary runs in a general east-west \ndirection, with the United States islands of American Samoa to the \nnorth, and Niue to the south. The boundary defines the limit within \nwhich the United States and Niue may exercise maritime jurisdiction, \nwhich includes fishery and other exclusive economic zone jurisdiction.\n  Niue is in free association with New Zealand. Although it is self-\ngoverning on internal matters, Niue conducts its foreign affairs in \nconjunction with New Zealand. Niue has declared, and does manage, its \nexclusive economic zone. Therefore, the United States requested, and \nreceived, confirmation from New Zealand that the Government of Niue had \nthe requisite competence to enter into this agreement with the United \nStates and to undertake the obligations contained therein.\n  I believe this Treaty to be fully in the interest of the United \nStates. It reflects the tradition of cooperation and close ties with \nNiue in this region. This boundary was never disputed.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthis Treaty and advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \n  The White House, June 23, 1998.\n                                  ____\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty Between the Government of \nthe United States of America and the Government of Belize for the \nReturn of Stolen Vehicles, with Annexes and Protocol, signed at \nBelmopan on October 3, 1996. I transmit also, for the information of \nthe Senate, the report of the Department of State with respect to the \nTreaty.\n  The Treaty is one of a series of stolen vehicle treaties being \nnegotiated by the United States in order to eliminate the difficulties \nfaced by owners of vehicles that have been stolen and transported \nacross international borders. When it enters into force, it will be an \neffective tool to facilitate the return of U.S. vehicles that have been \nstolen and taken to Belize. The Treaty establishes procedures for the \nrecovery and return of vehicles that are registered, titled, or \notherwise documented in the territory of one Party, stolen in the \nterritory of that Party or from one of its nationals, and found in the \nterritory of the other Party.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Treaty, with Annexes and Protocol, and give its advice and consent \nto ratification.\n                                                  William J.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce an old \npersonal friend and a highly qualified individual as the nominee for \nthe U.S. Ambassador to Spain.\n  Ed Romero is not only a native New Mexican, he is a descendant of the \nSpanish colonists who first settled in New Mexico in 1598. Mr. Romero's \npersonal biography represents both a commitment to his heritage and \ndiligence as a upstanding citizen of this country.\n  In the fulfillment of his duties as a New Mexican and an American, \nMr. Romero headed several delegations to Mexico to forge the \nrelationships necessary to expand business opportunities. He was also a \nmember of the U.S. delegation to the Helsinki accords.\n  Mr. Romero was the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Advanced \nSciences, Inc. Mr. Romero also founded the Albuquerque Hispanic Chamber \nof Commerce and is currently on the Boards of several Hispanic and \nLatin American Business and Cultural Associations and Foundations. In \nhis civic and community pursuits, he has been recognized by \norganizations as diverse as the National Kidney Foundation, New \nMexico's Air National Guard and the New Mexico Anti-Defamation League. \nMr. Romero has traveled extensively in Spain and speaks fluent Spanish.\n\n[[Page S6916]]\n\n  Mr. President, it is my pleasure and, indeed, an honor to introduce \nto the Senate an individual as distinguished and qualified for the \nposition of Ambassador to Spain as Edward Romero. I believe his \nbackground and commitment will make him a gracious, competent and \neffective representative of the U.S. I fully support his nomination and \nrespectfully ask my colleagues in the Senate for their careful \nconsideration of Mr. Romero as the next U.S. Ambassador to Spain.\n  Mr. FRIST.
