Mr. President, there will be an opportunity this morning \nfor Members of the Senate to discuss the President's submission of his \nbudget to the Congress yesterday.\n  The way the process works in our country is the President proposes a \nbudget that contains his recommendations for spending priorities. And \nthen the Congress deals with these recommendations in that way that \nCongress deems appropriate. The budget that the President proposes, and \nthe budget that the Congress finalizes, reflect what we think the \npriorities are for our country.\n  It is certain that 100 years from now none of us will be here; 100 \nyears from now we will be gone from this Earth. But if historians want \nto learn 100 years from now about who we were, and what we were, and \nwhat we felt was important to us, and what our priorities were, they \ncould look at the Federal budget document and evaluate our spending \npriorities. What did we think was important? What did we invest in, in \norder to achieve a better future for ourselves or our country? And they \ncould determine by our decisions about investment and spending what we \nheld dear as a country.\n  This President has proposed a budget that is vastly changed from the \nbudgets we have seen in recent years. When I came to the Congress in \n1981, in the House of Representatives, a new President was assuming \noffice here in town, President Ronald Reagan. He had a completely \ndifferent vision of fiscal policy.\n  He was supported by an economic theory that suggested if you had very \nlarge tax cuts, you would still achieve larger amounts of revenue and \nyou could actually balance the budget with large tax cuts. And so he \nproposed with his Office of Management and Budget guru, Mr. David \nStockman, a series of budgets that proposed very significant tax cuts \nand a doubling of the defense budget.\n  And President Reagan's economist and others, particularly an \neconomist named Arthur Laffer, who developed a Laffer curve, said this \nwould all work out OK. They said you can provide significant tax cuts, \ndouble defense spending, and it would all come out just fine.\n  In fact, that fiscal policy created a mountain of debt that began to \nchoke this country. The President and Congress in combination embarked \non a fiscal policy that was reckless. In fact, David Stockman, the \nchief strategist of it, said so in his book.\n  It took a long while to get through all of that, and even through the \nend of the 1980s and into the early 1990s the Federal budget deficit \nwas climbing and climbing at an alarming rate.\n  President Clinton came to office in 1993 and said we are going to \nchange that. And he presented the Congress in 1993 with a proposal to \nreduce the Federal budget deficit. As fiscal policy his proposal was \ntough, tough medicine.\n  And by one vote in the Senate and one vote in the House it passed. \nSome of my colleagues who voted for that are not here any longer \nbecause it was tough and controversial. But it put this country on the \nright road. Over a period of 5 years the budget deficit has come down, \ndown, way down.\n  And some of my colleagues are unwilling to accept the fact that there \nis a cause-effect relationship between the actions you take to reduce \nthis budget deficit and the results you get. But it is inevitable, if \nyou look at the facts, to conclude that what this President and what \nthis Congress did in 1993 to set this country on the right track has \nput us in the position today where we have a budget submitted to the \nCongress that wrestles that budget deficit to the ground and then says, \nas far as the eye can see in the years ahead, there is good news.\n  And the good news is that this economy is working. It's working \nbetter for the American people. I do not want to attribute it all to \none person or one party. That is not the case. Last year we had a \nbipartisan budget agreement between Republicans and Democrats and that \nhelps as well, and both parties ought to be credited for that.\n  But my point is I watched yesterday some people react to the \nPresident's budget submission, and it was the same cranky old tune you \nhave heard from them every single year. It sounds like they have a \npermanent toothache. Nothing on Earth can make them satisfied or happy.\n  Let me see if I can help them out. Let me try to explain why the \nAmerican people feel differently. Here is what makes the American \npeople feel good about the direction we are heading.\n  The Federal budget deficit, as I said, has been down, down, way down \nnow for 5 years in a row. And the deficit is almost nonexistent--not \nquite yet, but it will be.\n  Inflation is almost nonexistent. Inflation has come down, down, down. \nIt is the lowest it's been since 1986. Housing starts are up \nsubstantially. In 1996 they totaled 1.47 million housing starts. That \nis the largest number of housing starts in this country since 1988. And \nwhat we know so far about 1997 tells us that the figures for all of \nlast year will be even higher.\n  Mr. President, 14 million people are working now that were not \nworking in 1993. Unemployment is down. I can recall when the Federal \nReserve Board, that friend of mine, that institutional friend of mine, \nsaid if unemployment ever goes below 6 percent are we in for trouble; \nwe are in for a huge wave of inflation. The Federal Reserve Board has \nbeen wrong, it has been consistently wrong about that. Unemployment is \nnow at 4.7 percent, and inflation has not gone up, it has gone down.\n  Crime? The crime rate has gone down at the same time. This President \nsaid let's put 100,000 new police officers on the street. Let's put new \ncops on the street, on the beat. Guess what is happening. As our \neconomy strengthens, and as more people are working, we have a lower \ncrime rate. Since 1993, violent crime has dropped 16 percent. Robberies \nare down, assaults are down, the murder rate is down by over 20 \npercent, burglary is down. That is good news.\n  Welfare? In the last 4 years we have seen the largest decline in the \nwelfare rolls in the history of this country. There are 2 million fewer \npeople on welfare today than there were in August 1996, when we enacted \nwelfare reform. I might say that this was a bipartisan accomplishment: \nRepublicans and Democrats in the Congress joined to pass a welfare \nreform bill. I supported it as did many of my colleagues on both sides \nof the political aisle. A good economy plays a major role in this, but \nthe welfare reform bill also set us on the right track.\n  Child support collections are up 50 percent after this Congress \npassed legislation cracking down on deadbeat dads who decide their \nchildren are not their responsibility and that the taxpayers should pay \nfor them. The increase in collections is good news. Child support \npayments are up 50 percent.\n  Access to health care for millions of Americans? Because of last \nyear's action, 5 million American children without health care will get \nhealth care.\n  Medicare? In the work that we have done to provide long-term \nstability for Medicare much, much more needs to be done, but we have \ndone a great deal already.\n  I have more to say and I will in a bit, but I notice the minority \nleader, Senator Daschle, is on the floor. Let me yield whatever time \nSenator Daschle might use of the hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank my colleague for his leadership and his usual \neloquence. I want to associate myself with his remarks this morning. I \nappreciate very much his calling attention to the\n\n[[Page S283]]\n\nextraordinary and very historic accomplishment that we mark this week \nas we begin the debate on the fiscal 1999 budget.\n\n  I have some charts here that I think probably tell the story as well \nas any three charts could. This first graph simply lays out our fiscal \npolicy from 1980 through 2003, using the President's fiscal year 1999 \nbudget proposal to project from 1999 to 2003. The portion in red notes \nour struggle with the deficit from 1980 all the way up until the \npresent. The deficits during this period total $3.1 trillion. Then in \n1993 came the very controversial Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, \nwhich was enacted only after the Vice President cast the deciding vote. \nPassage of this act allowed us to make a dramatic reversal in our \nfiscal policy, generating savings that exceed the entire deficit that \nwe have accumulated from 1980 through 1999. The green, or blue portion \nas it may appear on the screen, represents a total savings of $4 \ntrillion. It shows that prior to the passage of the 1993 budget bill, \nCBO was projecting that the deficit would explode from $290 billion in \n1992 to $633 billion by the year 2003.\n  Instead, a wonderful thing happened as a result of courageous \ndecisions made by Democratic Senators and Members of Congress--some who \nare not here today because they voted on that deficit. I will never \nforget that moment as long as I live. After much consultation with \nSenators on both sides of the aisle, but especially our side of the \naisle, a majority came to the realization that this could be a historic \nvote. Indeed it was. That vote brought about a precipitous decline in \nthe deficit, to the point where we now see a surplus for the first time \nin 30 years. That surplus is projected to be $218 billion over the next \n5 years. In 1969 I was a senior in college. I didn't really know, then, \nwhether we had a surplus or a deficit. I really wasn't following it \nthat closely. But I look back now and note that it was a surplus, \nalbeit a small one. By the rarest of circumstances we had a set of \neconomic conditions that allowed us to reach surplus that year. \nHowever, it was a fragile one and would not be repeated for 30 years. \nNow we are being told that the budget before us could achieve at least \n$1 trillion surplus over the next 10 years. So this is not just a \nfleeting 1-year moment in time. Current economic analysis projects that \nit is very likely we could see budgetary surpluses for the next 10 \nyears. If in the years ahead we practice the same fiscal responsibility \nwe have demonstrated the last 5 years, we could see a surplus of $1 \ntrillion. In other words, we would not only achieve a $4 trillion \nsavings in projected deficits, we would add to that an additional $1 \ntrillion in surplus because of decisions we made in 1993 and again in \n1997.\n  So no one should be surprised at the ceremony at the White House \nyesterday or with the extraordinary optimism and excitement that many \nof us shared as a result of these tough decisions. We have all been in \nthose rooms. We have all noted a change in discipline. We have all \nnoted how difficult it is to say no. We have all noted that, were it \nnot for tough decisions and the new discipline that we have been able \nto establish over the last 5 years, we would not be celebrating today. \nBut, indeed we are, and this chart points out as well as any the \nreasons for that celebration.\n  This next chart is also quite educational and informative. The dotted \nline shows the average federal outlays as a share of gross domestic \nproduct over the course of the last 17 years, from 1980, when Ronald \nReagan became President, through 1997, under President Clinton. The \naverage outlay during this span has been 21.9 percent of gross domestic \nproduct. In the early 1980s we exceeded this average pretty \nsubstantially. The red line indicates what actually happened. In 1988 \nand 1989 we went below the average outlays and then during the Bush \nyears we exceeded the average outlays. In 1993, upon passage of \nPresident Clinton's budget bill, those outlays dropped precipitously \nand have continued falling right to the present. We see a dramatic \nreduction. Never in 17 years have we seen anything close to the drop in \noutlays that have occurred in the last 5 years. So, as a percent of \ngross domestic product, the federal government is spending far less \nthan we have ever spent in the last two decades.\n\n  Receipts have also gone up during this same period. We see that \nexpenditures and receipts meet about in the middle. Receipts as a share \nof gross domestic product have averaged 18.5 percent over the period \n1980 to 1997. This percent has gone up substantially in the last five \nyears so that revenues and outlays meet in the middle to bring us that \nsurplus. What is amazing is that even though average receipts are up, \nthe amount of tax paid by the average American working family is down, \nthe lowest it has been in 20 years. So, one might ask, why are receipts \nup? Receipts are up because people on Wall Street are making \nmegamillions, the economy is stronger than it has been at any time in \nour history, and the explosion of economic vitality and growth has \nproduced an economic engine that not only provides more after-tax \nincome for working families and businesses and farms, but also for the \ngovernments. More governments today at the State and local level are \ndeclaring surpluses than at any other time. Why? Because the engine of \nthis economy is as strong as it has ever been.\n  So, by showing fiscal discipline, by creating fiscal and monetary \npolicy that meld so well, we have created an economic engine that has \nallowed this economy to grow, to bring in the receipts, even though the \nvast majority of middle-income families have actually seen a reduction \nin their taxes over the last 20 years. These outlays have been reduced \nin large measure because we have been able to do something with \ngovernment bureaucracy that we have not seen since John Kennedy was \nPresident: a lowering of the federal government's civilian employment. \nAs depicted in this chart, we can see what has happened to Federal \nemployment over the period of the last 30 years. When President Kennedy \nwas in office, we had about 1.8 million employees working for the \nFederal Government. During the Johnson years that number shot up to \nover 2.3 million. It dropped in Nixon's time, went up a little bit in \nCarter's time, dropped somewhat in Reagan's time. But look what \nhappened in President Clinton's time. The red portion of the chart \nshows the dramatic decline in civilian employment in the executive \nbranch just in the last 5 years. It is once again at a level about \nwhere it was when President Kennedy was in office, when I was in 6th \nand 7th grade. So these outlays have gone down for many reasons, but \nthey have gone down in large measure because we have the smallest \nFederal Government that we have had in more than 30 years.\n  We have had an effective Federal Government. In education, health \ncare, health security, especially for Medicare recipients--in a lot of \nways, even though our Government is smaller, our country and the \nGovernment is stronger. Now we are at the crux of some very serious \npolicy questions. Perhaps the most important policy question is what do \nwe do with the surplus. I think the President last week laid out the \nblueprint as clearly and convincingly as anything I have heard him \ndiscuss in the 5 years he has been President. This President has said, \nbefore we do anything else, let's recognize one thing. If we don't deal \nwith Social Security soon in a meaningful way, by the time he and I and \nmany of us so-called baby boomers retire, security, the fund may well \nbe exhausted. Let's fix the Social Security problem, but until we do, \nlet's ensure that we don't do anything with the surplus. In essence, we \nshould pay down the debt as long as the Social Security problem remains \nunrepaired; so long as we don't have the confidence that Social \nSecurity will be available beyond the year 2030.\n  So I think the President is absolutely right. Let's solve Social \nSecurity, let's pay off some of the debt and whatever other things that \nwe want to do. However, let's use the same fiscal discipline that we \nhave used for the last 5 years to ensure that we provide good child \ncare, good education, good health care, and a vital economy. We should \npay for new investments and that's what the President's budget is \ndoing. Every single thing in the President's budget is paid for, every \npenny of it.\n  So it's an exciting day. We celebrate success. We celebrate vitality \nin the economy the likes of which many of us have never seen in our \nlifetimes. We celebrate and perhaps look back with some satisfaction to \ntough decisionmaking. And we look ahead, having\n\n[[Page S284]]\n\nlearned those lessons, with some expectation that it can continue. We \nwill continue to make tough decisions. We will continue to keep this \neconomy robust. We will continue to show fiscal discipline. We will \ncontinue to be sure that regardless of what else we do, when we invest \nin our future, when we invest in our children, when we invest in the \nthings that our people care so much about, that we make those \ninvestments good by paying for them. First, by protecting Social \nSecurity; second, by paying off some of the debt; third, by investing \nin things that are totally paid for with offsets that are real and \ncalculable.\n\n  Mr. President, if that isn't a recipe for success, I don't know what \nis. I hope all of us, Republicans and Democrats, can acknowledge the \nimportance of maintaining that success as we go forward. I noted that \nyesterday marked the first day of the debate of the 1999 budget. While \nwe can debate a lot of things, I hope several things are off the table. \nI hope we don't go back to the old mistakes we made in the 1980s. I \nhope that we recognize that rosy scenario has no place in budget \ncalculations any longer; that we have to ensure that the fiscal \ndiscipline and the leadership that we have demonstrated persists and \ncan consistently be demonstrated through the decisionmaking process we \nmake on the budget this year.\n  (Mr. ROBERTS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from South Dakota \nwill yield.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know the Senator comes from a reasonably \nsmall town in South Dakota. I come from a much smaller town in North \nDakota.\n  I have said on several occasions that in my hometown, like most \nhometowns, we have a couple of people who get up in the morning and go \ndown to the bar and play pinochle all day. They are retired. They sit \naround and play pinochle and enjoy life. The fact is, they sit around \nand play pinochle and complain while other people are out doing other \nthings, like figuring out how to pave Main Street. Almost nothing \nsatisfies them. There are people like that in every hometown, and there \nare people like that in Congress. The fact is, there is no amount of \ngood news that can satisfy the people who are bent on having a bad day. \nI find it interesting that we went through part of the eighties and \nsome of the nineties going in the wrong direction, and everyone was \nstanding up and saying, ``Gee, we were right on course; the deficit was \ncontinuing to escalate, the Federal debt was continuing to grow and \nmushroom.'' Everybody said, ``Well, we're right on course.'' But we \nweren't on course.\n  The Senator from South Dakota, I know, understands well the 1993 \nvote. In that vote, we on this side of the aisle said, ``Wait a second, \nthis train is running right down the wrong track. We are going to stop \nit, back it up, turn it around and move it in the other direction.'' \nThat is what has gotten us to the point we are at today, where instead \nof seeing escalating budget deficits and mushrooming Federal debt, we \nare seeing exactly the opposite. We not only see reduced deficits, and \na reduced debt burden, but also an opportunity, even as we balance the \nbudget, to invest in critical things that are important to the future \nhealth of the country. Is that how the Senator sees it?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the observation made by the \nSenator from North Dakota. That is true. There are some people who, \ngiven the kind of cards we have been dealt, you think would find some \ncause for optimism with all the good that is happening today: housing \nstarts the highest they have been in history; the number of new jobs \nthe highest they have ever been; the strength of the economy; the low \ninterest rates; the fact that we are going to see a surplus; a growth \nin the economy that exceeds that of Europe and Japan together. That \nremarkable economic success ought to be cause for optimism for even the \nmost ardent political pessimists sometimes found among our colleagues \non the other side.\n  So I acknowledge, as you do, that it is a remarkable day when, even \nwith all of this good news, there are still some people who are trying \nto find the dark lining in the cloud.\n\n  There isn't much dark lining there. If we stick to the text that we \nhave been using for the last 5 years, there is a lot of silver lining \nupon which we ought to be building our future.\n  Again, I appreciate very much the Senator's leadership in bringing \nthis to the attention of the American people and helping us as we make \nthese tough decisions each and every day.\n  Mr. President, I know others are seeking time for the floor. So, \nagain, I thank the Senator for allocating this time for discussion of \nthe budget and our current circumstances. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me continue for a couple of moments to \nfinish the presentation I was intending to make.\n  The reason I come back to the 1993 vote is that it was so \ncontroversial and so difficult for so many people. There were people \nhere who said, ``If you do this, if you pass this bill that makes a \nfundamental change in fiscal policy, you are going to cause a train \nwreck and you are going to run this country into a depression.'' We had \npeople say that on the floor of the Senate. I won't read their quotes \nbecause that would not be fair. That was the intention of some folks on \nthe floor, to say this is a terribly wrongheaded policy and going in \nthe wrong direction. It turns out it was very important we change the \ndirection of this country; it was the right policy.\n  When President Clinton proposed this budget, he talked about saving \nSocial Security first. This is another way of saying we ought to pay \ndown some of this debt. The problem has been that the Social Security \ntrust funds have been used in the operating budget. I have been on the \nfloor repeatedly talking about how inappropriate that is.\n  We ought to not step back into the same old hole we have been in for \na decade and a half, or even more. We ought not to decide, the minute \nthe budget picture looks better and we are headed in the right \ndirection, that we are going to provide more tax breaks or more \nspending. What we ought to do is provide some confidence to the \nAmerican people that we can manage this country's fiscal policy in a \nway that provides balanced budgets far out into the future. This \nPresident has done that in a way that says we are going to establish \nthe right priorities for this country's future.\n  I want to mention two of them because others will come and talk about \ndifferent portions of this budget. I want to talk about two. Some of \nthe things the President has proposed represent additional investment \nin certain kinds of activities, and he has achieved that by reducing \nspending in other areas. I want to mention a couple.\n  Head Start. Does anyone in this Chamber who has visited a Head Start \ncenter believe that that is not the best kind of Federal investment we \ncan make in young lives? Does anybody believe that program doesn't \nwork? All of the evidence suggests that it is a wonderful investment in \nyoung lives. You go there and look in the eyes of these young children, \n4- and 5-year-old children who are getting an opportunity in Head Start \nthat they wouldn't have had otherwise. It yields tremendous rewards in \nthe lives of each and every one of them.\n  When someone says, as we have seen in the past, ``Well let's cut the \nbudget and cut 60,000 kids out of Head Start,'' I say, ``You tell me \ntheir names, which kids do you want to cut out of Head Start?''\n  This President says, and I hope this Congress will agree, that \nprogram works, that program makes sense, that program improves young \ncitizens' lives. That's why his budget proposes to increase Head Start \nfunding by $309 million in the coming fiscal year.\n  Let me make one final point. There is a lot in this budget that makes \na lot of sense. The National Institutes of Health. This President says \nlet's do what we ought to do. Let's increase spending of the National \nInstitutes of Health, and he does so in a way that gets NIH funding to \n$20 billion in 2003, up nearly 50 percent over the coming 5 years, by \nachieving savings in other parts of the budget.\n\n  But I want to tell you briefly what they are doing down there at NIH. \nThey have 50,000 plants, shrubs and trees from all around the world \nthey collected with USDA, and they are\n\n[[Page S285]]\n\ndoing research. I encourage all my colleagues to go see what they are \ndoing.\n  Contemporary medicine derives many of its drugs from plant sources \nall around the world. They are doing an investigation of chili \npeppers--chili peppers. Do you know what they are finding? Chili \npeppers have a pain-killing extract. People knew that in folk medicine \nlong ago, but now it is being refined and used.\n  Sweet wormwood, a plant that has potency against malaria.\n  The willow tree, aspirin. The Chinese knew that 2,000 years ago. The \njava devil pepper, a drug used as hypertensive agents against high \nblood pressure. Rose periwinkle, used in Hodgkin's disease, anticancer \nagents. Foxglove, used in congestive heart failure.\n  The point is, go down and look at what they are doing and what we are \ngetting for this investment. It is going to improve the lives of people \nin this country because it will lead to significant medical \nbreakthroughs. And this is just one part of their research, in the area \nof evaluating plants, trees and shrubs all around the world for what \nfolk medicine used to understand they can contribute. We are \nunderstanding in a more significant and sophisticated way that these \nnatural resources can help people live a healthy life.\n  Go over to the Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and take a look at \nwhat they are doing with respect to heart disease and genetic research. \nIt is possible some day in the future that someone whose arteries \nbecome clogged will have their body grow a new artery link around that \nblockage. That comes from genetic research.\n  My point is, that is an area of the budget that I am very excited \nabout. Gosh, that makes a lot of sense because that is an investment in \nthe future, that is an investment that is going to help this country \nand all people of the world.\n  I think it is exciting that we can come to the floor of the Senate at \na time when the country is headed in the right direction. We have more \njobs, more opportunity, more confidence in the future. The things that \nwere troubling us--inflation, welfare, budget deficits, unemployment--\nare all of them down, down, way down. That ought to give cause for \noptimism to all Members of the Senate. And it should give the American \npeople the confidence that finally we are moving in the right \ndirection.\n  That is why this budget document is important. It sets out some \npriorities. Are some of them maybe adjustable? Are some of them wrong? \nYes. Are a lot of them right? Yes. Let's have a debate about that, and \nlet's describe and select those priorities that we believe will \nstrengthen and improve this country.\n  I am happy to yield such time as he consumes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for \nthis opportunity to speak.\n  I came to Washington 15 years ago to be a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives. I can recall that one of the major items that we \ndiscussed in the entire 14 years that I served was the budget deficit. \nIt seemed like such an impossible, intractable problem. Through \nPresident after President, we had these theories on how we were finally \ngoing to reach balance.\n  Oh, there was this steely resolve from everyone that we are going to \nget it done, and it seemed to be an elusive target that we missed year \nafter year after year. As the balanced budget effort failed, the debt \nof the Nation grew and our deficits grew. We continued to shell out \nmillions and millions and billions of dollars in interest on the \nnational debt, money wasted that couldn't be spent for other good \npurposes.\n  Thank goodness we are in a different era. I pick up the morning paper \nand see the President of the United States has submitted to Congress \nfor the first time in over 30 years a balanced budget. I read as well \nthe last balanced budget submitted by President Lyndon Johnson was the \nresult of a substantial tax surcharge which was imposed on the American \npeople. So this President has brought us to a point with a balanced \nbudget without this increase in taxes on working families, but giving \nus, I think, a better opportunity in the future.\n\n  How did we reach this point? I think you have to go back at least to \n1993 when we passed the budget of the President. A Democratically \ncontrolled Congress, with not one Republican vote in support, passed a \nbudget which moved us substantially toward a balanced budget.\n  It said that in the outyears, we would reduce spending, we would make \ncertain that our books would be in balance, and then, to give credit \nwhere it is due, with the Republican Congress, just this last year, we \ncame together again and, on a bipartisan basis, finished the job, \nfinished that last important but small piece that needed to be added to \nreach balance. Add that to our bustling and thriving economy, and we \nhave a situation that all of us can finally take pride in that we have \na budget that is balanced for America and is balanced in its \npriorities.\n  Speaking to that budget, my friend from North Dakota mentioned \nseveral areas that are near and dear to my heart. The whole concept \nthat we would finally find the resources in this budget to help working \nfamilies pay for child care is one that is long overdue. During the \nbreak that we just completed, I traveled the length and breadth of \nIllinois visiting child care centers, seeing what was going on in the \nsmall communities and large cities of my State.\n  I can tell you, it is heartening, it is encouraging--but there are \nmany challenges there--to go to St. Vincent de Paul Child Care Center \nin the city of Chicago and find 400 children in a very positive, warm \nand safe environment and to know that those children are receiving the \nvery best care. But then I hear from Sister Katie that there are, in \nfact, a thousand more children waiting to come to that center. Where \nare those kids today? Who is watching them? What are they learning? Is \nit good or bad?\n\n  The President's budget says let's start providing more money for \nfamilies to pay for child care, and he issues the resources from the \ntobacco agreement--one that I think should be one of our highest \npriorities this year. If we leave town in 1998, if this Senate and \nHouse leave town without enacting tobacco legislation--a tobacco \nagreement, a comprehensive approach--we will have turned our back on a \ngolden opportunity for families across America to help pay for child \ncare.\n  In the area of medical research, it always puzzled me that this area \nof research, which is so popular among the American people, didn't \nreceive the kind of investment that it was due. I will give credit \nwhere it is due, within the last year or two my colleague from \nIllinois, Congressman John Porter, and others, have moved forward to \nincrease NIH funding.\n  We can do better. We can do more. With this tobacco agreement and the \nproceeds from it, through this budget, we will finally start making the \nkind of investment in health research which every family cares for. \nNow, people may not come up on the street and say, ``Senator, I hope \nyou will do something about health research,'' but I say just visit a \nhospital. Visit a hospital where some family member is seriously ill \nand sit around for a few minutes, and you know what they will say. ``I \nhope that the people working in Washington and all across the country \ncan help spare my family or at least some other family what we have \ngone through with this health problem.''\n  The last point I will make is critically important. There is a lot of \ntalk about what to do with our surplus. There is kind of a surreal \nquality to this--a surplus? It was just a year ago that if you came to \nthe floor of this U.S. Senate you would have found several Members--one \nparked at this desk right over here--with a stack of books higher than \nhis head, all the budgets that have been submitted that were not in \nbalance. And what was his suggested solution and the solution of many \nof my colleagues? An amendment to the Constitution.\n  It is fortuitous that on the floor waiting to speak next is Senator \nRobert Byrd. Senator Byrd of West Virginia has led the fight against \nthis notion for a long, long period of time. Senator Byrd will recall \nthe speeches, ``If we don't amend this Constitution, if we don't put a \nbalanced budget amendment in the Constitution, we will never reach \nbalance. We have to change the Constitution.'' Senator Byrd had the \nwisdom and the leadership to stand up and say, ``You are\n\n[[Page S286]]\n\nwrong. This can be done with political will. It need not be done by \nchanging the Constitution of the United States.''\n  Here we are 12 months later, I say to the Senator. I don't hear the \nhue and cry on the floor anymore from our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle about amending the Constitution. They pick up the paper in \nthe morning and say, ``You've reached a balanced budget.'' We didn't \nhave to put that travesty in our Constitution. I think there is a \nlesson there. We certainly owe a great debt of gratitude to Senator \nByrd for his leadership in reminding us that we ought to step back and \ntake a look at the course of American history before we jump and run \nand add things to that great document.\n  Now today, I say to the Senator, there are people who say we don't \nhave to worry about the deficit anymore, our biggest problem is trying \nto figure out how to spend this surplus. All this extra money, what can \nwe do? Can we declare a dividend for the American people? Give them tax \nbreaks and become the most popular politicians in a generation? I \nsuppose we could do that, but I think that is shortsighted. We don't \nknow where this economy will be 6 months or a year from now. We don't \nknow where Federal revenues will be. It is far better for us to take a \ncautious course.\n  I think President Clinton was right in his State of the Union \nmessage. Our first stop on that course should be Social Security. Let's \nmake certain that if there is a surplus that we can count on, that we \ninvest it back into Social Security so that it is there not just for \ngenerations to come but for the next century. We can do that, and we \ncan do it if we don't rush to judgment here, if we don't spend this \nphantom surplus, if we don't overinvest.\n  As we were caught up a year ago in the idea of amending the \nConstitution, let's not get carried away in 1998 with overspending this \nsurplus that may be illusory or only temporary.\n  I stand today happy that this administration has brought forth the \nfirst balanced budget in 30 years, but understanding that within that \nbudget are important priorities for the working families of America, \npriorities which will never see the light of day unless this Senate and \nthe House of Representatives work together to make certain that we keep \nyour eye on the goal. The goal is making sure that we have a better \nstandard of living for families across America.\n  I thank Senator Byrd for giving this opportunity to speak and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the very distinguished Senator from Illinois. He is \nan extremely able Senator and he is focused on the betterment of the \ncountry and always with the interests of the people of his State \nuppermost in mind. I am glad to serve with him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/03/senate-section/article/S282-3", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S286-S287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ISTEA\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, there is an urgent necessity for the Senate \nto turn immediately to the consideration of the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act of 1997, ISTEA. That is the highway bill. \nThat bill was reported unanimously by the Environmental and Public \nWorks Committee on October 1, 1997. However, due to our inability to \nenact a comprehensive 6-year ISTEA reauthorization bill at the close of \nthe last session, our State highway departments and transit providers \nare currently operating under a short-term extension bill that provides \nroughly one-half year of funding which is needed for our Federal \nhighway construction, our highway safety, and our transit programs.\n  That short-term extension bill, Public Law 105-130, signed by the \nPresident on December 1, 1997, includes the following text, and I hope \nthat Senators will listen carefully:\n\n       A State shall not obligate any funds for any Federal aid \n     highway program project after May 1, 1998.\n\n  Let me repeat this provision that was in the law enacted and signed \nby the President on December 1 of 1997. Listen to these words:\n  ``A State,'' that is my State, the State of the distinguished Senator \nwho presides so efficiently over this Senate, that is the State of each \nof 99 other Members, ``A State shall not obligate any funds for any \nFederal aid highway program project after May 1, 1998.''\n  That is just 42 legislative working days away--42 days.\n  I want to take a moment to explore the practical impact of that \nsentence. That sentence means that on May 1 of this year, just 87 days \nfrom today, with just 42 legislative calendar days--session days, we \nmight say--away, our State highway departments and our transit \nproviders across the Nation will be prohibited, by law, from spending \nany Federal highway or transit trust fund dollars. This provision does \nnot apply just to the funding that was part of the short-term extension \nbill; it applies, equally, to any other unobligated funds that States \nmay have left in their accounts for highway or transit projects \ncurrently in progress.\n  Mr. President, this provision, prohibiting the obligation of highway \nor transit funds after May 1, is a doomsday provision. It is a \nprovision that says, beginning 3 months from this past Sunday, all 50 \nStates in the union will begin to hit the same brick wall and feel the \nsame pain--the pain of a Federal highway program coming to a halt, the \npain of workers being put on the unemployment line, the pain of urban \nmass transit projects stopping in midstream, the pain of gravel \nquarries shutting down, the pain of construction equipment \nmanufacturers closing their doors, the pain of our citizens sitting in \never-worsening traffic jams due to the inability to progress on \ndesperately needed projects, the pain of unnecessary accidents and \ndeaths on our highways--all of these because those roads cannot be \nbrought up to modern safe standards. Make no mistake about it, May Day, \nMay the 1st, May Day, will certainly elicit a cry for help from our \nStates and our people.\n  You will hear the Governors, you will hear the mayors then, you will \nhear the highway agencies then, from all over this country.\n  Mr. President, when the Congress put that doomsday provision into \nlaw, we did so at a time when the Senate majority leader was telling \nthe Senate that we would turn to a comprehensive 6-year ISTEA \nreauthorization bill as our first order of business early in the second \nsession of the 105th Congress. Back in November we knew that, if we \ntook up the ISTEA bill at the end of January, we would have sufficient \ntime between then and May 1 to move an ISTEA bill and go to conference \nwith the House and present a completed bill to the President for his \nsignature. It was an ambitious schedule, but it was achievable.\n  Mr. President, today, that picture appears to have radically changed, \nand it does not appear that we will be taking up the highway bill any \ntime soon. I say this from the inferences that I draw from newspaper \nreports and the reports that I receive by word of mouth and various \nother communications, electronic and so on. There are exceedingly few \nlegislative days available to us prior to May 1, as I have already \nindicated, about 42 session days. I am not counting Saturdays and \nSundays. These are session days. Although the priorities of the Senate \nleadership may have changed regarding debating ISTEA, the doomsday date \nof May 1 remains in the law. While it may be the desire of the Senate \nleadership to debate a budget resolution prior to the consideration of \nISTEA, let's realistically face what that means. While the law requires \nthat the Senate pass a budget resolution by April 15, the fact is that \nwe miss that deadline far more often than we meet it. And if we just \nlisten to the statements that have been made in the last few days \nregarding the President's budget, it is apparent that the debate over \nthe substance and the direction of the budget resolution promises to be \na long and contentious one.\n  So what is the real possibility of our enacting a comprehensive 6-\nyear ISTEA reauthorization bill prior to May 1, if we do not turn to it \nimmediately? Not good, at best.\n  Mr. President, some observers have looked at the calendar and \nconcluded that the Senate, along with the House, will just have to pass \nanother short-term ISTEA authorization bill. Well, Mr. President, I am \nnot a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee. But, I am \ntold by both the chairman and ranking member of that committee's \nSurface Transportation Subcommittee that the chances are very slight, \nindeed, that we will be successful in, again, passing a short-term\n\n[[Page S287]]\n\nISTEA extension bill. Over 200 amendments were filed to S. 1173, when \nit was brought before the Senate last fall. Several Members are anxious \nto offer their amendments. Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog, has seen \nhis shadow, but we here in the Congress cannot seem to see the \nhandwriting on the wall.\n  I again urge the leadership to bring forward and take up the ISTEA \nbill now and let the Senate get on with debating and voting on the many \namendments that have been filed in connection with this bill.\n  There is simply no other way that we can hope to complete action on \nthis critical legislation prior to the May 1 drop dead date that \npresently is hanging over the heads of all of us like Damocles' sword. \nAll of us are responsible for ensuring that the Nation's highway \nprograms continue without undue interruption and uncertainty. The time \nfor dithering and delaying is over. We need to keep our commitment to \nthe States and to our people and act now to avoid this doomsday \nscenario.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. It is my \nunderstanding that the next hour of deliberation is under my control or \nthat of my designee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.

Mr. President, over the last several days, there has \nbeen considerable discussion about the State of the Union Address and \nthe general framework of the President's new budget and subsequent \npresentations that have been made to the Congress and to the American \npeople about this budget. Over the next several months, we are going to \nentertain a lot of hyperbole, a lot of rhetoric, and probably a lot of \nfinger pointing, but I have a business background--bottom line. The \nbottom line here is that the celebration conducted on the White House \nlawn last year for the first balanced budget in 30 years and the first \ntax relief in 16 years, if we accept the President's presentations, is \nbeing canceled. It didn't last a year. Just take an x and mark it out \nand take all those films and set them aside. It didn't happen, because \nthe tax relief--the first significant tax relief in 16 years--was $110 \nbillion over the next 5 years. The President's budget envisions tax \nincreases of $106 billion over the next 5 years. So the tax relief is \ncrossed through, gone.\n\n  Now, it's true that there will be a different set of winners and \nlosers, which is unfortunately the type of thing that happens in the \nCapital City. The point is, they made huge fanfare that we were giving \n$110 billion in tax relief. We have gone home and talked about it, and \nwe are right back here raising it again, canceling it out.\n  Now, the balanced budget--the first in 30 years--the balanced budget \nagreement, which was a very hard-fought battle, finally secured and \nsigned with great celebration on the White House lawn, envisioned a cap \nof expenditures over 5 years. In other words, we came to terms about \nhow much we were going to spend between the signing of that and the \nyear 2002. Preset. We told the American people that we are on a \nglidepath and we have decided what we are going to spend. Well, the \nfruits of this have been enormous. The world has looked at us and said \nthat this is a very positive thing. The President's budget takes that \nand sets it aside and says, no, we are going to go back to the days of \ntax and spend, and he is proposing $150 billion in new spending, added \non above those caps that we agreed to.\n  So, in short, bottom line, you take the budget deal and tax relief \nand throw it out, cancel it. That is where the debate starts this year. \nI think that is unacceptable.\n  Mr. President, we have just been joined by my good colleague from \nMissouri. He is operating under a real scheduling problem here. I am \ngoing to yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Missouri. He is \ndealing with another matter, but we want to facilitate the Senator's \nschedule, and it is a very important initiative that he is going to be \ntalking about this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bond and Mr. Frist pertaining to the introduction \nof S. 1599 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we have now been joined by the senior \nSenator from Texas, Senator Gramm, an acknowledged expert on economics \nand the budget. I welcome him to the floor to discuss the President's \nbudget. I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank our dear friend and leader from \nGeorgia, Senator Coverdell, for yielding. Let me first say that this is \na very happy occasion to me because I have come to the floor of the \nSenate to talk about a budget where in the one provision that Americans \nclearly understand best, and based on the historical problems we care \nabout most, we have a unanimity of purpose with the White House, with \nthe Democrats. In fact, this is the first time in my career in Congress \nthat we have a President, a minority party, and a majority party, all \nof which have committed to balancing the Federal budget.\n  It is a certainty that if the economy stays as strong over the next \n18 months as it is today that we will balance the Federal budget in \nfiscal year 1999, which is October of 1998 through September of the \nyear 1999. That, obviously, is good news.\n  So I think the first thing we need to do is we don't need a debate \nabout balancing the budget. We don't need a debate about how we differ \nwith the President on this subject. Some people will want to debate \nabout how it happened. Some people will want to debate who should have \nthe credit. But it seems to me that the good news is given the economy \nstays as strong as it is we are going to have a balanced budget, and \nthe President and the Congress--Democrats and Republicans--agree on the \nbottom line of that budget.\n  So given all of that happy news, I think we should just simply take \nit to the bank, so to speak, and move ahead on that front.\n  Now the question comes: Where do we disagree? That is what I would \nlike to talk about today because I think those disagreements are very, \nvery important. How did we get to where we are today? It seems to me \nthat it started in 1985 when for the first time we really started to \ntry to gain control of spending. It has been fiscal responsibility--\noften a battle between the President and the Congress, Democratic \nPresidents, Republican Presidents, Democratic Congresses, Republican \nCongresses. But the basic fact of life is that since 1985 we have \nlimited the growth of Government for the first time really in the \npostwar period.\n  Where does the President want to take us from this happy moment, and \nwhere do Republicans want to take us from this happy moment? Given that \ntogether with a strong economy we are going to balance the budget, \nwhich road does the President want to go down? And which road do \nRepublicans in Congress want to go down? Then it seems to me that it is \nup to us to define those paths as we come to this fork in the road \nwhere people need to choose which path they want to follow.\n  The President is proposing in his budget $115 billion of new taxes \nand user fees. These taxes entail many different provisions from taxes \non airline tickets to changing the way we deal with life insurance--\nnumerous provisions. But when you add up all of the taxes and user \nfees, the President's budget over the next 5 years will take $115 \nbillion out of the pockets of Americans and transfer that money to the \nGovernment. The President will then use that money to fund in part a \n$130 billion increase in Government spending. Anyone who heard the \nState of the\n\n[[Page S288]]\n\nUnion has heard the long list of things that the President wants to \nspend money on.\n  The first thing I want people to understand is that this represents a \ndramatic change in policy. The President is contemplating from this \npoint where we have all come together to balance the budget taking a \nleftward path at this fork in the road that entails a very substantial \nincrease in taxes, and a very substantial increase in Government \nspending.\n  Let me tell you why I am concerned about the increase in taxes and \nuser fees. I am concerned because never have Americans paid more taxes \nthan they do today. American families all over the country--when you \nadd up the total taxes they pay--are paying about 31 cents out of every \ndollar they earn to the Government in taxes. We didn't pay 31 cents out \nof every dollar at the peak of the war effort in 1944 and 1945. We \ndidn't pay 31 cents out of every dollar at the peak of the Civil War \neffort. Never in the history of the country have taxes been higher than \nthey are today. Yet, in the President's budget under his own numbers, \nthe percentage of the income of Americans who work for a living that \ngoes to the Federal Government in taxes rises for 1998 over 1997 and \nrises for 1999 over 1998.\n  For 3 years in a row, despite the fact that we are at the highest tax \nlevel in American history, the President would raise taxes again, \nmeaning that Government would be spending more of our income than at \nany time in American history. And the only other times in American \nhistory that we have even rivaled this level of taxes were times when \ndefense spending was at a record high. And today defense spending is \nlower than it was when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor on December 7, \n1941.\n\n  Now it seems to me that what Republicans have to do--and I think we \nneed to do it in a very open way because this is a public policy \nchoice--is we need to go through and look at all of the $115 billion in \ntaxes and user fees, loophole closures, whatever euphemism the \nPresident may have for them, and we need to make a judgment. Are these \ngood things, are they bad things, should they be done, are they \nequitable, and do we want to take that much in revenues? That is the \nfirst question we have to answer. I think we do it by looking at each \nindividual program and making a decision.\n  Then we come to the decision as to what you would do with this money \nif you had it. If we had $115 billion of new revenues, would we want to \ngo out and undertake $130 billion of new spending programs, or would we \nwant to give that $115 billion back to the American people by cutting \ntaxes?\n  It seems to me that the difference between Republicans and the \nPresident at this sort of defining moment where we are on the verge of \nachieving a balanced budget and facing this fork in the road that the \nPresident wants to go left in raising taxes to increase spending even \nthough the tax rate is at a record high. I believe Republicans think \nthat we should look at each one of the President's revenue proposals. \nBut, if we believe that they merit our action, our support, we think we \nought to take that money and give it back to working Americans in terms \nof tax cuts.\n  We have had proposals by the President, for example, to spend $21 \nbillion on child care, a new massive program at the Federal and State \nlevel in block grants. Republicans believe there is a child care \nproblem. Today the average American family sends one out of every four \ndollars it earns to Washington, DC. In 1950, when I was a baby, the \naverage American family was sending one out of every forty dollars it \nearned to Washington, DC. Today working wives in two-parent families \nwhere both parents work outside the home are paying 55 percent of their \nearnings in taxes that didn't exist when I was a baby.\n  So, obviously, working families do have a problem paying for child \ncare and raising children. But is the answer another $21 billion \nFederal program? Or is the answer, for example, to double the dependent \nexemption from $2,500 a year to $5,000 a year so that instead of taking \n$2,500 off your income before you figure your taxes per child for those \nunder 6 you take $5,000 off per child. So you could keep more of your \nown money and invest it in your own decision about child care, whether \nit is professional child care, whether it was church based child care, \nor whether it is grandma keeping the children, or whether it is mom \nstaying home with the children. You would have a choice. That, it seems \nto me, is a legitimate choice that Americans can look at.\n  The President believes the answer to child care is $21 billion of new \nGovernment spending. We believe the answer is to take the $21 billion, \ndouble the dependent exemption for children under 6, and let working \nfamilies decide how to spend the money. I think the advantage of our \nprogram is you don't have to use child care to get benefits. If you \nstay home with your children, you get the benefit. If you work outside \nthe home and grandma takes care of the children, you get the benefit \nand you decide how to spend it. Who says one is better than the other? \nI think that is up to the American people. But that is the decision we \nare making at this crossroads where the President says the answer is \nmore Government, and we say the answer is more freedom--in this case \nfreedom to spend your own money.\n  If you ask American families that are in that income level--between \n$25,000 a year and $50,000 a year--so that their tax rate is popping up \nfrom 15 percent to 28 percent, if they would rather the Government \nspend $130 billion on their behalf, or would they rather say that if \nthey can work and make more money we will tax them at 15 percent \ninstead of 28 percent, what if we could say for single people that they \ncan earn $34,000 and still be in the 15 percent bracket, and we could \nsay to working families that they can earn $50,000 and still be in the \n15 percent bracket instead of $40,000? If we could do that for the same \ncost that the President is going to incur in funding all of these new \nGovernment programs, would working families rather keep that extra \nmoney and spend it themselves on many of the same things we say we are \ngoing to spend it on their behalf, or would they rather us do it?\n\n  Again, we are at that fork in the road where we came together to \nbalance the budget. But the President and the Democrats say let's spend \nthis money on more Government programs. We say let's let working \nfamilies keep more of what they earn, and for middle-income families \nwho have seen all the Reagan tax cut eaten up by an increase in payroll \ntaxes, let's stretch out this bracket at 15 percent.\n  Let's go up to $34,000 for single, and $50,000 for working couples \nwhere they will still be taxed at 15 percent, not 28 percent. Would \nthey prefer having that, or $130 billion worth of new Government \nspending? No one says the President is wrong and we are right. What we \nare saying is America, which do you want? Do you believe Government can \nspend your money better than you can spend it? Do you think we are \nwiser than you? Do you think we know your needs better than you know \nyour needs? Do you think we have this wisdom and insight and \nperspective that you as fathers and mothers, grandmothers and \ngrandfathers lack? Well, if you do--and that is a perfectly legitimate \nview; it is not one I share, but it is legitimate--then you want to \nsupport the President's program. But if you believe you could spend the \nmoney better, that you know a little bit more about taking care of your \nchildren and raising your family than the Government does, then you \nwant to support what Republicans want to do. You want to support going \ndown the fork in the road that we choose from this point. That is \nbasically the choice that we have.\n  Let me address two additional issues very briefly. If we have a \ntobacco settlement where we agree with the tobacco companies that they \nare going to pay the Government money--and the whole purpose of the \nsettlement that everybody forgets in this rush to spend the money is \nthat if there is a settlement the settlement is that the tobacco \ncompanies owe the taxpayers for the medical costs that have been \nimposed on the Federal Government as a result of people smoking--where \nhave those costs been imposed? Those costs have not been imposed on \nschool buildings or teachers. I'm not sure that smoking stunts your \ngrowth when you are a child but we know that it raises the probability \nthat you will have lung problems, heart problems, and numerous other \nhealth problems when you get older.\n\n[[Page S289]]\n\n  The cost of smoking borne by Medicare has been probably six dollars \nfor every one dollar that the States have spent on Medicaid because of \nsmoking. So if we are going to have a tobacco settlement, the cost that \nthe tobacco companies are paying to the Government is really to \ncompensate for the cost of Medicare.\n  So I don't think it is unreasonable that we ought to take that money \nand use it to save Medicare--not just for our parents but for our \nchildren.\n  So if there is a tobacco settlement, the money ought to go where the \nsettlement agrees it is for, and that is to compensate the taxpayer for \nmedical costs. And almost all of those costs at the Federal level are \nborne by Medicare.\n  Finally, if we are just simply going to raise taxes on cigarettes, \nthen we get back to the decision at this fork in the road as to whether \nif we are going to raise taxes on cigarettes to discourage people from \nsmoking, should we give the money back to Americans by cutting tax \nrates, or lowering the taxes in some way, or should we have the \nGovernment spend it and let the taxes which are already at historic \nhighs rise even further?\n  Again, there is no right or wrong here. It is a question of what \nAmericans want.\n  Finally, in protecting Social Security, I went to the State of the \nUnion Address, and I guess many people tuned in excited to hear what \nthe President was going to say about Social Security. The plain truth \nis, to my disappointment, the President said almost nothing about \nSocial Security. He has proposed no program whatsoever. He just simply \noutlined the $130 billion worth of new spending and then said to \nRepublicans, do not dare talk about cutting taxes because you need the \nsurplus to save Social Security.\n  The point is, if we want surpluses to save Social Security, we should \nnot spend the $130 billion to begin with.\n  How would you save Social Security? First of all, over the next 5 \nyears, $600 billion is going to be paid into Social Security above the \nlevel that we are actually paying out for Social Security benefits.\n  Under the President's budget, we spend $400 billion of it on general \nGovernment. I think we ought to take that money and invest it in Social \nSecurity. How would you do it? Let me tell you very briefly how I would \ndo it. Currently, workers pay 12.4 cents out of every dollar they earn \nin wages to Social Security. None of it represents a real investment, \nand it is all either paid out in benefits or spent on general \nGovernment. There is no trust fund. The trust fund exists as only a \npaper accounting system where the Government claims it owes money to \nSocial Security, but it does not count it as an external debt and when \nit pays interest, it does not count it as an expenditure of the \nGovernment.\n  What I would do is take that $100 billion a year being paid in above \nwhat we are spending and actually make investments that would be owned \nby individual workers. By doing that we can cut in half the long-term \nliability of Social Security.\n  So to sum up, since I know one of my other colleagues is here to \nspeak, we have come together on a bipartisan basis, Democrats and \nRepublicans, the President and Congress, with a unity of purpose to \nbalance the budget. We agree on that, and we are going to do it, and \nthat is no longer something we are debating. The question is where do \nwe go from here. Do we need more Government even though we have a \nrecord high tax rate, or do we need to let people keep more of what \nthey earn? That is the choice we face. That is what the debate is \nabout. And I hope people will understand it and make their choice. I \nbelieve they will choose freedom. They always have when they have had \nthe choice and when they have understood it. I believe that is the \nchoice they will make.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I appreciate very much the thoughtful remarks by the \nSenator from Texas.\n  We have been joined by our colleague from Arizona, and I yield 7 \nminutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Georgia and, of \ncourse, second the remarks just made by my colleague from Texas.\n  Mr. President, with the Federal Government apparently on the verge of \nits first unified budget surplus in nearly 30 years, many people are \nbeginning to ask what comes next, what should happen to the budget \nsurplus if and when it materializes. Should we spend it? Should we \nbegin to pay down the national debt? Should we provide hard-working \nAmerican families with some meaningful and, I would say, long overdue \ntax relief?\n\n  Before we try to answer those questions, I think it is worthwhile to \nrecall how we got here. Remember, it was not that long ago--in fact, it \nwas as recently as February of 1995--that President Clinton submitted a \nbudget that would have locked in annual deficits in the range of $200 \nbillion in the foreseeable future. A unanimous Senate rejected the \nClinton budget on May 19, 1995, and from that point on the debate took \na fundamental turn from whether to balance the Federal budget to how to \nbalance it.\n  During the last 3 years, we began to slow Federal spending growth. We \nhave eliminated 307 mostly small Federal programs. But perhaps the most \ndecisive factor has been what we did not do. We did not impose another \nlarge tax increase on already overtaxed families and businesses. And \nthat gave people enough room to do the things that they would naturally \ndo to result in an invigoration of our economy. In fact, the economy \nhas outperformed everyone's expectations, producing tens of billions of \ndollars in unanticipated revenues to the Treasury which has helped to \nclose this budget gap.\n  When the budget agreement passed last year, for example, deficits \nwere projected to go from $67 billion to $90 billion. The budget \nagreement allowed for substantial amounts of new spending before \nstarting down the path to balance in the year 2002. It was the \nexpectation of deficits in the interim that were higher, not lower, \nthat contributed to my decision to oppose last year's budget deal. It \nnow turns out that the 1997 budget deficit came in at only $22 billion \nand is projected to amount to about $5 billion in the current year, all \nbecause of the economy's robust performance and it comes in spite, I \nwould note, of the substantially increased spending allowed by the 1997 \nbudget.\n  So what ultimately we decide to do with the surplus--and again I \ncaution that projections are just that, projections--we ought to be \nsure that it sustains the economic growth that has gotten us to where \nwe are today. And that is why of the three possible approaches to \nutilizing this budget surplus, it seems to me the one that makes the \nmost sense is to return what we do not need to spend at the Federal \nGovernment level back to the hard-working families who earned it so \nthat they can make the decisions in their own lives as to how to spend \nthat surplus, thereby enabling us to continue the long term of economic \ngrowth which this country has been on now for the last many months and \nto ensure that robust economic growth continues to produce more \nrevenues to the Treasury in the future that can help us sustain both \nthe Federal budget and ensure that we do not have deficits in the \nfuture.\n  The President, of course, has taken a political road here. He is \nsuggesting that we should use the surplus for Social Security purposes. \nAs Senator Gramm pointed out, there is no indication as to how he would \ndo that, and as a matter of fact since the money going into the Social \nSecurity trust fund amounts to an IOU to the Social Security trust fund \nbecause it is then immediately spent by the Federal Government, we do \nnot put Social Security money in a shoe box here at the \nFederal Government level. What the President in fact is saying is \nsimply allow that money to be spent by the general fund of the U.S. \nGovernment, and I think that is unacceptable.\n\n  The other thing the President has said is, let's spend about $130 \nbillion on new programs. That is not what to do with the budget surplus \nthat may or may not materialize, and that in any event would put us on \na road to spending that money every year in the future. Clearly, we \ncannot sustain forever the kind of economic growth we\n\n[[Page S290]]\n\nhave today, and as a result we should not be embarking on new spending \nprograms that we are going to have to find new sources of revenue to \nsupport in the future.\n  Another thing we can do is to begin to pay down the national debt. \nGiven the fact we are paying almost $1 billion a day on interest on the \nnational debt, it makes sense for us to do that. So to the extent we do \nnot need the revenues for other purposes, we can devote part of that to \npaying down the national debt. But I suggest that the best way to \nensure that we can continue to have a robust economy, continue to gain \nthe receipts that we need to pay for Federal Government programs and \nalso to ensure that American families continue to receive some benefit \nfrom this economy is to provide that hard-working American family with \ntax relief to the extent that the budget surplus permits us to do so.\n  Clearly, the most effective from an economic point of view, what Alan \nGreenspan testified to the other day, if we are going to provide tax \nrelief, it should be in terms of marginal relief for all Americans. But \nto the extent that politically we are not able to do that this year and \nthat we need to do something in a targeted fashion, I think most of us \nagree the most beneficial kind of tax relief would be aimed at \neliminating the current marriage penalty which in effect has the \nGovernment of the United States supporting a policy which encourages \npeople who are living together, working but who are not married, to \ncontinue to stay unmarried because, after all, if they marry, then the \nsecond person's income is immediately put into the top bracket and they \nend up paying a lot more in taxes than they would if they remained \nunmarried. It should not be Government policy to be fostering that kind \nof family situation, and as a result the marriage penalty ought to be \none of our first targets for elimination to the extent we can spend any \nof this surplus for tax relief.\n  I use the word ``spend,'' Mr. President, and in closing I want to \nmake this point. That is the term that the budgeteers use, that the \npeople inside the beltway use when they talk about a surplus and \nputting it to ``good use.'' They talk about spending as if it were \nFederal Government money. And in the beneficence of the Federal \nGovernment we are going to give it back to the American people. The \ntruth of the matter is we should not have taken it from the American \npeople in the first place because, as it turns out, we did not need it \nand as a result the only right thing to do is for the Federal \nGovernment to return it to the American people in the form of tax \nrelief.\n  Again, I conclude by saying the benefits of that are twofold and \nsignificant. No. 1, American families are already way overtaxed, and \nthis enables them to provide more for their families in a way that they \ndeem most effective rather than somebody here in Washington, DC. But \nsecondly, because there is more family income at their disposal, to be \nspent, to be saved, and in saving to be invested in the American \neconomy, we can ensure that the economy continues to perform as it has \nwith the result that not only do we all have a better standard of \nliving but, of course, the Federal Government continues to get more \nrevenues because we have not changed basic tax rates. As long as those \nrates remain where they are, a robust economy is going to continue to \nallow the Federal Government to do just fine in terms of its \ncollections of revenue. That is why we can ensure that we can balance \nbudgets in the future, we can have plenty of money to begin paying down \nthat Federal debt, and we can provide tax relief to families and \nencourage a robust economy if we will use whatever surplus exists to \nreturn to the American people so that they can then spend it as they \nsee fit.\n\n  These are the options. I think that the Republican plan, which \nfocuses on debt reduction and tax relief, is the right way to go and \nthat the President's ideas for more spending, while they will get a \ncourteous listen here on Capitol Hill, are in the end not the best way \nto deal with the surplus that we might have and ultimately will have to \nbe rejected by the Congress.\n  I thank my colleague from Georgia for making this time available to \ndiscuss these important issues and look forward to our continuing \ndiscussions.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arizona for \nhis remarks and yield 7 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  I, too, thank the Senator from Georgia for getting the time in the \nChamber to talk about the President's budget submission and some of the \nthings that we hope Congress is willing to do in working with the \nbudget that we have. I concur with my friend from Arizona who just \nspoke and, before that, my senior colleague from Texas who talked about \nthe very clear choice we have in dealing with the budget issues.\n  The clear choice is, do you believe that we should increase \nGovernment spending by $123 billion this year or do you think the hard-\nworking American family should get back more of the money it has earned \nand worked for. And do you think we have a responsibility to our future \ngenerations to pay down the $5 trillion debt that has accumulated over \nthe last 40 years in our Congress.\n  That is the clear choice. I come down very strongly on the second \nchoice. The choice should be that we would do what is responsible for \nourselves and for future generations, and that is to pay one-half of \nany surplus we might have on the debt so that we start whittling it \ndown to a reasonable, manageable size. We cannot turn over to our \nchildren and grandchildren a bill of $5 trillion, that if we are in a \nrecession, will skyrocket their taxes in order to pay. The other half \nshould go back to the people who earned it. I never cease to be amazed \nat the way people who want to have more Government spending talk about \ntax cuts. They talk about tax cuts in terms of what is it going to cost \nthe Federal Government. I talk about tax cuts in terms of what is it \ngoing to cost the American family if we don't give back to them the \nmoney they worked so hard to earn, for them to decide what they would \nlike to spend it for in their own families. That is the difference in \nframing the question. And I am for the hard-working American family.\n\n  Most families in this country--in fact, the average family in this \ncountry pays 38 percent of what it earns in taxes. That is wrong. We do \nnot need to have that much Federal Government encroachment into the \npocketbooks of the American people. We do have responsibilities in \nGovernment, but we do not have to take such a chunk out of the hard-\nworking American's pocketbook if we manage our taxes and our spending \nresponsibly and if we are efficient in spending the taxpayer dollars.\n  So I would just say that I think the President has gone on the wrong \ntrack when he says we are going to have a surplus and therefore I want \nto increase spending by $123 billion. He is mortgaging the future of \nour children and he is saying I want to spend today and let's not think \nabout tomorrow. That is not what our responsibility is, as the stewards \nof our country and our Government.\n  So I am hoping we will do the right thing. I am hoping that as we are \nlooking at a level budget that we will also prioritize within that \nbudget and I hope we will remember, on the eve of potential problems \nand conflicts in the Middle East--that we will remember one of the main \nroles of the Federal Government is to provide for the national defense. \nIn fact, this budget does begin to stop the decline in spending for \nprocurement in our national defense. It does provide for a 3.1 percent \nincrease for our military personnel--well deserved. But it continues to \ndecrease the personnel strength. In fact, in this year's budget it \ndecreases another 43,000 in our troop strength from 1997 levels. We are \nalready at the lowest levels this country has been since the Korean \nwar.\n  There was the assumption after the cold war that somehow the world \nwas safer. But now, because we see escalating tensions in the Middle \nEast, because we know the North Koreans continue to train and build up \ntheir military, we see the conflicts around the world and the potential \nconflicts--and it is clear the world is not a safe place from which we \ncan retreat.\n  So I hope we will look at this drawing down of our strength. From \nDesert Storm levels, we will be down half a million in troop strength, \nfrom roughly 2 million, drawing down under this budget request of the \nPresident to 1.4\n\n[[Page S291]]\n\nmillion. I do not think that is responsible. In fact, at a time when \nthe Army had its worst recruiting year since 1979, I do not think it \nwould be prudent to put more responsibility on the thinning ranks of \nour troops who are leaving our armed services because of the overseas \ndeployments. So, I am going to stand for the strength of our national \ndefense, for that priority in our spending. I want to keep the other \nside, the increase in bureaucracy down, so our national defense stays \nup and so we can return to the taxpayers the hard-earned tax dollars \nthat they deserve; and that we start paying down the debt. That would \nbe my approach and I hope that is what Congress will do in the budget \ndeliberations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I understand the Presiding Officer, the Senator from \nWyoming, is our next presenter, and will soon be approaching his desk.\n  I yield up to 7 minutes to the Senator to make his presentation on \nthe budget, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). I recognize the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for \narranging for our discussion this morning. It seems to me it is one of \nthe most basic discussions that we will have during the year. Budgets, \nafter all, are sort of a map as to where we go. They are without great \ndetail, but sort of limit where we are going. They have to do with the \nrevenue that we anticipate raising. They have to do with the \nexpenditures, and generally where those expenditures will be. So, in \nterms of direction, in terms of what we really expect the Federal \nGovernment to do, the budget is extremely important.\n  Let me mention that the budget basically is done by the Congress. The \nPresident has been very outgoing in claiming credit for all the things \nthat have happened over the last few years, but the fact is the \nCongress is responsible for the spending. No spending can occur unless \nthe Congress agrees to it. No spending can be made in the Federal \nestablishment unless approved by the Congress. So the responsibility is \nhere, and I guess also you could say if there is any credit for having \ndone some downsizing over the past few years, it also goes here.\n  But I wanted to talk about something just a little bit different and \nthat is, frankly, my disappointment in the approach that is taken in \nthis case, and other cases as well; I am disappointed that when we have \nsomething to decide in our Government, all of our Government, that we \nare not more willing to lay things out as they are. I am, frankly, a \nlittle exasperated with all the spinning that goes on from almost \neveryone here, but frankly particularly from this administration, in \nsort of trying to say that things aren't really what they are. That is \nso discouraging, especially when we are in a time when there is greater \ncommunication availability to all the world, and certainly to the \nAmerican people, than there ever has been. So that if you ever thought \nof having Government of the people, for Heaven's sake, now we can do \nthat because everyone can know what the facts are. They are there \nautomatically.\n  Yet, as we go through these things, it is really difficult to \nunderstand what is being done because they are described one way at the \nWhite House, you know, as if this is a wonderful breakthrough and we \nare going to contain the size of the Government; that this is the end \nof the era of big Government. But the fact is, it is not. It is a \ngrowth. It is larger Government. It is more taxing. But it is hard to \nkind of decipher these things.\n  Let me read some material from James Miller, who was the OMB head in \nthe Reagan years. He is talking about the things that have been said, \nand what he thinks, at least, the real facts are. Miller says we have, \nin ``. . . the president's words, `the smallest government in 35 \nyears[.]' '' And yet, in 1963, ``at the height of Camelot,'' he calls \nit, ``total federal spending (in 1997 dollars''--1997 dollars, adjusted \nfor that--was $580 billion, with 48 percent going for defense. For 1998 \nthe federal government will spend $1,625 billion, of which 16 percent \nis for defense. And the President says ``the smallest Government in 35 \nyears.''\n  You know, that just is not the way it is. Now we are spending 15 \npercent for defense, as the Senator from Texas just described. Federal \nspending per capita was $3,069 in 1997 dollars in 1963. It is, today, \n$6,000. Spending per capita has doubled. The President says we have \n``the smallest Government in 35 years.'' The comparison is even more \ntelling when you include State and local governments--$4,100 per capita \nin 1963; $9,500 per capita now.\n  You know, it is really discouraging to try to deal and get people \ninvolved in making decisions as to what they think is best for this \ncountry when the facts are so distorted. There is nothing wrong with \nhaving it laid out there in real terms. This is a legitimate decision. \nThere are those who want more Government and more taxes and more \nexpenditures. That is a legitimate point of view. I don't happen to \nshare it. That is the liberal agenda. That is what we debate all the \ntime. The other alternative, of course, is to have less taxes, less \nspending, a less large Federal Government and move, more and more \ngovernmental functions closer to people. Those are legitimate debates. \nWhy it is, frankly, that we tend to hide those all the time under \nrhetoric I am not certain.\n  Let me give you another example. The President says, ``Under the \nleadership of Vice President Gore we have reduced the Federal payroll \nby 300,000 workers.'' According to the U.S. Office of Personnel \nManagement, between January 1993 and September 1997, Federal civil \nemployment fell by 254,000; 217,000 of that was attributable to \ndefense, the closing of bases, civilian workers in defense; 17,000 came \nfrom downsizing the Department of Veterans Affairs; and 14,000 more \nfrom completing the work on S's. This is not a reduction in the size \nof Government. But, you know, we are told that.\n\n  So, Madam President, I am hopeful, too, we can hold the caps we \nagreed upon last year, that the President agreed upon. I hope we can \ncontinue to move towards making the Government smaller and more \nefficient. I hope we do not continue to grow and to bring in new fees \nthat we don't recognize as taxes, although they are. So we have a great \nopportunity. All I ask is let us get it out there, debate it on the \nface of the real facts and not disguise it, trying to act as if it is \nsomething that it is really not.\n  Madam President, I yield now to the Senator from Kansas to complete \nour discussion for this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I appreciate the recognition and the \nstatement of the Senator from Wyoming, with which I associate myself.\n  I rise to make a few remarks on the President's $1.7 trillion budget \nproposal. Most people can't even recognize exactly what $1.7 trillion \nis, as a size, a quantity of money.\n  I believe one of the biggest challenges facing this second session of \nthe 105th Congress is to maintain the fiscal discipline that we \nexercised during consideration of the historic bipartisan budget \nagreement. Unfortunately, after reviewing the budget it appears that \nthe administration wants to walk away from that challenge, and that is \ntruly regrettable for Americans today, for Americans born in the \nfuture, and certainly for the baby boomers soon to be retiring--in less \nthan 15 years.\n  In this budget the President pretends to be fiscally responsible \nwhile at the same time calling for massive new spending programs, new \nprograms in many areas that he says were directed towards helping \nfamilies. But if the President really wants to help families, why \ndoesn't he propose ending the marriage penalty that penalizes people \nfor being married? Why doesn't he ask for marginal tax rate reduction? \nBut, instead, it's just proposing more of the same tax-and-spend \npolicies that have given us the era of big Government, which was \nsupposedly over. It appears as if the era of big Government is back \nwith a vengeance.\n  In contrast to the President, I believe that we must hold the line on \nthe size of the Government and reject attempts by this administration \nto bolster spending in violation of our bipartisan budget agreement. \nRemember, this bipartisan budget agreement was not just the product of \nlast year. It was something we have been struggling for\n\n[[Page S292]]\n\n3 years, to get an agreement on the budget. For 3 years we have been \nfighting about how can we restrain Federal spending, get it in line \nwith receipts so we could get to a balanced budget agreement. We have \nbeen struggling for 3 years on that, yet now, less than 7 months after \nthe agreement, the President is walking away. This is in gross \nviolation of this agreement. We cannot let the administration mortgage \naway our children's future in order to help satisfy this insatiable \nappetite for big Government spending. We must be able to deal with \nthese problems within the framework that we have already agreed to.\n  I just want to point out a few things, and I know some people have \nalready done this but in case we get carried with away with the idea \nthat now we have these surpluses and everything is rosy, we can spend \nto our heart's content, I don't know how many people realize, I hope \nmost do, that once we get to a balanced budget it has nothing to do \nwith the mortgage we already have on the country, which is $5.4 \ntrillion, over $20,000 per American. It has nothing to do with the \nunfunded obligations that we are on the hook for when the baby boomers \nand others start retiring, that extend to about $14 trillion in \naddition to the $5.4 trillion.\n\n  Here we are talking about being responsible for Medicare payments for \nwhen the baby boomers start retiring. We are talking about other \nentitlement programs that people have paid into, that there is an \nobligation by the Government, but we do not have funds set aside to \ntake care of these obligations.\n  So you are looking at taxing future generations more and more and \nmore to be able to meet those obligations at a time when, if we would \nexercise a minimum amount of fiscal discipline, just do the budget \nagreement we have already agreed to, we can start to deal with some of \nthese unfunded obligations.\n  In case people think this is a long way off in the future, the baby \nboomers start retiring in less than 15 years, and they are going to be, \ninstead of pulling the wagon, in the wagon saying, ``You obligated \nyourself, I paid into these funds, now I am calling on these.''\n  The percentage of the Federal Government, as a percentage of the \noverall economy, is at historically high levels, nearly 20 percent of \nthe economy. If the President wants all these new spending programs, \nwhy doesn't he propose equal cuts to other Government programs? Does \nanybody in this body allege that we don't have significant amounts of \nGovernment waste in spending? Let's cut those programs if he wants the \nnew spending programs, rather than adding more and more taxes and fees \nand burdens on the American public. That would be the way to deal with \nthis, is to try to get at some of the wasteful spending programs that \nwe already have.\n  I look forward to working with the administration on this budget, but \nwe cannot break this hard-fought bipartisan budget agreement on the \naltar of just more and more taxing and spending that keeps driving up \nthe cost of Government, keeps taking more and more from taxpayers, \nkeeps making it harder and harder for the average family to make a \nliving and to be able to support their own children like they would \nlike to do.\n  So I have great disappointment with what the administration has put \nforward in growing and in getting back to the era of bigger Government. \nI am afraid we are just going to have to push to maintain what our \nagreement was this past year. I think it is regretful that we are at \nthat point. Madam President, it seems as if we are. Thank you very \nmuch. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/03/senate-section/article/S287-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

MILLER, OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, TO BE A JUDGE OF THE UNITED \n                     STATES COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \ngo into executive session to consider two nominations which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nominations of Carlos R. \nMoreno, of California, to be United States District Judge for the \nCentral District of California and Christine O. C. Miller, of the \nDistrict of Columbia, to be a judge of the United States Court of \nFederal Claims.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to support the nominations \nof Carlos Moreno to the Federal district bench in the Central District \nof California and Christine O. Miller to the Court of Federal Claims.\n  I plan to discuss in greater detail why I intend to support these \njudges' nominations, but first I would like to address some of the \nconcerns that have been expressed with respect to the Senate's role in \nthe confirmation of Federal judges.\n  As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, one of the most \nimportant duties I hold or fulfill is in screening judicial nominees. \nIndeed, the Constitution itself obligates the Senate to provide the \nPresident with advice concerning his nominees and to consent to their \nultimate confirmation. Although some have complained about the pace at \nwhich the Senate has moved on judicial nominees, I would note that this \nbody has undertaken its constitutional obligation in a wholly \nappropriate fashion.\n  Indeed, the first matter to come before the Senate this session was \nconfirmation of three of President Clinton's judicial nominees. Senator \nLott is to be commended for giving these nominees early attention. As \nwell, the Judiciary Committee has announced judicial confirmation \nhearings for February 4 and February 25.\n  In 1997, the first session of the 105th Congress, the Senate \nconfirmed 36 judges. This is only slightly behind the historical \naverage of 41 judges confirmed during the first sessions in each of the \nlast five Congresses. And I would note the Judiciary Committee itself \nprocessed 47 nominees, including the two judges we are considering \ntoday.\n  Currently, there are 88 judicial vacancies in the judiciary, 85 if \nthe three nominees confirmed last week are included. In May 1992, \nhowever, when a Republican occupied the White House and the Democrats \ncontrolled the Senate, there were 117 vacancies on the Federal bench.\n  In fact, there are more sitting Federal judges today than there were \nthrough virtually all of the Reagan and Bush administrations. As of \ntoday, there are 756 active Federal judges. In addition, there are 432 \nsenior judges who must, by law, hear cases, albeit with a reduced load. \nOrdinarily, when a judge decides to leave the bench, he or she does not \ncompletely retire, but instead takes senior status. A judge who takes \nsenior status, as opposed to a judge who completely retires, must hear \na certain number of cases each year. Thus, when a judge leaves the \nbench, he or she does not stop working altogether, he or she merely \ntakes a somewhat reduced caseload.\n  Even in the ninth circuit, which has 10 vacancies, only one judge has \nactually stopped hearing cases. The others have all taken senior status \nand are still hearing cases. The total pool of Federal judges available \nto hear cases is 1,188, a record number of Federal judges.\n  The Republican Senate has confirmed the vast majority of President \nClinton's judicial nominees, and if the President continues to send us \nqualified nominees, I am sure that trend will continue. Let me say, \nhowever, that I will not vote to confirm judges who refuse to abide by \nthe rule of law. In my view, that is the absolute minimal qualification \nan individual must have to serve as one of our lifetime-appointed \nFederal judges.\n  Last year, I sought to steer the confirmation process in a way that \nkept it a fair and principled one, and exercised what I felt was the \nappropriate degree of deference to the President's judicial nominees. \nIt is in this spirit of fairness that I will vote to confirm Judge \nMiller and Judge Moreno.\n\n[[Page S293]]\n\n  Judge Moreno is currently a Los Angeles superior court judge. He was \nappointed to that position in 1993 by Governor Wilson. Prior to his \ncurrent appointment, Judge Moreno served as a municipal court judge, \nworked as an associate in the L.A. firm of Kelley, Drye & Warren, and \nserved as deputy city attorney in Los Angeles.\n  Judge Miller currently serves on the Court of Federal Claims. She was \nappointed to that position in 1983 by President Ronald Reagan. Judge \nMiller, before her judicial appointment, worked at the law firms of \nShack & Kimball, and then Hogan & Hartson. She also had the honor, \nafter graduating from the Utah College of Law, of clerking for the \nHonorable David Lewis, a Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals judge.\n  I think both these individuals will serve the Federal bench well and, \ntherefore, urge my colleagues to support them. I also would like to \nsubmit for the Record an editorial written by our leader, Senator Trent \nLott, which appeared on February 2 in the Washington Post, also a \nletter I wrote to the ABA discussing the Senate's work in confirming \nnominees. I ask unanimous consent that both those documents be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 2, 1998]\n\n                      Rehnquist's Rush to Judgment\n\n                            (By Trent Lott)\n\n       Chief Justice Rehnquist's 1997 year-end report has drawn \n     considerable press attention to the Senate's role in the \n     confirmation and appointment of federal judges. Good. It's \n     about time proper attention was given to these unique \n     government officials, who are appointed for life, paid \n     salaries that can run to nearly $145,000 and are provided \n     facilities and staff costing American taxpayers many millions \n     of dollars annually.\n       And if the cost of these judgeships and the judiciary \n     bureaucracy isn't enough to cause concern, consider the fact \n     that many such lifetime-appointed judges actually attempt to \n     make law from the bench. This is especially troubling when \n     federal judges seek to impose taxes on the public or turn \n     criminals loose on society.\n       The chief justice contends that federal judges are \n     underpaid and overworked and that the ``quality of justice'' \n     administered by the federal judiciary is in peril. He also \n     attempts to make an argument for more judges based on \n     statistics regarding, for example, the total caseload of all \n     district and circuit courts and the number of judicial \n     vacancies.\n       Interestingly, Rehnquist chooses to omit statistics that \n     hurt his case. In his report, he notes that the ``Senate \n     confirmed only 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in 1997, well under \n     the 101 judges it confirmed during 1994.''\n       True, the 17 judges confirmed in 1996 were certainly low as \n     compared with most other years. But in 1989, the Democrat-\n     controlled Senate confirmed 15 of President George Bush's \n     nominees. Moreover, the chief justice's reference to 1994 and \n     the confirmation of 101 judges that year is inappropriate, \n     because the Democrats controlled the Senate and the \n     presidency that year. Historically, the number and pace of \n     confirmations lessen when one party holds the White House and \n     the other the Senate. The large number of vacancies on the \n     bench in 1994 allowed Clinton to nominate many more judges \n     than in an average year, which accounts for the large number \n     of confirmations.\n       The chief justice also neglected to point out that Congress \n     has authorized an additional 250 judgeships since 1978 (now \n     totaling 849). Further, rather than retiring, many judges \n     take ``senior'' status, in which they continue to be paid, \n     have staff and decide cases. There are approximately 274 \n     district and 82 circuit judges on ``senior'' \n     status, contributing to the reduction of the workload of \n     ``active'' judges.\n       Almost every year, Congress receives a request from the \n     judiciary to add new judgeships to meet caseload increases. \n     The Committee on Long Range Planning of the Judicial \n     Conference projects that we will need 1,370 federal judges by \n     the year 2000, 2,350 judges by 2010 and 4,110 by 2020. \n     Clearly, the problems of caseload will have to be addressed \n     over the coming years. But merely creating new judgeships \n     will not provide solutions to such issues.\n       The chief justice also focused on the number of vacancies--\n     83--in the district and circuit courts. This number pales in \n     comparison with the 125 vacancies that occurred in 1993 \n     during President Clinton's first year, when the Democrats \n     controlled the Senate. The chief also failed to mention that \n     President Clinton has not submitted nominees to the Senate \n     for 41 of these vacancies.\n       Of the 13 nominees for circuit court judgeships, five were \n     went to the Senate less than 30 days from adjournment. Of the \n     28 district court nominees, three were sent to the Senate \n     within 30 days of adjournment, another three within 45 days \n     and one within 60 days of adjournment. Even the most partial \n     observers of the confirmation process recognize that more \n     than 60 days is required for investigation of a nominee's \n     education, experience and potential judicial temperament.\n       As noted by the chief justice, the judiciary characterizes \n     26 of the current 83 vacancies that have existed for more \n     than 18 months as ``judicial emergencies.'' There appears to \n     be no basis for this characterization other than the length \n     of time the position has been vacant and the notion that \n     every authorized position urgently needs to be filled. In \n     fact, one vacant position in the 4th Circuit, authorized in \n     1990, has never been filled, and President Clinton has not \n     nominated anyone to it. By the same token, he submitted \n     nominees just last year for two Texas district court \n     positions vacant since being authorized in 1990.\n       Clearly, the president did not view vacancies in any of \n     those positions as ``emergencies.'' In all, of the 26 \n     ``emergencies,'' only 12 apparently are deemed important \n     enough that the president has submitted nominations fill \n     them.\n       The pace of confirmation hasn't changed much in the Senate \n     since 1987. That was the year Democrats regained control of \n     the Senate and slowed the process of confirming Reagan \n     nominees. District court confirmations averaged 129 days and \n     circuit court confirmations 113 days in 1987. This pace \n     continued during the Bush administration, when Democrats \n     controlled the Senate. The experience of the Robert Bork, \n     Douglas Ginsberg and Clarence Thomas nominations to the \n     Supreme Court did much to further politicize an already \n     labor-intensive and time-consuming review process.\n       The pace quickened in 1993 and '94, when President \n     Clinton's district court nominees were confirmed on average \n     within 74 days of referral to the Democrat-controlled Senate. \n     The pace naturally slowed again when Republicans regained \n     control of the Senate.\n       The chief justice's dismal assessment of the judiciary is \n     not warranted. Congress will continue to closely monitor the \n     needs of the judiciary to fulfill its function as a separate \n     and equal branch of government. As a part of this process, \n     Congress will create and maintain such judgeships as are \n     necessary to empower the judiciary to accomplish the fair and \n     equal application of justice through the interpretation and \n     application of our laws.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 3, 1998.\n     Mr. Jerome Shestack,\n     President, American Bar Association, Philadelphia, PA.\n       Dear President Shestack: I am sorry that I could not attend \n     the American Bar Association's annual convention this year, \n     as I am at the World Economic Summit. I understand, however, \n     that Senator Patrick Leahy ably represents the Judiciary \n     Committee. Nevertheless, I thought it prudent to make you \n     aware of my views regarding the so-called judicial vacancies \n     issue, in which, I am sure, the ABA has great interest.\n       As you are doubtless aware, Chief Justice William Rehnquist \n     recently released his annual report on the federal judiciary. \n     In that report, he noted, among other things, the need \n     expeditiously to fill vacancies on the federal bench. The \n     Chief Justice's comments were very similar to those made over \n     the years, including 1992, when he urged the Senate to \n     confirm more of President Bush's judicial nominees. \n     Interestingly, 117 vacancies existed May 1992, compared with \n     the 88 we have today.\n       In 1997, the Senate confirmed 36 judges, only slightly \n     behind the historical average of 41 judges confirmed during \n     the first sessions in each of the last five Congresses. And \n     the Judiciary Committee itself processed 47 nominees during \n     the past session. There are currently more sitting judges \n     than there were throughout virtually all the Reagan and Bush \n     administrations. As of today, there are approximately 756 \n     active federal judges. In addition, there are 432 senior \n     judges who must continue to hear cases, albeit with a reduced \n     workload. That brings the total pool of federal judges \n     available to hear cases up to 1,188.\n       Despite claims to the contrary, the Senate has confirmed \n     the vast majority of President Clinton's nominees, and I am \n     confident that we will continue on a steady course this \n     session. I am basically pleased with the pace at which the \n     Judiciary Committee and the Senate have acted on the \n     President's nominees. Indeed, one of the Senate's first items \n     of business this session was to confirm three judicial \n     nominees, including Ann Aiken, a controversial nominee whom I \n     supported. We can, of course, always improve. I am hoping \n     that the Committee will establish a good working relationship \n     with the White House in this new year.\n       Such a relationship, however, does not mean that the \n     President has carte blanche to appoint judges. The \n     Constitution obligates the Senate to give advice to the \n     President on his nominees and ultimately to consent to them. \n     Under my stewardship, the Judiciary Committee will not simply \n     push nominees through just for the sake of filling \n     vacancies. Only recently, after the Judiciary Committee \n     had expeditiously reviewed and held hearings on two \n     nominees, did information surface that caused one of those \n     nominees to withdraw and that places the other's \n     confirmation prospects in question. If the Committee were \n     blindly to follow some sort of a timetable in processing \n     nominees, the federal bench would have been adversely \n     affected. Indeed, such a specific timetable could \n     encourage nominees to withhold relevant information from \n     the Committee in\n\n[[Page S294]]\n\n     the hope of forcing a vote. There is a good deal of \n     background research that must be done by the Committee \n     before it can send a nominee to the floor. If the \n     Committee fails to do its groundwork, it fails the Senate, \n     and thus prevents that body from fulfilling its \n     constitutional duty. I do not hold the President to any \n     sort of a timetable in selecting nominees; nor would I \n     expect others to place such burdens upon the Senate.\n       I would further note that the Chief Justice's report did \n     not focus solely on judicial vacancies. In fact, the primary \n     focus of his remarks was the increase in the federal \n     judiciary's workload. The Chief Justice complimented Congress \n     on its efforts to reform federal habeas corpus procedures and \n     to streamline prison litigation suits--two measures that he \n     indicated would be of great benefit to the judiciary. As I \n     recall, these were legislative measures the ABA opposed. \n     Nevertheless, I am hopeful that the ABA will be supportive of \n     further efforts to improve the judicial process.\n       In a similar vein, the Chief Justice expressed concern \n     about the expansion of federal jurisdiction. I hope in the \n     coming months to review the current status of federal \n     jurisdiction and to search for recommendations on how federal \n     courts might be freed from hearing cases more properly \n     brought in state courts. I think we must be vigilant in \n     searching for ways to utilize properly the federal courts' \n     limited resources.\n       Last year, I sought to steer the confirmation process in a \n     way that kept it a fair and principled one, and exercised \n     what I felt was the appropriate degree of deference to the \n     President's judicial nominees. Yet, the solution to an \n     increased judicial workload should not be simply to add more \n     judges or for the Senate to be held to some sort of a \n     confirmation timetable. I am confident that the Committee \n     will stay the course and continue to exercise its \n     constitutional duty in an appropriate manner. Thank you for \n     considering my views.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Orrin G. Hatch,\n                                                         Chariman.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am glad to be here with my good friend \nfrom Utah and welcome him back from a productive weekend.\n  Last week, I commended the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for \nscheduling the judicial confirmation hearing, the first of this year, \nfor tomorrow afternoon, and I commend the chairman again. I note that \nhe is following through on his earlier statement by including both \nMargaret McKeown of Washington State and Susan Oki Mollway of Hawaii at \nthat hearing. They have each been pending for over 18 months, and it \nwill be good to have their confirmation hearing.\n  I hope we will maintain pace this year that was established during \nthe last 9 weeks of the last session. In order to do that, I hope that \nin addition to these nominees we can proceed to confirm additional \nnominees for article III judicial vacancies before the end of the week.\n  I am delighted the Senate is getting the opportunity to consider the \nnomination of Judge Carlos Moreno to the United States District Court \nfor the Central District of California. He has been strongly supported \nby both Senators Feinstein and Boxer. They have both spoken to me about \nhim and strongly support him.\n  I have spoken often about the District Court of the Central District \nof California, its workload and the need to confirm qualified nominees \nfor the judicial vacancies that persist and are arising on that Court. \nI have spoken most often about that Court in connection with the \nlongstanding nomination of Margaret Morrow. It is my expectation that \nthe Senate will fulfill the commitment it made last year and proceed to \nthat nomination by the end of next week.\n  Judge Moreno received his undergraduate education at Yale College and \nhis law degree from Stanford Law School. He was a deputy city attorney \nin Los Angeles, as well as a municipal court judge before joining the \nLos Angeles Superior Court in 1993. Judge Moreno is currently serving \nthe people of California as a Judge of the California Superior Court. \nHe received high remarks from the American Bar Association and was \nreported by the Judiciary Committee on November 13, 1997, unanimously. \nI thank both the majority leader and my good friend from Utah for \nbringing him up this morning.\n  Along with Judge Moreno currently pending on the Senate calendar are \nMs. Morrow, two nominees for long-vacant judgeships in Illinois and a \nPennsylvania State court judge. I hope that we have a strong bipartisan \nvote in his favor.\n  I also expect that today the Senate will confirm the President's \njudgment in nominating and reappointing Judge Christine Miller to the \nCourt of Claims. The President's nomination of Judge Miller was \nreceived last year before her first term expired, but the Senate failed \nto act on it before adjournment last fall.\n  The President used his recess appointment power to reappoint Judge \nMiller and resubmitted her nomination. Today the Senate will reaffirm \nthe President's action and confirm her to a full term.\n  The Court of Claims is an important court. It is established by \nCongress under article I of the Constitution. No less than the Federal \njudiciary that is appointed to fill vacancies in the article III courts \nthat we speak about so often, the vacancies on the Court of Claims \nshould be filled and filled without delay.\n  Madam President, I hope that the distinguished Senator from Utah and \nI will be allowed by our caucuses to move forward on judges as quickly \nas possible. I know there is support in mine to do that.\n  Madam President, I see the distinguished Senator from California on \nthe floor and yield to her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank the ranking member, and I \nthank the Presiding Officer. I also would like to begin by thanking the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee for what was, by and \nlarge, a rapid and prompt processing of Carlos Moreno. I submitted the \nname of Carlos Moreno to the President for appointment to the District \nCourt from the Central District of California. In a sense, Madam \nPresident, I believe he is prototypical of really what a good Federal \njudge should bring to that office. I would like to just quickly go over \nwhat is an amazing success story.\n  Judge Moreno was born in East L.A., just 2 miles from the Federal \ncourthouse where he will be serving. He has earned the respect and \nadmiration of both the legal and the law community, and he has had 13 \nyears of service on the State courts. He has strong bipartisan support, \nincluding the endorsements of the former Governor George Deukmejian and \nLos Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block.\n  As the chairman of the committee pointed out, he obtained his \nbachelor's degree from Yale in 1970 and his J.D. from Stanford in 1975. \nHe began his legal career in the City Attorney's Office of Los Angeles \nwhere he worked for 4 years, from 1975 to 1979.\n  He prosecuted numerous jury trials, misdemeanor prosecutions, and \ncriminal and civil consumer protection cases. He worked as a litigation \nattorney for 7 years, handling commercial litigation in State and \nFederal courts. So he has experience in both the civil as well as the \ncriminal law. His caseload there included bankruptcy, wrongful \ntermination, banking, real estate, and antitrust.\n  In 1986 the Governor of California, George Deukmejian, appointed him \nto the municipal court. He served there for 7 years, handling 40 civil \njury trials in addition to a regular criminal trial workload.\n  In 1993, Governor Wilson elevated him to the California Superior \nCourt where he served for the past 4 years. He averaged approximately 2 \ndozen jury trials a year, at least a third of which have been \nhomicides. The remainder have consisted of a broad range of felonies \nand he has presided over about a dozen bench trials per year.\n  So, 13 years as a municipal and superior court judge. This year he \nwas selected as the superior court judge of the year by the criminal \nlaw section of the Los Angeles County Bar Association and was described \nas one who earns praise from both prosecutors and defense attorneys for \nhis fair, even-tempered handling of a high-volume calendar of criminal \ncases. The large number of court trials he handles in which both sides, \nboth sides, waive the jury and try the case before him is an indicator, \nI believe, of the trust he has received from opposing counsels.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord letters of support by George\n\n[[Page S295]]\n\nDeukmejian, former Governor; a letter from the District Attorney of Los \nAngeles County; and a letter from the Sheriff of Los Angeles County.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              Los Angeles, CA,\n\n                                                  October 6, 1997.\n     Re Judge Carlos R. Moreno.\n\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: It has come to my attention that Judge \n     Carlos Moreno has been nominated for an appointment to the \n     U.S. District Court, Central District of California.\n       In 1986, it was my pleasure to appoint him to the Compton \n     Municipal Court and in 1993 he was appointed by Governor Pete \n     Wilson to the Los Angeles Superior Court.\n       It is my understanding that he has performed in an \n     exemplary manner as a Municipal and Superior Court Judge and \n     has a clear perception of the importance of maintaining a \n     judicial system that insures fairness and social order.\n       Judge Moreno is well suited for this position. I am \n     confident that he has the appropriate judicial skills and in \n     light of his qualifications, I hope you will give him every \n     consideration for appointment to the U.S. District Court.\n           Most cordially,\n                                                George Deukmejian,\n     35th Governor of California.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Los Angeles County\n\n\n                                            District Attorney,\n\n                                     Los Angeles, CA, May 2, 1997.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator, San Francisco, CA.\n       Dear Dianne: Superior Court Judge Carlos R. Moreno has \n     informed me that he is seeking an appointment to the U.S. \n     District Court for the Central District of California, and I \n     am writing to strongly recommend his nomination and \n     confirmation.\n       Although Judge Moreno is not a personal acquaintance of \n     mine, I have had the opportunity to personally interview him \n     and to speak with several of my colleagues who have appeared \n     before him on many occasions. All of the persons I contacted \n     were effusive in their praise of the professional attributes \n     that Judge Moreno brings to the bench as a Superior Court \n     trial judge: he is fair, bright, willing to read with care \n     the lawyers' written motions, control his courtroom, and give \n     both sides fair hearings in his court. In addition, he \n     apparently relishes legal research and thoroughly \n     familiarizes himself with the issues of a case before he \n     gives a decision--a quality which would serve him well on the \n     Federal bench.\n       I do not make recommendations on behalf of those seeking \n     appointments lightly, and in fact, I turn down most requests. \n     However, the level of support and enthusiasm expressed by my \n     colleagues on behalf of Judge Moreno prompted me to agree to \n     interview him, and I found him during the interview to have \n     the personal attributes that I had been told he displays on a \n     daily basis in his court. I am confident Carlos Moreno would \n     serve as a District Court judge with distinction, and I \n     believe his appointment would be beneficial to the citizens \n     of California.\n           Very truly yours,\n\n\n                                                 Gil Garcetti,\n\n     District Attorney.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            County of Los Angeles,\n                                Monterey Park, CA, April 23, 1997.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     San Francisco, CA.\n       Dear Dianne: It has come to my attention that Los Angeles \n     County Superior Court Judge Carlos R. Moreno has indicated \n     his desire to be appointed a United States District Court \n     Judge for the Central District of California. I am pleased \n     and honored to give him my personal endorsement.\n       Judge Moreno has an extensive criminal justice background. \n     He has been a Judge of the Superior Court of Los Angeles \n     County since November of 1993. Prior to that, Judge Moreno \n     was a City Attorney with the City of Los Angeles from 1975 to \n     1979 where he handled criminal and civil consumer protection \n     prosecutions and legislative and politically sensitive \n     matters. He was a member of the law firm of Kelley, Drye & \n     Warren from 1979 to 1986, and in October 1986 Judge Moreno \n     was elected Judge of the Municipal Court. He held that seat \n     until his appointment to the Superior Court in 1993. \n     Throughout his tenure on the bench, he has continually \n     demonstrated the prerequisite abilities necessary to be a \n     fair, impartial, and knowledgeable jurist.\n       Judge Moreno is an extremely hard working individual of \n     impeccable character and integrity. His list of credits, both \n     professionally and within the community, is extensive.\n       I would like to recommend that you favorably consider his \n     appointment. I have no doubt that he would be a distinguished \n     addition to the United States District Court.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Sherman Block,\n                                                          Sheriff.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, to sum it up, I believe we have a \nman among men, a fine jurist, a fine attorney, skilled and \nknowledgeable in both criminal and civil law. This is the reason I \nrespectfully submit him as someone who is really prototypical of the \nkind and type of background that one might bring to the Federal \ndistrict court.\n  I thank the ranking member and I thank the chairman for the rapid \nprocessing of this distinguished nominee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I strongly support the nominations of \nCarlos Moreno and Christine Miller to serve as federal judges.\n  Judge Moreno is superbly qualified to serve as a federal judge in the \nCentral District of California. He is a graduate of Yale University, \nHarvard Business School, and Stanford Law School. Currently, he is a \njudge on the Los Angeles Superior Court. As a member of that court's \nTrial Delay Reduction Committee he was instrumental in establishing and \nenforcing policies that successfully reduced trial backlogs in Los \nAngeles County. At a time when lengthy backlogs are also plaguing the \nfederal courts, Judge Moreno's experience will be an important asset \nfor California's Central District Court.\n  Judge Miller is also well qualified to continue her service on the \nUnited States Court of Federal Claims. She has served on that court for \nthe past fifteen years, and President Clinton's nomination of her for a \nsecond fifteen-year term is a tribute to her ability and leadership.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to express my concern that the \nSenate has still not had a chance to vote on the nomination of Margaret \nMorrow to the federal district court for the Central District of \nCalifornia. Ms. Morrow was first nominated in May 1996. She was \napproved by the Judiciary Committee in June last year, and it is long \npast time for the Senate to vote on her nomination.\n  On average, it is taking twice as long for Senate Republicans to \nconfirm President Clinton's nominees as it took for Democrats to act on \nPresident Bush's nominations. But I am especially concerned about the \nRepublicans' record of subjecting women who are nominated for federal \njudgeships to far greater delays than men.\n  Women nominated to the federal courts are four times--four times--\nmore likely than men to be held up by the Republican Senate for more \nthan a year.\n  Last year, the Senate confirmed 30 men, but only 6 women. And, by \nconfirming only 36 judges, the Senate condemned many of our nation's \nbusiest courts to even lengthier delays in processing their civil \ncases.\n  There is no question that Margaret Morrow possesses the necessary \nqualifications to be confirmed. She is a Harvard-educated attorney and \na partner in a prestigious California law firm. She is the first woman \nto serve as the president of the California Bar Association. She is a \nwell-respected attorney and a role model for women in the legal \nprofession.\n  Yet action on her nomination has been delayed--like nine other \nnominees who have been waiting for more than 18 months--because the \nRepublicans are playing politics and preventing needed judicial \npositions from being filled.\n  When even a Republican Chief Justice criticizes the Republican \nCongress for refusing to move more quickly to confirm judges, you know \nsomething's wrong. The Chief Justice is deeply concerned about the \nlarge number of judicial vacancies on the federal courts. There are too \nfew judges to handle the workload.\n  The bottleneck in the Senate is jeopardizing the court system and \nundermining the quality of justice. Fewer than half of President \nClinton's nominees have been confirmed.\n  We owe it to Americans across the country to give these nominees a \nvote. If our Republican colleagues don't like them, vote against them. \nBut give them a vote.\n  The distinguished majority leader has rightly noted that the process \nof confirming judges is time-consuming. The Senate should take care to \nensure that only individuals acceptable to both the President and the \nSenate are confirmed. The President and the Senate do not always agree. \nBut it should not take longer to consider women than it does to \nconsider men.\n\n[[Page S296]]\n\n  Some Republicans claim they have slowed the confirmation process to \nprotect the federal courts from ``judicial activism.'' But this \nargument is a smokescreen. If President Clinton is actually nominating \njudicial activists, then why is it that these nominees are approved \noverwhelmingly when the Senate is finally allowed to vote on them? The \nclosest vote that we have had on any nominee in this Congress was the \n76 to 30 vote in favor of Ann Aiken last week.\n  The claim that Clinton judges are activist judges is a transparent \nruse being used to slow down the confirmation process. The reason is \nobvious. The Republican majority in Congress is doing all it can to \nprevent a Democratic President from naming judges to the federal \ncourts. The courts are suffering, and so is the nation.\n  In some areas of the country, people have to wait years to have their \ncases even heard in court. And then they have to wait years more for \noverburdened judges to find time to issue their decisions. Families, \nworkers, small businesses, women and minorities have traditionally \nlooked to the courts to resolve disputes. The lack of federal judges \nmakes the swift resolution of their cases impossible.\n  The number of cases filed in the federal appeals courts has grown by \n11 percent over the last six years. The average time between filing and \ndisposition has also increased. Courts with long-standing vacancies are \nin even worse shape.\n  In California's Central District Court, the Court to which both \nCarlos Moreno and Margaret Morrow have been nominated, the caseload has \ngrown by 15 percent since 1994. The time people have to wait for their \ncivil cases to be resolved has increased by 11 percent. In that \ndistrict, over 300 pending civil cases are more than three years old.\n  Across the country, real people are being hurt. In the Central \nDistrict of Illinois, a disabled Vietnam veteran who was fired after \nenduring harassment from his co-workers has been waiting over three and \na half years for a resolution to his case.\n  In the Southern District of Texas, 4,000 victims of a student loan \nfraud are waiting for the outcome of a class action suit that has been \npending for almost eight years.\n  In the District Court of South Carolina, there is still no decision \nin a suit filed more than six years ago against the state's \napportionment laws. The outcome of this case will affect hundreds of \nthousands of citizens. It goes to the heart of whether the basic \nconstitutional principle of ``one person, one vote'' is being fairly \napplied. The last communication the lead plaintiff received from the \nCourt was in June of last year.\n  In the Southern District of Florida, Julio Vasquez--a U.S. citizen \nmigrant worker--broke his leg in 1989 in a boarding house provided by \nhis employer. To this day, nearly nine years later, Mr. Vasquez has \nnever received sufficient medical attention, and his injury affects his \nability to work. He is still waiting for the judge's ruling in his \ncase.\n  These are typical victims of the vacancy crisis in the federal \ncourts. They are hard-working Americans injured on the job--citizens \nseeking to exercise their right to vote--students trying to get an \neducation--disabled veterans searching for justice.\n  I commend my colleagues for bringing two distinguished nominees to a \nvote today. I hope with this new year we will see a new day in moving \nahead to fill the vacancies in our courts and end these unconscionable \ndelays.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, on these judges today, I learned long \nago, and certainly have had it reiterated during my 23 years in the \nSenate, that it is not always wise to predict the outcome of votes. I \nhave been surprised before both pleasantly and unpleasantly. I have \nbeen surprised at some I thought might pass and failed to pass, and \nother times have had a very pleasant surprise to find something did \npass when I didn't expect it to.\n  I think it is safe to say--and I believe there will be bipartisan \nconsensus on this--that these judges' nominations will pass \noverwhelmingly, which is usually what happens with a judgeship.\n  Starting this year we have proceeded on more judicial nominations in \nthe first couple of weeks this session than we did over the course of \nthe first months last year.\n  I hope that we have strong bipartisan votes on these judgeships \ntoday. It will signal that the Senate is moving forward and that we \nwill make progress to help fill the vacancies that plague the Federal \njudiciary. Today, there are 86 vacancies on the Federal courts. After \nthese favorable votes, we will have 54 nominees pending before the \nSenate in need of our prompt attention. I have spoken with President \nClinton on a couple of occasions recently, urging the White House to \nmove quickly in sending up further nominations, and they are. We saw \nthat on the first day that we came back when a dozen new nominations \ncame up. We have 55 nominees pending. Almost two-thirds of the current \nvacancies have nominees pending to fill them.\n  Now I think it is time to say that for whatever reasons--political, \nideological or otherwise, for whatever reasons--the Senate went slowly \nlast year on nominations. The distinguished chairman and I want to be \nallowed by our respective caucuses to move forward, fulfilling our \nroles as chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, to \nmove nominations forward.\n  I do not question the integrity of the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, who has worked very hard on this, and has on more than one \noccasion strongly supported somebody who would not have been his \nnominee had he been the one appointing; in the same way, I have \nstrongly supported nominees of past Presidents who would not have been \nmine had I been the person making the nominations. But in both \ninstances, the Senator from Utah and I looked at a man or a woman of \nhigh qualifications, of good legal background, perhaps of a different \nbackground than our own, but somebody who would serve the interests of \njustice well, and we have pushed forward for their confirmation.\n  I hope, so that the U.S. Senate does not send the wrong image to the \nJudiciary and to the American people, that we would be able to move \nforward in the way the Senator from Utah and I have preferred to work \nin the past and move these judges, vote them in or vote them down.\n  I am not suggesting to any Senator how he or she should vote. If they \ndo not like a nominee, vote against that nominee. Give us a chance to \nvote on them, vote them up or vote them down, but keep the Federal \nJudiciary out of politics.\n  It is, after all, one of the linchpins of our democracy, this great \ndemocracy. We are the third most populous country in the world, the \nmost powerful nation on Earth, the most powerful democracy history has \never known. We maintain that power as a democracy and not a \ntotalitarian society. We maintain it largely because of the integrity \nand independence of our Federal Judiciary. They act as a break on a \nrunaway Executive or a runaway Congress because what they hold is their \ngreat shield and great bulwark. The Constitution of the United States \nis something that stands above all of us, whether as Members of the \nCongress, the Executive Branch or the Judiciary itself.\n  We need their integrity and we need their independence. With it, we \nguarantee the diversity of thought and the diversity of action that \nprotects our freedoms and our democracy--in this case, the greatest \ndemocracy on Earth.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on each of \nthe nominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                 Vote on Nomination of Carlos R. Moreno\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Carlos R. Moreno, of California, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Central District of California.\n\n[[Page S297]]\n\n  The clerk will call the roll on the first nomination.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

MILLER, OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, TO BE A JUDGE OF THE UNITED \n                     STATES COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \ngo into executive session to consider two nominations which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nominations of Carlos R. \nMoreno, of California, to be United States District Judge for the \nCentral District of California and Christine O. C. Miller, of the \nDistrict of Columbia, to be a judge of the United States Court of \nFederal Claims.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to support the nominations \nof Carlos Moreno to the Federal district bench in the Central District \nof California and Christine O. Miller to the Court of Federal Claims.\n  I plan to discuss in greater detail why I intend to support these \njudges' nominations, but first I would like to address some of the \nconcerns that have been expressed with respect to the Senate's role in \nthe confirmation of Federal judges.\n  As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, one of the most \nimportant duties I hold or fulfill is in screening judicial nominees. \nIndeed, the Constitution itself obligates the Senate to provide the \nPresident with advice concerning his nominees and to consent to their \nultimate confirmation. Although some have complained about the pace at \nwhich the Senate has moved on judicial nominees, I would note that this \nbody has undertaken its constitutional obligation in a wholly \nappropriate fashion.\n  Indeed, the first matter to come before the Senate this session was \nconfirmation of three of President Clinton's judicial nominees. Senator \nLott is to be commended for giving these nominees early attention. As \nwell, the Judiciary Committee has announced judicial confirmation \nhearings for February 4 and February 25.\n  In 1997, the first session of the 105th Congress, the Senate \nconfirmed 36 judges. This is only slightly behind the historical \naverage of 41 judges confirmed during the first sessions in each of the \nlast five Congresses. And I would note the Judiciary Committee itself \nprocessed 47 nominees, including the two judges we are considering \ntoday.\n  Currently, there are 88 judicial vacancies in the judiciary, 85 if \nthe three nominees confirmed last week are included. In May 1992, \nhowever, when a Republican occupied the White House and the Democrats \ncontrolled the Senate, there were 117 vacancies on the Federal bench.\n  In fact, there are more sitting Federal judges today than there were \nthrough virtually all of the Reagan and Bush administrations. As of \ntoday, there are 756 active Federal judges. In addition, there are 432 \nsenior judges who must, by law, hear cases, albeit with a reduced load. \nOrdinarily, when a judge decides to leave the bench, he or she does not \ncompletely retire, but instead takes senior status. A judge who takes \nsenior status, as opposed to a judge who completely retires, must hear \na certain number of cases each year. Thus, when a judge leaves the \nbench, he or she does not stop working altogether, he or she merely \ntakes a somewhat reduced caseload.\n  Even in the ninth circuit, which has 10 vacancies, only one judge has \nactually stopped hearing cases. The others have all taken senior status \nand are still hearing cases. The total pool of Federal judges available \nto hear cases is 1,188, a record number of Federal judges.\n  The Republican Senate has confirmed the vast majority of President \nClinton's judicial nominees, and if the President continues to send us \nqualified nominees, I am sure that trend will continue. Let me say, \nhowever, that I will not vote to confirm judges who refuse to abide by \nthe rule of law. In my view, that is the absolute minimal qualification \nan individual must have to serve as one of our lifetime-appointed \nFederal judges.\n  Last year, I sought to steer the confirmation process in a way that \nkept it a fair and principled one, and exercised what I felt was the \nappropriate degree of deference to the President's judicial nominees. \nIt is in this spirit of fairness that I will vote to confirm Judge \nMiller and Judge Moreno.\n\n[[Page S293]]\n\n  Judge Moreno is currently a Los Angeles superior court judge. He was \nappointed to that position in 1993 by Governor Wilson. Prior to his \ncurrent appointment, Judge Moreno served as a municipal court judge, \nworked as an associate in the L.A. firm of Kelley, Drye & Warren, and \nserved as deputy city attorney in Los Angeles.\n  Judge Miller currently serves on the Court of Federal Claims. She was \nappointed to that position in 1983 by President Ronald Reagan. Judge \nMiller, before her judicial appointment, worked at the law firms of \nShack & Kimball, and then Hogan & Hartson. She also had the honor, \nafter graduating from the Utah College of Law, of clerking for the \nHonorable David Lewis, a Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals judge.\n  I think both these individuals will serve the Federal bench well and, \ntherefore, urge my colleagues to support them. I also would like to \nsubmit for the Record an editorial written by our leader, Senator Trent \nLott, which appeared on February 2 in the Washington Post, also a \nletter I wrote to the ABA discussing the Senate's work in confirming \nnominees. I ask unanimous consent that both those documents be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 2, 1998]\n\n                      Rehnquist's Rush to Judgment\n\n                            (By Trent Lott)\n\n       Chief Justice Rehnquist's 1997 year-end report has drawn \n     considerable press attention to the Senate's role in the \n     confirmation and appointment of federal judges. Good. It's \n     about time proper attention was given to these unique \n     government officials, who are appointed for life, paid \n     salaries that can run to nearly $145,000 and are provided \n     facilities and staff costing American taxpayers many millions \n     of dollars annually.\n       And if the cost of these judgeships and the judiciary \n     bureaucracy isn't enough to cause concern, consider the fact \n     that many such lifetime-appointed judges actually attempt to \n     make law from the bench. This is especially troubling when \n     federal judges seek to impose taxes on the public or turn \n     criminals loose on society.\n       The chief justice contends that federal judges are \n     underpaid and overworked and that the ``quality of justice'' \n     administered by the federal judiciary is in peril. He also \n     attempts to make an argument for more judges based on \n     statistics regarding, for example, the total caseload of all \n     district and circuit courts and the number of judicial \n     vacancies.\n       Interestingly, Rehnquist chooses to omit statistics that \n     hurt his case. In his report, he notes that the ``Senate \n     confirmed only 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in 1997, well under \n     the 101 judges it confirmed during 1994.''\n       True, the 17 judges confirmed in 1996 were certainly low as \n     compared with most other years. But in 1989, the Democrat-\n     controlled Senate confirmed 15 of President George Bush's \n     nominees. Moreover, the chief justice's reference to 1994 and \n     the confirmation of 101 judges that year is inappropriate, \n     because the Democrats controlled the Senate and the \n     presidency that year. Historically, the number and pace of \n     confirmations lessen when one party holds the White House and \n     the other the Senate. The large number of vacancies on the \n     bench in 1994 allowed Clinton to nominate many more judges \n     than in an average year, which accounts for the large number \n     of confirmations.\n       The chief justice also neglected to point out that Congress \n     has authorized an additional 250 judgeships since 1978 (now \n     totaling 849). Further, rather than retiring, many judges \n     take ``senior'' status, in which they continue to be paid, \n     have staff and decide cases. There are approximately 274 \n     district and 82 circuit judges on ``senior'' \n     status, contributing to the reduction of the workload of \n     ``active'' judges.\n       Almost every year, Congress receives a request from the \n     judiciary to add new judgeships to meet caseload increases. \n     The Committee on Long Range Planning of the Judicial \n     Conference projects that we will need 1,370 federal judges by \n     the year 2000, 2,350 judges by 2010 and 4,110 by 2020. \n     Clearly, the problems of caseload will have to be addressed \n     over the coming years. But merely creating new judgeships \n     will not provide solutions to such issues.\n       The chief justice also focused on the number of vacancies--\n     83--in the district and circuit courts. This number pales in \n     comparison with the 125 vacancies that occurred in 1993 \n     during President Clinton's first year, when the Democrats \n     controlled the Senate. The chief also failed to mention that \n     President Clinton has not submitted nominees to the Senate \n     for 41 of these vacancies.\n       Of the 13 nominees for circuit court judgeships, five were \n     went to the Senate less than 30 days from adjournment. Of the \n     28 district court nominees, three were sent to the Senate \n     within 30 days of adjournment, another three within 45 days \n     and one within 60 days of adjournment. Even the most partial \n     observers of the confirmation process recognize that more \n     than 60 days is required for investigation of a nominee's \n     education, experience and potential judicial temperament.\n       As noted by the chief justice, the judiciary characterizes \n     26 of the current 83 vacancies that have existed for more \n     than 18 months as ``judicial emergencies.'' There appears to \n     be no basis for this characterization other than the length \n     of time the position has been vacant and the notion that \n     every authorized position urgently needs to be filled. In \n     fact, one vacant position in the 4th Circuit, authorized in \n     1990, has never been filled, and President Clinton has not \n     nominated anyone to it. By the same token, he submitted \n     nominees just last year for two Texas district court \n     positions vacant since being authorized in 1990.\n       Clearly, the president did not view vacancies in any of \n     those positions as ``emergencies.'' In all, of the 26 \n     ``emergencies,'' only 12 apparently are deemed important \n     enough that the president has submitted nominations fill \n     them.\n       The pace of confirmation hasn't changed much in the Senate \n     since 1987. That was the year Democrats regained control of \n     the Senate and slowed the process of confirming Reagan \n     nominees. District court confirmations averaged 129 days and \n     circuit court confirmations 113 days in 1987. This pace \n     continued during the Bush administration, when Democrats \n     controlled the Senate. The experience of the Robert Bork, \n     Douglas Ginsberg and Clarence Thomas nominations to the \n     Supreme Court did much to further politicize an already \n     labor-intensive and time-consuming review process.\n       The pace quickened in 1993 and '94, when President \n     Clinton's district court nominees were confirmed on average \n     within 74 days of referral to the Democrat-controlled Senate. \n     The pace naturally slowed again when Republicans regained \n     control of the Senate.\n       The chief justice's dismal assessment of the judiciary is \n     not warranted. Congress will continue to closely monitor the \n     needs of the judiciary to fulfill its function as a separate \n     and equal branch of government. As a part of this process, \n     Congress will create and maintain such judgeships as are \n     necessary to empower the judiciary to accomplish the fair and \n     equal application of justice through the interpretation and \n     application of our laws.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 3, 1998.\n     Mr. Jerome Shestack,\n     President, American Bar Association, Philadelphia, PA.\n       Dear President Shestack: I am sorry that I could not attend \n     the American Bar Association's annual convention this year, \n     as I am at the World Economic Summit. I understand, however, \n     that Senator Patrick Leahy ably represents the Judiciary \n     Committee. Nevertheless, I thought it prudent to make you \n     aware of my views regarding the so-called judicial vacancies \n     issue, in which, I am sure, the ABA has great interest.\n       As you are doubtless aware, Chief Justice William Rehnquist \n     recently released his annual report on the federal judiciary. \n     In that report, he noted, among other things, the need \n     expeditiously to fill vacancies on the federal bench. The \n     Chief Justice's comments were very similar to those made over \n     the years, including 1992, when he urged the Senate to \n     confirm more of President Bush's judicial nominees. \n     Interestingly, 117 vacancies existed May 1992, compared with \n     the 88 we have today.\n       In 1997, the Senate confirmed 36 judges, only slightly \n     behind the historical average of 41 judges confirmed during \n     the first sessions in each of the last five Congresses. And \n     the Judiciary Committee itself processed 47 nominees during \n     the past session. There are currently more sitting judges \n     than there were throughout virtually all the Reagan and Bush \n     administrations. As of today, there are approximately 756 \n     active federal judges. In addition, there are 432 senior \n     judges who must continue to hear cases, albeit with a reduced \n     workload. That brings the total pool of federal judges \n     available to hear cases up to 1,188.\n       Despite claims to the contrary, the Senate has confirmed \n     the vast majority of President Clinton's nominees, and I am \n     confident that we will continue on a steady course this \n     session. I am basically pleased with the pace at which the \n     Judiciary Committee and the Senate have acted on the \n     President's nominees. Indeed, one of the Senate's first items \n     of business this session was to confirm three judicial \n     nominees, including Ann Aiken, a controversial nominee whom I \n     supported. We can, of course, always improve. I am hoping \n     that the Committee will establish a good working relationship \n     with the White House in this new year.\n       Such a relationship, however, does not mean that the \n     President has carte blanche to appoint judges. The \n     Constitution obligates the Senate to give advice to the \n     President on his nominees and ultimately to consent to them. \n     Under my stewardship, the Judiciary Committee will not simply \n     push nominees through just for the sake of filling \n     vacancies. Only recently, after the Judiciary Committee \n     had expeditiously reviewed and held hearings on two \n     nominees, did information surface that caused one of those \n     nominees to withdraw and that places the other's \n     confirmation prospects in question. If the Committee were \n     blindly to follow some sort of a timetable in processing \n     nominees, the federal bench would have been adversely \n     affected. Indeed, such a specific timetable could \n     encourage nominees to withhold relevant information from \n     the Committee in\n\n[[Page S294]]\n\n     the hope of forcing a vote. There is a good deal of \n     background research that must be done by the Committee \n     before it can send a nominee to the floor. If the \n     Committee fails to do its groundwork, it fails the Senate, \n     and thus prevents that body from fulfilling its \n     constitutional duty. I do not hold the President to any \n     sort of a timetable in selecting nominees; nor would I \n     expect others to place such burdens upon the Senate.\n       I would further note that the Chief Justice's report did \n     not focus solely on judicial vacancies. In fact, the primary \n     focus of his remarks was the increase in the federal \n     judiciary's workload. The Chief Justice complimented Congress \n     on its efforts to reform federal habeas corpus procedures and \n     to streamline prison litigation suits--two measures that he \n     indicated would be of great benefit to the judiciary. As I \n     recall, these were legislative measures the ABA opposed. \n     Nevertheless, I am hopeful that the ABA will be supportive of \n     further efforts to improve the judicial process.\n       In a similar vein, the Chief Justice expressed concern \n     about the expansion of federal jurisdiction. I hope in the \n     coming months to review the current status of federal \n     jurisdiction and to search for recommendations on how federal \n     courts might be freed from hearing cases more properly \n     brought in state courts. I think we must be vigilant in \n     searching for ways to utilize properly the federal courts' \n     limited resources.\n       Last year, I sought to steer the confirmation process in a \n     way that kept it a fair and principled one, and exercised \n     what I felt was the appropriate degree of deference to the \n     President's judicial nominees. Yet, the solution to an \n     increased judicial workload should not be simply to add more \n     judges or for the Senate to be held to some sort of a \n     confirmation timetable. I am confident that the Committee \n     will stay the course and continue to exercise its \n     constitutional duty in an appropriate manner. Thank you for \n     considering my views.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Orrin G. Hatch,\n                                                         Chariman.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am glad to be here with my good friend \nfrom Utah and welcome him back from a productive weekend.\n  Last week, I commended the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for \nscheduling the judicial confirmation hearing, the first of this year, \nfor tomorrow afternoon, and I commend the chairman again. I note that \nhe is following through on his earlier statement by including both \nMargaret McKeown of Washington State and Susan Oki Mollway of Hawaii at \nthat hearing. They have each been pending for over 18 months, and it \nwill be good to have their confirmation hearing.\n  I hope we will maintain pace this year that was established during \nthe last 9 weeks of the last session. In order to do that, I hope that \nin addition to these nominees we can proceed to confirm additional \nnominees for article III judicial vacancies before the end of the week.\n  I am delighted the Senate is getting the opportunity to consider the \nnomination of Judge Carlos Moreno to the United States District Court \nfor the Central District of California. He has been strongly supported \nby both Senators Feinstein and Boxer. They have both spoken to me about \nhim and strongly support him.\n  I have spoken often about the District Court of the Central District \nof California, its workload and the need to confirm qualified nominees \nfor the judicial vacancies that persist and are arising on that Court. \nI have spoken most often about that Court in connection with the \nlongstanding nomination of Margaret Morrow. It is my expectation that \nthe Senate will fulfill the commitment it made last year and proceed to \nthat nomination by the end of next week.\n  Judge Moreno received his undergraduate education at Yale College and \nhis law degree from Stanford Law School. He was a deputy city attorney \nin Los Angeles, as well as a municipal court judge before joining the \nLos Angeles Superior Court in 1993. Judge Moreno is currently serving \nthe people of California as a Judge of the California Superior Court. \nHe received high remarks from the American Bar Association and was \nreported by the Judiciary Committee on November 13, 1997, unanimously. \nI thank both the majority leader and my good friend from Utah for \nbringing him up this morning.\n  Along with Judge Moreno currently pending on the Senate calendar are \nMs. Morrow, two nominees for long-vacant judgeships in Illinois and a \nPennsylvania State court judge. I hope that we have a strong bipartisan \nvote in his favor.\n  I also expect that today the Senate will confirm the President's \njudgment in nominating and reappointing Judge Christine Miller to the \nCourt of Claims. The President's nomination of Judge Miller was \nreceived last year before her first term expired, but the Senate failed \nto act on it before adjournment last fall.\n  The President used his recess appointment power to reappoint Judge \nMiller and resubmitted her nomination. Today the Senate will reaffirm \nthe President's action and confirm her to a full term.\n  The Court of Claims is an important court. It is established by \nCongress under article I of the Constitution. No less than the Federal \njudiciary that is appointed to fill vacancies in the article III courts \nthat we speak about so often, the vacancies on the Court of Claims \nshould be filled and filled without delay.\n  Madam President, I hope that the distinguished Senator from Utah and \nI will be allowed by our caucuses to move forward on judges as quickly \nas possible. I know there is support in mine to do that.\n  Madam President, I see the distinguished Senator from California on \nthe floor and yield to her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank the ranking member, and I \nthank the Presiding Officer. I also would like to begin by thanking the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee for what was, by and \nlarge, a rapid and prompt processing of Carlos Moreno. I submitted the \nname of Carlos Moreno to the President for appointment to the District \nCourt from the Central District of California. In a sense, Madam \nPresident, I believe he is prototypical of really what a good Federal \njudge should bring to that office. I would like to just quickly go over \nwhat is an amazing success story.\n  Judge Moreno was born in East L.A., just 2 miles from the Federal \ncourthouse where he will be serving. He has earned the respect and \nadmiration of both the legal and the law community, and he has had 13 \nyears of service on the State courts. He has strong bipartisan support, \nincluding the endorsements of the former Governor George Deukmejian and \nLos Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block.\n  As the chairman of the committee pointed out, he obtained his \nbachelor's degree from Yale in 1970 and his J.D. from Stanford in 1975. \nHe began his legal career in the City Attorney's Office of Los Angeles \nwhere he worked for 4 years, from 1975 to 1979.\n  He prosecuted numerous jury trials, misdemeanor prosecutions, and \ncriminal and civil consumer protection cases. He worked as a litigation \nattorney for 7 years, handling commercial litigation in State and \nFederal courts. So he has experience in both the civil as well as the \ncriminal law. His caseload there included bankruptcy, wrongful \ntermination, banking, real estate, and antitrust.\n  In 1986 the Governor of California, George Deukmejian, appointed him \nto the municipal court. He served there for 7 years, handling 40 civil \njury trials in addition to a regular criminal trial workload.\n  In 1993, Governor Wilson elevated him to the California Superior \nCourt where he served for the past 4 years. He averaged approximately 2 \ndozen jury trials a year, at least a third of which have been \nhomicides. The remainder have consisted of a broad range of felonies \nand he has presided over about a dozen bench trials per year.\n  So, 13 years as a municipal and superior court judge. This year he \nwas selected as the superior court judge of the year by the criminal \nlaw section of the Los Angeles County Bar Association and was described \nas one who earns praise from both prosecutors and defense attorneys for \nhis fair, even-tempered handling of a high-volume calendar of criminal \ncases. The large number of court trials he handles in which both sides, \nboth sides, waive the jury and try the case before him is an indicator, \nI believe, of the trust he has received from opposing counsels.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord letters of support by George\n\n[[Page S295]]\n\nDeukmejian, former Governor; a letter from the District Attorney of Los \nAngeles County; and a letter from the Sheriff of Los Angeles County.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              Los Angeles, CA,\n\n                                                  October 6, 1997.\n     Re Judge Carlos R. Moreno.\n\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: It has come to my attention that Judge \n     Carlos Moreno has been nominated for an appointment to the \n     U.S. District Court, Central District of California.\n       In 1986, it was my pleasure to appoint him to the Compton \n     Municipal Court and in 1993 he was appointed by Governor Pete \n     Wilson to the Los Angeles Superior Court.\n       It is my understanding that he has performed in an \n     exemplary manner as a Municipal and Superior Court Judge and \n     has a clear perception of the importance of maintaining a \n     judicial system that insures fairness and social order.\n       Judge Moreno is well suited for this position. I am \n     confident that he has the appropriate judicial skills and in \n     light of his qualifications, I hope you will give him every \n     consideration for appointment to the U.S. District Court.\n           Most cordially,\n                                                George Deukmejian,\n     35th Governor of California.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Los Angeles County\n\n\n                                            District Attorney,\n\n                                     Los Angeles, CA, May 2, 1997.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator, San Francisco, CA.\n       Dear Dianne: Superior Court Judge Carlos R. Moreno has \n     informed me that he is seeking an appointment to the U.S. \n     District Court for the Central District of California, and I \n     am writing to strongly recommend his nomination and \n     confirmation.\n       Although Judge Moreno is not a personal acquaintance of \n     mine, I have had the opportunity to personally interview him \n     and to speak with several of my colleagues who have appeared \n     before him on many occasions. All of the persons I contacted \n     were effusive in their praise of the professional attributes \n     that Judge Moreno brings to the bench as a Superior Court \n     trial judge: he is fair, bright, willing to read with care \n     the lawyers' written motions, control his courtroom, and give \n     both sides fair hearings in his court. In addition, he \n     apparently relishes legal research and thoroughly \n     familiarizes himself with the issues of a case before he \n     gives a decision--a quality which would serve him well on the \n     Federal bench.\n       I do not make recommendations on behalf of those seeking \n     appointments lightly, and in fact, I turn down most requests. \n     However, the level of support and enthusiasm expressed by my \n     colleagues on behalf of Judge Moreno prompted me to agree to \n     interview him, and I found him during the interview to have \n     the personal attributes that I had been told he displays on a \n     daily basis in his court. I am confident Carlos Moreno would \n     serve as a District Court judge with distinction, and I \n     believe his appointment would be beneficial to the citizens \n     of California.\n           Very truly yours,\n\n\n                                                 Gil Garcetti,\n\n     District Attorney.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            County of Los Angeles,\n                                Monterey Park, CA, April 23, 1997.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     San Francisco, CA.\n       Dear Dianne: It has come to my attention that Los Angeles \n     County Superior Court Judge Carlos R. Moreno has indicated \n     his desire to be appointed a United States District Court \n     Judge for the Central District of California. I am pleased \n     and honored to give him my personal endorsement.\n       Judge Moreno has an extensive criminal justice background. \n     He has been a Judge of the Superior Court of Los Angeles \n     County since November of 1993. Prior to that, Judge Moreno \n     was a City Attorney with the City of Los Angeles from 1975 to \n     1979 where he handled criminal and civil consumer protection \n     prosecutions and legislative and politically sensitive \n     matters. He was a member of the law firm of Kelley, Drye & \n     Warren from 1979 to 1986, and in October 1986 Judge Moreno \n     was elected Judge of the Municipal Court. He held that seat \n     until his appointment to the Superior Court in 1993. \n     Throughout his tenure on the bench, he has continually \n     demonstrated the prerequisite abilities necessary to be a \n     fair, impartial, and knowledgeable jurist.\n       Judge Moreno is an extremely hard working individual of \n     impeccable character and integrity. His list of credits, both \n     professionally and within the community, is extensive.\n       I would like to recommend that you favorably consider his \n     appointment. I have no doubt that he would be a distinguished \n     addition to the United States District Court.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Sherman Block,\n                                                          Sheriff.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, to sum it up, I believe we have a \nman among men, a fine jurist, a fine attorney, skilled and \nknowledgeable in both criminal and civil law. This is the reason I \nrespectfully submit him as someone who is really prototypical of the \nkind and type of background that one might bring to the Federal \ndistrict court.\n  I thank the ranking member and I thank the chairman for the rapid \nprocessing of this distinguished nominee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I strongly support the nominations of \nCarlos Moreno and Christine Miller to serve as federal judges.\n  Judge Moreno is superbly qualified to serve as a federal judge in the \nCentral District of California. He is a graduate of Yale University, \nHarvard Business School, and Stanford Law School. Currently, he is a \njudge on the Los Angeles Superior Court. As a member of that court's \nTrial Delay Reduction Committee he was instrumental in establishing and \nenforcing policies that successfully reduced trial backlogs in Los \nAngeles County. At a time when lengthy backlogs are also plaguing the \nfederal courts, Judge Moreno's experience will be an important asset \nfor California's Central District Court.\n  Judge Miller is also well qualified to continue her service on the \nUnited States Court of Federal Claims. She has served on that court for \nthe past fifteen years, and President Clinton's nomination of her for a \nsecond fifteen-year term is a tribute to her ability and leadership.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to express my concern that the \nSenate has still not had a chance to vote on the nomination of Margaret \nMorrow to the federal district court for the Central District of \nCalifornia. Ms. Morrow was first nominated in May 1996. She was \napproved by the Judiciary Committee in June last year, and it is long \npast time for the Senate to vote on her nomination.\n  On average, it is taking twice as long for Senate Republicans to \nconfirm President Clinton's nominees as it took for Democrats to act on \nPresident Bush's nominations. But I am especially concerned about the \nRepublicans' record of subjecting women who are nominated for federal \njudgeships to far greater delays than men.\n  Women nominated to the federal courts are four times--four times--\nmore likely than men to be held up by the Republican Senate for more \nthan a year.\n  Last year, the Senate confirmed 30 men, but only 6 women. And, by \nconfirming only 36 judges, the Senate condemned many of our nation's \nbusiest courts to even lengthier delays in processing their civil \ncases.\n  There is no question that Margaret Morrow possesses the necessary \nqualifications to be confirmed. She is a Harvard-educated attorney and \na partner in a prestigious California law firm. She is the first woman \nto serve as the president of the California Bar Association. She is a \nwell-respected attorney and a role model for women in the legal \nprofession.\n  Yet action on her nomination has been delayed--like nine other \nnominees who have been waiting for more than 18 months--because the \nRepublicans are playing politics and preventing needed judicial \npositions from being filled.\n  When even a Republican Chief Justice criticizes the Republican \nCongress for refusing to move more quickly to confirm judges, you know \nsomething's wrong. The Chief Justice is deeply concerned about the \nlarge number of judicial vacancies on the federal courts. There are too \nfew judges to handle the workload.\n  The bottleneck in the Senate is jeopardizing the court system and \nundermining the quality of justice. Fewer than half of President \nClinton's nominees have been confirmed.\n  We owe it to Americans across the country to give these nominees a \nvote. If our Republican colleagues don't like them, vote against them. \nBut give them a vote.\n  The distinguished majority leader has rightly noted that the process \nof confirming judges is time-consuming. The Senate should take care to \nensure that only individuals acceptable to both the President and the \nSenate are confirmed. The President and the Senate do not always agree. \nBut it should not take longer to consider women than it does to \nconsider men.\n\n[[Page S296]]\n\n  Some Republicans claim they have slowed the confirmation process to \nprotect the federal courts from ``judicial activism.'' But this \nargument is a smokescreen. If President Clinton is actually nominating \njudicial activists, then why is it that these nominees are approved \noverwhelmingly when the Senate is finally allowed to vote on them? The \nclosest vote that we have had on any nominee in this Congress was the \n76 to 30 vote in favor of Ann Aiken last week.\n  The claim that Clinton judges are activist judges is a transparent \nruse being used to slow down the confirmation process. The reason is \nobvious. The Republican majority in Congress is doing all it can to \nprevent a Democratic President from naming judges to the federal \ncourts. The courts are suffering, and so is the nation.\n  In some areas of the country, people have to wait years to have their \ncases even heard in court. And then they have to wait years more for \noverburdened judges to find time to issue their decisions. Families, \nworkers, small businesses, women and minorities have traditionally \nlooked to the courts to resolve disputes. The lack of federal judges \nmakes the swift resolution of their cases impossible.\n  The number of cases filed in the federal appeals courts has grown by \n11 percent over the last six years. The average time between filing and \ndisposition has also increased. Courts with long-standing vacancies are \nin even worse shape.\n  In California's Central District Court, the Court to which both \nCarlos Moreno and Margaret Morrow have been nominated, the caseload has \ngrown by 15 percent since 1994. The time people have to wait for their \ncivil cases to be resolved has increased by 11 percent. In that \ndistrict, over 300 pending civil cases are more than three years old.\n  Across the country, real people are being hurt. In the Central \nDistrict of Illinois, a disabled Vietnam veteran who was fired after \nenduring harassment from his co-workers has been waiting over three and \na half years for a resolution to his case.\n  In the Southern District of Texas, 4,000 victims of a student loan \nfraud are waiting for the outcome of a class action suit that has been \npending for almost eight years.\n  In the District Court of South Carolina, there is still no decision \nin a suit filed more than six years ago against the state's \napportionment laws. The outcome of this case will affect hundreds of \nthousands of citizens. It goes to the heart of whether the basic \nconstitutional principle of ``one person, one vote'' is being fairly \napplied. The last communication the lead plaintiff received from the \nCourt was in June of last year.\n  In the Southern District of Florida, Julio Vasquez--a U.S. citizen \nmigrant worker--broke his leg in 1989 in a boarding house provided by \nhis employer. To this day, nearly nine years later, Mr. Vasquez has \nnever received sufficient medical attention, and his injury affects his \nability to work. He is still waiting for the judge's ruling in his \ncase.\n  These are typical victims of the vacancy crisis in the federal \ncourts. They are hard-working Americans injured on the job--citizens \nseeking to exercise their right to vote--students trying to get an \neducation--disabled veterans searching for justice.\n  I commend my colleagues for bringing two distinguished nominees to a \nvote today. I hope with this new year we will see a new day in moving \nahead to fill the vacancies in our courts and end these unconscionable \ndelays.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, on these judges today, I learned long \nago, and certainly have had it reiterated during my 23 years in the \nSenate, that it is not always wise to predict the outcome of votes. I \nhave been surprised before both pleasantly and unpleasantly. I have \nbeen surprised at some I thought might pass and failed to pass, and \nother times have had a very pleasant surprise to find something did \npass when I didn't expect it to.\n  I think it is safe to say--and I believe there will be bipartisan \nconsensus on this--that these judges' nominations will pass \noverwhelmingly, which is usually what happens with a judgeship.\n  Starting this year we have proceeded on more judicial nominations in \nthe first couple of weeks this session than we did over the course of \nthe first months last year.\n  I hope that we have strong bipartisan votes on these judgeships \ntoday. It will signal that the Senate is moving forward and that we \nwill make progress to help fill the vacancies that plague the Federal \njudiciary. Today, there are 86 vacancies on the Federal courts. After \nthese favorable votes, we will have 54 nominees pending before the \nSenate in need of our prompt attention. I have spoken with President \nClinton on a couple of occasions recently, urging the White House to \nmove quickly in sending up further nominations, and they are. We saw \nthat on the first day that we came back when a dozen new nominations \ncame up. We have 55 nominees pending. Almost two-thirds of the current \nvacancies have nominees pending to fill them.\n  Now I think it is time to say that for whatever reasons--political, \nideological or otherwise, for whatever reasons--the Senate went slowly \nlast year on nominations. The distinguished chairman and I want to be \nallowed by our respective caucuses to move forward, fulfilling our \nroles as chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, to \nmove nominations forward.\n  I do not question the integrity of the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, who has worked very hard on this, and has on more than one \noccasion strongly supported somebody who would not have been his \nnominee had he been the one appointing; in the same way, I have \nstrongly supported nominees of past Presidents who would not have been \nmine had I been the person making the nominations. But in both \ninstances, the Senator from Utah and I looked at a man or a woman of \nhigh qualifications, of good legal background, perhaps of a different \nbackground than our own, but somebody who would serve the interests of \njustice well, and we have pushed forward for their confirmation.\n  I hope, so that the U.S. Senate does not send the wrong image to the \nJudiciary and to the American people, that we would be able to move \nforward in the way the Senator from Utah and I have preferred to work \nin the past and move these judges, vote them in or vote them down.\n  I am not suggesting to any Senator how he or she should vote. If they \ndo not like a nominee, vote against that nominee. Give us a chance to \nvote on them, vote them up or vote them down, but keep the Federal \nJudiciary out of politics.\n  It is, after all, one of the linchpins of our democracy, this great \ndemocracy. We are the third most populous country in the world, the \nmost powerful nation on Earth, the most powerful democracy history has \never known. We maintain that power as a democracy and not a \ntotalitarian society. We maintain it largely because of the integrity \nand independence of our Federal Judiciary. They act as a break on a \nrunaway Executive or a runaway Congress because what they hold is their \ngreat shield and great bulwark. The Constitution of the United States \nis something that stands above all of us, whether as Members of the \nCongress, the Executive Branch or the Judiciary itself.\n  We need their integrity and we need their independence. With it, we \nguarantee the diversity of thought and the diversity of action that \nprotects our freedoms and our democracy--in this case, the greatest \ndemocracy on Earth.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on each of \nthe nominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                 Vote on Nomination of Carlos R. Moreno\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Carlos R.

Mr. President, 85 years ago today, the 16th Amendment to \nthe United States Constitution was ratified, giving Congress the power \nto levy an income tax on the people. As we mark this occasion, I rise \nto call upon Congress to take immediate action to end the federal tax \ncode as we know it, and end 85 years of ever-increasing hardship for \nAmerica's taxpayers.\n  Let me focus on how we got here and why we need real tax reform.\n  Mr. President, this great Nation was born out of a revolt against the \nabusive taxing powers of its motherland. This tax revolt created a \nnation of individual liberty. In this land, a person owns himself, his \nlabor, and the fruit of his labor. To protect individual liberty, our \nfounders crafted Clause 4 of Article I, Section 9 of the U.S. \nConstitution, rejecting all direct income taxes that were not \napportioned to each State by its population.\n  This clause, as originally adopted in the Constitution, clearly \nreflected the genius, wisdom, and experience of our founders--\nprotecting individual liberty by limiting the Government's power to \ntax. For more than 100 years following the founding of this nation, the \nAmerican people enjoyed tax freedom and did not pay any income taxes. \nAlthough an income tax was imposed as a temporary measure to finance \nthe Civil War in 1862, it was repealed shortly after the war ended.\n  In the same period--during the last decade of the 18th, the entire \n19th, and first decade of the 20th century--the Supreme Court also \ndefended this freedom and held the income tax to be unconstitutional. \nHowever, under the direct influence of the rise of socialism in Europe \nat that time, on February 3rd, 1913, the 16th Amendment to the \nConstitution was ratified. The 16th Amendment says:\n\n       ``The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on \n     incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment \n     among the several States, and without regard to any census or \n     enumeration.''\n\n  Mr. President, in my view, nothing has been more damaging to \nAmerica's families than the 16th Amendment. It opened a Pandora's box \nwe have never since been able to contain. A few months after the \nAmendment was ratified, the Revenue Act of 1913 was enacted, imposing \nan individual income tax. The ratification of the 16th Amendment and \nenactment of the first tax code fundamentally eroded individual liberty \nand created the shadow of servitude that has darkened our Nation since.\n  Former IRS Commissioner T. Coleman Andrews said the 16th Amendment, \nin effect, repealed Article Four of the Bill of Rights. The 16th \nAmendment has empowered tax collectors to invade our citizen's homes, \npapers, and private affairs. Worse still, it is used for social \nengineering, redistributing private income, and promoting class \nwarfare.\n  Initially, the income tax did not apply to individuals with taxable \nincomes less than $3,000, which in today's dollars means that people \nwith incomes of $44,000 or lower would be exempted from paying tax. It \nonly imposed a one-percent tax on the first $20,000, which equals over \n$300,000 in today's dollars. The highest tax rate was up to 7 percent \nfor income above $500,000, which equals over $8 million today.\n  Less than one percent of all Americans paid any income tax in 1913. \nOnly 5 percent of Americans paid any income tax as late as 1939, before \nWorld War II. Then came the New Deal, which tripled Government \nspending, producing a large Federal budget deficit.\n  It was the Second World War that gave the Government an excuse to \nenact the first mass income tax increase in U.S. history. The lowest \ntax rate rose from 4 percent on income over $4,000 to 23 percent on \nincome over $2,000. Higher taxes were accompanied\n\n[[Page S298]]\n\nby a withholding system that took money out of each worker's paycheck, \nrather than requiring them to pay their taxes in one lump-sum payment \nat the end of the year. After the war, tax rates and Federal revenue \nreceded somewhat, but never returned to prewar levels.\n  Today, the Federal tax burden is at an historic high. For the average \nworker, more than three hours of every eight-hour working day are \ndedicated just to paying taxes. The average American family spends more \non taxes than it does on food, clothing, transportation, and housing \ncombined. A typical median-income family can expect to pay nearly 40 \npercent of its income in Federal, State, and local taxes. This. In \n1996, an average household with an annual income between $22,500 and \n$30,000 paid an average of $9,000 for food, clothing, and housing and \npaid $11,000 in total taxes.\n  Households with incomes ranging from $45,000 to $60,000 averaged \n$16,000 for basic necessities, and paid the tax collector $25,000. If \nthe ``hidden taxes'' that result from the high cost of Government \nregulations are factored in, a family today gives up more than 50 \npercent of its annual income to the Government. The budget submitted \nyesterday by the President continues this pattern of growing Federal \nintrusion into the taxpayers' daily lives.\n  While I have always called for a smaller, more efficient Government, \nthe President's budget endorses just the opposite. While I want to \nclose down Government agencies that do not perform their duties, the \nPresident wants to give them more money. That includes the Department \nof Energy, a taxpayer-financed black hole for which the President wants \nto boost spending by another 8 percent next year.\n  Overall, it appears the President would increase Federal spending by \n$135 billion and raise taxes and fees by $115 billion to pay for all \nthat new spending. And the President's scheme to help fund his laundry \nlist of new initiatives by using $65.5 billion in tobacco settlement \nproceeds is risky--if a settlement does not occur, then where do the \ndollars come from? Even higher taxes? I know some of my colleagues take \noffense when I use the phrase ``Washington's big spenders.'' But I \ncannot think of any euphemism in which to couch what is happening here.\n  This is a budget cooked up by big spenders and served to a taxpaying \npublic that did not order it and does not want it. But that has long \nbeen the pattern in Washington.\n  To make matters worse, as the tax burden has grown higher and more \nunfair, the government tax collector, the IRS, has turned into an \narrogant, inefficient, cold-hearted, heavy-handed, intrusive, and \nabusive bureaucracy. We have heard many horror stories about how IRS \nagents routinely use their enormous coercive power to squeeze more \nmoney out of the taxpayer's pockets to meet the demands of ever-\nincreasing Government spending. Not only do people pay more taxes, but \nthey spend more time and money calculating their tax burden. Our tax \nsystem has become extremely complicated and difficult to understand, \neven for IRS experts. Do you know the tax code was only 14 pages long \nwhen it was first enacted, but today it has grown to 10,000 pages, and \non top of that, there are another 20 volumes of tax regulations, and \nthousands and thousands of pages of instructions and other guidance. \nThe current tax code is anti-family and anti-economic growth. It \ndestroys economic opportunity, hinders job creation, impedes \nproductivity, and retards competitiveness. It has deepened despair and \ndisaffection among the poor and disadvantaged. It encourages abuse, \nwaste, and corruption.\n  Our Nation faces many great challenges in the 21st century. But \nwithout real change, the present tax system will fail to lead us there. \nWe must fix the system. To correct the problem once and for all, \nCongress must pass new legislation to fundamentally reform our tax \nsystem and replace the ever-more-complicated tax code with one that is \nsimpler, fairer, and more friendly to the taxpayers.\n  The American people deserve a new tax code that promotes harmony \namong people instead of promoting class warfare; a new tax code that \nencourages work and savings; a new code that rewards families and \nsuccess rather than penalizing them; a new code that stimulates real \neconomic growth and produces more jobs and higher tax revenue for the \nGovernment; a new tax code that allows people to keep more of their own \nmoney.\n  Congress should explore all possible solutions to achieve these \nobjectives. The 85th anniversary of the 16th Amendment's ratification \nis an ignoble occasion. I urge my colleagues to reflect on this day and \nwhat it has come to mean to America's struggling taxpayers. And I urge \nthem to join me in a pledge to the people that we will not let another \nanniversary come and go before we dedicate ourselves to ending the tax \ncode as we know it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will just take a few minutes to speak \nabout an individual and a case that is now taking place in the State of \nOregon. The individual I refer to is one Casey Martin, an outstanding \ngolfer who just happens to have a disability. I am also referring to \nthe PGA Tour's determination to exclude Casey from participating in a \nprofessional sport for which he is eminently well qualified and by \nwhich he has attempted to earn his living. The PGA Tour has said no, \nCasey can't play with the cart he needs to accommodate his disability. \nThe Tour wants to keep Casey out because of his disability and because \nof a certain rule and tradition.\n  Mr. President, Casey Martin has had the guts and the gumption not to \nback down, but to take on the PGA Tour.\n  Last week, Senator Dole and I held a press conference in Washington, \nDC, with Casey Martin to show our support for him and to state for the \nrecord that as two of the primary sponsors of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, it certainly was our intention, and the legislative \nintent, to cover this type of a situation. We wanted to state for the \nrecord that the ADA did, in fact, apply to the Casey Martin situation.\n  Yesterday, Casey Martin's case started. His trial began in Oregon.\n  Casey Martin has a powerful story. He has worked, he has practiced, \nhe has played, he has spent an enormous amount of time and energy--a \nlot of it painful--reaching the highest levels of one of America's most \npopular professional sports. It has been for him a very difficult road. \nNow Casey stands at a roadblock, much like the roadblock that millions \nof Americans with disabilities have confronted--Americans who each and \nevery day only ask for reasonable accommodations and modifications that \nwill allow them to live their lives and pursue their dreams just like \neveryone else.\n  We passed the Americans with Disabilities Act to give Casey Martin, \nand others with disabilities, an equal opportunity to fully participate \nin American life. That means in everything--employment, education, \nrecreation, social activities and opportunities. I have often said that \nADA really stands for the ``American Dream for All.'' That is what it \nis all about, and that is what it is about in this case, too--will \nCasey Martin have the opportunity to pursue his American dream?\n  I would like to take a moment to compliment those who have already \nshown their support for Casey Martin. Particularly, I would like to \ncongratulate Mr. Phil Knight and all of the folks at Nike. Their \ncommercial that they are running now showcasing Casey Martin makes a \nvery powerful statement about the ability of people who also happen to \nhave disabilities.\n  I would also like to compliment the golfers, like Greg Norman and Tom \nLatham, two outstanding golfers, who have publicly stated their support \nfor Casey Martin.\n  Mr. President, I am here to say that Casey Martin should have an \nopportunity to compete in the PGA Tour and to say that the ADA \nguarantees him that right. As Senator Dole said last week at our press \nconference, PGA does not stand for ``please go away,'' and the PGA Tour \nshouldn't try to send Casey Martin away from a game for which he is \notherwise well-qualified. Casey is someone who spent his entire life \nplaying golf; he played in college, along with Tiger Woods, at Stanford \nin the NCAA; he is a golfer who, with his disability, recently won one \nof the tours,\n\n[[Page S299]]\n\na Nike tour in Lakeland, Florida. So this man is eminently well-\nqualified to play professional golf.\n  I am disappointed--I am sorely disappointed--in the PGA Tour's \nfailure to reach an agreement with Casey, to come to some kind of an \naccommodation that would allow him to compete and earn his living being \na professional golfer.\n  As I understand it, the sticking point here is the PGA Tour's \ntradition and rule of no carts. Well, Mr. President, I believe there \nare values to upholding traditions and rules, but there is no merit in \nrigidly standing on tradition simply because of outmoded assumptions.\n  Over the years, all kinds of traditions have scuttled the aspirations \nand limited the possibilities of millions of Americans with \ndisabilities. People with disabilities just didn't do certain things. I \nalways tell the story about my brother who I grew up with who had a \ndisability. He became deaf at an early age. He was sent away to the \nIowa School for the Deaf and Dumb--that is what it was called in those \ndays, the School for the Deaf and Dumb. The Presiding Officer sitting \nin the Chair may be a few years younger than I am, but I remember when \nI was younger, that is what they called deaf people, they were deaf and \ndumb. As my brother said to me, ``I may be deaf, but I am not dumb.'' \nSo we have done away with that tradition. We don't refer to people as \ndeaf and dumb, and we don't have deaf and dumb schools any longer \neither.\n\n  But when he went to that school, they told him he could be one of \nthree things: He could be a baker, a shoe cobbler or a printer's \nassistant. That was it. There was nothing else he could do. ``That is \nit, you can pick one of those three things.''\n  He said, ``I don't want to be any one of them.''\n  They said, ``Fine, you are going to be a baker then.''\n  Tradition and rules had it that deaf people could only do certain \nthings. That has all gone by the wayside. We see deaf Americans now \ndoing everything. Why, we even have a person who is deaf who is the \npresident of a college. So we have done away with a lot of these old \ntraditions, and the ADA is helping to change the old traditions. It is \nasking us to rethink our assumptions about people with disabilities and \nwhat they can do. It is asking us to look at reasonable modifications \nthat would permit them, as I said, to pursue their American dream.\n  The ADA is intended to include people in the mainstream of American \nlife. It requires entities to make--and I quote from the law--\n``reasonable modifications'' to ``policies, practices and procedures'' \nso long as those modifications do not create a ``fundamental \nalteration'' to the program or activity.\n  So, Mr. President, rules and traditions that create barriers for \npeople with disabilities are rules and traditions that must be changed.\n  I am reminded of a recent incident here in the Senate, where we were \nasked to make a reasonable modification to a Senate policy. A staff \nperson with a vision impairment was precluded from coming on to the \nSenate floor with her guide dog because we had a no-animals rule on the \nfloor. Certainly, it sounded like a very reasonable rule and tradition. \nWe don't want animals running all over the floor of the Senate. You \ndon't want me bringing my pet dog on to the Senate floor. Well, that \nwas a rule and tradition.\n  So we had a debate about whether we should change the rule to \naccommodate the needs of the staff person. We talked about the history, \nthe traditions of the Senate. Ultimately, we did the right thing. We \nmade a reasonable modification to that rule and that tradition so the \nstaff person could do her job and bring her dog on to the Senate floor.\n  Allowing Casey Martin to use a golf cart is a reasonable modification \nunder the Americans with Disabilities Act. The cart will help level the \nplaying field a little on which Casey Martin competes without giving \nhim an undo advantage. What we are talking about here goes to the heart \nof the principles and the foundation of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct.\n  The PGA Tour can say all they want, that a cart somehow alters the \nfundamental operation of the golf game. Yet, if that is so, then why do \nthey allow carts to be used on the Senior Tour? Why do they allow carts \nto be used in the qualifying rounds for the younger people?\n  When the court enjoined the PGA Tour and said, yes, the Tour must \nallow Casey to use a cart, and he used a cart, the Tour said, ``We will \nlet everybody use carts.'' I am told that out of 168 golfers, only 15 \ndecided to use a golf cart. I thought to myself, if a golf cart gives \nplayers that much of an advantage, why wouldn't everyone use them?\n  So I consulted some of my golfing friends. I am not a golfer, but I \nhave friends who are avid golfers. One individual told me, ``Well, \nthere is nothing like walking a golf course, because when you walk, you \nfeel the wind and you see how often it gusts and you know what \ndirection it is blowing in. You get a feel for the lay of the fairway, \nand you can think about your next shot and what went wrong on the last \none. You get in a golf cart and you lose all that feel.''\n  I have tested this hypothesis with other golfers, and they say, \n``Yes, that is true.''\n  Allowing Casey Martin to use a golf cart will not give him \nany advantage at all in the PGA Tour. In fact, it may very well present \na disadvantage. So, again, I just think this is one of those old rules \nand traditions that needs a reasonable modification under the ADA so \nthat Casey Martin can compete in professional golf.\n\n  Lastly, Mr. President, Casey Martin may not fit the stereotype of \nwhat the PGA considers a competitive golfer, but millions of Americans \nwho don't fit the typical image of a golfer have now taken up the game. \nIt has moved from an exclusive sport played at private country clubs to \nan inclusive sport played by a cross-section of Americans.\n  When I was growing up in my State of Iowa, I bet I could count on one \nhand the number of golf courses in the State of Iowa, all at private \ncountry clubs, exclusively played by those people who belonged to those \nclubs. We have 99 counties in Iowa, Mr. President. I bet you every one \nhas a golf course now. Some of them have more than one. Farmers out in \nthe field get off the tractor and come in and play a game of golf. So \nit is no longer this sort of exclusive game it once was. Everyone is \nplaying golf. Barriers to the sport have come down.\n  As I said earlier, barriers and traditions that prevent people with \ndisabilities from fully participating are barriers and traditions that \nmust come down. Holding up a barrier for Casey Martin sends exactly the \nwrong message not only to Americans with disabilities but to each and \nevery one of us.\n  I am sorry that the PGA Tour saw fit to take this to court. They \nfirst tried to argue that they weren't even covered by the ADA, when \nthe law was plain on its face they were covered. They went to court \nand, of course, the court threw that out and said, ``Of course, you are \ncovered.'' Now they are back in court again to drag this thing out.\n  I wish they hadn't done it, because that very action alone tends to \ncreate a chilling effect. A lot of Americans will say, ``Well, I may \nhave a disability, but if I want to do something and there is a rule or \ntradition against it, do you mean I have to go to court? Do you mean I \nhave to hire lawyers? I have to go through all that just to get my \nrights?''\n  That is the message the PGA Tour, by going to court, is sending to \nAmericans all over this country.\n  Mr. President, people with disabilities get up every morning, and \nthey have a tough day ahead of them. They have to prepare for that day, \nmany times with the aid of an assistant, perhaps they have to use a \nwheelchair or get in a special bus to go to work. It takes a lot of \neffort, a lot of time. They don't have the time and they don't want to \ngo to court, but they want the Americans with Disabilities Act to work. \nPeople with disabilities want entities like the PGA Tour to use some \ncommon sense and some common decency to make reasonable modifications \nso that people like Casey Martin can pursue their American dreams.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/03/senate-section/article/S298-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S299-S300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I speak from the floor of the Senate as \na Democrat but really to all of my colleagues, and to the President, as \nwell.\n  I think that President Clinton's State of the Union Address was, \nindeed, an important step forward for our country in some of the \ninitiatives that he outlined. When the President talked about education \nand talked about child care and talked about health care, I think what \nhe said resonated with people throughout the country. I think it has a \nlot to do with the fact that people are less interested in denunciation \nand more interested in enunciation. They really want to know what it is \nwe stand for and whether or not we are thinking seriously, all of us, \neven if we have disagreement on some of these issues, about where our \ncountry needs to be.\n  In that sense, what the President talked about was an important step \nforward. First, a response to what some of my colleagues had to say on \nthe floor of the Senate, and then a response to some of the President's \ninitiatives and to Democrats. On the Republican side, I think the \nargument that has been made, that I have heard colleagues make on the \nfloor of Senate--and I summarize what any number of different \nRepublican colleagues have said--in many ways amounts to the argument \nthat when it comes to the most pressing issues of people's lives, there \nis nothing the Government really can or should do. This is not an \nappropriate role for the Government to play--to assure that there is \naffordable child care for working families, to assure that there is \naffordable health care, to invest in more teachers in our schools, \nreducing class size, and so forth. Quite frankly, that argument is a \ngreat argument for people who own their own large corporations or are \nwealthy, but it doesn't work for most of the people in the country. \nMost of the people in Minnesota and most of the people in the country \nare very focused, as I have said on the floor of Senate, as to how they \ncan earn a decent living and how they can raise their children \nsuccessfully.\n  The President's proposals speak to that, at least part of the way. \nBut what concerns me about what the President said, and I give credit \nwhere credit is due, what concerns me about the way in which Democrats \nare speaking about these proposals, is I think that we can do much \nbetter. This is our opportunity. The business cycle is up. We all talk \nabout economic performance. This is the time where we can really make \nsome of these critical investments.\n  Mr. President, what I worry about is that we give the speeches, there \nis a lot of hype. We talk about the importance of early childhood \ndevelopment, we talk about the importance of education, we talk about \nhealth care, but we do not invest enough resources to put this on a \nscale where it is really going to make a significant difference. If we \ndon't do that, if we have such a downsized politics and policy that we \nonly reach a tiny fraction of those people that we are talking about, \nthose children, those working families, then I think it invites mutiny \nbecause it becomes just symbolic politics.\n  Let me give a few examples. Mr. President, as far as I can determine \nwhen we talk about child care, without going into all the statistics, \nand we think about families with incomes of $35,000 a year and under, \nwe will probably reach, with the amount of resources the President has \ntalked about investing in early childhood development, about 2 out of \n10 children who could benefit--2 out of 10 children. If it is so \ncompelling, and if the evidence is irreducible and irrefutable that we \nhave to get it right for these children by age 3 otherwise many of them \nwill never do well in school and will never be prepared for life, then \nwhy are we only investing in 2 out of 10 children?\n  After-school program. Again, an important initiative, but as I look \nat the number of children who could benefit from this, and I think \nabout my travel in some of our inner-city communities and rural \ncommunities, much less the suburbs, we will be reaching, with the \nPresident's proposal, about 1 out of 10 young people or children that \nare eligible. If it is important to have good positive things going on \nfor young people in our communities after school, why is it only \nimportant to reach 1 out of 10 young people or children that would be \neligible?\n  Now I know what I am saying is counterintuitive because in a way I'm \nin the tiny minority on this, but I think we can do much better. I will \nintroduce child care legislation and I will talk about 5 out of 10 \nchildren, that we can at least reach half the children that really \ndeserve to have nurturing child care, that deserve to have the highest \nquality child care. Why are we only talking about affordable child care \nthat is only affordable for about 20 percent of the families that need \nthe assistance? Why are we not making sure that every child in the \nUnited States of America, when he or she goes to kindergarten, knows \nhow to spell her name, knows the alphabet, knows colors, shapes \nand sizes? Why can't we make sure that we make the investment in the \npublic sector, private sector and volunteers and communities, that \nevery single child comes to kindergarten, ready to learn? The \nPresident's proposal is a step in the right direction but we can do \nmuch better. We can do much better.\n\n  A second example, health care. Mr. President, I'm all for expanding \nMedicare, but the current proposal that the President has outlined \nmakes it impossible for most citizens between the ages of 55 and 65 to \nbe able to afford the premium. Most won't benefit. Second of all, I \ndon't know why--I guess I speak more to Democrats, my party--why have \nwe abandoned the idea of comprehensive health care reform, universal \nhealth care coverage? Why are we not talking about a strategy for our \ncountry whereby the next century, next millennium, each and every \ncitizen will be able to benefit from dignified, humane, affordable \nhealth care? Why, Democrats, have we backed away from this?\n  I'm going to introduce legislation that will have a national \nprogressive framework, a defined package of benefits. Remember, \ncolleagues, remember what we talked about a few short years ago, that \nevery citizen should have health care at least as good as what Senators \nand Representatives get? I believe that. I think all of us should \nbelieve that. It will also make sure that States agree that it will be \naffordable and it will also have strong consumer protection, but then \nit leaves it up to States as to how to get there. There will be Federal \ngrants for each and every State that agrees to reach, within the next 5 \nyears, universal coverage. Different states can do it different ways. \nWe can decentralize it. But we ought not to give up on the goal of \nhumane, affordable, dignified health care for each and every citizen in \nour country. The American people believe in that. It might be that the \ninsurance industry, which has so much clout here, doesn't believe in \nit, but the majority of people in our country do, and Democrats and \nRepublicans, we ought to be on their side. We ought to be on their \nside.\n  The third example, Mr. President, which is near and dear to my heart, \ncall it counterintuitive politics because we don't talk about it very \nmuch but I think we should. I have traveled all across the country. I \nhave had a chance to meet with a lot of people in poor communities. I \nwant to raise the minimum wage. I think we should do that. It is a \nmatter of elementary simple justice. I am proud to join Senator Kennedy \nin this fight. We will raise the minimum wage 50 cents a year for the \nnext 3 years and then index it. If people work full time 52 weeks a \nyear 40 hours a week they ought not to be poor in America. If you had \nhealth care and child care, you really would be making a difference in \nterms of family income.\n  Mr. President, I also visited communities, be they rural or urban, \nwhere there are no jobs, even with the economy being where it is, even \nwith official unemployment at record low levels. I go to inner-city \nBaltimore or inner-city Chicago or Minneapolis, I can go to Appalachia, \nrural Appalachia, I can go to rural Minnesota, and\n\n[[Page S301]]\n\nin all too many cases the jobs are not there, or the jobs at decent \nwages are not there. Why don't we make a commitment to making sure that \npeople find employment? That is dignity.\n  We have communities where there are compelling needs--there is elder \ncare, there is child care, there is housing rehab, there is community \ncrime prevention, there is teacher's assistance, there is environmental \ncleanup, all sorts of work to be done and people who can't find any \njobs. I will introduce a bill that will provide people--we have now a 5 \nmillion job gap between people that want to work and jobs vacant--\nprovide people with a transition whereby they have a job for a year at \na decent wage with these benefits, and then can transition to private \nsector. We need to get more private capital in these communities. But \nwhen you have people in our rural areas, our ghettos and our barrios \nwho have worked and worked on community-building jobs and have the \ndignity and build up some of the skills, then private sector gets more \ninterested in these communities. But right now in a lot of communities \nin our country, people are crying out, where are the jobs?\n  Mr. President, we can do much better. We have to make these \ninvestments. I am saying to my colleagues today on the floor of the \nSenate that as we go into the next century there are some \ncontradictions we cannot live with. There are some contradictions in \nthis city, Washington, DC, right here in this city, and all across the \ncountry. We have to make sure that we are investing in communities. We \nhave to make sure we are investing in children. We have to make sure we \nare investing in education, and not just in education for some \nchildren, not just affordable child care for some children, not just \nhealth care for some citizens. If we are going to argue that these are \npriorities, then we have to back the rhetoric with the resources. We \nhave to make the investment.\n  Mr. President, I worry that at the very time where we have the best \nchance to make this investment--at a time of real optimism, at a time \nwhen I think people in the country feel good and know that we can do \nbetter, that justice, fairness, opportunity, building communities and \nbuilding leadership are things that we can do--we are going to miss the \nopportunity by making speeches but not following up the speeches, by \nnot really meaning what we say, and not really making the investment.\n  President Clinton, thank you for pinpointing some of these \ninitiatives. Republican colleagues, maybe in areas like child care we \ncan come together. I hope we can. But for the President and all my \ncolleagues, we can't outline problems and say we are committed to \nmaking a huge difference and then not make the investment that is \nanywhere near the scale of what needs to be done to make a difference. \nWe can do much better than what the President outlined in his address \nfor children, we can do much better for education, we can do much \nbetter for health care, and we can do much better when it comes to \ntackling problems with race, gender, poverty, and children in America.\n\n  I appreciate what the President has outlined as a first step, but we \nought to be doing much better here in the Senate and in the House of \nRepresentatives. We ought to be doing much better. This is our chance \nto make an enormous difference.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SIMMONS, U.S. NAVY\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to recognize \nand say farewell to an outstanding Naval officer, Commander Ray C. \nSimmons, upon his retirement from the Navy after more than twenty years \nof commissioned service. Throughout his career, Commander Simmons has \nserved with distinction, and it is my privilege to recognize his many \naccomplishments and to commend him for the superb service he has \nprovided the Navy and the nation.\n  Commander Simmons entered the United States Naval Academy from the \nState of New Hampshire in 1973 and was commissioned as an Ensign upon \ngraduation in 1977. Since then, Commander Simmons has spent his career \npatrolling the world's oceans as a Naval Flight Officer and \noceanographer. Following flight training, he began his service in \nPatrol Squadron Four in Barbers Point, Hawaii, making three deployments \nto the western Pacific, Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf, including \noperations in support of the 1979-80 Iranian hostage crisis. In 1990, \nhe joined the staffs of the United States Sixth Fleet and NATO Strike \nForce South, embarked in USS Belknap, homeported in Gaeta, Italy. \nDuring the Persian Gulf War, Commander Simmons, as Fleet oceanographer, \nserved as a member of the TLAM cruise missile targeting team, planning \nstrikes on Iraq from the eastern Mediterranean Sea. He also served as \nFlag Lieutenant and personal aide to the Sixth Fleet Commander.\n  When not at sea, Commander Simmons has likewise served with \ndistinction on the staffs of Patrol Wing Two and the Chief of Naval \nOperations, in the Naval Western Oceanography Center and as Aide and \nacting Deputy Executive Assistant to the Vice Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff. He served with the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration (NASA) as the first Department of Defense liaison \nofficer for joint NASA-Defense earth science applications programs. In \n1995, he commanded the United States Naval Ice Center, with additional \nresponsibility as Director of the joint Coast Guard, Navy and National \nOceanographic and Atmospheric Administration United States National Ice \nCenter, and served as the lead Department of Defense lead technical \nadvisor to the Russia-United States Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission \nEnvironmental Working Group. Among Commander Simmons's many awards and \ndecorations are the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, four Meritorious \nService Medals, two Navy Expeditionary Medals and the Southwest Asia \nService Medal. He is both a qualified Naval Flight Officer and Naval \noceanographer.\n  During his more than twenty year career, Commander Simmons has served \nthe United States Navy and the nation with excellence and distinction. \nHe has been an integral member of, and contributed greatly to, the \nbest-trained, best-equipped and best-prepared naval force in the \nhistory of the world. Commander Simmons's unflappable leadership, \nintegrity, and limitless energy have had a profound and positive impact \non the United States Navy and the nation.\n  Commander Simmons will retire from the United States Navy on March 1, \n1998, after twenty years and nine months of dedicated commissioned \nservice. On behalf of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I wish \nCommander Simmons fair winds and following seas. Congratulations on \ncompletion of an outstanding and successful career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/03/senate-section/article/S301-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S301-S302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RETIREMENT OF CAPTAIN JOHN LYNCH\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man a \nnumber of us, especially those who are members of the Armed Services \nCommittee, have come to know over the past several years, Captain John \nLynch who retired from the United States Navy during the Christmas \nRecess.\n  There are few careers more demanding or rewarding than those in our \narmed forces, and in, 1972, John Lynch joined the Navy. Despite Richard \nNixon's overwhelming re-election to the Presidency, this was a tension \ncharged era in our Nation, we were in the waning days of our \ninvolvement in Vietnam and most young people were seeking ways to avoid \nmilitary service. Few people were actually entering the\n\n[[Page S302]]\n\narmed services on their own volition, but John was an exception, and \nhis spirit of patriotism and selflessness would serve him well \nthroughout his career. In 1974, a young John Lynch donned cap and gown \nand accepted his bachelor's degree in Industrial Education and earned a \ncommission as an Ensign. Leaving the comfortable and familiar campus of \nThe College of New Jersey, he headed south to the hot, humid weather of \nthe Florida panhandle and the vocal, uncompromising, and unforgiving \nMarine Corps Drill Instructors who put the aviation candidates through \ntheir paces and initiated them into the life of the military.\n  By the time then Ensign Lynch graduated from flight school, \nVietnamization was fully in place and responsibility for prosecuting \nthe war was squarely on the shoulders of the Republic of Vietnam. \nThough American military personnel were no longer involved in a \n``shooting war'', the United States was certainly locked into a tense, \ndangerous, and sometimes deadly Cold War with communist nations. During \nthis period in our history, the United States and, primarily, the \nformer Soviet Union stared at each other over fortified borders, and \ntested each other's defenses and military capabilities. Certainly one \nkey element in how this Cold War was prosecuted was anti-submarine \nwarfare, where American and Soviet submariners shadowed and evaded each \nother and the ships and aircraft that tried to detect and monitor their \nactivities. It was as a part of this nuclear weapons cat and mouse game \nthat John Lynch cut his teeth as a young Naval officer and aviator, \nflying operations looking for Soviet submarines.\n  As many will remember, the Cold War would heat up from time to time, \nand there was a period in the 1980's when events in the Middle East \nforced the United States to use force to protect our citizens, \ninterests, and security. Inflammatory and hateful rhetoric espoused by \nradical leaders, coupled with things such as the infamous ``Line of \nDeath'', the bombing of the Marine Barracks in Beirut, and a campaign \nof terror directed at the United States and her allies that brought \nAmerican military assets to bear in the Mediterranean, and John Lynch \nwas among those deployed to that region. As a matter of fact, as the \nOfficer in Charge of the Navy's first dual SH-60B helicopter detachment \naboard the U.S.S. Halyburton as it conducted operations off the coast \nof Libya, John logged nine combat flights in support of the fleet. \nThose experiences demonstrated the competence, composure, and courage \nof John Lynch, the essential qualities of any successful leader, \nwhether he or she be in the military, the government, or the private \nsector. They certainly benefitted him, and those who served under him \nin HSL-42, during Operation Desert Shield/Storm.\n  Of course, Captain Lynch's career was not all dangerous missions \nflown in the cramped cockpit of Navy helicopters, throughout his 24-\nyears in the service, he held a number of different assignments that \npromoted Naval rotor wing aviation, including at IBM; Naval Air Station \nNorth Island, San Diego; Naval Aide and Flag Secretary at Naval Air \nStation Jacksonville; and on the staff of the Chief of Naval Operations \nfor Surface Warfare. He earned a Master's Degree from the University of \nSouthern California while he was stationed in San Diego. He also \nparticipated in the LEGIS Fellows Program, serving as a Military \nLegislative Assistant to my friend, United States Representative Tillie \nFowler.\n  It was during his almost three year tenure as Director of Senate \nAffairs in the Office of the Secretary of Defense that we came to know \nJohn Lynch. In that position, the Captain was responsible for being the \nliaison between the Department of Defense and all Senators and their \nstaffers, though his primarily interaction was with the members and \nstaff of the Armed Services Committee. A gregarious and competent man, \nCaptain Lynch was an excellent representative of the Secretary of \nDefense who rendered an important service, helped facilitate positive \nrelations between the Pentagon and the Senate, and made certain that \nthe positions of the Secretary of Defense and the Executive Branch were \nwell represented. He was unquestionably professional and accommodating \nand he set an excellent example for all those who worked for him in the \nOffice of Senate Affairs, as well as for his successor.\n  After more than 20 years in service to the Navy and the Nation, it \nmust be difficult for Captain Lynch to begin a new career, but he can \nlook back on his time as a Naval Officer and take great satisfaction \nand pride in a job well done. His efforts helped to assure that the \nUnited States and her citizens were well protected, and I know Captain \nLynch must be proud that his eldest son, Shaun, has chosen to follow in \nhis father's public spirited footsteps by attending the Naval Academy \nand serving the Nation. I wish John Lynch, his wife Linda, son Shaun, \nand daughters Laurne and Kelly health, happiness, and success in the \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/03/senate-section/article/S301-3", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I would like today to pay tribute to one of \nmy most esteemed colleagues on the occasion of his birthday. For, \nsixty-five years ago, in Salisbury, Maryland, two Greek immigrants \nnamed Spyros and Matina Sarbanes gave birth to a child, whom they named \nPaul. I, for one, have no doubt--although history does not provide \nconfirmation of my conjecture--that within a few days, or perhaps \nweeks, of this event, young Paul had begun the earnest and impassioned \nlearning that would distinguish him throughout his life.\n  This learning has paid dividends throughout the life and career of \nPaul Sarbanes. It won him a scholarship to Princeton--from where he \ngraduated Phi Beta Kappa--and earned him a Rhodes Scholarship. Thence, \nhe proceeded to Harvard Law School and a prestigious clerkship with a \nfederal appellate court judge. After conquering such mountains early \non, he might have been forgiven for resting on his laurels, but these \nearly triumphs proved to be simply prologue to further achievements. \nSenator Sarbanes' drive and his intelligence propelled him from a law \nfirm to the Maryland House of Delegates, then on to the U.S. House, \nand, in 1976, to the U.S. Senate. How wonderfully appropriate that the \nyear in which this country celebrated its bicentennial it should also \nwitness, in the election of Senator Sarbanes, confirmation of the basic \nAmerican tenet that any man--even the child of immigrants--can rise to \nthe highest levels in this country! And who better than Senator \nSarbanes to prove that the American meritocracy, which rewards \nextraordinary wisdom and diligence, endures?\n  For over two decades, I have been privileged to work alongside \nSenator Sarbanes. I have learned in that time to put down whatever \nbusiness I have before me and pay careful attention when this man \nspeaks on the floor. For I know that whatever words issue forth from \nhis mouth will be the result of careful consideration, intelligent \nanalysis, and a nuanced balancing of the facts. These qualities \ndistinguish Senator Sarbanes' remarks, and they are the reason why this \nman epitomizes for\n\n[[Page S303]]\n\nme the best that the legal profession has to offer. If every lawyer \nwould only emulate the reasonableness and wisdom of Senator Sarbanes, \nthe country's legal profession would be held in much higher esteem than \nit is today!\n  Mr. President, I am sure I speak for all my colleagues when I wish my \nesteemed colleague Senator Sarbanes the happiest of birthdays. The \nwords of Senator Sarbanes' classical forebear, Aristophanes, seem \nparticularly appropriate today: ``Blest the man who possesses a keen \nintelligent mind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/03/senate-section/article/S302-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO THE NATIONAL CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION'S 100 YEARS OF \n                               EXCELLENCE\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I call upon my colleagues today to \nrecognize an organization that has been very valuable not only to the \nhard working ranchers and farmers that I represent in Colorado, but to \neveryone in America whose livelihood depends upon the cattle industry.\n  Founded in 1898, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association is the \nmarketing and trade association for America's one million cattle \nfarmers and ranchers.\n  Small businesses, like cattle farms and ranches, are the heart of the \nAmerican economy. The U.S. cattle industry is comprised of more than \none million individual farms or ranches that provide our nation with a \nsteady supply of safe, nutritious beef. Living on a small ranch in \nIgnacio, Colorado, I know the vast majority of U.S. cattlemen are \nfamily farmers and ranchers who are skilled stewards of their natural \nresources and trained caretakers of the animals under their care. \nEighty percent of cattle businesses have been in the same family for \nmore than 25 years and 10 percent for more than 100 years.\n  Cattle ranchers form the largest part of the U.S. food and fiber \nindustry, which, in turn, is the largest segment of the U.S. economy--\nnearly 17.5 percent of the gross national product. Doing business in \nall 50 states, cattlemen contribute to thousands of rural economies \nand, directly and indirectly, add $153 billion to the national economy. \nIt is also important to recognize that the beef industry provides 1.6 \nmillion American jobs, and the U.S. annually produces nearly 25 percent \nof the world's beef supply with less than 10 percent of the world's \ncattle inventory.\n  In Denver, where the industry is commemorating 100 years of the \ncattlemen's association history, we have a unique opportunity for \npeople all across America to join in celebrating the labor of \ngenerations of America's cattlemen and women.\n  Since this historic event is taking place in my home state of \nColorado, I would like to take this time also to recognize the Colorado \nCattlemen's Association, which is one of the nation's oldest \ncattlemen's associations, founded in 1867, even before Colorado became \na state. I am proud to say that with hard working grass-roots \norganizations like the National Cattlemen's Association and the \nColorado Cattlemen's Association, issues that directly affect the West \nand across this country can be addressed in Washington with great \nsuccess.\n  In 1996, I joined Senator Domenici on the Senate floor in support of \nthe grazing reform bill in the 104th Congress. It was a moving sight to \nsee so many cattlemen and women in the Senate gallery and the halls of \nCongress working with their senators to help ensure passage of this \nvital legislation. Currently, grazing legislation is pending in the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on which I serve. With \nendorsements from strong grass-roots organizations like the National \nCattlemen's Beef Association and the Colorado Cattlemen's Association, \nwe will continue to fight to get this legislation enacted into law.\n  Once again I commend the National Cattlemen's Beef Association for \n100 years of dedicated service to America's ranchers and farmers.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, as many of our colleagues are aware, there \nhas been a problem in America since roughly 1990 in that we have \ncollected taxes on gasoline. Those taxes, as anyone knows who has ever \nstood and read the gasoline pump as they are filling up their car or \ntruck, are dedicated to building highways. But, yet, since 1990, over \n25 cents out of every dollar we have collected in gasoline taxes has \nnot gone to building highways. It has instead gone to fund general \ngovernment.\n  This produces a real problem. If you read the sign on the gasoline \npump, it basically gives you good news and bad news. The bad news is \nthat about a third of the cost of a gallon of gasoline is taxes. The \ngood news is that every penny you pay in gasoline taxes is supposed to \ngo to build roads. The problem since roughly 1990 has been that the bad \nnews is true and the good news is not true.\n  Senator Byrd, I, and others set about last year to try to correct \nthis problem to basically try to bring honesty to Government by having \na program that in reality conforms to what we tell the American people. \nAnd that program is that if you collect money on gasoline taxes to \nspend on roads that you spend the money on roads and nothing else. We \nhave done it in two parts. One part is complete.\n  I offered an amendment to last year's tax bill which was adopted in \nthe Senate, adopted in the House, and became law when the President \nsigned the tax bill into law. It took the 4.3 cents a gallon tax on \ngasoline that in 1993 the President had dedicated permanently to \ngeneral revenues--the first time in American history that such a \ndesignation had ever occurred--and it put that gasoline tax back into \nthe highway trust fund. You can imagine how surprised we were when the \nPresident's budget came out and not one penny of that gasoline tax is \nproposed to be spent on highways.\n  Senator Byrd, I, and others have put together an amendment which now \nhas, I believe, 52 cosponsors. I want today to outline what the \namendment does and what it does not do, what the result of adopting the \namendment would do, and what it would not do. I also want to address \ntwo other issues that people have talked about as reasons of not being \nfor the amendment.\n  First of all, our amendment is on an authorization bill. It basically \nwould change the highway bill to assure that the 4.3-cents-a-gallon tax \non gasoline would be authorized to be spent on highways. Our amendment \ndoes not, nor could it, change the spending caps in the budget. Nothing \nin our amendment would in any way change the total amount of funds that \nare currently available to be spent under the budget agreement which we \nadopted last year. In fact, our amendment specifically states that \nnothing in the amendment will bridge or break those caps. So we are not \ndebating how much total money is going to be spent next year. That \ndebate is going to occur in the budget and probably to some extent in \nthe appropriations process and perhaps in the Finance Committee with \ntaxes and user fees.\n  My position is longstanding, and I don't intend to change it under \nany circumstances. And that position is that we should not raise the \nspending caps; that we made an agreement last year with the President. \nWe took that agreement to the American people. We made a promise. I \nthink we ought to live up to that promise.\n  The Byrd-Gramm amendment simply allows highways to compete with every \nother use of money within the budget agreement. If we do not adopt the \nByrd-Gramm amendment, it means that for the next 6 years we are going \nto be spending less than 75 cents out of every dollar collected in \ngasoline taxes on highways, and we are going to continue to perpetuate \nan untruth where people were told when they buy gasoline that the money \nis going to build highways when in reality over 25 cents out of every \ndollar is going to general government. If you believe that when we have \na dedicated revenue source--a\n\n[[Page S304]]\n\n``user fee,'' as some call it--that we have an obligation, in fact, a \nmoral obligation, to the American people to use the revenue for the \npurpose that it is collected for, then I believe that you should be for \nthe Byrd-Gramm amendment.\n\n  We have, I believe now, 52 cosponsors. I don't have any doubt about \nthe fact that if we voted on the Byrd-Gramm amendment today as an \namendment to the highway bill it would be adopted and it would probably \nget 75 or 80 votes.\n  Here is the problem. Those who oppose the amendment would like to \ndelay its consideration and consider it in the context of the budget. \nWhen we are considering the budget we are going to be considering many \nproposals to break the spending caps. And it is the hope of those who \noppose the amendment to use that parliamentary position to try to \nconvince people that rather than fulfilling the commitment we made to \nthe American people about spending gasoline taxes on roads that we \nshould not do that so we can raise spending in other areas.\n  In fact, the strategy is to commingle this effort to allow highways \nto compete in an effort to break the budget entirely. I didn't think \nthat is where we ought to consider this amendment. This is not a budget \namendment. Our amendment does not break the spending caps. All we do is \nauthorize highways at a level that would allow the spending of every \npenny collected in the gasoline tax, or at least that new portion, 4.3 \ncents a gallon. It would then be up to the Appropriations Committee \nwithin their overall budget to decide how much to spend on highways.\n  Let me make it clear. I believe that under those circumstances we \nwould be successful, and that we would provide the full level of \nfunding. But in doing so we would do it within the spending caps.\n  A couple of additional points. Our highway bill will expire on May \n1st. It would be my intention--and I believe it is the intention of \nSenator Byrd--that if that highway extension expires, we would want an \nopportunity as part of rewriting it to offer our amendment. In fact, we \nare preserving our right to offer our amendment, as obviously anyone \ncan at any time to any bill. We don't want to do that. We want to have \nthe opportunity to have the highway bill in front of us.\n  I hope my colleagues will join Senator Byrd and join me in urging our \nleadership on both sides of the aisle to come forward with the highway \nbill. I came over today because we are here at 3 o'clock with no \nbusiness before the Senate. We could have already written the highway \nbill. It takes time to plan the building of roads and bridges. It takes \ntime for States to set out their blueprint of what they are going to \ndo. I am blessed in being with a Southern State that has a long \nconstruction cycle. But for people who live in States like North \nDakota, they have a very short construction cycle in terms of highway \nconstruction. And if the highway bill should expire, if they lose May, \nJune, and July, they will end up not having a highway construction \nperiod this year.\n  So I believe that we need to get on with this bill. I think there is \na solid consensus that says that within the spending caps we want to \nallow highways the right to compete for funds up to the amount of taxes \nthat we collect on gasoline. If those of us who believe that the money \nshould be spent on highways can't win that debate, then obviously we \nwill not get the money.\n  But since the money was collected on gasoline taxes, people were told \nit was going to be used for highway construction, I believe that if we \ndo authorize its expenditure we will be successful.\n  So I came over today to basically make two points. No. 1, nothing in \nthe Byrd-Gramm amendment raises the spending caps. The amendment \nspecifically states that the spending in the Byrd-Gramm amendment will \nbe within the spending caps. We are going to debate spending caps and \nthe total level of spending in the budget. The Byrd-Gramm amendment is \nauthorization which authorizes the construction of highways at a \nfunding level up to the expenditure of the gasoline taxes that we are \nnow collecting. It will be up to each of us then within the spending \nlimits that are set in the budget--and I hope they will be the spending \nlimits that we agreed to last year and I intend to fight for, but \nwithin that we will have an opportunity to compete so that funds can be \nspent on highways and so that we can have truth in Government, so that \nwhen working Americans go to the filling station and stick the nozzle \nin their gas tank and they sit there while they are holding it reading \non the gas pump that every penny of gasoline taxes goes to build roads, \nthat will not be false advertising by the Government, that it will in \nfact be a reality.\n  The final point I wanted to reemphasize is we are running out of \ntime. The extension of the highway bill expires on May 1. We are not \ngoing to be able to get another clean extension. We obviously have time \nto deal with this bill since there is no action in the Chamber here at \n3 o'clock in the afternoon. It is early in the session. We were told \nwhen Congress adjourned for the Christmas recess the first item of \nbusiness was going to be the highway bill. With a construction cycle \nbeginning in May in the northern tier of the country, with the \ndesperate need for highways and highway modernization, with the fact we \ntold people the money they spend on gasoline taxes is a user fee to be \nused for highways and roads, I believe it is important that we move \nahead. I urge our leadership, both on the Republican side of the aisle \nand on the Democratic side of the aisle, to move ahead with the highway \nbill. Let the Senate work its will and know that the amendment which \nwill be offered by Senator Byrd and by me and by 52 Members of the \nSenate is an amendment that does not break the spending caps.\n  Under no circumstance am I going to support breaking the spending \ncaps. This is a debate about priorities. It is a debate about whether \nor not, when you tell people that their gasoline taxes go to build \nroads, it should go to build roads. This is competition for available \nmoney. It is not a debate about increasing the total level of spending. \nI know people get confused on this issue, and I wanted to be sure that \nwe continue every day to reiterate that this is a debate about \npriorities. It is a debate about honesty in Government. But it is not a \ndebate about the total level of spending. That decision will be made in \nthe budget, and hopefully the decision will be made to live up to the \ncommitment we made last year.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for recognition. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

Mr. President, with regard to S. 1575, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of \nCalendar No. 301, S. 1575, the Ronald Reagan airport legislation, and \nit be considered under the following agreement:\n  One amendment to be offered by Senator Daschle or his designee \nregarding a commission; one amendment to be offered by Senator Dodd \nregarding a commission; one amendment to be offered by Senator Daschle \nor his designee regarding Dulles Airport naming; one amendment to be \noffered by Senator Coverdell, which is a technical change amendment; \none amendment to be offered by Senator Reid regarding the FBI building \nrenaming; one relevant amendment to be offered by Senator Lott or his \ndesignee; and one relevant amendment to be offered by Senator Daschle \nor his designee.\n  I further ask that these amendments be the only amendments in order \nand they all be in the first degree and must be offered and debated \nprior to the close of business this evening, and any votes ordered with \nrespect to the amendments or passage occur on Wednesday morning, at a \ntime to be determined by the majority leader after notification of the \nDemocratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot\n\n[[Page S305]]\n\nobject, but I would simply clarify that this has been a work in \nprogress for several days. I appreciate very much the cooperation of \nthe majority leader in accommodating Democratic Senators and Republican \nSenators who wish to offer amendments.\n  There were two issues here. One was the opportunity to offer \namendments. This unanimous consent request does that. People can vote \nup or down on the amendments and can certainly vote up or down on the \nbill. There will be plenty of discussion about the reasons for a vote \non either side of these amendments as the debate unfolds.\n  The second issue was one relating to the IRS bill. It was our view \nthat the bill reforming the IRS needed to be brought to the attention \nof the Senate and needed to be scheduled. The majority leader has \nacknowledged the need to do that as well, and he has given me a \ncommitment that we will take up the IRS bill prior to the end of March. \nSo given his commitment to address the IRS and to allow amendments to \nbe offered, that will, in my view, certainly provide us with an \nopportunity to move forward. So I appreciate very much his effort to \nrespond to those concerns.\n  We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Regarding the majority leader's unanimous \nconsent request, without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Daschle for his comments. I \nthink this is a fair agreement. Senators understandably want to be able \nto offer relevant amendments, and these amendments do pertain to this \ngeneral area of discussion. I think that is reasonable. I think that is \nfair. I was concerned earlier on at the suggestions that were being \nmade that we would wind up with just a litany of amendments making it \nimpossible for us to bring this to a reasonable conclusion, and \ndelaying other issues that we have already made a commitment to do. So \nI am pleased that we have this agreement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/03/senate-section/article/S304-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IRS RESTRUCTURING LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I further announce to all Senators that it \nwill be my intention to call up and consider the IRS restructuring \nlegislation no later than March 30, 1998. I have done that after \nconsultation with Members on both sides of the aisle and, particularly, \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee. He has assured me that he is \nvery dedicated to getting this done. We found out last year in our \nhearings in the Finance Committee that, in fact, the abuses we had \nheard about were occurring.\n\n  The House passed a bill that made some very positive changes and sent \nthat over to the Senate right at the end of the session. We believe \nthat we are finding out still other problems that exist, and that that \nbill can be strengthened. We have given our word, frankly, on both \nsides of the aisle, that we are going to deal with this issue and we \nare going to deal with it in a timely way. I think the Finance \nCommittee may have another hearing or two, although I am not limiting \nit to that. I didn't ask the chairman how many more he wanted to have. \nWe heard from the Secretary of Treasury last week and the new IRS \nCommissioner, Mr. Rossotti about their reorganization plans. We are \nstill learning things that are happening in order to maybe try to \nchange the culture at IRS, but at the same time we are continuously \nfinding additional problems that have not been addressed in the bill \nthat came across from the House. I believe we can have whatever \nadditional hearings that we need to have and have a markup and have \nthis legislation on the floor of the Senate by the end of March.\n  The only reason why I didn't want to narrow it down more than that, \nfrankly, is we have a number of issues we have to deal with in March, \nas Senator Daschle knows, such as NATO enlargement, the budget, \nsupplemental appropriations, which I presume will involve at least a \npart, or all of IMF, as well as this issue. Now, I believe this issue \nmay not take that much time. But we have to make sure that we have \nlooked at the entire schedule for March and we have allowed appropriate \ntime to consider this very important issue of restructuring of the IRS. \nI think this is a good agreement and we should move forward with it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I only want to acknowledge, again, the \nextraordinary leadership in our caucus that this Senate has benefited \nfrom, thanks to Senator Kerrey, on the issue of IRS reform. He and \nCongressman Portman were the two chairs of the IRS commission that \ndelved into all of these issues. They formulated the policy, convinced \nthe administration, and worked to resolve many outstanding differences. \nSo I appreciate very much their tenacious leadership in this area and, \nagain, thank them for their efforts in bringing us to this point. We \nwill, at long last, resolve this matter.\n  I am told that 1\\1/2\\ million taxpayers have been adversely affected \nby IRS activity since the House passed its reform legislation last \nyear. We need to put an end to that, and we need to find ways in which \nto ensure that the American people and the IRS have a clear message: \nThe old days are gone. The time for reform of the IRS is here.\n  The Senate, on a bipartisan basis, thanks to the leadership of \nSenator Kerrey is committed to that. We will send the bill to the \nPresident well before the April 15 filing time for taxes for the last \ncalendar year.\n  I thank the majority leader, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/03/senate-section/article/S305-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S305-S306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               IRS REFORM\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, first, let me thank both the majority \nleader and the Democratic leader for resolving this. I thank, as well, \nChairman Roth of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, and others \nwho have worked on this. Getting it done by the end of March means \nthat, prior to the 15th of April, taxpayers will have substantially \nmore power. I know that Senator Roth is looking at some additional \nthings that he might add to the bill.\n  Let me identify a few that are in this bill that, if we can get it \npassed before April 15, taxpayers will have. Under current law, the IRS \ncan come out and try to collect money from a taxpayer that they think \nowes money and, if they make a mistake, tough luck, there is no \nsanction against them. Under this changed law, if the IRS goes out and \ndoes this and it is discovered that they are negligent, they can be \nresponsible for $100,000 in punitive damages to be paid to the \ntaxpayer. And if it is discovered that they were wrong, they have to \npay the legal fees and other expenditures that the taxpayer would have \nbeen out. It puts the burden on the IRS to make certain that they don't \nsend out a collection notice unless they are certain there is a \ncollection there. Today, they have no negative sanctions at all. This \nwill shift a substantial amount of power to the taxpayers, which I \nthink is needed.\n\n  Chairman Roth has used what is called section 6103 to look at some of \nthe privacy problems, and he has some additional ideas he may want to \nadd in this area. Just with what the House has passed and what we have \nin our bill right now, there is a substantial amount of new power that \nthe taxpayer will have. We will make the taxpayer advocate more \nindependent. Senator John Breaux and others--and I believe Chairman \nRoth supports it--will make the taxpayer advocate even more independent \nby removing them from the IRS. They do a relatively good job, but there \nis a conflict of interest and they have a difficult time being able to \nbe a powerful advocate for the taxpayers.\n  There are lots of other things that this piece of legislation does, \nand to be able to get it done by the 15th of April, I think taxpayers \nare going to like it a lot. Here are some more examples. We all know \nthe code is complicated, and we all know that one of the cheapest ways \nto get an audience to their feet and to appreciate this is to propose \nsome tax break, a deal that we favor. And everybody around here has one \nthat they like. If we have a reconciliation bill or a tax bill we are \ngoing to move through this bill, this law would say that the IRS \nCommissioner has to be at the table when that is being discussed, and \nthen to say this is what it is going to add to the taxpayer burden.\n  It has been estimated now that it costs somewhere between $100 \nbillion and $200 billion a year to comply with\n\n[[Page S306]]\n\nthe code. This would put the Commissioner at the table and give the \ncommissioner a sufficient amount of independence to say this is what it \nwill cost, or that it requires an index and some measure of cost to the \ntaxpayer.\n  We heard Mr. Rossotti talk about his need for power. It's surprising \nhow little management authority the Commissioner has, though you will \nnot likely see that having an impact immediately. Long-term, there is \nno question that is going to have an impact. My guess is that most \nMembers have heard complaints coming from citizens that they know have \nto go to a regional office to get an answer to a question or get a \nproblem solved. That is because what IRS has done is increasingly \ncentralized the decisionmaking process. And what Mr. Rossotti, \ncorrectly, is trying to do is decentralize that process, so you have \nhuman beings in offices at the local level helping to make decisions. \nThe way he is proposing to do that is to end the stovepipe stricture \nthat exists and create functional structures. He needs the law to be \nchanged in order to have the management authority to get that done.\n  So I thank the majority leader very much and the Democratic leader, \nSenator Daschle, for their determination to get this done. I thank \nSenator Grassley and Senator Roth. And before I leave the floor, I also \nwant to thank Secretary Rubin. There was an awful lot of attention paid \nto a conflict that Congressman Portman, who was cochair of this effort, \nand I had having to do with an independent board for the IRS. We worked \nout those disagreements. Lost, unfortunately, in the process of \ndebating that is another change we put in place, which was to require \nsome consolidated oversight on Congress' side and the purpose of both \nis so that we can get to a point where you have a shared agreement, you \nhave consensus between the executive and legislative branch about what \nyou want the IRS to do. It is impossible to make technology decisions.\n  The administration is asking for another $400 million for tax system \nmodernization. Without this piece of legislation in place and Mr. \nRossotti with the power and consolidated congressional oversight, I \nwould vote no on that.\n  This process began with Senator Shelby and I on the floor adding \nmoney for the creation of this commission. Congressman Lightfoot and \nCongressman Hoyer, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on the \nTreasury, were involved in the House. It began because Senator Shelby \nand I saw that the General Accounting Office had said that nearly $3 \nbillion of money had been wasted trying to modernize the information \nsystems at the Internal Revenue Service. Unless you can get an \nenvironment where the legislative and executive branch say we agree on \nthe plan, we support the plan, we support what we are trying to do--\neverybody from the private sector and the public sector said, take \nanother $100 million, or $400 million, or whatever you can, to put into \ntechnology and it is going to be more money down the rat hole.\n\n  To get this done by the 15th of April gives us an opportunity to \nincrease confidence that when we give the IRS the technology money they \nneed to modernize their system, it is likely to be that they will do \nthe right thing. I also predict, Mr. President, that there is a title \nin here that hasn't been given a lot of attention because it is not \nvery controversial. I think that 10 years from now it may be seen as \none of the most significant parts of this legislation, and that is \npowerful incentives to move to the electronic world, electronic filing, \nand the removal of the some of the disincentives in place right now to \nelectronic filing. I don't want to talk about the information \nsuperhighway, but the air rates for electronic filing is less than 1 \npercent; for the paper world it is 22 percent. The cost to the taxpayer \nto run the IRS, as well as the cost of the taxpayer to comply is \nsubstantially higher in a paper world than an electronic one.\n  Since the IRS deals with 100 million households on an annual basis, I \nalso would forecast that if we can get the IRS into the electronic \nworld so taxpayers will know with certainty what their bill is--for \nmost families, it is one of the largest bills they have to pay. In \nNebraska, for just the Federal obligation in taxes, the average \nindividual contribution to Washington on an annual basis is $4,600 a \nyear. So for most families, their tax obligation is one of the largest \nobligations or bills that they have to pay, and uncertainty about that \ncan make it difficult for them to do financial planning.\n  I forecast that the electronic filing section of this bill is going \nto be something that is going to benefit taxpayers in lots of ways, and \nI also believe that it is going to be the sort of thing we will have to \ndo in lots of other areas of Government if we are going to get the unit \ncost of Government down and the efficiency of the operation of the \npeople's Government up.\n  So I appreciate very much knowing now with certainty that this bill \nwill be brought to the floor prior to the 30th of March and, more \nimportantly, prior to the 15th of April, because I think the American \ntaxpayers have waited for this all too long.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/03/senate-section/article/S305-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S306-S310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RONALD REAGAN WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, first let me say to both the majority \nleader and the minority leader that the author and the cosponsors of S. \n1575 are pleased that we were able to come to terms on the process by \nwhich we manage the legislation that would name Washington National \nAirport the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in memory of a \ngreat President of the United States. We hopefully are still on a \ntimeframe by which this could be done in time for his birthday, which \nis this Friday. He will celebrate his 87th birthday.\n  The agreement is consistent with the argument that we have made all \nalong that this is a memorial. The amendment process should be related \nto the context of the memorial, and extraneous issues should not have \nbeen a part of the amendment process. There is an integrity in this \nunanimous consent. All of these amendments are relevant, and all of \nthem relate to the concept of whether this ought to be done or not.\n  We just heard from the Senator from Nebraska about his agreement or \nconcurrence with the agreement that we would bring up IRS reform by \nApril 15th. I, too, echo his agreement that that be done. But I did not \nbelieve it ought to be a part of this memorial. It diminished the \nnature of this for it to become a legislative vehicle for extraneous \nmatters. No matter how important they are, they should not have been \ndealt with in the context of the memorial to former President Reagan.\n  I see the Senator from Nevada is present. I ask, if I might, is he \nhere on behalf of the amendment under the agreement that we have just \nagreed to?\n  Mr. REID. What amendment is that?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. It has here ``an amendment to be offered by Senator \nReid regarding the FBI building.''\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Georgia that is the reason I am \nhere.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield the floor in deference to the Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will shortly send an amendment to the desk \nto delete the name J. Edgar Hoover from the FBI building.\n  Let me preface my remarks by saying how much I respect and admire \nPresident Reagan. When I served in the House of Representatives, I, on \na number of occasions, sided with the President on a number of issues \nthat I felt were important to the country and to the State of Nevada. \nPresident Reagan was a good friend of the State of Nevada. His No. 1 \nadviser and counselor was the Senator from Nevada, Paul Laxalt, for \nwhom I also have great respect. I wouldn't do anything to withhold this \nmeasure from passing in time for his 87th birthday. This is not \nsomething I am going to talk a long time about. It is just something \nthat I have\n\n[[Page S307]]\n\nbeen looking, for more than a year, for an opportunity, for a vehicle \nto remove Mr. Hoover's name from the Federal Bureau of Investigation \nbuilding.\n\n  I say to the sponsor of this bill that I commend and applaud him for \nbeing as tenacious as he has been in making sure this is done prior to \nthe President's 87th birthday, which I understand is this Friday. I \nhope that the President, even though he is ill, will understand what an \nimportant act of Congress this is. It is one of many things that is \ngoing to be done to honor President Reagan's name. We, of course, have \nthe largest Federal building in Washington, DC proper that will be \nnamed after him in Federal Triangle. There is going to be an aircraft \ncarrier named after him, the largest in the Nimitz class that will be \nnamed after President Reagan. All of these honors are appropriate.\n  I want to make sure that I stress in my statement here today that my \namendment has nothing to do with any attempt to take away the naming of \nthe building for President Reagan. I hope that my friends on the other \nside of the aisle will support this amendment.\n  Let's look at J. Edgar Hoover. When I first became interested in \nthis, I would show a book, ``J. Edgar Hoover, A Man and His Secrets,'' \nby Curt Gentry. Curt Gentry is a personal friend of mine. Curt and I \nhave worked together for many years on a number of different things. I \nhave the greatest respect for him. It took him 10 years to write this \nbook, the most thorough research ever done on J. Edgar Hoover by Curt \nGentry. It is a fine book. It is very readable. As you all know, he \nalso wrote the book on Charles Manson called ``Helter-Skelter,'' which \nwas also a best-seller.\n  I became convinced that we needed to do something to take the name \noff that building when I learned that, among other things, J. Edgar \nHoover had a longstanding secret investigation of Quentin Burdick from \nNorth Dakota. Try that one on for size. Quentin Burdick from North \nDakota was investigated by J. Edgar Hoover for his subservience. I \nwould suggest to everyone that all of us who served with Burdick would \nsuggest he was nothing other than a patriot.\n  Among other things, when J. Edgar Hoover died, his secretary had all \nof his personal records taken out of the FBI building and taken to his \nhome. These were files on people. We will never know the full extent of \nthe investigation this man did over the five decades that he was \ninvolved with the FBI. We know that it took, on a daily basis, working \nthe longest and as hard as people could, 2\\1/2\\ months to shred the \npersonal files which he had on people. We have learned in years past--\nand this is one--that he conducted investigations of many, many people. \nWe could go through a long list of people he conducted investigations \non. The index of this book that I have before me goes over names of \npeople who are fine Americans who he had secret investigations done on.\n  We all know of the work that he did to cause all the problems he \ncould to the person from Georgia, Dr. Martin Luther King. And the \nthings he did alone to Dr. Martin Luther King was about as un-American \nas anything could be.\n  J. Edgar Hoover's name on the FBI building is a stain on the \nbuilding. Arguably there is no other public official of this century \nwho did so much to undermine the civil liberties as did J. Edgar \nHoover. That says a lot because we have had many people who have been \ninvolved in going after people's civil rights and civil liberties, and \nI would say Hoover was at the top of the list. This was engaged in \nwhile he was head of the FBI. We have learned since he died that he did \nmany different things.\n  Because the sponsor of the bill is from Georgia, I hope that he will \njoin me in this effort.\n  Twenty-five separate actions were taken against Dr. Martin Luther \nKing in the 1960s by J. Edgar Hoover that had no statutory basis--none. \nBy the FBI's own admission, the allegations of ``Communist'' that flew \nover Dr. King were never proved nor established. There was a concerted \nundercover campaign of continuous wiretapping of his home, his office, \nand travel accommodations for over 3 years. The FBI Director himself \napproved of an attempt to disrupt Dr. King's marriage. The FBI launched \nan aggressive campaign intended to, among other objectives, replace Dr. \nKing with a civil rights leader more acceptable to J. Edgar Hoover. \nWhen Dr. Martin Luther King received the Nobel Peace Prize, the FBI \nsent a thinly veiled recommendation in a letter to Dr. King himself \nthat Dr. King kill himself before accepting the prize.\n  J. Edgar Hoover went to extraordinary lengths to pursue a vicious \nvendetta against Dr. King, and I don't think I need to dwell on that \nanymore. Dr. Martin Luther King did not need this aggravation, this \nintrusive interference with this person's life.\n  The reason I mention Dr. King is because he is a very prominent \nfigure. This happened to prominent and not-so-prominent people, anybody \nthat J. Edgar Hoover felt needed to be looked at, and he did so in \nspite of what the law might have been because he was the law in his own \nmind.\n  Under his direction, the FBI continued to harass activists, or \nprotesters, or any political movement. They didn't have to be in the \ncivil rights movement--any political movement. He moved in with his \nminions, harassed, and did whatever he could to disrupt people. This \nwas carried out by intimidation, slander, and threatening to disrupt \ntheir marriages, force them out of jobs, and smear them in the eyes of \nparents and teachers. Letters were used to incite violence between \nrival black groups, counting on contracts to be placed on certain \nleaders' lives in each group. Additional letters were forged over local \nCommunist Party leaders' signatures to attack the employment practices \nof Mafia-owned businesses in order to intensify further animosity \nbetween these organizations.\n\n  The full extent of the FBI involvement will never be known because, \nas I have indicated, most all the records of relevant and highly \npertinent Bureau documents were destroyed after he died in 1972.\n  So now that Americans have the real story on this demagoguery, we \nmight be shamed into a more appropriate name for the FBI headquarters. \nI say to my friend from Georgia that my original intent was to take the \nname off the building and insert some other President's name--President \nEisenhower, President Bush, or President Truman. But I do not want to \nmake this a political debate. I think we should go ahead and name the \nairport after President Reagan and get Hoover's name off the FBI \nbuilding. Then I am happy to work with my friends from the other side \nof aisle to come up with an appropriate name for the FBI building. But \nI don't think it does this country any good to have this man's name \naffixed to the FBI building. Here is a person who spent his entire life \ntaking away people's rights.\n  So I hope this does not become a partisan issue. As I have indicated \nto my friend from Georgia, I hope there is a large vote for the Reagan \nbill from this side of the aisle. But I also hope there is a vote on \nthe other side of the aisle to get this man's name off the Federal \nBureau of Investigation building. I have so much respect for that \norganization and the people who work in it. I have spoken to FBI agents \nwho really do not want his name on the building. The more time that \ngoes by and the less people who worked under his influence, the more \nthis happens all the time. The FBI is known today as an entity that \nprotects people's rights, not take rights away.\n  So I hope that the message has been made. I only use one example. \nThat is Dr. King. If anyone wants more information, I can certainly \nspread across this Senate the records of hundreds of people who were \ntreated the same way that Dr. King was treated.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1640\n\n     (Purpose: To redesignate the J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building in \n     Washington, District of Columbia, as the ``Federal Bureau of \n                       Investigation Building'')\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1640.\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. REDESIGNATION OF J. EDGAR HOOVER FBI BUILDING.\n\n       (a) In General.--The J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building located \n     at 935 Pennsylvania Avenue\n\n[[Page S308]]\n\n     in Washington, District of Columbia, shall be known and \n     designated as the ``Federal Bureau of Investigation \n     Building''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     building referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be \n     a reference to the ``Federal Bureau of Investigation \n     Building''.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would just state in closing that we have \nnumerous newspaper articles: ``FBI Aide Terms Effort to Villify King \nIllegal;'' ``FBI Can't Justify Acts Against King;'' ``FBI Labeled King \nCommunist;'' ``Senate Probe Bares Secret Files;'' ``Crusade to Topple \nKing;'' ``Kelly Explores FBI Effort to Destroy King;'' ``King Widow \nDemands Reopening Martin Luther King Murder Probe;'' ``FBI Supervisor \nLinked to Dr. King Case;'' `` `No Legal Basis for Harassing King,' FBI \nofficial says;'' ``FBI Tried to Kill Reverend King's Reputation.'' And \nI say again there are numerous people who were treated as badly, if not \nworse, as Dr. King. And if there is any question from anybody on either \nside of the aisle in that regard I would be happy to supply that \ninformation.\n  I also ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, first I thank the Senator from Nevada \nfor his opening acknowledgement about the appropriateness of this \nlegislation to honor former President Reagan. I appreciate his \nacknowledgement of the nature of the timeframe, that we are wanting to \ndo this in conjunction with the President's 87th birthday.\n  I thank the Senator from Nevada for acknowledging that, indeed, this \nis a very unique period in the twilight years of the former President, \nand that he is bravely and courageously struggling with an illness; \nthat he has used that illness as a last attempt to do public good by \ncalling attention to its nature and highlighting the problem to the \nNation. And I appreciate very much those generous remarks on behalf of \nthe former President.\n  With regard to the presentations the Senator has made on behalf of \nhis amendment, there will be a recorded vote up or down, and the \nMembers of the Senate may make their decision as to their agreement or \nnot with whether or not the current name of the FBI building would be \nremoved and left to future congressional action to determine if another \nname should so honor the building.\n  I also agree with the Senator in his admiration of the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation. It has had some difficult times, but clearly it has \nbeen throughout our history an instrument to which the American public \nlooked for security and integrity.\n  Today, of course, the central objective is to fulfill the goal of S. \n1575 which is to honor former President Reagan in this very fitting way \nby redesignation of Washington National Airport as Ronald Reagan \nWashington National Airport.\n  I thought it might be useful, Mr. President, to share some of the \nNation's efforts to encourage the Congress and the President to get \nthis job done by Friday. Resolutions are being introduced and passed \nthroughout the country in support of the renaming of National Airport \nfor President Reagan. On January 16, 1998, the California assembly \npassed a resolution in support of this legislation. Of course, it is \nextremely fitting because former President Reagan was twice elected \nGovernor of the great State of California, where he served successfully \nand with integrity and purpose. I have been told that a similar \nresolution was introduced yesterday in the South Dakota Senate by \nSenator Alan Aiker and in the Maine House of Representatives by \nRepresentative Adam Mack. The Alabama House of Representatives, my \nneighboring State, has passed a resolution in support of the \nredesignation of National Airport. The Arizona Senate has passed a \nresolution in like support of redesignation. The Idaho, Illinois, and \nOhio legislatures will introduce resolutions next week. In Wisconsin, a \nresolution has been introduced and will be voted on this week. In \naddition, on February 6, President Reagan's 87th birthday, the \nWisconsin legislature will vote on a plan to name the new Department of \nAdministration building in Madison after former President Ronald \nReagan.\n  Mr. President, I am glad this short-lived filibuster has come to an \nend and that we can move on to resolution of this legislation.\n  As I said when we began the debate on this legislation, there are \nfewer than 12 namesakes of former President Reagan. As indicated by the \nSenator from Nevada, assuming the success of this legislation, I think \nwe are going to see a growing crescendo across the country. As we look \nback on the Reagan Presidency, if you had to find a word that \ncharacterized it, it was ``optimism''--optimism, a complete belief in \nthe spirit and nature of the American people. Historically, there are \nvery few eras for which the principles of American freedom were more \ncenter point, almost on a par in a sense with the founding. President \nReagan's policies unleashed unprecedented economic liberty, created \nmillions and millions of new jobs, created unprecedented growth, \ncreated and made the value of economic liberty fall into the homes of \nmillions and millions of Americans across this country.\n  Sometimes when we talk about American liberty we tend to focus on the \ncomponent of keeping ourselves free from impoundment by adversarial \nforces, the Axis powers and Adolf Hitler, Saddam Hussein. But one of \nthe critical components of American liberty is economic liberty. We \nfought the War of Independence over economic liberty. And there has not \nbeen another American leader so committed to it as was former President \nRonald Reagan. He fought for it throughout his entire life and, as \nPresident, implemented policies that enriched it in every corner.\n\n  Having said that, he was also one of the strongest proponents of \ndefending our freedom through strength, and as we said over the last \nseveral days his strong conviction with regard to the Soviet Union, \nwhich he labeled ``the evil empire,'' was unprecedented in changing the \nfortunes of world history as he brought down the Berlin Wall and he \nbrought down the Soviet Union's grasp over millions of people in the \nworld. So he was seeing to liberty not only at home but liberty abroad.\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Nevada is seeking recognition, \nand I will yield the floor to the Senator at this time.\n  Mr. REID. I extend my appreciation to the Senator. I want to complete \nanything I have on this legislation prior to our automatic 5 o'clock \nbreak, and I want to say a couple things.\n  First of all, just so the record is clear, there were a number of \nthings written about J. Edgar Hoover but one of the most telling things \nwas written on the day of his death when a local columnist wrote about \nsome of the things they were beginning to discover in some detail, the \nfiles he had kept on people. And this one columnist indicated he had \nreviewed the titillating tidbits about such diverse figures as Marlon \nBrando, Harry Belafonte, athletes like Joe Namath, Lance Rentzel, Joe \nLouis, Muhammad Ali, and, of course, he was always hard on all black \nleaders. Included in this article was Ralph Abernathy and Roy Ennis. \nAfter Dr. King was assassinated, he continued his work going after his \nwidow. It wasn't good enough that he had attempted to vilify this man; \nhe went after the widow.\n  And then I guess it is all summed up by a note that President Nixon \nsent to John Dean when he said, and I quote, ``He's got files on \neverybody,'' which I guess is true. I deleted some swear words in the \nnote from Nixon to Dean.\n  So I hope that we could get this part of the history at least off the \nFBI building. It is a great institution. Whenever I can do anything \nlegislatively to help the FBI, I have done that. I think they are a \ngreat organization that today we should be proud of, and in spite of J. \nEdgar Hoover the FBI I think has a great reputation.\n  Mr. President, let me just say, since I see my friend from Arizona in \nthe Chamber, and I know we have a 5 o'clock break, a couple words to \nextend my appreciation to the majority leader for setting a time \ncertain that we can take up the IRS bill, which certainly is one of the \nmost important things that we can do, the restructuring of the Internal \nRevenue Service. It passed the House widely last year. We should have\n\n[[Page S309]]\n\npassed it ourselves last year. I think it is important that we move \nforward on this as quickly as we can. It is important legislation to, \namong other things, change the burden of proof in a tax case from the \ntaxpayer to the tax collector. Certainly it seems that would be an \nappropriate thing to do. It needs to be restructured. It will pass \noverwhelmingly when we get to it. I hope that Chairman Roth will move \nforward with hearings as quickly as possible so that we can have all \nthat done. There is no excuse we cannot move forward with this on the \ndate in March the majority leader has selected.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, many opponents of this legislation have \nexpressed concerns about Congress stripping the local airport authority \nof its control. As many of my colleagues know, I have long advocated \nthat the Federal Government get out of the business of running National \nand Dulles airports. The Federal Government, much to my chagrin, \nmandates the number of hourly operations at National Airport and the \nlength of nonstop flights to and from National Airport, known to many \nof us as the so-called perimeter rule. My attempts to deregulate \nNational Airport have been met with ardent local resistance.\n  I just want to take this opportunity to say that National and those \nwho represent it cannot just accept the Federal regulations that are \nconvenient for them and that they like. If they oppose our activities \nwith respect to an airport that's still federally owned, I urge them to \nstep up and oppose all Federal statutes that specifically address \nWashington National, such as the perimeter rule.\n\n  I say to those who are raising this concern about our involvement by \nacting congressionally in renaming the Washington National Airport the \nRonald Reagan Airport, I hope that you will express at least a \nscintilla of that same zeal in trying to remove the Federal requirement \nthat every flight that leaves National Airport can go no further than \nwhat, just by coincidence, turns out to be the western edge of the \nrunway at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, which rule happened to have been \nput in by the former Speaker of the House, Jim Wright. I know that is \npurely coincidental.\n  The reality is that there are very strict Federal regulations that \ngovern National Airport and Dulles Airport, and those regulations \nshould be removed. So I continue, of course, also to be amused at the \nfact that at Washington National Airport, hundreds of thousands of \ndollars of revenue on an annual basis are lost, or perhaps millions, \nbecause of the reserved parking places for Members of the Congress, \ndiplomats and judges. But that problem has been, to a large degree, \nsolved, because the very clever and intelligent people that run \nWashington National Airport, when faced with occasional complaints by \npeople who were struggling past empty parking lots with a sign on them \nthat said ``Reserved for diplomats, Members of Congress and Supreme \nCourt Justices,'' struggling people like women with children, elderly \nindividuals who had to go much, much further away because these parking \nlots are reserved close in to the airport, they solved this problem for \nus, and it probably will not come up again, because they took down the \nsigns that said, ``Reserved for diplomats, Supreme Court Justices and \nMembers of Congress,'' and they put up signs that said, ``Reserved.'' \nSo, for all intents and purposes, that problem is pretty well resolved.\n  The fact is that it is outrageous and it is a disgrace. It is, again, \nan example of the Federal involvement in National Airport.\n  I would like to be serious for just a moment, if I could. I want to \nthank Senator Coverdell. I thank Senator Coverdell for bringing this \nissue up and for his usual tenacity in seeing this thing through. But I \nalso want to say it's not just tenacity that characterizes Senator \nCoverdell, it's a willingness to discuss and negotiate this issue with \nthose on the other side of the aisle so we have reached what I think is \na reasonable agreement that would resolve this issue. I thank my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle who have been willing to enter \ninto this agreement so we can have their legitimate concerns ventilated \nin the proper parliamentary fashion, the way we do business around here \nin the Senate.\n  I was disturbed last Thursday when apparently we were going to go \nthrough some kind of filibustering over this issue, rather than resolve \nit in the way we are resolving it now. I didn't think it was a good way \nfor us to start the year. So I thank my friends, especially the \nDemocratic leader, Senator Daschle, for his characteristic willingness \nto resolve the differences we may have had.\n  Each of these amendments which are germane will be voted on. I am \nsure many of them have merit. I remind my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle, they feel very strongly and with great affection for their \nheroes. And their heroes are deserving of their respect and affection. \nAnd we on this side of the aisle share that respect and affection for \ntheir heroes. Perhaps not to the degree, but certainly we share the \naffection and respect. We also on this side of the aisle believe that \nRonald Reagan did marvelous things, not only for all Americans but all \ncitizens of the world in providing an opportunity for peace and \nfreedom. He did keep the United States of America as a beacon of hope \nand freedom to all mankind and I believe that what we are going to do \nis exceedingly appropriate. I am pleased that we will be able to \nresolve this. I am sure that in the minds of many of us there is never \nany way we will be able to properly honor and commemorate his services \nto our Nation. What we are doing is done in a very small and \ninsignificant fashion in the grand scheme of things.\n  Again, I thank Senator Coverdell and I thank my friends on the other \nside of the aisle for their cooperation with us on this issue. I \npledge, at least for myself and I think most people on this side of the \naisle, that when an issue of this nature arises which is emotionally as \nwell as intellectually important, that we will try to show and should \nshow the same consideration to you as was displayed on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my cosponsor, Senator McCain of \nArizona, for his remarks and for his support of this effort and for the \nenormous contribution he has made to our coming to this point. He spoke \nto an amendment that I want to take just a second on.\n  We understand there will be an amendment that would suggest that this \nis an intrusion into local matters. This is, of course, an amendment \nthat I would encourage all my colleagues to oppose. I would just cite \nthe Federal law that contemporarily governs Washington National. It \nsays:\n\n       The Federal Government has a continuing but limited \n     interest in the operation of the two Federally-owned airports \n     which serve the travel and cargo needs of the entire \n     metropolitan Washington region as well as the District of \n     Columbia and the national seat of Government.\n\n  To be candid about it, I think if it weren't for the Congress, \nNational Airport, like many other close-in metropolitan airports, would \nhave been closed. It is just that the Congress would never have \naccepted that. Of course it was funded by the Federal Government \nthrough 1987, and since that time has received appropriate grants from \nseveral Federal entities. So I believe the idea that there is not an \nappropriate national and Federal role here cannot be substantiated. \nThis is one amendment--I have not seen the exact language--but that I \nwould encourage opposition to. I see my good friend from New Jersey is \non the floor to make comments. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I know to many Americans it may be \nstrange or bewildering with so many issues before the Congress that we \nare debating naming, honoring, Americans by placing their names on \ndifferent public facilities. But who we honor, and the names we attach \nto public buildings and locations, matters. By whom we choose to honor, \nwe set standards about ourselves. We communicate with future \ngenerations the qualities of people that we admire and the things in \nAmerican history that\n\n[[Page S310]]\n\nare important. The Senator from Georgia has rightly noted the \nconsiderable contributions of former President Ronald Reagan. The \nSenator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, has offered an amendment of importance \nfor another reason.\n  Standards change. Nations learn conduct and behavior. No sooner had \nthe Soviet Union fallen than statues of Stalin and Lenin tumbled to the \nstreets. Samoza, Marcos, Batista had probably not even left office when \ntheir names and statues were removed from public places.\n  In America through the years we have had despots of a different \norder, people who lived in a free society but did not always respect \nthe law. They were part of the U.S. Government but not always in its \nbest traditions. The Senator from Nevada has raised an issue before the \nSenate that the name of J. Edgar Hoover remains on the FBI building in \nWashington, DC. Every year, thousands of American schoolchildren wander \ndown Pennsylvania Avenue to visit the FBI headquarters. Because the FBI \nnow is often a model of law enforcement in our country, because the \ncountry has been fortunate to have Louis Freeh as its director, who \nrespects the law and is in the highest traditions of our country, \nneither those schoolchildren nor many of our citizens, probably, \nremember or understand that there was a time when the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation's leadership, under J. Edgar Hoover, neither lived within \nnor always respected the law.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Will the Senator yield for just one moment for an \nadministrative note?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I am happy to yield.\n\n\n                            Order for Recess\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I ask unanimous consent that at the closure of the \nSenator's remarks, the Senate stand in recess until the hour of 6 this \nevening. As you know, this is for the Members' briefing on Iraq.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for 1 minute following his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest as amended by the Senator from Nevada? Hearing none, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Upon J. Edgar Hoover's death, perhaps his closest \ncolleague in the Bureau, William Sullivan, described Mr. Hoover as a \n``master blackmailer.''\n  We now know from historians Mr. Hoover had compiled files on \nPresidents of the United States and Members of Congress through illegal \nsurveillance and wiretapping, holding dossiers on leaders of the U.S. \nGovernment. It was a practice of blackmail. It changed policies. It \nthreatened America. And it was wrong.\n  Probably no one of his time, through subterfuge, within the U.S. \nGovernment, had a more adverse impact on the civil rights movement. He \nvigorously dispatched agents of the U.S. Government to harass the \nleadership of the NAACP. He called leading civil rights organizations \n``Communist fronts.'' Indeed, he instructed agents to stand by and \nwatch as racist mobs would beat up voter registration workers and civil \nrights workers in organized and lawful marches. To the extent that he \nharassed Martin Luther King, former Vice President Walter Mondale \ncalled J. Edgar Hoover ``a disgrace to every American.''\n  I don't know how we explain to American schoolchildren who leave \ntheir schools to honor Martin Luther King, who learn in our classrooms \nabout the American Constitution, our respect for laws, that when they \nvisit this proud Capital of our country, the most prominent name on the \nmost prominent street in America is J. Edgar Hoover. But I know this, \nthe Senator from Nevada is right, that it is a contradiction that \nshould be removed, an explanation that no longer need be made. It is \ntime to remove the name of J. Edgar Hoover from the FBI building. And \nif it is not enough that we suspected all along his intimidation of \nPresidents and his violation of basic rights, his biographers now give \nus more than enough reason. If you don't respect the Constitution, or \ncivil rights, or civil liberties, Mr. Hoover lived outside the laws \nthat he pretended to uphold.\n  It is now known that he had secret relationships with underworld boss \nFrank Costello, whose primary duties in organized crime including \nfixing games of chance and horse races. Gambling tips were given to Mr. \nHoover, so he was able to support a lifestyle and live with income \noutside of the law. He had close contacts with members of New York's \norganized crime families as well, who he refused to investigate, or \neven acknowledge that they were a public policy problem for more than a \ndecade. It is now claimed that outside of these illegal acts, within \nthe bureau itself he used hundreds of thousands of dollars of public \nmoney for his own personal use.\n  The Senator from Nevada has brought before the Senate a painful \ndecision, because it requires an honest reflection on a period of \nhistory of our own country.\n  Mr. Hoover was not in the best traditions of this country. And in a \ntime when many fear that civil liberties in our country are sometime \nthreatened, no longer from without but from within, it is a valuable \nmessage not only to our own people but, indeed, to law enforcement that \nwe honor people not only who enforce the law but who live within it.\n  As Richard Cohen of the Washington Post observed in 1990:\n\n       You affect the future, by what you do with the past and how \n     you interpret it. All over the world, when regimes change, so \n     do names. Danzig becomes Gdansk. Images of Lenin come down \n     all over Eastern Europe, and in the Soviet Union, Stalingrad \n     becomes Volgograd. These are all political statements. They \n     say, ``there's a new way of doing things.''\n\n  Mr. President, exactly, there is a new way of doing things.\n  The Senator from Georgia offers the name of Ronald Reagan because \nRonald Reagan makes us proud. He was the right way of doing things in \nour country, whether you agree with the naming of the airport or you do \nnot. Mr. Hoover is an indication of the wrong way of doing things in \nAmerica. I support the amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada. I \nam proud to offer it with him. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there may be some who feel that Ronald \nReagan was not the greatest President. I have already laid across this \nRecord how I feel about Ronald Reagan. But everyone would say that \nRonald Reagan's heart was in the right place. He was a true American \npatriot who did what he thought was best for this country.\n  The direct opposite is applicable to J. Edgar Hoover. He didn't do \nthings that were good for this country.

The Senate is considering S. 1575.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. We are returning \nto the Ronald Reagan legislation, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n[[Page S311]]\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. It is my understanding that the Senator from \nConnecticut is here to speak on his amendment. I wonder if I might get \nthe Senator's attention for a moment. About how long does the Senator \nneed?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be taking maybe all of 5 to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, shortly, I will offer an amendment. I am \nmaking some drafting corrections to it. When that is completed, I will \nsubmit it to the desk for consideration. Allow me to, first of all, ask \nunanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in a moment I will send that amendment to \nthe desk. First of all, on the underlying question here, in terms of \nthe naming of the National Airport in honor of President Ronald Reagan, \nI support that, Mr. President. I realize others apparently do not, and \nI certainly respect people's right to make that decision. For those who \nhave been around here long enough, I guess going back to the days when \nPresident Reagan served as President, there were not many issues on \nwhich we agreed. I fought rather vociferously on issues involving Latin \nAmerica, domestic policy, and questions on a wide range of issues. But \nI happen to believe that the people who have served this country as \nPresident, elected twice, deserve recognition. Whether you agree with \nhim or not, the people elected him twice to the highest office in our \nland, a position achieved only by some 41 or 42 people in the history \nof this country. So if this is what has been chosen by those who \nbelieve it is a proper way to recognize the contribution of Ronald \nReagan, I respect that.\n  It has been suggested that we haven't named anything for Harry Truman \nor Jimmy Carter, and I think that is a legitimate point. Certainly, \nthose who want to do that--and I join them in that--ought to find an \nappropriate way to recognize their contributions. It seems to me that \nthat ought not to detract from the effort here to name something in \nhonor of Ronald Reagan.\n  So if this is what the President's family and others believe, as I \nsaid a moment ago, is an appropriate and proper way to recognize him, \nthen this Senator--this Democrat, if you will, which comes secondary to \nmy role in the Senate, and as a citizen--I am going to support that \ndecision. I noted earlier that it took many years before we were able \nto recognize Franklin Delano Roosevelt with a monument. He was one of \nthe greatest Presidents in this century, having led us during the Great \nDepression and a world war. I was saddened that day when the ceremonies \nopened up that wonderful memorial, and it occurred to me that there \nweren't many people on the other side of the aisle there.\n  We ought to take politics out of these decision whenever possible. I \ncall for the establishment of a commission so that, henceforth--not on \nthis issue, but henceforth when we decide to name or rename facilities, \nthere ought to be a deliberative way in which we proceed. Too often \nthese issues are raised when a particular monument is up for \nconsideration, and based on whether people agree or disagree with that \nchoice, there are suggestions about sending this off to a commission or \nsome group for consideration. I understand that, but too often once \nthat issue is put aside and ended, we go back to business as usual and \nnever come back to how we consider these issues.\n  So the amendment that I am offering establishes a commission. It does \nnot condition this naming on the commission being established, but \nrather it is prospective. So that in the future when such namings or \nrenamings will occur, there is a process by which we can do it.\n  I offer a second part of this amendment, which is a Sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution that has to do with the naming of facilities here on \nthe Capitol grounds. Rather than trying to write statutory law here, I \njust made it a Sense-of-the-Senate resolution that would establish a \ncommission made up of former Members of Congress from both parties. So \nthat on the Capitol grounds when we are naming rooms or facilities \nwithin the Capitol here, there would also be a deliberate process by \nwhich we go, and that is really a sense of the Senate. The idea is that \nit would give our former colleagues a role to play when the issue arose \nas to whether or not we ought to name buildings, facilities, porticoes, \nor balconies that have been named in the past. I think as temporary \ncustodians of these wonderful grounds of the Capitol, we ought to be \ndeliberate and cautious in how we go about naming these facilities, so \nthat long after we are gone, there is an appropriate designation that \nthe test of time would wear well.\n  I point out to my colleagues that, in the last 24 hours or so, we \nhave heard of the people who have just been named to the National \nBasketball Association Hall of Fame. What is the relationship? I note \nthat there is a requirement that there be a period of 5 years since the \nperson has left professional basketball before they can even be \nconsidered. I note that Larry Bird, someone I admired immensely, as \nmost Americans did for his great skill on the basketball court, I \nsuppose you might have made the case when he retired in 1992 that he \nshould have been named immediately. Yet, the rules are that you have to \nwait 5 years and then a board thinks about it, analyzes it, and makes \nits judgment.\n  All I am suggesting here is as temporary custodians, for these \nwonderful Capitol grounds, that we ought to establish a similar kind of \na process before we go off and name buildings and rooms and facilities \nand other parts of these grounds for people who may be very well \ndeserving of such a designation, but the test of time and a little \ndeliberation would serve us all well and serve future generations well \naccordingly.\n  So there are two parts of this amendment. First is that we would \nestablish, by law, a commission that would consider naming, in future \ndays, Federal facilities around the country. And the second part is a \nsense of the Senate to deal with the Capitol grounds and buildings.\n  Mr. President, as I say, this is prospective. It doesn't affect the \ndecision of naming the National Airport for Ronald Reagan. I support \nthat. I said to my colleagues that, despite whatever differences--and \nthey were significant--I had with this American President, I believe \nthat naming such an airport for him is not inappropriate. In fact, \nhaving served this Nation for 8 years as President, chosen by the \nAmerican public, a designation such as this in his honor is \nappropriate, and I support that.\n  With that, I will be happy to yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, if the Senator seeks a rollcall vote, \nwhich would occur tomorrow, it would be appropriate to ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1641\n\n (Purpose: To provide an orderly process for the renaming of existing \n                          Federal facilities)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1641.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. FEDERAL FACILITIES REDESIGNATION ADVISORY GROUP.\n\n       (a) In General.--There is established a Federal Facilities \n     Redesignation Advisory Group comprised of--\n       (1) 2 members of the House of Representatives designated by \n     the Speaker of the House;\n       (2) 2 members of the House of Representatives designated by \n     the Minority Leader of the House;\n       (3) 2 members of the Senate designated by the Majority \n     Leader of the Senate;\n       (4) 2 members of the Senate designated by the Minority \n     Leader of the Senate; and\n       (5) the Administrator of General Services.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of the Advisory Group is to \n     consider and make a recommendation concerning any proposal to \n     change the name of a Federal facility to commemorate or honor \n     any individual, group of individuals, or event.\n       (c) Criteria.--\n       (1) In general.--In considering a proposal to rename an \n     existing Federal facility, the Advisory Group shall \n     consider--\n       (A) the appropriateness of the proposed name for the \n     facility, taking into account any history of association of \n     the individual for whom the facility is proposed to be named \n     with the facility or its location;\n\n[[Page S312]]\n\n       (B) the activities to be carried out at, and function of, \n     the facility;\n       (C) the views of the community in which the facility is \n     located (including any public comment, testimony, or evidence \n     received under subsection (d));\n       (D) the appropriateness of the facility's existing name, \n     taking into account its history, function, and location; and\n       (E) the costs associated with renaming the facility and the \n     sources of funds to defray the costs.\n       (2) Age and current occupation.--The Advisory Group may not \n     recommend a proposed change in the name of a Federal facility \n     for a living individual unless that individual--\n       (A) is at least 70 years of age; and\n       (B) has not been an officer or employee of the United \n     States, or a Member of the Congress, for a period of at least \n     5 years before the date of the proposed change.\n       (d) Administration.--\n       (1) Meetings.--The Advisory Group shall meet publicly from \n     time to time, but not less frequently than annually, in \n     Washington, D.C.\n       (2) Hearings, etc.--In carrying out its purpose the \n     Advisory Group--\n       (A) shall publish notice of any meeting, including a \n     meeting held pursuant to subsection (f), at which it is to \n     consider a proposed change of name for a Federal facility in \n     the Federal Register and in a newspaper of general \n     circulation in the community in which the facility \n     is located, and include in that notice an invitation for \n     public comment;\n       (B) not earlier than 30 days after the date on which the \n     applicable meeting notice was issued under subparagraph (A), \n     shall hold such hearings, and receive such testimony and \n     evidence, as may be appropriate; and\n       (C) may not make a recommendation concerning a proposed \n     change of name under this section until at least 60 days \n     after the date of the meeting at which the proposal was \n     considered.\n       (3) Administrative support.--The Administrator of General \n     Services shall provide such meeting facilities, staff \n     support, and other administrative support as may be required \n     for meetings of the Advisory Group.\n       (e) Reports.--The Advisory Group shall report to the \n     Congress from time to time its recommendations with respect \n     to proposals to rename existing Federal facilities.\n       (f) Proposal To Rename DCA.--Notwithstanding subsection \n     (b), the Advisory Group shall not have the authority to \n     consider any proposal to rename Washington National Airport, \n     or a portion of the airport, in honor of former President \n     Ronald Reagan.\n\n     SEC. 2. REPORT REQUIRED BEFORE EITHER HOUSE PROCEEDS TO THE \n                   CONSIDERATION OF LEGISLATION TO RENAME FEDERAL \n                   FACILITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--It shall not be in order, in the Senate or \n     in the House of Representatives, to proceed to the \n     consideration of any bill, resolution, or amendment to rename \n     an existing Federal facility unless the Advisory Group has \n     reported its recommendation in writing under section 1(e) \n     concerning the proposal and the report has been available to \n     the members of that House for 24 hours.\n       (b) Rules of Each House.--This section is enacted by the \n     Congress--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and of the House of Representatives, and as such subsection \n     (a) is deemed to be a part of the rules of the Senate and the \n     House of Representatives; and it supersedes other rules only \n     to the extent that it is inconsistent therewith; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     the Senate and the House of Representatives to change the \n     rules (so far as relating to the procedure of the Senate or \n     House of Representatives, respectively) at any time, in the \n     same manner and to the same extent as in the case of any \n     other rule of the Senate or House of Representatives.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING COMMISSION TO NAME \n                   FEATURES OF CAPITOL BUILDING AND GROUNDS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should \n     establish, in accordance with the rules of the Senate and the \n     House of Representatives, a commission consisting of former \n     members of Congress, appointed by the Speaker of the House, \n     the Minority Leader of the House, the Majority Leader of the \n     Senate, and the Minority Leader of the Senate, to recommend \n     the naming or renaming of--\n       (1) architectural features of the Capitol (including any \n     House or Senate office building); and\n       (2) landscape features of the Capitol Grounds.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, may I inquire of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Georgia, chairman of the committee, may it not be possible--and I \nsee my colleague, the distinguished Democratic leader arriving. He has \nan amendment that is very similar. In fact, it is drawn in similar \nlanguage, but it has a different application. I inquire as to whether \nor not the ordering of the amendments might be such that his amendment \nbe considered--\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I yield to the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I think the Senator may be referring to \nan amendment that I understand the Senator from Virginia may be \noffering. I will be offering another amendment. But I think the \nsuggestion made by the Senator from Connecticut is a good one and \nperhaps we could make that arrangement later on in the unanimous \nconsent agreement.\n  Mr. DODD. I hope that might be the case. It would be a proper \nordering of these.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Could the \ndistinguished floor manager, the distinguished Senator from Georgia, or \nthe distinguished Democratic leader, advise the Senate, is tonight to \nembrace all of the debate that is going to be on the central bill as \nwell as the amendments and, therefore, Senators desiring to speak \nshould do so this evening?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. By close of business this evening.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at some point I hope to be recognized for \na period not to exceed 4 or 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent I believe \nwe have established the order of the amendments. The first was an \namendment to be offered by Senator Daschle or his designee regarding \nthe commission. So the Senator's desire that that be considered first \nis accomplished.\n  The next amendment is the one offered by the Senator from Connecticut \nto be followed by another amendment to be offered by Senator Daschle or \nhis designee regarding Dulles Airport. There is then an amendment to be \noffered by myself, which I would at the moment not likely offer, to be \nfollowed by the amendment which has already been offered by Senator \nReid dealing with the FBI building. There is a provision for a relevant \namendment to be offered by the majority leader which may or may not be \noffered, and a similar amendment--I think that is what we have here--to \nbe offered by the minority leader. So I believe the order has been \nestablished, and it accomplishes what the Senator from Connecticut \nwould have preferred.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for that.\n  Mr. President, if I may inquire further, I was just told--I apologize \nto my colleague from Virginia, Senator Robb--it is my understanding \nthat the distinguished Democratic leader would be offering the \ncommission amendment. All I was suggesting is if it is appropriate at \nthe proper time that an unanimous consent request would provide an \norder for these amendments so there would be a proper flow here in a \nway that we would consider the amendment of the Senator from Virginia, \nI suspect, prior to mine, and then mine. If that would be the order, \nagain, I am here on the floor because I have another engagement and was \nasked to come over and properly deal with the amendment which I want to \noffer. There was no attempt to try to get ahead of anybody in line. \nMaybe a sequencing of these amendments would serve everybody's \ninterest. I would have no objection to that, if the amendment of the \nSenator from Virginia can be considered prior. We can deal with this at \na later point.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. If I might ask a question of the minority leader, is \nthe amendment of the Senator from Virginia fulfilling this first \namendment request, he or his designee, on the commission amendment?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will respond, if the Senator will yield, by \nacknowledging the leadership of the Senator from Virginia. It is my \nunderstanding that he will be prepared to offer the amendment relating \nto a commission and that we would want to precede to the other \ncommission amendment offered by Senator Dodd.\n\n[[Page S313]]\n\n  I will simply inform colleagues that the amendment relating to the \nrenaming of Dulles International Airport will likely not be offered.\n  So, as the Senator from Georgia has suggested, it may be appropriate \njust to ensure that everyone has a clear understanding, that the \namendment relating to a commission offered by Senator Robb, be first; \nthe amendment by Senator Dodd, second; the amendment, should he choose \nto offer it, by Senator Coverdell, third; the amendment by Senator \nReid, fourth; the amendment by Senator Lott, fifth; and the amendment \nby myself relevant, or my designee, sixth.\n\n  Perhaps there would be an appropriate time to propound the unanimous \nconsent, and I will do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the sequence of the \namendments?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, which I \nwill not, the minority leader has followed the path of the unanimous \nconsent previously ordered. I can think of no reason for anybody on our \nside, even though I can't counsel with the majority leader, to object. \nTherefore, there is no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the indulgence of \nthe senior Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. President, as I noted, the amendment relating to the renaming of \nDulles International Airport will not be offered, and Senator Robb will \nbe offering the amendment relating to a commission.\n  I would like to use my authority under the unanimous consent \nagreement relating to the relevant amendment to send an amendment to \nthe desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1642\n\n (Purpose: To require approval by the Metropolitan Washington Airports \nAuthority of the renaming of Washington National Airport as the Ronald \n                        Reagan National Airport)\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Daschle) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1642.\n       On page 3, after line 5, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3. MWAA APPROVAL REQUIRED.\n\n       This Act shall not take effect until the Metropolitan \n     Washington Airports Authority approves the redesignation of \n     the airport provided for by section 1 of this Act.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, that is the entire text of the amendment.\n  I have spoken on this issue on several occasions, so I don't need to \nrestate many of the thoughts that were already expressed. Obviously, \nthis is an issue that will unfortunately divide us in some respects. \nBut I don't think the question of honoring President Reagan should \ndivide us at all.\n  There is no doubt that we, on a bipartisan basis, should seek ways in \nwhich to honor former leaders and former Presidents. Frankly, I am not \nall that troubled about whether they are still living and very much a \npart of our country and society in roles of leadership, as is the case \nwith President Reagan. I do think there have been a number of questions \nlegitimately raised about whether this is the most appropriate way with \nwhich to honor our former President, and the appropriateness of \nrenaming Washington National Airport has been the subject of a good \ndeal of discussion over the last several days.\n  Senator Robb and others have pointed out that Washington National \nAirport was transferred to the Metropolitan Washington Airports \nAuthority in 1986 under a 50-year lease. The Airports Authority and \nother local authorities under that lease have been given all \njurisdiction relating to matters pertaining to the airport. Some have \nnoted that imposing this change in name will require countless \nbusinesses to make, in some cases, substantial investments and \ncommitments financially that they have already noted could be very \nprohibitive.\n  Some asked as well whether it is appropriate, given the fact that the \nInternational Trade Center in Washington will be named after our former \nPresident, Ronald Reagan in May. This is the single most expensive \nFederal building ever erected and is second only to the Pentagon in \nsize. The naming of this building will provide us with a sufficient \nopportunity to call attention to Ronald Reagan's commitments and \ncontributions to this country.\n  That isn't the only matter that will be raised with regard to \nrenaming or naming of facilities. A new Nimitz-class aircraft carrier \nwill be named after the former President as soon as it is completed.\n  So we have the International Trade Center to be named in May and the \nNimitz-class aircraft carrier in the near future. We have clearly \ndemonstrated that we are prepared to honor this former President on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  Many people have questioned whether or not the Greater Washington \nBoard of Trade's views about renaming Washington National Airport ought \nto be considered. In a letter to Congressman Shuster, the Washington \nBoard of Trade noted that this change ``would be very confusing to air \ntravelers, visitors, and local residents alike.''\n  The imposition of the Federal Government on local jurisdiction has \nalso been raised. Perhaps no one spoke more forcefully and passionately \nabout the importance of local control, about the importance of local \ndecisionmaking, about the importance of giving more power to the local \nlevel, than President Reagan. Yet, we find the chairman of the \nArlington County Board in opposition to this name change. Christopher \nZimmerman, the chairman of the Arlington County Board, noted, \n``Memorializing President Reagan by imposing a name change, against the \nwishes of the local business community, Metropolitan Washington \nAirports Authority, and local jurisdictions which it serves, would \ncertainly go against the spirit and intent of the President's actions \nwhile in office.''\n  The chairman of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, also \nquestions whether Congress could impose the change legally without the \nauthority's consent, given the contractual arrangements under which we \nare now operating. Alexandria Mayor Kerry Donley is concerned that the \nname change could affect nearby businesses and suggested that Congress \n``leave well enough alone.''\n  The city council of Alexandria also urges Congress to ``retain the \npresent name of Washington National Airport, which honors the ``Father \nof our Nation' and our first President, George Washington.''\n\n  Linwood Holton, who served as the chairman of the Airports Authority \nwhen the Federal Government leased Washington National Airport in 1986, \nalso opposes renaming it. He argues that the purpose of the lease was \nto achieve ``local control, management, operation and development of \nthe airport,'' and that this bill is not ``consistent with either the \nliteral terms or the purpose of that lease agreement'' and ``would be \ndetrimental to the airport and its users and affect the traveling \npublic in ways currently not intended by the drafters of this \nlegislation.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Mr. Holton's \nletter sent by Mr. Holton to Congressman Moran which describes the \nconcern in greater detail be printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as I noted, President Reagan made it very \nclear that were he to waive the magic wand, the more the Federal \nGovernment could turn local decisionmaking over to local \ndecisionmakers, the happier he would be. Here we have virtually every \nsingle local decisionmaker elected and appointed who oppose the very \nrenaming that is incorporated into this legislation.\n  How ironic that in the name of President Reagan we do the very thing \nthat he opposed the most--forcing Federal will on local officials.\n  I don't think that Congress should pass legislation that removes \nWashington's name from National Airport and\n\n[[Page S314]]\n\nreplaces it with the name of another President, or anybody else, over \nthe objection of local officials. I personally oppose it. But that \nshouldn't be the issue. In the name of the spirit of Ronald Reagan, the \nissue should be, what do the local authorities think? What would they \ndo? And if we are prepared to say tomorrow that we don't care what they \nthink, it doesn't matter how opposed they are, we are going to do it \nanyway, Mr. President, how ironic.\n  How ironic, indeed. The airports authority has only had this very \nunique opportunity to govern themselves for 11 years. We turned over \nthat airport to them for 50 years.\n  Another irony is that Ronald Reagan signed that legislation. So it, \nindeed, represented the spirit of the Reagan philosophy when we enacted \nit. All the local entities, in keeping with his spirit, said, ``We'll \ntake this responsibility. This is what is probably as indicative of \nwhat you are trying to do as anything. You are turning over the \nresponsibility to us. Give it to us.'' Now they have it. They have had \nit for 11 years. Now the irony is we are saying, ``Well, we take it \nback.'' And all the more ironic, we are going to take it back in the \nname of President Ronald Reagan.\n  So, Mr. President, the amendment I am offering simply says, look, if \nwe are going to honor the spirit of former President Ronald Reagan, \nlet's, at the very least, do what he said was what his Presidency was \nall about. Let us ensure that local governmental decisionmakers have \nthe opportunity to have a voice in keeping with the spirit of Ronald \nReagan. So the amendment I am offering is very simple. It states this \nact shall not take effect until the Metropolitan Washington Airports \nAuthority approves the redesignation of the airport.\n  As everyone knows, the airports authority is a bipartisan panel, \nRepublicans, Independents and Democrats. Let's do what President Reagan \nsaid we should do in honoring his name, in honoring the spirit of his \nPresidency. Let us not say we did not mean it in 1987. Let us not say, \nover your objections, we are going to do it anyway. Let's honor the \nspirit of this President by doing the right thing. Let's give them the \nopportunity to have a voice. This amendment does that. We will have the \nopportunity to vote tomorrow. I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                               Linwood Holton,\n\n                               McLean, Virginia, January 29, 1998.\n     Hon. James Moran.\n       Dear Jim: I am writing to you in regards to the pending \n     legislation to change the name of the Washington National \n     Airport to ``Ronald Reagan National Airport.'' I had the \n     honor of working closely with the Congress and Secretary of \n     Transportation Elizabeth Dole in advancing the Metropolitan \n     Washington Airport Act of 1986 to transfer Washington \n     National Airport out of the Federal Government to the \n     Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. This legislation \n     of course was signed into law by President Reagan. The \n     Airports Authority was created by the Commonwealth of \n     Virginia and the District of Columbia. The Federal Government \n     leased Washington National Airport and Washington Dulles \n     International Airport to the Authority for fifty years \n     beginning on June 1987. I was privileged to serve as Chairman \n     of the Authority at that time and I signed that lease on \n     behalf of the Authority.\n       The purpose of the transfer, as recited in the lease \n     itself, was to achieve ``local control, management, operation \n     and development'' of the airports. I am very concerned that \n     after ten years of this lease arrangement, the Congress now \n     proposes to take unilateral action to change the name of the \n     airport. This is not at all consistent with either the \n     literal terms or the purpose of that lease agreement. \n     Further, the change to the name as proposed, while honoring a \n     president for whom I have the greatest respect, would be \n     detrimental to the airport and its users and affect the \n     traveling public in ways certainly not intended by the \n     drafters of this legislation.\n       The lease grants the Authority complete control, power, and \n     dominion over the airports. The intent of Congress, Virginia \n     and the District of Columbia in this arrangement is clear. \n     Even though the Federal Government continues to own the \n     underlying land, the airport is to be treated as any other \n     airport, not as a federal facility. In the past, there have \n     been changes made to the lease at the request of Congress and \n     the changes have been brought about by a mutually agreed upon \n     agreement to the lease to secure the consent of the Airports \n     Authority. The proposed name change legislation does not \n     acknowledge the need to obtain the consent of the Authority \n     and this is inconsistent with the intended relationship \n     between the Federal Government and the Authority.\n       As for the consequences, the removal of ``Washington'' from \n     the airport name removed the location and market identifier \n     that is obviously very important to travelers and shippers at \n     points distant from the Washington area. It is worth noting \n     that well over half of those who travel through National are \n     not residents of the Washington region. The word \n     ``Washington'' provides immediate market and location \n     information. Without it, there will be confusion that does \n     not exist today about where the airport is and what market it \n     serves. The cost of such loss of identity and confusion may \n     not be readily qualified, but I believe that it would be \n     substantial. There also are other costs such as the costs to \n     local businesses who have associated their identities with \n     Washington National Airport.\n       In conclusion, the legislation which transferred Washington \n     National Airport to the Metropolitan Washington Airports \n     Authority granted to the Authority the control and oversight \n     of the airport. Unilateral action by the Congress to take the \n     drastic action of changing the name of the airport is \n     inconsistent with both the spirit and the intent of the \n     transfer.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                   Linwood Holton.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, this amendment would be among those \nthat the sponsors of S. 1575 would oppose. I want to first acknowledge \nthat the Senator from Connecticut in offering his amendment, which is \nprospective, offered his support of the effort of the sponsors to \nredesignate Washington National as Ronald Reagan Washington National \nAirport, and that he would vote for this redesignation even though he \nhad differences. The differences were so pronounced I can remember \nthem, and I was a long way from the Senate at that time.\n  I really believe the nature of the amendment that has just been \ndescribed by the minority leader is basically a disagreement of \nredesignation and not so much one of the philosophical issue over local \ncontrol. Of course, it isn't the Alexandria airport. It is the National \nAirport. Cities are constitutional instruments of States. The Governor \nof the State of Virginia has endorsed the redesignation of the airport \nwhich is an appropriate governing local facility.\n  But, again, we could argue this forever. The level of Federal \nGovernment control of operations at Washington National is without \nparallel in the United States. The legislation that authorized limited \nlocal authority over Washington National contains congressional \ndirectives--appropriate landing fees, employee bargaining rights. The \nprecise composition of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority \nand political affiliations of its members is mandated by Congress, not \nconstructed by State or local government.\n  By statute, the Federal Government limits the length of nonstop \nflights to and from National Airport--National Airport, not \nAlexandria--to 1,250 miles. That is the Metropolitan Washington \nAirports Act of 1986, section 6012. There is only one other federally \nimposed perimeter rule in the country, in the entire United States--\nLove Field, TX.\n  In addition, the Federal Government controls the number of slots, \ntake off and landing rights at four ``high density rule'' airports: \nWashington National, New York LaGuardia, JFK, and Chicago O'Hare. Air \ncarriers are limited to 37 hourly operations at Washington National; 11 \nhourly operations are reserved for commuter aircraft, and 12 for \ngeneral aviation and business activity, all Federal mandates.\n  When the Federal Government authorized the lease of Washington \nNational and its limited governance by the Washington Metropolitan \nAirports Authority in 1986, it codified all of the regulations of the \nMetropolitan Washington Airports into Federal regulations. These \nFederal regulations govern airport operations such as taxicab \noperation, nighttime noise, and landing fees. And the Federal \nGovernment has the prerogative and authority legally and emotionally to \ndesignate the name of the National Airport.\n  I could cite the specific authority, but in deference to time, and I \nknow the Senator from Virginia has strong opinions and wants to be \nheard, I will not linger on this question. I do want to say that any \namendment that creates a retroactive impoundment on Congress' ability \nto designate will be opposed by the sponsors.\n  We are pleased that there is bipartisan support for this designation. \nI want\n\n[[Page S315]]\n\nto say, and I have mentioned it several times during the discussion, \nobviously there are disagreements on the contribution, but, as Senator \nDodd said, there is no disagreement about the admiration the American \npeople have for former President Ronald Reagan. To be quite candid \nabout it, talking about the ironies, I am not sure that the naming of \nthe most expensive building in Washington's history is exactly in \nconcert with President Reagan.\n  In conclusion, let me say that this President is wounded. He was a \ngreat American servant. He is in the sunset of his life. He is probably \nengaged in the most courageous battle he ever was tested for. I think \nsometimes extraordinary conditions and circumstances call for a \nspontaneous response. I am most hopeful that this legislation will be \nsuccessful, and it will be successful in order to meet his 87th \nbirthday, which is this Friday.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the great State of Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. I thank the Chair. I thank you for the characterization of \nVirginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1643\n\n (Purpose: To provide an orderly process for the renaming of existing \n                          Federal facilities)\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, in accordance with the unanimous consent \nagreement, I would like to send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia (Mr. Robb) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1643.\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I was going to go ahead and allow the \namendment to be read because it is not terribly long, and I think it is \nfairly straightforward.\n  I am also conscious of the fact that there are sufficient votes to \npass the Coverdell bill as it was introduced. I would point out, \nhowever, that the bill was not referred to a committee. It was not \nsubject to a hearing and does not have the benefit of any of the local \ninput that would have been so desirable under the circumstances.\n  Because local views on this proposal were not considered, I made a \nspeech in this Chamber yesterday reflecting my own views and, I \nbelieve, the views of many Virginians. My comments were similar to the \nviews that were just expressed by the minority leader, who spoke more \neloquently but came to the same conclusion.\n  I mentioned yesterday that I have long personally admired President \nReagan's personal courage, his strong convictions, his infectious \nspirit, and his leadership in the national and international community. \nBut I thought this particular legislation, because it was contrary to \nthe wishes of all of the local governments that President Reagan worked \nso hard to empower, was simply not the right way to proceed.\n  I also suggested that renaming some other international airport, \nperhaps in his native State of Illinois or his adopted State of \nCalifornia, would be more appropriate. I talked about the fact that the \nmost substantial Federal building ever built in Washington is going to \nbe dedicated in his name on May 5. And I talked about the fact that the \nnext super carrier will bear his name, and that given his role as \nCommander in Chief and the respect that he generated, not only \nthroughout the United States but around the world, I wholeheartedly \nendorsed this designation.\n  The difficulty I have with the legislation before us is that it \ndirectly contravenes the legacy of the man we hope to honor. We have \nclear expressions of the views of the local governments. Both of the \nlocal governments, the City of Alexandria, and the County of Arlington, \nhave expressed their concern and opposition.\n  In addition, my predecessor, the first Republican Governor of \nVirginia in this century, and a former chair of the Metropolitan \nWashington Airports Authority, was very explicit in his description of \nthe intent of the 50-year\n\n[[Page S316]]\n\nlease of the National Airport and Dulles airport, and the autonomy it \nprovided for the Airport Authority.\n  I do not quarrel with the characterization of the distinguished \nSenator from Georgia as to some of the Federal strings that remain \nattached to that particular legislation. We seldom really ever turn \nloose anything in its entirety in this body, and I understand that.\n  But the bottom line is, in my judgment, this legislation disregards \nthe views of local officials and business leaders, and thrusts the \ncentral government upon a local authority that was divorced from the \nfederal government by President Reagan himself.\n  The amendment I have sent to the desk simply creates an advisory \ngroup which would take into consideration the views of the local \ncommunity, and the history of a particular facility, before any \nrenaming occurs.\n  There may be other approaches to this particular challenge, and in \nlistening to the distinguished minority leader, I believe his approach \nwould be entirely appropriate.\n  The problem here is that we are taking up and considering legislation \nthat has not been considered by any committee of the Senate, that has \nnot had any hearing. Indeed, when we have been able to ascertain the \nviews of those who would normally be considered most interested, they \nhave expressed reservations in various degrees. I think it would be \nappropriate under the circumstances, since the legislation before us \ntoday purports to honor the 40th President, if the views of either the \nPresident or Mrs. Reagan, who speaks so eloquently for him, were known \non this matter. I think that would be helpful to many Members in \nconsidering this issue.\n  It may be entirely appropriate, after appropriate consultation, to go \nahead and rename Washington National Airport.\n  In any event, the haste with which we move is designed, I believe, to \nreflect the coming birthday of President Reagan. And I would simply \nsuggest that some consultation with the family--and specifically the \nPresident, or speaking for the President, Mrs. Reagan--might very much \nbe in order.\n  A very nice ceremony, I am informed, has been planned for the \ndedication of the Ronald Reagan Building on May 5. The former First \nLady is planning to participate, and I think all the Members of \nCongress will certainly be there, if not in body, then in spirit.\n  So I ask my colleagues to think about what we are doing, and think \nabout whether or not this properly honors the man it is designed to \nhonor.\n  The amendment I have sent to the desk will be taken up tomorrow. \nAgain, it would create an advisory group that would deliberate on some \nof the issues I have raised, and report back to Congress in a timely \nfashion. It would not preclude any action by the Senate or the House. \nIt would simply provide input from some of the local governments and \ncommunities that President Reagan so strongly defended during his long \nand illustrious tour as President of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I request the yeas and nays on the amendment I have \nsent to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, unless the Senator from Georgia wishes to \ntake the floor at this point, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, once again this argument, which I just \nsimply do not understand, suggesting that the President's family \nsomehow has to come here and seek homage, or lobby the Congress--it is \nan incredible argument. That family would never do that. Anybody \nwaiting for some communique or something of that nature--I would not \nhold my breath.\n  As I said a moment ago, this is something the Nation has to feel it \nneeds to do. It is a ``thank you'' that they need to express; our \ncountry, our citizens. There is no way that family would come here \nlobbying for this kind of thing. I am always surprised when it is \nsuggested that we have not heard or something. That is disappointing.\n  Mr. President, again I want to make it clear, the sponsors are going \nto oppose any of these amendments that change the rules retroactively, \nthat impose some new constraint on this redesignation or some new \nconstraint on the Congress. The concept of putting something in place \nprospectively may be laudable. There are several amendments here by \nMembers on the other side who have declared they are going to vote for \nthe redesignation but they have another issue that they are bringing \nforward. I think that is appropriate. But the amendments that reach \nbackwards are not acceptable on our side.\n  The argument that a local city or authority has jurisdiction here is, \nin my judgment, a specious argument. The Federal Government's \nrelationship with Washington National Airport is indisputable. You \ncannot go to that airport without seeing the presence of it any day or \nany night. And the law is very clear, in terms of the Federal role in \nthat facility. I will read the short version rather than the elongated:\n\n       The Federal Government has a continuing but limited \n     interest in the operation of the two federally owned airports \n     which serve the travel and cargo needs of the entire \n     metropolitan Washington region as well as the District of \n     Columbia as the national seat of Government.\n\n  As I said, municipalities are creatures of State governments and \nchartered by State governments and the Governor of the State of \njurisdiction is in support of the redesignation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/03/senate-section/article/S310-3", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                       executive message referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/03/senate-section/article/S316-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT OF DEFERRALS OF BUDGETARY RESOURCES--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                            PRESIDENT--PM 89\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; referred jointly, pursuant to the order of January 30, 1975, to \nthe Committee on Appropriations, to the Committee on the Budget, to the \nCommittee on Finance, and to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control \nAct of 1974, I herewith report eight new deferrals of budgetary \nresources, totaling $4.8 billion.\n  These deferrals affect programs of the Department of State, the \nSocial Security Administration, and International Security Assistance.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to establish food safety research, education, and \nextension as priorities of the Department of Agriculture, to require \nthe use of a designated team within the Department of Agriculture to \nenable the Department and other Federal agencies to rapidly respond to \nfood safety emergencies, and to improve food safety through the \ndevelopment and commercialization of food safety technology; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                     THE SAFE FOOD ACTION PLAN ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I am pleased to be introducing companion \nlegislation to a bill prepared by Congresswoman Debbie Stabenow \nentitled the Safe Food Action Plan Act.\n  The bill adds food safety as a new statutory priority in the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture's research, education and extension programs. \nThis should mean that more of the nearly $1.5 billion spent through \nexisting grant and research programs, including the Fund for Rural \nAmerica, will be focused directly on food safety. That's the kind of \nawareness that we need, to prevent and combat food supply \ncontamination.\n  The bill also creates a Federal Emergency Management Agency-like \napproach to dealing with food safety crises. Currently, there are at \nleast 3 agencies within the Department of Agriculture that have some \nresponsibility for preventing and controlling outbreaks of food borne \ndisease, not to mention the Food and Drug Administration and the \nCenters for Disease Control. This bill establishes a Food Safety Rapid \nResponse Team across internal division boundaries within USDA that will \ncoordinate with other Federal agencies. If outbreaks do occur, the \nAmerican people must be confident that the government is prepared to \nefficiently handle and limit such public health threats.\n  This legislation was developed by Congresswoman Stabenow over several \nmonths with input from all parts of the food production and consumption \nchain and the Department of Agriculture. It is an excellent complement \nto the Administration's enforcement enhancement proposal. The Safe Food \nAction Plan is a sensible and cost-effective way to make the Federal \ngovernment responsive and responsible.\n  I hope the Agriculture Committee will seek to move this legislation \nas quickly as possible, and I urge my colleagues to consider \ncosponsoring this important measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Frist, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Lott, Mrs. \n        Hutchison, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Abraham, Mr. \n        Grams and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 1599. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit \nthe use of somatic cell nuclear transfer technology for purposes of \nhuman cloning; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               THE HUMAN CLONING PROHIBITION ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today, I rise to announce that we are \nintroducing a measure that places an outright ban on the use of somatic \ncell nuclear transfer technology for human cloning purposes. Recent \nreports that a Chicago-based scientist is prepared to move forward with \nhuman cloning experimentation forces us to engage in an immediate \ndebate on how far out on the moral cliff we are willing to let science \nproceed before we as a Nation insist on some meaningful constraints. \nWhen the announcement was made last month that these efforts to raise \nfunds for human cloning were going forward, we stated that we would \nmove on an emergency basis to deal with this and to express, through \ncongressional action, a strong sense that this is unacceptable and we \nmust prohibit it. I am pleased to be joined by the distinguished \ncosponsors, Senators Frist, Gregg, Lott, Hutchison, Shelby, Nickles, \nLugar, Abraham, Grams, and Hagel.\n  I believe we no longer have the luxury of waiting around for this \nmorally reprehensible act to occur in the United States. Less than a \nyear ago, the cloning of Dolly, the now famous sheep, provoked a debate \nof unprecedented proportions, a debate which to this day generates \npolar feelings of fascination and fear. We have in this body adopted \nprohibition on the use of Federal funds for research on or \nexperimentation in human cloning. The time has come for us to make that \na flat prohibition and to put our country in league with other \ncivilized countries, which are saying human cloning is not acceptable \nand will not go forward.\n  Daily news accounts about the successful cloning of animals and \nstories of organizations and individuals pursuing human cloning have \nkept the debate alive. The American public is asking if similar \ntechniques can be used to clone humans, and they are concerned whether \nsomething that was once thought only to be science fiction is now \ncloser to becoming a reality.\n  Those opposing a prohibition on human cloning suggest that we cannot \nput the genie back in the bottle, and that we cannot stop progress. I \nsuggest that in this case our technological capability may be \noutrunning our moral sense.\n  The ethical implications of human cloning are staggering. We should \nnever create human life for spare parts, as a replacement for a child \nwho has died, or for other unnatural and selfish purposes.\n  How many embryos or babies would we tolerate being created with \nabnormalities before we would perfect human cloning? It took Scottish \nscientists over 276 tries before they created Dolly, and we still do \nnot even know if Dolly is the perfect sheep. What would have happened \nhad those 276 been badly deformed potential humans? For humans, these \nresults are entirely unacceptable. Dr. Ian Wilmut, the leading Scottish \nscientist who created Dolly, himself has stated that he can see no \nscenario under which it would be ethical to clone human life. I believe \nhe is right.\n  Moreover, in September of 1994, a federal Human Embryo Research Panel \nnoted that ``allowing society to create genetically identical persons \nwould devalue human life by undermining the individuality of human \nbeings.''\n  Further, the panel concluded that ``there are broad moral concerns \nabout the deliberate duplication of an individual genome. The notion of \ncloning an existing human being or of making carbon copies of an \nexisting embryo appears repugnant to members of the public. Many \nmembers of the panel share this view and see no justification for \nfederal funding of such research.''\n  And I would emphatically argue that those statements apply to private \nsector research as well.\n  It is also important to note that this legislation is narrowly \ndrafted, and it's sole objective is to ban the use of somatic cell \nnuclear transfer for human cloning purposes. We worked overtime to \nensure that this language was specific so that it would only ban this \ntechnique which was used to create Dolly.\n\n[[Page S319]]\n\n  This technique has also been criticized by a representative of the \npharmaceutical industry. In a prepared statement for members of \nCongress, dated January 13, 1998, the representative said,\n\n       While conventional cloning technology has been used \n     extensively worldwide to meet global medical needs, nuclear \n     transfer technology is fraught with untold failures for each \n     partial success, and has major significant ethical issues \n     associated with it. Furthermore, it has no strong therapeutic \n     or economic based need driving it at this time. The concept \n     that it is a viable alternative to infertile parents is cruel \n     and completely unjustified. I would challenge you not to \n     confuse the two as the Congress considers its options here.\n\n  In addition, our bill is straightforward and clear. It prevents a \nspecific technology that is characterized by industry, researchers, \ntheologians, ethicists, and others as ``fraught with failures and \nlacking therapeutic value.'' This bill, however, does allow important \nand promising research to continue.\n  In vitro fertilization research, plant and animal cloning, the \ncloning of DNA, cells and tissues, stem cell research, gene therapy \nresearch and other activities taking place at the Human Genome Center \noffer great hope in addressing how to prevent, diagnose, and treat many \ndevastating diseases. And these types of research will continue to \nthrive.\n  I have long been a supporter of biotechnology; however, there is a \nbright line between those activities and human cloning. And we must \ndraw that line.\n  The belief that all human beings are unique and created by God is \nshared by billions of us around the world. Human cloning, or man's \nattempt to play God, would change the very meaning of life, of human \ndignity, and of what it is to be human. Are we ready for that? Hardly.\n  I heard a profound statement from a leading bioethicist. He said, ``I \nhave heard from many who wish they could be cloned, but I have never \nheard someone say that they wished they were a clone of someone \nelse''--because cloning threatens human dignity, of what it means to be \na unique individual.\n  There is a bright line between those activities--the legitimate \nactivities and investigations to improve human life, to deal with the \nsignificant diseases that we have that might be ameliorated by \ntechnological research. We have to draw the line between legitimate \nresearch in medicine and human cloning.\n  Human cloning would devalue human life by undermining the \nindividuality of human beings. We must show the moral courage and have \nthe will to say no to human cloning.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1599\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Human Cloning Prohibition \n     Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDING.\n\n       Congress finds that in order to prevent the creation of a \n     cloned human individual through human somatic cell nuclear \n     transfer technology, it is right and proper to prohibit the \n     creation of cloned human embryos that would never have the \n     opportunity for implantation and that would therefore be \n     created solely for research that would ultimately lead to \n     their destruction.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the Federal Government \n     should advocate for and join an international effort to \n     prohibit the use of human somatic cell nuclear transfer \n     technology to produce a human embryo.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I now yield to my distinguished colleague \nfrom Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to support both the intent and to \nunderscore the importance of this bill, the Bond-Frist-Gregg bill, \nwhich does address the issue of human cloning. The purpose of this bill \nis very straightforward, and that is to prohibit human cloning while at \nthe same time protecting very important scientific research.\n  This bill does prohibit human cloning, a topic which has captured the \nimagination of not only the American people but really the world over \nthe past year after the successful experiment by Ian Wilmut, the \nScottish scientist who successfully cloned ``Dolly,'' an adult sheep, \nusing a new technique, a technique called somatic cell nuclear \ntransfer. Public sentiment in response immediately registered, and I \nthink appropriately so, opposition to the application of this specific \ntechnique to human beings. Fears that the ``Dolly'' experiment might \nlead to asexual human reproduction nearly drowned out pleas from the \nscientific community to protect legitimate cloning research at the \ncellular and animal level.\n  Congress responded to the public fear by enacting a ban on the \nFederal funding for any human cloning research at the embryo level, and \nthe President soon after issued an Executive order forbidding \nimplantation of a cloned human embryo with the use of Federal funds.\n  Scientists in the private sector have been left unregulated, but most \nresearch societies, appropriately I believe, adopted a voluntary \nmoratorium on the use of somatic cell technology for the purpose of \nhuman cloning.\n  Since no imminent threat of human clones at the time was perceived, \nthe issue took a back seat to the more visible items before the \nCongress and the country, such as balancing the Federal budget. With \nthe exception of an occasional television show, movie or news report, \ncloning pretty much faded from the mental radar screen of most \nAmericans. But then not too long ago Dr. Seed gave new life to the \nwhole human cloning debate when he announced in a public way his \nintention to use the Wilmut technique to create a cloned human \nindividual.\n  At that time it very quickly became apparent to virtually everyone \nthat without Federal legislation human cloning could, and many feel \nwould, occur in the private sector without due consideration to the \nethical, social, theological and medical implications of this new and \nunproved technique.\n  Our collective instinct that human individuals should not now be \ncloned has its roots in the most basic feelings we have about human \nnature. We know that an individual is more than the sum of individual \nbody parts, more than the sum of the various organs, and we know \ninstinctively that the human spirit, no matter how hard we try or how \ngood the science is, cannot be replicated. The science of somatic cell \nnuclear transfer is still today imperfect. Wilmut's technique can be \ndangerous, we know, to the cloned child. In addition, we have no idea \nabout the long-term effects of asexual reproduction on the human gene \npool or on the psychosocial structures of our world.\n  Quite simply, we are not prepared for a human ``Dolly'' experiment. \nAnd our inability to respond adequately to the moral, the ethical and \nthe theological implications of this technology has highlighted a \nserious weakness in the fabric of our social structure. In too many \ninstances we have allowed ourselves to separate scientific progress \nfrom those ethical conversations. We no longer can divorce the two. Dr. \nSeed and others have forced us to confront our deficits and to fashion \ntimely answers to the timeless question: ``Is there a line that should \nnot be crossed even for scientific or other gain, and if so, where is \nit?'' I have used that line in this Chamber before. It is from a \nWashington Post editorial in October of 1994: ``Is there a line that \nshould not be crossed even for scientific or other gain, and if so, \nwhere is it?''\n  The debate on this particular bill, and others that address the issue \nof cloning, will have to center around that question, where is that \nline?\n  I have a research background. I am a research scientist. I am a \ntransplant physician. I am committed to the public welfare through that \npublic service of medicine and science. From that background, I \npersonally would use four principles that I think must, in my view, be \na part of any legislation as we embark on prohibiting human cloning. \nFirst, legislation must differentiate between human cloning on the one \nhand and animal, cellular and molecular and plant cloning on the other. \nIt is that human dimension we must address and address very \nspecifically in order not to halt the progress of science in those \nother fields.\n\n  The second principle. The legislation must be crafted very \nspecifically with surgical precision, with laser-like precision, \nnarrowly, yes, so that we will avoid inadvertently banning other \nnontargeted research, research that is critically important to \nimproving health care for the current generation as well as that next \ngeneration, important research that we must protect in terms of stem \ncell research, in vitro fertilization, our search for cures of juvenile \ndiabetes, our attack on prevention and cure of cancer.\n  The third principle that I would encourage my colleagues to adopt as \nwe\n\n[[Page S321]]\n\nembark upon this banning of human cloning is that the legislation must \nprevent the specific technique of somatic cell nuclear transfer, the \nspecific technique, because of its potential to facilitate the mass \nproduction of cloned human embryos that could be created solely for \nresearch and ultimately destroyed.\n  Fourth, the legislation must include the creation of a new permanent \nbipartisan commission that is representative of the American people, \nrepresentative of science, representative of our ethical thinking, \nrepresentative of theology, so that we can more adequately address in a \nsophisticated, mature way, consistent with the science and ethical \nthinking of today, the many issues that are going to face us in this \narena of bioethics, this rapidly oncoming onslaught of science, and \nvery good science as we look to the future. Science is critically \nimportant as we learn better to address the ravages of disease.\n  Two temptations threaten both science and ethics in the current \nenvironment. On the one hand, we have the pressure on legislators, \noften unfamiliar with the specifics of scientific issues, to rush out \nand draft laws that could hamper important research efforts if we are \nnot very careful. And on the other hand, almost in parallel, is this \ntendency on the part of some scientists to say, no, we don't need that \ntype of intervention, that type of oversight of ethics, of laws. Thus \nwe have science and we have ethics that are almost lost in this \npolitical morass and the public meanwhile stays outside, all too often \nfrightened, uninvolved, and unengaged.\n  This cloning debate, I think, maybe for the first time in the history \nof this body, forces us to address what is inevitable as we look to the \nfuture, and that is a rapid-fire, one-after-another onslaught of new \nscientific technological innovation that has to be assimilated into our \nethical-social fabric.\n  Thus, this bioethics commission is important to consider these future \ninnovations as they come forward. Right now there are no fewer than six \nlegislative proposals that are either on the table or soon to be on the \ntable on this issue of banning human cloning. These bills range from a \nsweeping prohibition of all types of cloning to really some very \nsymbolic bans. The National Bioethics Advisory Commission, the \ncommission that was appointed by and that reports to President Clinton, \ndid a good job of trying to assimilate the information on the cloning \nunder their very short, 90-day deadline last year. But they, as hard as \nthey tried, were unable to substantively address the ethical issues \nsurrounding human cloning.\n  The commission cited at the time that they had inadequate time to \ntackle these difficult ethical issues in the context of our pluralistic \nsociety, and they focused primarily on scientific concerns, as well as \nthe less abstract issue of safety--a really proscribed area of safety, \nsaying that the technique today is not safe or has not been proven to \nbe safe. And then they appealed, to us, as Americans--to take this to \nthe public square, take this out to the people around America and talk \nto them and look for the sort of leadership that we need on forming a \nnational policy on human cloning.\n  In an effort to follow up on the recommendations of the National \nBioethics Commission, the Senate Labor Committee's Subcommittee on \nPublic Health and Safety, which I chair, on June 17, 1997, held a \nhearing. That hearing was entitled ``Ethics and Theology: A \nContinuation of the National Discussion on Human Cloning.'' And we \nheard outstanding testimony on all sides of the issue, from Christian, \nIslamic and Jewish traditions and from philosophers and theologians, \nall well schooled in biomedical ethics. We launched a much broader \npublic debate with questions about the nature of human individuality, \nabout family, about social structure. However, the time has now shown \nthat both a Presidential commission and the U.S. Congress are really \ninadequate forums to fully address the diversity, the richness, the \nfabric of these bioethical issues and their importance as we look to \nthe future.\n  I, therefore, today, through our legislation, propose creation of a \nnew, permanent, independent national bioethics commission, \nrepresentative of the public at large, with the combined participation \nof experts in law, ethics, theology, medicine, social science, \nphilosophy, coupled with interested members of the public. It is my \nhope that this public commission, in an environment where it can \ncapture the diversity of our society today, will forge a new path for \nour country in the field of bioethics, in considering new techniques \nand new innovation; that they will enable us to have an informed, \nongoing, thoughtful, scientific debate in the public square, without \nfear or politics driving our decisions.\n  In this proposal the majority and minority leaders of Congress would \nappoint members of the panel, but no current Member of Congress or \nadministration political appointee would participate during his or her \nterm of office. Individuals would serve for 3 years. There would be 24 \nsuch members, six subcommittees looking at the various fields that I \nhave mentioned. Each and every citizen should have an opportunity to \nparticipate in these ongoing bioethical debates.\n  I anticipate that some may question the role of theology in a public \npolicy debate. Certainly the President's advisory commission found that \ntheir considerations were incomplete without examining the religious \nmores of our culture. Indeed, our Founding Fathers also recognized that \npublic policy could not be formulated in a theological vacuum. While \nthey forbade the establishment of a state religion, they simultaneously \naffirmed the rights of God-fearing people to make their voices heard in \nthe public arena. Today, and throughout history, religion has been a \nprimary source of the beliefs governing these decisions for men and \nwomen of all races, of all creeds.\n  While these four principles that I outlined earlier start as the \nbasic foundation, we do need to reach out and receive the input of \nothers as we embark upon consideration of this piece of legislation. \nWith these four principles it is my hope that we can build a bipartisan \ncoalition of support for a ban on human cloning.\n  I do call upon my colleagues in the scientific community to step \nforward and participate in the ongoing debate in good faith. We have \nmuch to gain from your expertise, and the public has much to gain from \nyour ongoing work.\n  In recent days, many in the biotechnology community have argued that \nthe mass production of cloned human embryos for research purposes is \nvital to their research efforts. I appeal to them this afternoon to \ntake one step back and recognize that this legislation does not \nprohibit the vast majority of all current embryo and stem cell \nresearch, and acknowledge that there are serious ethical dilemmas \nassociated with churning out human embryos as if they were products on \nan assembly line.\n\n  Let us have no more hedging about what is and what is not an embryo. \nBiologically it is clear. Proponents of embryo research have always \nbeen quite open that they are seeking to do embryo research because the \nembryo is biologically unique. So I say to those in the research \ncommunity, this legislation does not threaten your ongoing embryo \nresearch. It does not limit your ability to experiment with stem cells, \nwith gene therapy, with in vitro fertilization. Help us stop Dr. Seed \ndead in his tracks. Keep this issue focused on human cloning and join \nour efforts to create a new commission to deal with these issues on an \nongoing basis.\n  The Washington Post, in 1994 said:\n\n       The creation of human embryos specifically for research \n     that will destroy them is unconscionable. . .. Viewed from \n     one angle this issue can be made to yield endless \n     complexities. What about the suffering of individuals and \n     infertile couples who might be helped by embryo research? \n     What about the status of the brand new embryo? But before you \n     get to these questions [the Post says] there is a simpler \n     one.\n\n  It is the question I read a few minutes ago at the beginning of my \nstatement and I will read it again. It is:\n\n       Is there a line that should not be crossed, even for \n     scientific or other gain, and if so, where is it?\n\n  As the editor of the New England Journal of Medicine has said in the \npast:\n\n       Knowledge, although important, may be less important to a \n     decent society than the way it is obtained.\n\n  This is where the debate will be over the next several days. I \nbelieve that an\n\n[[Page S322]]\n\nhonest ban on human cloning must begin at the level of the activation \nof the embryo, not later at some point, at the time of implantation. Is \nthe Federal Government capable of preventing a woman from implanting an \nembryo derived from her own genetic makeup into her own womb? Is it \nwise to perfect our cloning techniques on embryos when we forbid their \nimplantation? Yes, I think we need to start the ban at the time of the \nactivation of the embryo.\n  In closing, it is clearly vital that our public debate and reflection \non scientific developments keep pace with and even anticipate and \nprepare us for this, really, rush of new scientific knowledge that is \ncoming toward us each and every day. The moral and ethical dilemmas \nthat are inherent in the cloning of human beings may well be our \ngreatest test to date. We don't simply seek knowledge, but we seek the \nwisdom to apply that knowledge. As with each of those mind-boggling \nadvances of the last century, we know that there is the potential both \nfor good and evil. Our task as legislators is to reflect the public \ntrust, to define the role of the Federal Government in harnessing this \ntechnology for the good. Our task as citizens is to exercise \nresponsible stewardship of the precious gift of life.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 1600. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to waive \nin the case of multiemployer plans the section 415 limit on benefits to \nthe participant's average compensation for his high 3 years; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                   INTERNAL REVENUE CODE LEGISLATION\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code \nlimits annual pension benefits from multiemployer plans to the average \nof the three highest consecutive years of income while a worker was \ncovered by the plan. The bill I am introducing today will exempt \nmultiemployer pension plans from the income-based limitations imposed \nby Section 415.\n  Section 415 was enacted in an effort to prevent the ``gaming'' which \noccasionally occurred in single employer pension plans. Such gaming \noccurred when an employee's salary was significantly increased the year \nbefore retirement in order to increase that employee's retirement \nbenefits. Single employer plans, unlike multiemployer plans, are \ngenerally based upon an employee's salary prior to retirement. \nReportedly, from time-to-time, such gaming did occur in single employer \nplans.\n  Multiemployer plans, conversely, are generally based on the number of \nyears an employee has worked, plus the collectively-bargained-for \ndollar amount of contributions made into the plan. Therefore, such \ngaming generally did not occur in multiemployer plans. Section, 415, \nhowever, does not distinguish between multiemployer plans and single \nemployer plans. Instead, section 415 assumes the salaries of all \nworkers increase steadily over the course of their employment. In fact \nhowever, for many workers, particularly those that belong to \nmultiemployer pension plans, there is no such steady increase in \nearnings. Rather, the salaries of these workers tend to fluctuate over \nthe course of their employment. Because of these fluctuations, the \nthree highest years of compensation for many multiemployer plan \nparticipants are not necessarily consecutive.\n  Congress recognized this inequity and in 1996, as part of the Small \nBusiness and Jobs Protection Act (Pub. L. 104-188), exempted public \nemployee pension plans from Section 415. This exemption, however, was \nnot extended to private sector employees covered by multiemployer \npension plans. The bill I have introduced today exempts multiemployer \npension plans, single employer plans would still be subject to Section \n415 limitations.\n  Congressman Peter J. Visclosky introduced similar legislation in \nApril 1997 in the House of Representatives. His bill has bipartisan \nsupport in the House. I hope that my bill will receive similar support \nhere in the Senate. Private sector employees, who are covered by \nmultiemployer pension plans, should receive the same treatment as \npublic sector employees.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to prohibit \nany attempt to clone a human being using somatic cell nuclear transfer \nand to prohibit the use of Federal funds for such purposes, to provide \nfor further review of the ethical and scientific issues associated with \nthe use of somatic cell nuclear transfer in human beings, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n         the prohibition on cloning of human being act of 1998\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, Senator Kennedy and I are \nintroducing legislation that would prohibit, for a period of ten years, \nany person from attempting to clone a human being using somatic cell \nnuclear transfer technology.\n  The reason for this legislation is simple: the cloning of a human \nbeing today remains scientifically dangerous, morally unacceptable, and \nethically flawed.\n  Let me be clear about the intent of this legislation right at the \noutset: I am opposed to human cloning. I do not believe it is, or will \never be, morally acceptable to clone human beings.\n  This legislation was carefully drafted so that it would not prevent \nor interfere with vital biomedical research into cancer and other \ndiseases, birth defects, infertility, and the mass production of drugs \nand vaccines.\n  The Bill authorizes the continuation of the National Bioethics \nAdvisory Commission, and requires the Commission to report to the \nPresident and the Congress in 4\\1/2\\ years and 9\\1/2\\ years on the \nscience and ethical issues associated with this technology.\n  The Commission's reports to Congress will also include a \nrecommendation as to whether the moratorium should be continued beyond \nthe ten years set by this legislation.\n\n\n                   technology outpaces public policy\n\n  The successful cloning of a sheep in Scotland last year, using a \nprocedure known as somatic cell nuclear transfer, was hailed as an \namazing scientific success.\n  But it also ignited a fierce international debate about the potential \nuse of this technique to clone human beings, and the ethical, legal and \nreligious questions raised by such a possibility.\n  Chicago-area physicist Dr. Richard Seed stirred that debate into full \nforce last month when he told the media that he intends to clone human \nbeings.\n  He said that there were ten clinics in the United States interested \nin offering cloning services and that he believes the demand will be \nfor over 200,000 cases per year, according to the American Medical \nNews.\n  Setting aside the fact that Dr. Seed's claims are somewhat \nimplausible at the moment given the rudimentary state of cloning \ntechnology, he did hit a nerve.\n  This is a classic example, in my view, of how the lightening speed \nwith which we are able to develop new technologies can sometimes get \nahead of society's ability to handle these advances.\n  I do not believe that, today, we know enough to permit human cloning, \nor to make a permanent determination about the use of this technology.\n  But, when writing laws that would have such an enormous impact on an \nentire field of science--science that includes the development of \nlifesaving \n\n[[Page S323]]\n\nnew therapies for disease, the prevention of birth defects, and \nfertility--Congress has a responsibility to be prudent and judicious in \ndrafting legislation.\n\n  In preparing this legislation, Senator Kennedy and I, and our staffs, \nmet with representatives from: The National Bioethics Advisory \nCommission; The National Institutes of Health; The American Society for \nReproductive Medicine; The Biotech Industry Association; The Department \nof Health and Human Services; The Food and Drug Administration.\n  Included in the National Bioethics Advisory Commission were members \nof the religious and medical ethics communities.\n  This bill is carefully drafted to prohibit attempts to clone a human \nbeing, while not impeding other important research involving somatic \ncell nuclear transfer technology, and the cloning of cells, tissues, \nDNA and animals.\n\n\n                          procedure is unsafe\n\n  One compelling reason to prohibit attempts to clone human beings at \nthis time is the fact that the technology is so new that it is unsafe \neven in animals.\n  Dolly, the famous cloned sheep, was the only success out of 277 \nattempts, and the procedure has not been repeated successfully \n(although there are reports of the pending birth of at least one calf \nusing the same cloning procedure).\n  The National Bioethics Advisory Commission concluded that attempting \nto use this process to clone humans would involve unacceptable risks to \nthe fetus or potential children, possibly resulting in multiple \nmiscarriages, developmental abnormalities, and unknown risks to the \nmother.\n  Even if and when concerns about safety are resolved, the ethical \nconcerns of cloning humans still remain.\n  This 10-year moratorium will allow us the time to study and debate \nthis issue fully--which we as a society need to do because the science \nis not going to go away, and we will have to have a greater \nunderstanding of it to make informed decisions on its use.\n\n\n                must not impede other important research\n\n  The term ``cloning'' is used by scientists to describe various \ntechniques that involve duplication of biological material, both animal \nand human.\n  A blanket ban on cloning, or on use of the nuclear cell transplant \ntechnique to clone, would be too broad, and would deprive the United \nStates--and the world--of invaluable biological research.\n  The cloning technique that was used to produce Dolly, somatic cell \nnuclear transfer, was an extension of experiments carried out over 40 \nyears to facilitate understanding of how development of an animal from \na single fertilized egg is carried out.\n  The agricultural industry has been using nuclear transplantation \nresearch to try to improve livestock breeding.\n  Biotechnology companies are exploring ways to use cloning to improve \nthe production of therapeutic drugs.\n  And health researchers are hoping that a greater understanding of \nnuclear transplantation cloning can lead to new treatment for human \ndisease.\n\n\n                                 cancer\n\n  A report issued by the National Institutes of Health, dated January \n29, indicates that cloned tissue culture cells have allowed scientists \nto test potential chemotherapies on cancerous cells, to study the \ncellular events leading to cancer, and to mass-produce drugs and \nvaccines.\n\n\n                                diabetes\n\n  Cloning technology, using somatic cell nuclear transfer, could teach \nscientists how to augment the insulin-producing cells in diabetics \nusing cells from their own bodies.\n  Not only could cloning technology revolutionize the treatment for \ndiabetes--it could potentially provide a cure for this debilitating \ndisease.\n\n\n                              skin grafts\n\n  Somatic cell nuclear transfer might also be used in the future to \ncreate skin grafts for people who are severely burned.\n  In severe burn cases, many times there is not enough healthy skin on \nthe victim to perform a skin graft, so doctors are forced to use skin \nfrom cadavers or skin cells grown in tissue culture.\n  In both cases, the skin is genetically different from the burn \nvictim, and while it provides material for emergency grafting, this \nskin is ultimately rejected and the patient must undergo numerous \ngrafting.\n  Somatic cell nuclear transfer cloning could allow skin to be \ngenerated from virtually any of the burn victim's cells, which would be \ngenetically identical and therefore should not be rejected.\n  The life-saving possibilities for this technology are enormous:\n  The creation of nerve stem cells to treat neurodegenerative diseases \nsuch as multiple sclerosis, Lou Gehrig's disease, Alzheimer's disease, \nParkinson's disease, and to help repair injuries of the spinal cord.\n  Bone marrow stem cells, for the treatment of leukemia, sickle cell or \nother blood diseases.\n  Liver cells to treat liver damage.\n  Muscle cells to treat muscular dystrophy and heart disease.\n  Cartilage-forming cells to reconstruct joints damaged by injury or \narthritis.\n  The cloning of cells in culture has reduced the use of live animals \nin research and has allowed studies of human cells that could not be \ndone otherwise.\n  As scientists from NIH clearly warn, without future research \nexploring this cloning technology, these and other potential life-\nsaving possibilities will be unrealized.\n  NIH scientists also make clear that all of these possibilities can be \naccomplished without using this technology to create, or attempt to \ncreate, a human being.\n  A letter signed by more than 50 medical and patient organizations \nsent to Members of Congress last week warning very clearly of the \ndanger in drafting legislation to ban cloning.\n  In the letter they say:\n\n       Poorly crafted legislation to ban the cloning of human \n     beings may put at risk biomedical research, such as the use \n     of cloning techniques on human cells, genes and tissues, \n     which is vital to finding the cures to the diseases and \n     ailments which our organizations champion.\n\n\n             the differences with the president's proposal\n\n  The bill we are introducing today is very similar to the President's \nbill which he sent to Congress on June 10, 1997. But it differs from \nthe President's in five important aspects.\n  First, it adds additional provisions to prevent anyone from cloning \nor even attempting to clone a human being. In addition to the outright \nprohibition on cloning a human being, the bill prohibits the use of \nFederal funds for such a purpose. Furthermore, the bill prohibits \nshipping the product of somatic cell nuclear transfer in interstate or \nforeign commerce for the purpose of attempting to clone a human being. \nThis provision will ensure that no one may attempt to evade the law by \nshipping the product of somatic nuclear cell transfer overseas for the \npurpose of cloning a human being.\n  Second, it stiffens already tough penalties in the President's bill \nto deter any attempt at cloning a human being. The bill provides a \npenalty of $1,000,000 or three times the gross gain or loss from such a \nviolation, whichever is greater. In addition, the bill provides that \nany property used in an attempt to violate the act, as well as any \nproperty traceable to such an attempted violation, will be forfeited. \nFurthermore, the Attorney General, who is solely empowered to enforce \nthe act, is granted the power of injunction to immediately enjoin \nviolations.\n  Third, the bill preempts state laws that prohibit or restrict \nresearch regarding, or practices of, somatic cell nuclear transfer, \nmitochondrial or cytoplasmic therapy, or the cloning of molecules, DNA, \ncells, tissues, organs, plants, animals, or humans.\n  This provision is important because I believe we need a consistent \nnational policy and we should discourage the practice of ``forum \nshopping'' from state to state for lenient laws.\n\n  This bill is not intended to preempt state laws such as California \nPenal Code Title 9, Chapter 12, Section 367g, and California Business \nand Professions Code Division 2, Chapter 5, Article 12, Section 2260, \nwhich require that physicians and other medical personnel obtain signed \nwritten consent from patients before sperm, ova, or embryos are used \nfor any purpose other than reimplantation in the same patient or in \ntheir spouse, and require that any use\n\n[[Page S324]]\n\nof sperm, ova, or embryos of donors comply with the written intent of \nthe donor.\n  The California statues were passed in order to address serious \nallegations by at least 60 California families, that medical personnel \nat fertility clinics at the University of California at Irvine and the \nUniversity of California at San Diego transferred donors' sperm, ova, \nor embryos to researchers or implanted them in other women, without \ndonors' knowledge or consent. These allegations raise grave concerns \nabout serious violations of personal integrity and privacy. This \nlegislation is in no way intended to preempt or interfere in any way \nwith these California statutes, or with related statutes that would \nhave a similar effect.\n  Fourth, the bill we are introducing urges the President to cooperate \nwith foreign countries to enforce restrictions on human cloning. Other \ncountries are moving to ban human cloning and we should join them so \nthat scientists cannot evade our laws by moving their operations \noffshore.\n  Finally, our bill establishes a 10-year ban, as opposed to the 5-year \nban in the President's recommended legislation.\n  It is conceivable that there could be incredible scientific \nbreakthroughs with cloning technology over the next 3 to 5 years.\n  But developing a legal and moral framework for understanding of the \npotential use and abuse of this technology will take much longer.\n  This legislation sunsets after 10 years, during which time the \nNational Bioethics Advisory Commission must keep Congress and the \nPresident informed on the status of the science, its potential uses for \nsociety, and make recommendations on whether to continue the \nprohibition.\n  Congress can extend the ban temporarily or permanently at any time \nduring or after the ten year period if it so chooses.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Creating life outside of the normal reproductive process has \nchallenged many of our basic beliefs--never more so than with the \nnotion of cloning a human being.\n  It is important that we as a society engage in a rigorous public \ndebate to fully understand the science, the dangers, the potential \nbenefits, and the moral and legal implications of this technology.\n  Throughout history, science has empowered humankind to achieve things \nnever before believed possible. Our challenge is to harness this power \nwithout losing control over our own lives, or the moral compass that \nguides us.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to submit for the Record the \nletter to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 February 2, 1998.\n\n         Regarding: Legislation to Ban Cloning of Human Beings\n\n       Dear Member: We are writing to express our concern about \n     legislation pending in the Congress to ban the cloning of \n     entire human beings.\n       Let us be clear. We oppose the cloning of a human being. We \n     see no ethical or medical justification for the cloning of a \n     human being and agree with the conclusions of the National \n     Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) that it is unacceptable \n     at this time for anyone in the public or private sector, \n     whether in a research or clinical setting, to create a human \n     child using somatic cell nuclear transfer technology. We \n     recognize that this application of the technology raises \n     fundamental ethical and social issues. This technology is not \n     currently safe to use in humans.\n       The American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the \n     Biotechnology Industry Organization, and the Federation of \n     American Societies of Experimental Biology have all stated \n     that their members will not seek to clone a human being. \n     These three associations include essentially every researcher \n     or practitioner in the United States who has the scientific \n     capability to clone a human being.\n       We agree with NBAC in its report on cloning that: ``It is \n     notoriously difficult to draft legislation at any particular \n     moment that can serve to both exploit and govern the rapid \n     and unpredictable advances of science.'' Poorly crafted \n     legislation to ban the cloning of human beings may put at \n     risk biomedical research, such as the use of cloning \n     techniques on human cells, genes and tissues, which is vital \n     to finding the cures to the diseases and ailments which our \n     organizations champion. Cancer, diabetes, allergies, asthma, \n     HIV/AIDS, eye diseases, spinal cord injuries, Guillain-Barre \n     syndrome, Gaucher disease, stroke, cystic fibrosis, kidney \n     cancer, Alzheimer's disease, tuberous sclerosis, tourette \n     syndrome, alcoholism, autoimmune diseases, osteoporosis, \n     Parkinson's disease, infertility, heart disease, diseases of \n     aging, ataxia telangiectasia and many other types of research \n     will benefit from the advances achieved by biomedical \n     researchers.\n       We urge the Congress to proceed with extreme caution and \n     adhere to the ethical standard for physicians, ``first do no \n     harm.'' We believe that there are two distinct issues here, \n     cloning of a human being and the healing which comes from \n     biomedical research. Congress must be sure that any \n     legislation which it considers does no harm to biomedical \n     research which can heal those with deadly and debilitating \n     diseases.\n       Please keep patients' concerns in mind as you proceed in \n     analyzing this very complicated issue.\n           Sincerely,\n         AIDS Action Council; Allergy and Asthma Network/Mothers \n           of Asthmatics, Inc.; Alliance for Aging Research; \n           Alzheimer Aid Society; American Academy of Optometry; \n           American Academy of Pediatrics; American Association \n           for Cancer Education; American Association for Cancer \n     Research; American Autoimmune Related Diseases \n     Association; American College of Cardiology; American \n     College of Medical Genetics; American Diabetes \n     Association; American Heart Association; American \n     Paralysis Association; American Pediatric Society.\n         American Society for Reproductive Medicine; American \n           Uveitis Society; Americans for Medical Progress; \n           Association of Medical School Pediatric Department \n           Chairmen; Association of Pediatric Oncology Nurses; \n           Asthma & Allergy Foundation of America; A-T Children's \n           Project; Cancer Research Foundation of America; Cancer \n           Care, Inc.; Cancervive; Candlelighter's Childhood \n           Cancer Foundation; Cystic Fibrosis Foundation; \n           Foundation for Biomedical Research; Guillain-Barre \n           Syndrome Foundation International; International \n           Patient Advocacy Association.\n         Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology; Juvenile \n           Diabetes Foundation International; Kent Waldrep \n           National Paralysis Foundation; Log Cabin AIDS Policy \n           Institute; National Alliance for Eye and Vision \n           Research; National Alliance of Breast Cancer \n           Organizations (NABCO); National Association for \n           Biomedical Research; National Campaign to End \n           Neurological Disorders; National Coalition for Cancer \n           Research; National Foundation for Cancer Research; \n           National Gaucher Foundation; National Kidney Cancer \n           Association; National Osteoporosis Foundation; National \n           Patient Advocate Foundation; National Stroke \n           Association.\n         National Tuberous Sclerosis Association; Oncology Nurses \n           Association; Outpatient Ophthalmic Surgery Society, \n           Inc.; Parkinson's Action Network; Radiation Research \n           Society; Research!

Mr. President, several months ago, the world learned of \none of the most astounding developments in modern biology: the cloning \nof a sheep named Dolly. This extraordinary scientific achievement \nawakened widespread concern about the possibility of a brave new world, \nwhere human beings would be cloned and where individuals would seek to \nachieve a kind of immortality by reproducing themselves. There is \nwidespread agreement among scientists, ethicists, and ordinary \nAmericans that production of human beings by cloning should be \nprohibited, at least until the possibilities and pitfalls of this \nscientific procedure are better understood.\n  The President reacted rapidly to this scientific advance and the \nunprecedented issues it raised by asking the National Bioethics \nAdvisory Commission to study the issue and make recommendations. The \nCommission recommended that creation of human beings by cloning should \nbe banned for several years, and the Administration has submitted \nlegislation to implement this recommendation.\n  The legislation that Senator Feinstein and I are introducing today \nwill assure the American public that reproducing human beings by \ncloning will be prohibited. It largely follows the President's \nlegislation and the Recommendations of the Commission. It makes it \nillegal to produce human beings by cloning and establishes strict \npenalties for those who try to do so. In addition, it prohibits anyone \nfrom beginning the cloning process in this\n\n[[Page S325]]\n\ncountry and carrying out the implantation step in another country.\n  But just as important as what the bill does is what it does not do. \nIt does not seek to use public concern about cloning to establish a \nback door ban on research into human development.\n  A prohibition that goes too far could outlaw needed research on the \nprevention, treatment, and cure of cancer.\n  It could outlaw needed research on fertility, to help birth defects, \nand hereditary diseases.\n  It could outlaw needed research on the cure of spinal cord injuries.\n  All of these various kinds of research have broad support in Congress \nand the country. Yet a blunderbuss ban on human development research \ncould easily interfere with this important and life-saving research, or \neven halt it altogether.\n  In addition, the FDA has jurisdiction over human cloning and will act \nvigorously to shut down any clinic that operates without FDA approval. \nThe FDA must find that human cloning is safe and effective. Given the \ncurrent state of the science, the DFA would almost certainly decide \nthat a human cloning procedure is not safe at the current time. The FDA \napproval process is not a permanent ban on human cloning, but it \neffectively bans the procedures for the near future.\n  The American Medical Association and over forty national medical \norganizations and research groups have voiced support for the kind of \nresearch that is urgently needed to continue the progress we are making \nagainst a wide range of diseases. Benjamin Younger, the Executive \nDirector of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, has said, \n``We must work together to ensure that in our effort to make human \ncloning illegal we do not sentence millions of people to needless \nsuffering because research and progress into their illness cannot \nproceed.''\n  The legislation we are introducing today will do what the American \npeople want--ban the production of human beings by cloning. It strikes \nthe proper balance between assuring that human beings will not be \nreproduced through cloning and allowing needed research to continue. I \nhope that Congress will act promptly to enact this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

LANKA\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for Mr. Robb) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S.Res. 172\n\n         \n       Whereas February 4, 1998, is the occasion of the 50th \n     anniversary of the independence of the Democratic Socialist \n     Republic of Sri Lanka from Britain;\n       Whereas the present constitution of the Democratic \n     Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka has been in existence since \n     August 16, 1978, and guarantees universal suffrage; and\n       Whereas the people of the

and promotion of enhanced trade \n     and cultural ties: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates President Chandrika Bandaranaike \n     Kumaratunga and the people of the Democratic Socialist \n     Republic of Sri Lanka on the celebration of 50 years of \n     independence;\n       (2) expresses best wishes to the Government and people of \n     the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka as they \n     celebrate their national day of independence on February 4, \n     1998; and\n       (3) looks forward to continued cooperation and friendship \n     with the Government and people of the Democratic Socialist \n     Republic of Sri Lanka in the years ahead.\n\n     SEC. 2. TRANSMITTAL OF RESOLUTION.\n\n       The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit an enrolled copy \n     of this resolution to the Government of the Democratic \n     Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of Senate Resolution \n172, which commemorates the 50th Anniversary of independence of Sri \nLanka. I believe it is appropriate that we so mark this occasion by \noffering our congratulations to her excellency, President Kumaratunga \nand the people of Sri Lanka.\n  In the first five decades since Sri Lanka gained its independence \nfrom British colonial rule, Sri Lanka has held regular national \nelections as well as provincial and local government elections. The \nmost recent parliamentary elections were held in August 1994, and the \nthird presidential election was held in November 1994.\n  Sri Lanka has prospered economically since 1977, when it introduced \neconomic liberalization policies which shifted the economy away from \nstate controls, subsidies and public sector involvement to a market-\noriented system in which private entrepreneurship flourishes. The U.S. \nis Sri Lanka's largest trading partner, accounting for 30% of the \nlatter's exports, and over 90 U.S. companies have invested in Sri \nLanka, with a heavy concentration in mining and textiles.\n  U.S. official relations with Sri Lanka date back to 1850 when John \nBlack, an American merchant residing in Colombo was appointed the first \nAmerican commercial agent in GALLE. Fifty years later the agency moved \nto Colombo and became a consulate. It subsequently became an embassy in \n1948 after Sri Lanka became independent.\n  The exchange of bilateral visits has played an important role in \nstrengthening the cordial relations between our two nations. Then \nSecretary of State John Foster Dulles visited Sri Lanka soon after its \nindependence, and since that time members of this body as well as our \ncolleagues in the House have regularly visited this lovely country.\n  Despite its prosperity and commitment to democratic principles, Sri \nLanka has been plagued for many years by two domestic insurgencies, one \nmainly Tamil in the North, and the other mainly Sinhalese, in the \nSouth. The result has been the loss of many lives and heavy damage to \nproperty. The government has reiterated its commitment to addressing \ngrievances articulated by these groups through dialog and the process \nof negotiation. Four rounds of unconditional talks with the Tamil Tiger \nseparatists were held following the President's election in November \n1994, and a cease fire was subsequently reached. This however, was \nbreached by the separatists after 3\\1/2\\ months when they resumed their \nterrorist activity.\n  As a result of these terrorist actions at home, Sri Lanka has placed \ncounter terrorism at the forefront of its foreign policy. Sri Lanka was \nthe Vice Chair of the United Nations Ad hoc Committee on Terrorism and \nplayed an important role in the drafting of the Convention for the \nSuppression of Terrorist Bombing, being the first to sign the \nConvention at United Nations Headquarters on January 12, 1998.\n  I am therefore, Mr. President, pleased to introduce this Senate \nResolution. I want to commend the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Mr. Helms and the ranking member, Mr. Biden for their \nsupport.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yea'' on this Senate Resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/03/senate-section/article/S326-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S326-S328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         RONALD REAGAN WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT LEGISLATION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        REID AMENDMENT NO. 1640\n\n  Mr. REID proposed an amendment to the bill (S. 1575) to rename the \nWashington National Airport located in the District of Columbia and \nVirginia as the ``Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport''; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

DEXTER PEACH\n\n Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay homage to one of \nour Nation's most dedicated and loyal public servants, Assistant \nComptroller General of the United States, J. Dexter Peach.\n  On January 2nd of this year, J. Dexter Peach retired following a \ndistinguished 38-year career with the United States General Accounting \nOffice, capped by 15 years as an Assistant Comptroller General.\n  Mr. Peach began his career with the General Accounting Office in \n1960, rising through the evaluator ranks to lead two of its major \ndivisions--Energy and Minerals and the Resources, Community and \nEconomic Development Divisions--serving as Assistant Comptroller \nGeneral for the latter. He is an acknowledged subject matter expert on \na wide variety of national programs and policy issues dealing with \nenergy, environment, natural resources, and economic development \nmatters and has an in-depth understanding of federal legislative and \nregulatory processes. As Assistant Comptroller General for Planning and \nReporting, Dexter Peach had broad responsibility for maintaining the \nOffice's planning system and assuring the overall quality of the \nagency's planning system and assuring the overall quality of the \nagency's products.\n  Mr. President, I had the privilege of working with Dexter Peach in my \ncapacity as both Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Senate \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs. His critical work relating to energy \nissues after the OPEC embargo in 1973, earned him the Comptroller \nGeneral's Award for contributions to energy issues of national \nimportance. He has also received three Federal Senior Executive Service \nRank Awards--a Distinguished Rank and two Meritorious Ranks. The \nAmerican University also distinguished him with their prestigious Roger \nW. Jones Award, bestowed annually to a career federal civil servant for \noutstanding public service.\n  Mr. President, the General Accounting Office was created in 1921 with \nthe mandate to audit, evaluate, or investigate virtually all federal \ngovernment operations--wherever they might take place. In other words, \nthe GAO serves as a ``watchdog'' over the taxpayers' money--guarding \nagainst fraud, abuse, and inefficient allocation of public funds.\n  GAO evaluations under Dexter Peach's guidance and leadership have \nsaved taxpayers billions of dollars. During his career as Assistant \nComptroller General, Congress has implemented numerous recommendations \nresulting from his work--including budget reductions, cost avoidances, \nappropriations deferrals, and revenue enhancements. He has also been \ninstrumental in assisting the Congress by directing reports on the \ncosts of cleaning up nuclear weapons complexes, environmental crises \nsuch as the Exxon/Valdez oil spill, efforts to preserve and protect the \nnation's drinking water, and issues dealing with the deregulation and \nsafety of the airlines industry.\n  In short, Mr. President, Dexter Peach's tenure at GAO has been \ncharacterized by success on every level; throughout his career, he has \nserved as an example of a truly exceptional public servant. I am sure I \nspeak for all of us here in the Senate in giving recognition to a man \nwho has served this Nation with integrity, dedication, honor, and \ndiligence--Assistant Comptroller General J. Dexter Peach.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/03/senate-section/article/S328-3", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S328-S329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DAVE MOORE\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, it is with great sorrow that I rise \ntoday to acknowledge the passing of my former colleague Dave Moore on \nJanuary 28, and with great joy that I recall his memory and the \nhappiness he brought to Minnesota television viewers for over thirty-\nfour years.\n  Dave Moore was hired by WCCO Television in Minneapolis for a series \nof announcing jobs in July of 1950. At the onset of daily newscasts at \nWCCO in 1957, Dave was placed at the helm of the 10 p.m. broadcasts.\n  For the next thirty-four years Dave would become a fixture on \nMinnesota television and a true icon. It is difficult to imagine that \nin July of 1957 the management of WCCO, and quite possibly Dave \nhimself, knew that Dave\n\n[[Page S329]]\n\nwould become such an legend. Scores of Minnesotans would tune into WCCO \nnews each night and hear Dave's friendly voice as he reported the news \nwith his warm, yet serious, demeanor.\n  Trained as an actor at the University of Minnesota, Dave reported the \nnews with the spontaneity, flair, and wit that only an actor could \nprovide. Dave's acting talents made it possible for him to venture \nbeyond his role as an anchorman to his role on ``Bedtime Nooz'' where \neach Saturday night between 1962 and 1971 he would take a satirical \nlook at current events.\n  Dave's broadcasting success was acknowledged by a number of awards \nand honors, including the Mitchell V. Charnley Award in 1983, as well \nas being named Outstanding Broadcast Personality of 1991 by the \nMinnesota Broadcasters Association. In addition, ``The Moore Report,'' \na documentary and public interest program hosted by Dave, won numerous \nawards, including the George Foster Peabody Award for its special \ntitled ``Hollow Victory: Vietnam Under Communism.''\n  As a truly gifted orator, Dave used his talents to serve his \ncommunity by doing volunteer reading for Radio Talking Books for the \nBlind, and making frequent visits to local elementary schools to read \nto the students.\n  A native of Minneapolis, Dave was quite content with establishing his \ncareer in the his hometown, untempted by the possibilities available to \na person of his talents. Dave was the most visible personality on WCCO \nwhen it was at its pinnacle, yet that did not cause him to shy away \nfrom the public. Dave often acted in community plays and could be \nfrequently seen around Minneapolis simply participating in life in the \ncity he loved as just another one of its ordinary citizens.\n  Mr. President, I wish to offer my sincerest condolences to Dave's \nfamily and on behalf of the citizens of Minnesota reassure them that we \nall share in their loss. At the conclusion of his last broadcast on \nDecember 6, 1991, Dave expressed his sentiments by simply stating, \n``There will be no maudlin, tearful farewell, just a simple, but very \nheartfelt thank-you to all of you for your support down through the \nyears. I've been very touched by it.'' Thank you Dave, you touched us \nas well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/03/senate-section/article/S328-4", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n COMMENDING VICKI DONOVAN AS THE 1998 NEW HAMPSHIRE TEACHER OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Vicki Donovan for being named New Hampshire's 1998 Teacher \nof the Year. Vicki is a fourth-grade teacher at Belmont Elementary \nSchool, where she has taught for eleven years. I commend her \noutstanding accomplishment and well-deserved honor.\n  Vicki, who lives in Belmont, will spend the next year representing \nNew Hampshire's teachers at various statewide and regional functions. \nAs New Hampshire's Teacher of the Year, she will be considered for the \nNational Teacher of the Year Award sponsored by the Council of Chief \nState School Officers and Scholastic, Inc. The National Teacher of the \nYear Program is the oldest and most prestigious honors program to focus \npublic attention on excellence in teaching. New Hampshire's \nCommissioner of Education, Elizabeth Twomey, named Vicki the Teacher of \nthe Year.\n  Vicki's accomplishments as a teacher are numerous. She organized \nBelmont Elementary School's yearbook in her first year there, and has \ntaught at several grade levels in the elementary school. She is \ninvolved with the Belmont Elementary School Support Group, B.E.S.T., \nand has served on the town's Civic Profile Committee, Government Study \nGroup, and Youth and Education Committee.\n  In addition to her numerous extracurricular accomplishments, Vicki \nhas excelled in perhaps the most important area: her students. Vicki's \nstudents say their experience with her as their teacher marked their \nbest year in school.\n  New Hampshire has always been fortunate to have many talented \nteachers, but Vicki Donovan is certainly a role model among teachers of \nthe Granite State. As a former teacher myself, I am proud of her \ncommitment to education and congratulate her on this distinguished \nachievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/03/senate-section/article/S329-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN RECOGNITION OF PEGGY POSA\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and pay \ntribute to a remarkable woman from Michigan, Peggy Posa. Peggy is \nretiring after more than ten years of service as Executive Director of \nthe Coalition on Temporary Shelter (COTS).\n  Before Peggy Posa arrived, COTS was considered an important emergency \nshelter for homeless people in Detroit. By providing this service \nalone, COTS was a key part of the network of community organizations \nwhich serve underprivileged residents of Detroit. Under Peggy's \nleadership, however, COTS has grown to be considered one of Michigan's \nmost respected providers of housing and comprehensive services for \nhomeless people. She led COTS through an expansion and renovation of \nthree shelter facilities; the creation of twenty-three units of \npermanent supportive housing for frail, elderly and mentally challenged \nindividuals; the creation of three transitional housing programs; and \nthe development of a variety of support services designed to assist \npeople seeking to regain economic self-sufficiency and decent, \naffordable housing.\n  Peggy Posa is widely admired as an innovative and tireless leader on \nissues related to the problem of homelessness. While she is retiring \nfrom her full time responsibilities, she has said that she will \ncontinue to be involved with COTS on a part time basis. I have no doubt \nthat her colleagues and the people she serves are grateful for her \ncontinued dedication and support.\n  Mr. President, Peggy Posa and COTS can take pride in the fact that \nthey have truly succeeded in helping people to change their lives. I \nhope my colleagues will join me in saluting Peggy's commitment to her \ncommunity and in wishing her well in her retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/03/senate-section/article/S329-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S329-S330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PRESIDENT EDUARD SHEVARDNADZE\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, last Friday, January 23rd, was \nthe birthday of President Eduard Shevardnadze. This is a man whose \nactive and courageous involvement helped bring the cold war to a \npeaceful end and who is now rebuilding Georgia from a ruinous civil \nwar. He has taken a courageous position, even in the face of \nassassination attempts, to bring about and maintain the independence of \nfreedom of his native country, Georgia.\n  Mr. Shevardnadze is working hard to bring about difficult economic \nreform and to build an independent legislative branch. He has \nintroduced some remarkable changes in Georgia: he introduced a new \ncurrency, adopted and implemented a new constitution, removed mafia \nleaders from powerful positions, secured the transportation of Caspian \noil through Georgia and has worked hard at establishing regional \ncooperation with other leaders in the Caucasus and Central Asia. His \ndedication to furthering independence, economic prosperity and harmony \nin the region places him as a historic world figure.

Your initiatives in promoting \n     and advancing the economic and political freedom of your \n     country are well noted by your friends and admirers \n     throughout the world and place you as a historic world \n     figure. Please count me as one of those who acknowledges your \n     great contributions to the creation of a better world.\n       As Georgia continues to develop and improve, let us hope \n     that our nations will share the fruits of our labors through \n     peace and security for all the newly independent states.

Mr. President, today I want to congratulate \nCalifornia State Senator John Burton as he assumes the role of \nPresident Pro Tempore of the California State Senate.\n  When I was first elected to the U.S. Congress in 1983, it was the \nseat of Congressman John Burton in which I served.\n  Then, as now, I never forgot his advice to me: ``Believe in yourself, \nfollow your heart, and don't be afraid.''\n  That advice has never let me down.\n  Senator John Burton is an inspiration to many people. His life and \nsuccess are triumphs of hope and determination.\n  It is a widely known fact that Senator Burton struggled with \naddiction in the past and had to step back from politics for a time to \nreclaim his life.\n  John Burton earned his way back into the political life of California \nmuch in the way that he first entered it--as a champion of people too \noften overlooked or undervalued.\n  John Burton's career is a testament to the virtues of loyalty, \nconsistency, courage and service. For all his work and spirit have \nmeant to those he has touched, it is no wonder his colleagues elected \nhim to lead them in the California Senate.\n  Even though I can't believe I have to call him ``Mr. President,'' as \na United States Senator, I couldn't be more proud!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/03/senate-section/article/S330-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MONTANA TEEN DAY\n\n Mr. BURNS.
