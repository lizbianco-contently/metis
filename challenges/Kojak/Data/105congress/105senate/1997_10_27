Mr. President, I would like to speak about the \nDepartment of Defense's illegal progress payment policy.\n  I have spoken on this policy a number of times since the beginning of \nthe year. Well, I thought we had finally laid the issue to rest. But \nhow wrong I was. On July 22, DOD made a commitment to bring that policy \ninto compliance with the law.\n  The commitment was made by the nominee to be Deputy Secretary of \nDefense, Mr. John Hamre. At the time, he was the department's chief \nfinancial officer or CFO. He is now the Deputy Secretary of Defense.\n  Mr. Hamre made the commitment in front of the leaders of the Armed \nServices Committee: Senator Strom Thurmond, chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee; Senator Carl Levin, ranking minority member of the \ncommittee; and The committee's ranking Republican, my friend from \nVirginia, Senator Warner; and the Senator from Iowa was also present.\n  Mr. Hamre promised to put the new policy into effect on October 1, \n1997. But October 1 has come and gone. As of this moment, the illegal \npolicy is still in operation. For over 6 years now, the inspector \ngeneral; the IG, has been telling DOD to fix the policy. And DOD has \nrepeatedly promised to fix it. Unfortunately, Mr. President, these were \nempty promises. They are broken promises.\n  Mr. President, John Hamre gave me his word he would fix it this time. \nA man's word is like gold. You should be able to take it to the bank. \nHe proposed to bring the policy into compliance with the law. And he \ndid it in front of the leadership of the Armed Services Committee. I \nexpect him to keep his word. And the IG is involved, as well. The IG \nmade a commitment to verify compliance. And DOD is not in compliance. \nThis is a bad situation. The basic agreement is outlined in the IG's \nletter of July 23. I placed a copy of that letter in the Record on July \n24. It can be found on page S8110.\n  The July agreement started to unravel barely 1 month after being put \ntogether. It unraveled because of complaints from industry--mainly a \ngroup called the Council of Defense and Space Industry Associations--\nthat is CODSIA.\n  The group sent a letter to DOD on August 27. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent to have a copy of this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Council of Defense and Space\n\n\n                                        Industry Associations,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 27, 1997.\n     Hon. Alice C. Maroni,\n     Acting Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), Pentagon, \n         Washington, DC.\n\n     Mrs. Eleanor R. Spector,\n     Director of Defense Procurement,\n     Pentagon, Washington, DC.\n\n     Mr. Gary W. Amlin,\n     Acting Director, Defense Finance and Accounting Service, \n         Arlington, VA.\n       Dear Mrs. Maroni, Mrs. Spector, and Mr. Amlin: The \n     undersigned members of the Council of Defense and Space \n     Industry Associations (CODSIA) are very concerned with DoD's \n     decision to implement the requirement to distribute contract \n     financing payments starting October 1, 1997, without allowing \n     final action on DFARS Case 97-D011 and without determining \n     the impact of such a decision on DoD and industry. This \n     change will increase significantly the administrative \n     workload and cost for all parties involved in the payment \n     process.\n       The cost impact of this decision on industry is extremely \n     onerous. It will require major changes to accounting and \n     billing systems and to electronic commerce systems to meet \n     the new requirements. We estimate that the additional \n     staffing and administrative effort necessary to ensure \n     compliance with the required distribution in the billing \n     process will cost the industry about $1.3 billion in FY98.\n       The $1.3 billion estimate does not include (1) the impact \n     on any contracts not paid from DFAS Columbus, (2) actual cost \n     accumulation by ACRN or CLIN/SLIN, (3) any additional \n     subcontractor cost, (4) progress payments on basic ordering \n     agreements, (5) the cost of breaking down contracts below the \n     ACRN level, (6) new billing system audits, and (7) higher \n     prices resulting from delayed payments.\n       The October 1 implementation date does now allow time to \n     comply with the requirements of both the Regulatory \n     Flexibility Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act. The \n     statement in the proposed rule that it pertains primarily to \n     internal Government accounting procedures ignores the impact \n     of the rule on industry. It is our opinion that a regulatory \n     flexibility analysis is required and that industry should \n     have an opportunity to participate in that analysis. As to \n     the paperwork burden, the proposed rule will result in \n     significant new information collection requirements in order \n     for contractors to be paid. The statement that the proposed \n     rule will not impose any information collection requirements \n     that OMB must approve is inaccurate.\n       Industry is not prepared to implement progress payments \n     distributions on October 1, 1997, and we believe that DFAS \n     will have great difficulty in doing so. Therefore, we urge \n     you to delay the implementation to allow time for a thorough \n     analysis of the impact of this decision.\n       Whatever decision is made on implementation, the new \n     requirement should not apply to existing contracts. \n     Furthermore, if this decision is implemented, the progress \n     payment rate should be increased to eighty-five (85) percent \n     to compensate for slower payments.\n       If the implementation date cannot be delayed, we urge the \n     following steps to reduce the administrative cost and \n     disruption of the progress payment process.\n       Do not make progress payment distributions retroactive. The \n     decision to implement progress payment distributions on \n     existing contracts with five or less progress payments as of \n     October 1, 1997, will result in claims for equitable \n     adjustment. This applies to contracts that have been awarded \n     as well as to prospective contracts that are currently in a \n     solicitation or negotiation phase.\n       Require DoD to simplify contracts to one ACRN by not using \n     multiple appropriations per contract and not assigning \n     multiple ACRNs per appropriation. This is the only way DoD \n     can comply with this requirement without creating a \n     significant problem for industry and DFAS.\n       Distribute progress payments by ACRN rather than CLIN/SLIN.\n       Continue the current DFAS procedure of reallocating payment \n     by ACRN when there are not enough funds in an ACRN to make \n     the payment.\n       Take steps as detailed in Enclosure I to reduce \n     administrative effort.\n       Further details of industry's concerns and an analysis of \n     the cost impact are contained in Enclosures I and II to this \n     letter.\n       DFAS has made significant progress in making timely \n     payments on both progress payment and delivery invoices. The \n     implementation of progress payment distributions would be a \n     major setback for DFAS, and a setback for acquisition reform \n     and payment efficiency. We would be pleased to discuss this \n     matter with you. For further information, please contact Dave \n     Koonce of the Lockheed Martin Corporation at (301) 897-6657.\n           Sincerely,\n         Don Fuqua, President, Aerospace Industries Association; \n           Lorraine M. Lavet, Chief Operating Officer, American \n           Electronics Association; Gary D. Engebretson, \n           President, Contract Services Association; Kenneth \n           McLennan, President, Manufacturers Alliance for \n           Productivity and Innovation; Lawrence F. Skibbie, \n           President, American Defense Preparedness Association/\n           National Security Industrial Association; Cynthia L. \n           Brown, President, American Shipbuilding Association; \n           Dan C. Heinemeier, Vice President, Electronic \n           Industries Association; Bert M. Concklin, President, \n           Professional Services Council; Penny L. Eastman, \n           President, Shipbuilders Council of America.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Industry's complaint boils down to one key point: The \nnew policy will cost $1.3 billion in the first year alone. This is \npure, grade A Pentagon baloney. The IG says it is baloney.\n  No one knows what the new policy would cost--if anything.\n  Maybe it would save money.\n  DOD is paying accounting firms like Coopers & Lybrand hundreds of \nmillions of dollars to resolve accounting errors.\n  These accounting errors are caused, in part, by the current policy.\n  If payments were made according to law, all the money paid to Coopers \n& Lybrand could be saved. Surely these saving would offset any new \ncosts. Let's face it, the thought of more cost makes industry lick its \nchops. More cost is not the issue.\n  More money is the issue. What I am talking about here is the flow of \nfunds.\n  The new policy threatens to interrupt the money flow.\n  That is what scares CODSIA.\n  And I am not talking about not paying legitimate bills on time. Under \nlaw, DOD must pay its bills promptly.\n  I am talking only about bills that cannot or should not be paid. I am\n\n[[Page S11217]]\n\ntalking about overobligations and overpayments.\n  DOD cannot write checks and pay bills with no money in the bank.\n  Mr. President, this simple rule applies to most citizens in this \ncountry but not to entrenched bureaucrats in the Pentagon.\n  They can dip into a bottomless well that is the $250 billion defense \nbudget.\n  This bottomless well allows DOD bureaucrats to merge and comingle \nappropriations.\n  They do this to cover shortages--beyond the purview of Congress. Say \na bill is submitted for payment, but the bureaucrats discover that \nthere is insufficient money in the account to pay it.\n  Under the current policy--that is Mr. Hamre's policy--the bureaucrat \nis authorized to arbitrarily and deliberately post it to another \naccount--the wrong account--but one fat with cash.\n  Mr. President, that is illegal. Yet that is exactly what CODSIA is \nasking DOD to keep doing. CODSIA refers to ACRN for accounting \nclassification reference number. ACRN's identify appropriation \naccounts.\n  I quote from CODSIA's letter to DOD:\n\n       Continue the current DFAS [Defense Finance and Accounting \n     Service] procedure of reallocating payment by ACRN when there \n     are not enough funds in an ACRN to make the payment.\n\n  In other words, CODSIA says: Keep charging the wrong account if there \nisn't enough money in the right account.\n  Mr. President, that is a blatant violation of law.\n  When an ACRN contains insufficient funds to pay a bill, the account \nis overdrawn. It is in the red. It is time for heads to roll.\n  That is a violation of the Antideficiency Act--section 1341 of title \n31, and that carries criminal penalties. It's a felony.\n  And when you arbitrarily reach into another account to get the money, \nas CODSIA suggests, you also violate sections 1301 and 1502 of title \n31.\n  These laws are the sacred constitutional cornerstones of Congress' \ncontrol over the purse strings.\n  CODSIA shows no respect for these sacred constitutional principles.\n  At least CODSIA is up-front about what it wants. It wants industry to \nget paid--even if it means breaking the law.\n  There is another problem--overpayments. These are bills that should \nnot be paid.\n  DOD has a nasty habit of overpaying contractors and does it with \ngreat regularity.\n  The bad part about it is DOD doesn't know when it happens. DOD \ndoesn't have the controls in place to detect them.\n  The only way DOD knows about an overpayment is when the contractor \nvoluntarily returns the money.\n  Well, Mr. President, guess what is causing overpayments?\n  Answer: Mr. Hamre's current progress payment policy--the one he \npromised to terminate on October 1.\n  A recent GAO report--No. 97-37, page 12--says this policy is ``the \nmost frequent cause of DOD's overpayments.''\n  The GAO report is entitled ``Fixing DOD's Payment Problem Is \nImperative.''\n  The new policy promised--but not delivered--by Mr. Hamre should put a \nlid on overpayments.\n  Now if overpayments were stopped, who would suffer: CODSIA or the \ntaxpayers?\n  Mr. President, I think CODSIA has plenty of self-serving reasons for \nwanting to keep the current policy.\n  CODSIA lost its credibility when it insisted that DOD break the law \nto keep the money spigot wide open.\n  Mr. Fuqua's letter to Acting Comptroller Alice Maroni was followed by \na similar letter to Mr. Hamre.\n  This one was from the defense heavyweights: Boeing, Hughes, Lockheed \nMartin, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon.\n  The message was the same.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         The Boeing Co., Hughes Aircraft Co., Lockheed Martin \n           Corp., Raytheon Co., Northrop Grumman Corp.,\n                                               September 22, 1997.\n     Hon. John Hamre,\n     Deputy Secretary of Defense,\n     Pentagon, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Dr. Hamre: We are writing to convey our concern \n     regarding the Department's plan to implement new requirements \n     for progress payment distributions effective October 1. We \n     are particularly concerned that there has not been time to \n     ascertain fully the cost of compliance or the impact on \n     timeliness of payments. A quick cost impact estimate \n     conducted by industry indicates a minimum impact for Fiscal \n     Year 1998 of $1.3 billion (see enclosed CODSIA letter dated \n     August 27). These costs, plus those to be incurred by DOD for \n     implementing this requirement, will have to be borne by the \n     U.S. Government.\n       We understand that the DOD Inspector General and the \n     General Accounting Office indicate the need for improvements \n     in the DFAS accounting system. However, until DOD and its \n     contractors can fully assess the cost and related impacts of \n     the policy change made in your two memoranda of July 23, \n     1997, we are not confident that this is the least expensive \n     means of ensuring the improvements. We should also explore \n     legislative action for the Fiscal Year 1999 authorization \n     cycle.\n       In the meantime, we request that you delay the October 1, \n     1997, implementation date for the proposed progress payment \n     distribution policy change and that the change, when it does \n     become effective, be applied only prospectively and not to \n     any existing contracts. We respectfully request the \n     opportunity to meet with you to discuss the grave nature of \n     this issue and obtain your guidance on appropriate actions \n     industry can take to mitigate the associated cost impact and \n     delay.\n       We appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look \n     forward to your response. We remain confident that the \n     taxpayers' interest can be protected in a cost effective \n     manner.\n           Sincerely,\n         Scott E. Carson, Vice President, The Boeing Co.; Marcus \n           C. Bennett, Executive Vice President and Chief \n           Financial Officer, Lockheed Martin Corp.; Peter R. \n           D'Angelo, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial \n           Officer, Raytheon Co.; Charles S. Ream, Vice President \n           and Chief Financial Officer, Hughes Aircraft Co.; \n           Richard B. Waugh, Corporate Vice President and Chief \n           Financial Officer, Northrop Grumman Corp.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. Hamre buckled under all the pressure from industry.\n  He responded with what I fear may be an open ended deferral of the \nnew policy.\n  In doing that, I am afraid he is breaking his word to me and the \nleadership of the Armed Services Committee.\n  At this point, the future of the new policy is very much in doubt.\n  Mr. President, I will have much more to say about this issue in the \nnear future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized to \nspeak for up to 30 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I probably will not use 30 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/27/senate-section/article/S11215-6", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11217-S11218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE SENATE STANDSTILL\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. I come to the floor to express some feeling of sadness, \nsome feeling of impatience, frankly, some feeling of irritation, that \nwe are not doing more than we have been doing.\n  The last 3 weeks we have come in, we have talked about things, we \nhave set them aside, we haven't been able to proceed with the country's \nbusiness. I think that is a shame. We have many things to do. We have \nlots of opportunities to do some things that need to be done, and here \nwe are sort of ground to a stop. We are being held up by people who \ninsist on having it their own way or no way, their own way or the \nhighway. That is not really what we ought to be doing here.\n  We have an opportunity to deal, for instance, with Federal funding \nfor highways, something that ought to be done, an authorization that \nexpired in September, and we need to move forward with it. It has been \npassed by the committee. It is on the floor, but because of objections \nwe are still here and not doing a thing. ISTEA expired in September and \nwe need to be doing it. The stalling, of course, is basically a result \nof campaign finance. We voted several times not to bring McCain-\nFeingold to the floor. That bill did not receive a majority vote.\n  Many in this body, including myself, are favorable to doing something \nin campaign finance, but not McCain-Feingold. That is where we are. We \nare being held up for that, I think for a couple of reasons. One is to \nsort of change the image of the hearings that are taking place, to \nswitch the hearings from the potential of the allegation of breaking \nthe law, to changing\n\n[[Page S11218]]\n\nthe law. Those are two different things. But we ought to be talking \nabout whether or not there was realism to the idea that foreign funds \nwere taken into campaigns. That breaks the law. We ought to be talking \nabout the changing or shifting soft money to hard money. That is \nagainst the law. The allegations of laundering money, that is against \nthe law. That is what we are talking about there. Then we ought to be \ntalking over here about campaign reform, fine. But McCain-Feingold is \nnot one this body is willing to accept.\n  As a result of that, we are not doing anything simply because of \ncomplaints--well, we can't go forward unless I get my way. I think the \nmajority leader has done a great job of trying to negotiate something, \ntrying to put campaign finance on the menu for next March--that is the \nthing to do--and then come up with a bill that has some support, \nbipartisan support, and we can do something. But that is not where we \nare.\n  Think a minute about the agenda that we might be able to pursue, the \nthings that people really want to do. One, of course, is ISTEA, the \nfunding of highways. Now, some say it doesn't matter, there is enough \nmoney, there is enough cash-flow, we don't need to do it until next \nyear. And there is probably cash-flow to finish the contracts there \nnow, to operate, but there is not the kind of money that highway \ndepartments need to plan for next year, to go ahead and let contracts \nand move forward as we should. We ought to be doing that.\n  IRS reform--most people want to do something about the IRS in two \nareas. One, change the way the agency works, and that can be done, to \nmake it more friendly. There are proposals out there that most people \nagree with. The other is to start talking about changing the Tax Code \nwhich underlies the problem, which we need to be doing.\n  What are we doing? We just can't move forward with anything because \nyou are not doing it the way you want to. Come on, that is not why we \nare were sent here.\n  We ought to be doing something to make sure that our balanced budget \nagreement is ready for next year. A balanced budget means more than \nanything else. We need to be doing something, as I mentioned, about the \nTax Code to make it simpler. Most people agree with that. We can do \nsome things, but you can't do them unless you undertake it. You can't \ndo it by just stalling.\n  We need to do something about educational IRA's to give people an \nopportunity to set aside money for education so they can use it not \nonly for higher education but for elementary and secondary. Those \nproposals are out here and are ready to be worked on. Can't do that \nbecause you don't agree to what we want on McCain-Feingold. Give me a \nbreak. We have a lot of things we ought to be doing.\n  We ought to be talking about ways to have smaller Government, ways to \nbring the private sector into contracting those nongovernmental \nactivities in Government that can be done to help small business--the \nmain thing small business has talked about in the White House meetings \nfor the last 3 years. Can't do that, though, because we don't have it \nour way.\n  States rights. We ought to be talking about the proper role of \nGovernment, individual freedom and responsibilities. Those are the \nthings that we are here for.\n  Mr. President, I am disappointed that we aren't able to move forward. \nI am disappointed that we are not able to do some useful things while \nwe are here. That is why we are here, why we were sent here. I have no \nobjection to disagreement. That is part of the system. Certainly not \neverybody is going to agree. In the first place, we have different \nphilosophies. That is kind of why we have two parties; we represent \ndifferent philosophies on things. That is perfectly legitimate. \nWhenever anybody has a bill, there are reasons why others don't agree. \nThat is why we have a system to vote to decide how they will work out. \nThere is no problem with debate, no problem with argument, no problem \nwith disagreement. But we need to move beyond that. We need to move \nbeyond that and do some of the things that we were sent here to do--and \nthere are so many. As people begin to look at next year's election, the \nissues begin to identify themselves, as they should, and we ought to be \ndoing something with them. We ought to be doing something with them.\n  Mr. President, we will have an opportunity, I guess, this afternoon \nto move forward. Perhaps we can move on. At least we have six more \nappropriations bills to pass to keep the Government operating. We have \nhad to extend the time twice because we haven't been able to get to \nthem. It would be interesting at some time to have everybody in this \nbody write down the 10 issues that they think are most important to \nthis country and to set about to do them. Wouldn't that be interesting \nand useful? We can do that.\n  Mr. President, I hope that when we come together this afternoon to \nvote, we will also bring together the Interior appropriations bill and \nmove forward on that. There will be things we don't agree with. I can \ntell you one I don't agree with procedurally. You will find on the \nappropriations bill--it was put on there--a $400 appropriations dealing \nwith endangered species, the jumping mouse. Well, I don't have any \nparticular objections to jumping mice, but I do have an objection to \nsomeone putting it on the appropriations bill when it is in the \nconference committee, has never been talked about in either House, and \nthey put it on there and you don't have any chance to do anything about \nit. That's wrong. It's the wrong procedure. We should not do that. But \nI am not going to try to hold the thing up because of that. It ought to \ngo forward. So should the other things that are before us here in this \nconference.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/27/senate-section/article/S11217-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11218-S11221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEGRADATION OF THE SALTON SEA ECOSYSTEM\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues in the Senate what I believe to be a building environmental \ncrisis in southern California, and that has to do with the Salton Sea. \nLet me begin by telling you what the Salton Sea is. The modern day \nSalton Sea is often referred to as the largest manmade water body in \nCalifornia. It was formed in late 1905 as a result of a break in a \ntemporary levy along the Colorado River. For a period of about 16 \nmonths after the breach, the Colorado River flowed into the below-sea-\nlevel depression then known as the ``Salton sink,'' filling it to a \ndepth of more than 80 feet above its lowest elevation. Since that time, \nthe water level in the sea has been seeking a balance between desert \nforces that extract water as a product of evaporation and the inflows \nof water from surface and subsurface sources. The Salton Sea is about \n350 square miles. It is 35 miles long, it has 115 miles of shoreline, \nand it is 15 miles wide. It is a big body of water. Today, the depth is \nabout 51 feet, and I believe it is about 234 feet below sea level.\n  This lake was originally a freshwater lake. It is now dying because \nof a confluence of events. It is the combination of the rising salinity \nlevels caused by the evaporation I just mentioned--and the body of \nwater is now 25 percent saltier than the ocean--plus major disease \noutbreaks and other up to this point identified as unknown causes that \nscientists believe are linked to millions of gallons of polluted \nagricultural drainage as well as chemical wastes coming out of \nMexicali. Now, these wastes flow from the Alamo and the New Rivers, \nwhich go from Mexico, flow north, and empty into this huge body of \nwater. The body of water is best known as being between Palm Springs \nand the Mexican border. It is near the areas we considered for the \nDesert Protection Act, and originally it was hoped that it would be a \nmajor recreation area. As a matter of fact, it was hoped that about \n$500 million a year in revenues would be produced because of \nrecreational and job opportunities. Instead, it is now just a dreadful \nsituation.\n  The two rivers I just mentioned, the New River and Alamo River, \naccount\n\n[[Page S11219]]\n\nfor about 78 percent of the water replenishment of the Salton Sea. The \nWhitewater River on the northern end also dumps agricultural runoff \ninto the Salton Sea. I first visited the area in 1990 when I was in El \nCentro. I remember going to the banks of the New River and there were \nworkers there, volunteers, picking up rubbish along the riverside. They \nhad on elbow-high gloves. I asked the question, ``Why do you wear these \ngloves?'' They told me that even above the gloves they would get \nblisters when they worked around the area. So in 1990 something was \ngoing on. It has gotten a lot worse since then.\n  In 1996, pathogenic micro-organisms were identified in the sea's \nenvironment, and that includes the New River. Among them were the \norganisms capable of causing polio, typhoid, cholera, and tuberculosis. \nAlso, concerns about public health from disease-causing agents have \nresulted in the issuance of public health advisories warning of the \ndangers of eating fish caught in the sea.\n  Because of its diverse ecosystem, the Salton Sea National Wildlife \nRefuge has been ranked among the top 10 of our Nation's 510 national \nrefuges. It is of critical importance to the western region because of \nits proximity to the Pacific Ocean and Mexico. It is a key component in \nthe Pacific flyway for millions of migratory water birds that rest at \nthat refuge on their annual journeys to and from Canada and South \nAmerica. So birds that touch down there may well also be dying \nelsewhere. However, an increased frequency and severity of massive die-\noffs of thousands of waterfowl and shore birds and millions of fish \nhave been occurring in the Salton Sea in recent years, and it's \nthreatening the existence now of the entire regional ecosystem.\n  The size of the calamity is mind-boggling. The mortality toll \nincludes birds from every one of the species that visit the sea, \nincluding the endangered California brown pelican, with which I happen \nto be particularly enamored.\n  The degradation of the Salton Sea ecosystem is also taking a toll on \nthe economy of the surrounding area, and we have seen economic values \ndrop off precipitously. There are some who believe it is too late to \nsave the Salton Sea because the problems are too complex and too large. \nI don't share that point of view, and I am asking this body's support \nfor increased efforts to address the sea's problems to prevent further \ndegradation of this environmentally rich ecosystem and to preserve it \nfor all time.\n  Let me quickly mention a brief chronology of happenings. In 1992, \nmore than 150,000 waterfowl, known as eared grebes, died from an \nundiagnosed cause. In 1996, a severe botulism outbreak killed more than \n15,000 birds, including more than 1,400 endangered brown pelicans. \nAbout 15 percent of the western race of the North American white \npelican have perished in the last 2 years. That is 15 percent of the \nentire white pelican population of the west coast.\n  Earlier this year, an outbreak of Newcastle disease decimated an \nentire nesting colony of nearly 2,000 double-crested cormorants. The \ndestruction of the cormorant nesting colony on a small island less than \n100 yards long, which had been popular with the birds, shows how \nquickly death comes in this area. One week the island was alive with \nthe sounds and sights of hundreds of nesting waterfowl, of eggs \nhatching and new fledglings checking out their surroundings. The next \nweek they were all dead, every one of them. Today, all that is left are \nthe skeletal remains and the rotting carcasses that dot the island. It \nis a macabre, tragic scene, as I think some of these photos begin to \nshow. This is a bird skeleton in a nest. Right here you can see one of \nthe bird skeletons and a baby carcass in the sand with a nearby pen, \njust to show you the size. There are just a few in this photo, but they \ndot the whole landscape.\n\n  The birds died in their nests or where they collapsed in the sand, \nunable to fly or walk. So the scenes you see are depicted all over the \nisland. Two of my staff members visited the Salton Sea recently--just a \ncouple of weeks ago--and had to carefully pick their steps in order to \navoid stepping on dead birds.\n  Equally tragic is the sight of birds stricken with botulism which \naffects the nervous system. First they lose their ability to fly, and \nthen the ability to stand upright or walk. Lastly, as the deadly \ndisease progresses they become completely paralyzed and can no longer \nraise their heads, and they drown or they die of starvation.\n  So the task of rescuing sick and dying birds and cleaning up the \nendless stream of carcasses is being handled by dedicated men and women \nof the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at the Salton Sea National \nWildlife Refuge in Imperial County. I have the utmost respect for their \nwork.\n  Since last March, they have been bringing in boatloads--often three \ntimes a week--of stricken birds and carcasses of the dead that have \nbeen picked up throughout the sea. The death toll as of October 22 for \nthis year stood at 6,792 birds, including 234 endangered California \nbrown pelicans. The White pelican held by refuge worker, Marcos Orozco, \nrescued a week or so ago, and the other sick birds in the boat may have \na chance to survive. They are the lucky ones who will undergo emergency \ntreatment at the refuge's recently completed hospital in an attempt to \nstabilize them until they can be transferred to a volunteer \norganization's rehab facility in Orange County. If successful there \nthey will be released back to the wild.\n  Let's talk about the brown pelican that you see dead in this \nphotograph. And you see part of the Salton Sea here with this small \nisland and vastness behind it. Last year more than 1,400 of these birds \nperished in the waters and on the mud flats of the sea. For refugee \nworker Orozco, it was the first time in his 26-year career at the \nSalton Sea that he had seen a die-off of brown pelicans. However, the \ndeaths are continuing, and the prospects are not good.\n  ``It is not a pretty sight,'' notes refuge manager Clark Bloom who \nhas observed grown persons breaking down and crying when they witnessed \nthe sick and dying birds.\n  My big concern here is that not enough is being done. And I am almost \nas sure as I am standing here that it is only a question of time before \nsome of these micro-organisms also begin to impact people as well. \nRight now it is birds. But if it were people, I think the shouts would \nbe deafening.\n  And it is hard for me to imagine what 1 million dead fish floating on \nthe surface of this lake must look like. But for Ken Sturm, the \nwildlife biologist at the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge, the \nscene is one he will not forget.\n  He reported that the lifeless mass of Tilapia, a popular sport fish \nwhich he observed at the northern end of the sea, extended more than 3 \nmiles in length. That was on September 8, about 6 weeks ago. But that \nisn't the beginning nor the end. On September 24, another floating mass \nof at least 1,000 dead fish was spotted at the southern end of the \nrefuge.\n  Scenes like this are commonplace along many shoreline areas, and in \nmuch larger numbers, I am sorry to say. A parasite which affects the \ngills of the fish is a prime suspect in some of the fish die-offs, but \nmore scientific research is needed to pinpoint the exact cause.\n  Another suspect which some experts believe could trigger conditions \nleading to the fish kills is a purplish algae like that shown in this \nphoto. It doesn't look like much. But they believe it is a potentially \ndeadly algae. I would hazard a guess that it probably comes from some \nchemical waste.\n\n  There are some bright spots.\n  The first, of course, is the staff of the Salton Sea National \nWildlife Refuge. They have been doing a truly commendable job. However, \nthey need additional resources, including boats and personnel, in order \nto respond adequately.\n  Also, the Pacific wildlife project in Orange County, a volunteer \ngroup, deserves commendation. Ninety percent of the birds that are \nrescued would have perished without their care.\n  Also noteworthy is the fact that private groups, agencies, and \nbusinesses in the area have contributed to date more than $60,000 this \nyear in cash and services to finance construction of a field hospital \nfor sick birds at the Federal refuge. Whether the sick white pelicans \nin the refuge that you see in the photo here make it or not is unknown. \nThey have just been brought in from the sea and given emergency\n\n[[Page S11220]]\n\ntreatment, and we will see if they survive.\n  While these efforts are underway, the Federal Government and others \nare analyzing projects for restoration of the Salton Sea. This is where \nit gets very complicated.\n  The Bureau of Reclamation in September of this year issued its final \ndraft on the Salton Sea which evaluated 54 alternatives to improve the \nphysical, chemical, and biological conditions of the sea. Five of those \nalternatives will be now considered further. The problem is no one \nagrees.\n  The recently enacted 1998 Energy and Water appropriations bill \nincludes $400,000 for the Bureau of Reclamation to continue its \nresearch project.\n  The conference report in the fiscal year 1998 VA-HUD and independent \nagencies appropriations bill includes $6 million in the EPA's budget \nfor continued research on the Salton Sea--now you are beginning to see \nthe number of agencies that are coming into this--including $1 million \nfor the University of Redlands and $5 million for the Salton Sea \nAuthority.\n  I have written letters, which I ask unanimous consent be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 23, 1997.\n     Hon. Franklin Raines,\n     Director, Office of Management and Budget,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Director Raines: As you prepare the Administration's \n     budget for Fiscal Year 1999, I would like to bring to your \n     attention the need to provide $2 million to address the \n     environmental calamity which has struck the Salton Sea \n     ecosystem in Southern California.\n       Disease outbreaks of catastrophic proportions have hit the \n     bird and fish populations at the inland lake which is a major \n     element of the migratory Pacific Flyway where some 49 bird \n     species are found. Unless corrective action is taken, experts \n     predict even more dire consequence which would mean the \n     destruction of the Sea's ecosystem within a decade, or \n     sooner.\n       In order to deal with the immediate crisis and to formulate \n     actions needed to restore the Salton Sea ecosystem, the Fish \n     and Wildlife Service had identified a number of programs, \n     actions and equipment components in need of funding in Fiscal \n     Year 1999. They are summarized as follows:\n       $1 million for operational support at the Salton Sea \n     National Wildlife Refuge to include $119,000 for four full-\n     time equivalent employees (16 persons for a four month \n     period) to pick up dead, sick or dying birds, and for \n     sampling work; $25,000 for equipment and supplies, $88,000 \n     for purchase of more cages, wildlife medical supplies and \n     equipment for a field hospital and rehabilitation center; \n     $40,000 for a new incinerator for disposal of dead wildlife \n     and to meet air quality standards; $125,000 for assignment of \n     a full-time science coordinator and one support person to the \n     Salton Sea to orchestrate the implementation of scientific \n     studies and associate field operations; $350,000 for modular \n     facilities for research and support staff to work on site; \n     $60,000 for purchase of two new air boats for field \n     operations; $40,000 for equipment maintenance that supports \n     operations such as vehicles and boat repairs and minor \n     equipment replacement; $183,000 for a short-term study to \n     provide information on how to understand factor driving the \n     current pelican/fish die-offs and methods for eliminating the \n     kills.\n       $1 million for a Salton Sea Response Plan to included \n     $525,000 for hiring a team leader and assemble a interagency \n     team and to pay for consultant contracts; $115,000 for \n     miscellaneous office equipment rental or purchase; $125,000 \n     for technical assistance contracts, such as a contract with \n     the Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians to identify \n     Native American sites within the study area; $100,000 for \n     rental of temporary work space for team members; $85,000 for \n     conducting public scoping workshops, and $50,000 for printing \n     of a final plan.\n       The catastrophic degradation of the Salton Sea ecosystem \n     has helped to focus national and local attention to the \n     problem, providing considerable momentum among various \n     agencies, interest groups and the public for addressing the \n     problem. The funding needs cited above are critical in \n     getting a start on restoration of the Salton Sea ecosystem \n     and preventing a recurrence of the devastation that has taken \n     such a heavy toll of waterfowl and fish. Therefore, I \n     respectfully request your cooperation in providing the $2 \n     million for the Fish and Wildlife in the Fiscal Year 1999 \n     budget request. Because of initiatives underway to further \n     identify critically needed scientific research associated \n     with restoration of the Salton Sea, additional funding \n     proposals will be brought to your attention as soon as they \n     are identified.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter, and for your \n     commitment to preserving our nation's precious natural \n     resources.\n       With warmest personal regards.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                 Washington, DC, October 20, 1997.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Thank you for your letter regarding \n     the Fish and Wildlife Service's request for funding for the \n     Salton Sea ecosystem restoration. I appreciate your bringing \n     this matter to my attention, since OMB has just begun to \n     review Administration budget proposals for Fiscal Year 1999.\n       In that process we have many important needs to address. \n     The information you provided will be helpful as we undertake \n     our evaluation of the Service's request. The Administration \n     will strive to fund as many important projects as possible \n     within the constraints of the Balanced Budget Agreement.\n       Thank you again for your interest in this matter. If I can \n     provide further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact \n     me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Franklin D. Raines,\n      Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 23, 1997.\n     Hon. Bruce Babbitt,\n     Secretary, Department of the Interior,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: I am writing to ask your assistance \n     regarding the environmental crisis at the Salton Sea in \n     Southern California where the die-off of waterfowl and fish \n     has reached catastrophic proportions.\n       Recent disease outbreaks in birds and fish at the Salton \n     Sea have brought local and national attention to the \n     degradation that is occurring to the ecosystem of this inland \n     lake which is a major stop for migratory water birds along \n     the Pacific Flyway. The scope of the devastation underscores \n     the need for immediate steps to save the Salton Sea and its \n     precious resources. Last year an outbreak of Newcastle \n     disease killed 14,000 birds, and the die-off is continuing \n     unabated. The bird mortality toll through September 15, for \n     example, was 6,293, including 182 endangered California brown \n     pelicans. Also, on September 8, a massive fish kill composed \n     of more than 1 million Tilipia extending over three miles in \n     length was observed by the biologist at the Salton Sea \n     National Wildlife Refuge.\n       Several major engineering projects have been proposed by \n     various interests, including the Salton Sea Authority and \n     Congressional representatives for addressing the \n     deterioration of the inland lake. However, because of the \n     complexity of the problems confronting the Salton Sea, I \n     agree with experts of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and \n     others who stress the need to fully understand the ecosystem \n     and its problems before committing vast amounts of funds to \n     any single restoration project. In this regard, I believe it \n     is imperative that the report to Congress which the Bureau of \n     Reclamation is preparing on its findings and recommendations \n     for solving the Salton Sea's problems be completed as soon as \n     possible. I am hopeful that the bureau's report will contain \n     an action plan, and recommendations for funding of necessary \n     scientific studies associated with any proposed restoration \n     project.\n       In that regard I respectfully ask your assistance in \n     calling on federal agencies with responsibility in the Salton \n     Sea to review and re-prioritize their FY 98 work programs so \n     that research tasks which are deemed most critical for \n     implementation of restoration projects can begin as soon as \n     possible. Also, because the Salton Sea is an environmental \n     and economic resource of regional and national significance, \n     I strongly believe that the federal, state and local \n     governments all must share in the responsibility for saving \n     the Sea and in paying for its restoration.\n       In light of the environmental calamity which grips the \n     Salton Sea, and the need for immediate action to prevent \n     further degradation, I ask that you give your personal \n     attention to these matters. I have been informed that because \n     of limited staff and equipment, personnel to the Salton Sea \n     National Wildlife Refuge are hampered in their ability to \n     handle the rescue of waterfowl and in the cleanup and \n     disposal of dead birds. Therefore, I would appreciate your \n     consideration of what additional resources can be provided \n     for field operations at the Salton Sea to deal with the \n     massive die-off of birds and fish that is occurring there, \n     including reimbursement for the Pacific Wildlife Project for \n     the assistance in rehabilitation diseased birds. I believe it \n     is imperative that the federal agencies be given the \n     resources that they need to do the job and that wherever \n     possible, volunteer groups who have provided invaluable \n     service in rescuing and rehabilitating diseased birds, be \n     compensated for their expenses.\n       Thank you for your cooperation in this matter. I am \n     committed to doing all that I can to ensure that the causes \n     of the environmental degradation of the Salton Sea are \n     identified and eliminated, and pledge to work with you to \n     make it a reality.\n       With warmest personal regards.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Dianne Feinstein,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n[[Page S11221]]\n\n     \n                                                                    ____\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 19, 1997.\n     Hon. John M. Bernal,\n     Commissioner, International Boundary and Water Commission, El \n         Paso, TX.\n       Dear Commissioner Bernal: I am writing to ask your \n     assistance in providing a progress report on the cleanup of \n     the New River pollution and in determining how completion of \n     the improvement project can be expedited.\n       As you know, the cleanup of the New River is a critical \n     factor to the elimination of the environmental degradation of \n     the Salton Sea and the public health threat which the \n     pollution poses for residents of Imperial County and the \n     border region. Disease outbreaks among birds and fish at the \n     Salton Sea have brought local and national attention to the \n     degradation of the inland sea and the region's ecosystem. \n     Moreover, the mortality toll of fish and wildlife continues \n     to rise, and has served to heighten interests in finding \n     solutions that will result in the elimination of the complex \n     problems besetting the Salton Sea.\n       Because of the concerns cited above, I respectfully request \n     your assistance in providing a progress and status report on \n     the short term and long-term New River pollution cleanup \n     measures which the IBWC is overseeing. I have been informed \n     that while much progress has been nade on the package of 11 \n     so-called ``quick fix'' projects, that, because of technical \n     and other reasons, the project has taken longer than expected \n     to complete. I would appreciate information on the expected \n     completion date for all of the improvements. Also of interest \n     is the status of the other major work on upgrading of the \n     Mexicali I wastewater treatment plant and construction of the \n     new Mexicali II treatment plant.\n       Because of the importance of these projects for reducing \n     New River pollution and other serious threats to the \n     environment and public health, I also ask that the IBWC, in \n     conjunction with its Mexico partners, do all that it can to \n     accelerate completion of the improvements and certification \n     by the Border Environment Cooperation Commission.\n       Thank you for your cooperation. I also pledge to assist in \n     any way possible so please do not hesitate to contact me in \n     that regard.\n       With warmest personal regards.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Dianne Feinstein,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The first letter is to Frank Raines of OMB asking that 2 million \nadditional dollars in fiscal year 1999 be included, and giving the \nrationale for those inclusions.\n  I have received a letter dated October 20 indicating--and I thank him \nvery much for that--that OMB is reviewing the request.\n  I also have a letter dated September 23 to Bruce Babbitt of the \nInterior, and to John Bernal of the International Boundary and Water \nCommission. I have received no response to either of these letters.\n  It is my view that the Department of the Interior should take this \noff of the back burner and put it on the front burner. And I would \nrespectfully suggest that they utilize the same club-fed methodology \nthat they have used I think with great success in handling California's \nwater problems. This is where the Secretary of the Interior really \ntakes the responsibility to pull together all of the disparate groups \ninto a kind of working commitment to see that the right thing is done.\n  My concern is that the die-off could continue for years, and the \nchemical and agricultural wastes continue to interface.\n  If you fly above this river you will see where the river leaches out \na crystalline substance into the agricultural heartland of the Imperial \nValley. You will see where it directly abuts green field row crops. \nThis I think is the potential danger in terms of the future for people \nworking in that area, not only for blisters but also for something \npotentially much more serious.\n  So I am hoping that Secretary Babbitt will elevate this into a club-\nfed effort and that we can really get cracking.\n  The House Subcommittee on Water and Power also held an oversight \nhearing in Palm Desert on October 3 of this year, a few weeks ago, \nhelping to focus national and regional attention on the Salton Sea and \nthe need for action. However, as I said, at this time there is no \nagreement on a plan. And the critical research must be done. But what \nis clear to me is that it must be expedited. We now have a die-off that \nhas been going on throughout this decade, and is escalating. We now \nhave identified microorganisms which yield typhoid, cholera, and \ntuberculosis, and other diseases in what is a 350-square-mile body of \nwater which is polluted in a major and very sad way.\n  So the longer a solution is delayed, Mr. President, the worse the \nsituation will become.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/27/senate-section/article/S11218-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the action of my \nState's Governor in proclaiming September 19, 1997, as Wyoming's POW/\nMIA Recognition Day. I believe such a proclamation to be wholly \nappropriate in light of the fact that over 2,000 Americans are still \nmissing in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, and over 8,000 on the Korean \nPeninsula. These men gave their last full measure in causes whose \nworthiness is rendered more secure with every passing year of \nhistorical distance. Though the same can be said of all who sacrificed \nso, we often forget the sacrifice of those who have no headstones to \ncall to us each memorial day. Hence the importance of efforts such as \nGovernor Geringer's, which remind the Nation of our continuing and \nunfulfilled responsibility to account for the remains of these men for \nthe sake of their families and our national conscience. I am reminded \nof something written half a century ago:\n\n       The universe is so vast and so ageless that the life of one \n     man can only be justified by the measure of his sacrifice.\n\n  That passage was in a young Royal Air Force pilot's last letter to \nhis mother before his death during the Battle of Britain. I commend \nGovernor Geringer for his proclamation and I urge the President to \nintensify his efforts at retrieving the remains of America's missing in \naction. In their sacrifice they proved their measure. America owes them \nthis small debt.\n  There being no objection, the proclamation was ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                        Governor's Proclamation\n\n       Two thousand one hundred sixteen Americans are still \n     missing and unaccounted for from the Vietnam War, and their \n     families, friends and fellow veterans still endure \n     uncertainty concerning their fate. Six are listed from \n     Wyoming.\n       U.S. Government intelligence and other evidence confirm \n     that the Government of Vietnam could unilaterally account for \n     hundreds of missing Americans, including many of the 454 \n     still missing in Laos and the 76 still unaccounted for in \n     Cambodia, by locating and returning identifiable remains and \n     providing archival records to answer other discrepancies.\n       The President has normalized relations with Vietnam and \n     believed that such action would generate increased unilateral \n     accounting for Americans still missing from the Vietnam War, \n     and such results have not yet been provided by the Government \n     of Vietnam.\n       Wyoming calls on the President to reinvigorate U.S. efforts \n     to press Vietnam for unilateral actions to locate and return \n     to our nation remains that would account for hundreds of \n     America's POW/MIAs and records to help obtain answers on many \n     more.\n       For these significant reasons, I, Jim Geringer, Governor of \n     the State of Wyoming, do hereby proclaim September 19, 1997, \n     to be ``POW/MIA RECOGNITION DAY'' in Wyoming, and encourage \n     all citizens to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies.\n       In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused \n     the Great Seal of the State of Wyoming to be affixed this \n     22nd day of August, 1997.\n                                                     Jim Geringer,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/27/senate-section/article/S11221-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11222]]\n                     OHIO'S POW/MIA RECOGNITION DAY\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to call my colleagues' \nattention to a resolution introduced by the Governor of Ohio, George \nVoinivich, to commemorate National POW/MIA Day, which took place on \nSeptember 19, 1997. That day last month and more important, the issue \nitself, are of great importance to all Americans, especially to those \nthat served our country in military missions abroad.\n  As of today 2,116 Americans are classified as either prisoners of war \nor missing in action (POW/MIA) from the Vietnam war. Thousands more \nremain missing and unaccounted for from the Korean war and even the \nSecond World War. The families and friends of these soldiers still have \nto endure the awful uncertainty concerning their fate. Every effort \nmust be made to determine the fate of these soldiers. In the case of \nVietnam, I am hopeful that the normalization of diplomatic relations \nwith Vietnam and the reopening of the American Embassy will encourage \nthe government of Vietnam to fully cooperate with American officials in \ntheir search to gain the fullest possible accounting of POW/MIA's. I \nstrongly encourage the President and the Ambassador to Vietnam to give \nthe POW/MIA issue top priority and insist that the Vietnamese \nGovernment disclose all pertinent information on American POW/MIA's.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful that last month's POW/MIA Day, and \nGovernor Voinivich's eloquent resolution will serve to heighten \nAmerican awareness and inform foreign governments of the United States' \nserious commitment to bringing our soldiers home.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the State of Ohio's POW/\nMIA Recognition Day resolution be inserted in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, 2,116 Americans are still missing and unaccounted \n     for from the Vietnam War, including 114 from the State of \n     Ohio; and\n       Whereas, their families, friends and fellow veterans still \n     endure uncertainty concerning their fate; and\n       Whereas, U.S. Government intelligence and other evidence \n     confirms that the Government of Vietnam could unilaterally \n     account for hundreds of missing Americans, including many of \n     the 454 still missing in Laos and the 76 still unaccounted \n     for in Cambodia, by locating and returning identifiable \n     remains and providing archival records to answer other \n     discrepancies; and\n       Whereas, the President has normalized relations with \n     Vietnam believing that such action could generate increased \n     unilateral accounting for Americans still missing from the \n     Vietnam War, and such results have not yet been provided by \n     the Government of Vietnam;\n       Now, therefore, I, George V.

Mr. President, 16 months ago we had a debate on the \nnomination of Alan Greenspan as Chairman of the Federal Reserve System. \nI argued at that time that he was far too concerned about a possible \nincrease in the rate of inflation and had far too little concern about \nthe employment and incomes of working people.\n  At that time, we had a number of Senators who came to the floor and \nsaid, with unemployment at 5.5 percent, a further decline in \nunemployment would likely lead to higher inflation. They seemed to \nbelieve that raising interest rates was the best course of action.\n  In the last year, unemployment has dropped three-tenths of 1 percent. \nBut that represents only a part of the increase in the work force. The \npool of workers that can get jobs not only comes from the 4.9 percent \nwho are unemployed now but also from those who are not considered part \nof the labor force, such as younger retirees, women at home, and people \nwho have been discouraged from looking for work in the past, and, of \ncourse, persons on welfare. Our economy has brought an additional \n400,000 of these persons into the work force over the year beyond those \nconsidered as unemployed.\n  In the past year, the economy has grown at a rate of about 3.3 \npercent, roughly about 1 percent over what the Federal Reserve's target \nwas to be.\n  In terms of economic growth, a little means a lot. A 1 percent higher \nrate of economic growth in an $8 trillion economy means at extra $80 \nbillion a year, year after year. That comes out to be $300 for every \nman, woman, and child in America.\n  Now, unfortunately, the Fed seems intent on restraining the economy \nand keeping from building on its success. Many at the Fed, including \nthe two nominees, Mr. Gramlich and Mr. Ferguson that will soon be \nbefore the Senate, believe in a concept called NAIRU--the non-\naccelerating inflationary rate of unemployment. If it sounds arcane, \nthat is because it is.\n  But it is still important nonetheless. It is important because so \nmany people adhere to it and believe in it. NAIRU basically says, if \nthe unemployment goes below a certain level, inflation will accelerate, \nnot just increase, but will accelerate at such a rate that only \nunnecessarily high interest rates can slow it down.\n  Just 3 years ago, it was widely accepted among the economic elites \nthat the economy would shift toward higher inflation if unemployment \nfell below 6 percent. That was the NAIRU cutoff. But it fell below 6 \npercent, and actually some measures showed inflation dropping after \nunemployment went below that.\n  Then the common wisdom was then if unemployment went below 5.5 \npercent for long, then inflation will accelerate. Greenspan and others \ninsisted on this. Well, it fell below 5.5 percent. Then the magic point \nbecame 5 percent, below which inflation was sure to accelerate at \ndizzying speeds if we went below 5 percent.\n  Unemployment has been under 6 percent for more than 3 years now and \nless than 5 percent since early this year, and no one, including the \nFed Chairman, can point to any signs of accelerating inflation.\n  Unfortunately, economic reality and the new world has yet to \npenetrate the thinking of those at the Fed.\n  I was deeply disappointed with Mr. Greenspan's statement before the \nHouse Budget Committee on October 8 when he said, ``the performance of \nthe labor markets this year suggests that the economy has been on an \nunsustainable track.''\n\n  In other words, a 3.3 percent rate of growth, he says, is \nunsustainable. Let me respectfully disagree.\n  I disagree with the basic premise that Alan Greenspan and the \nnominees before us are promoting. Their focus seems to be on when we \nshould raise interest rates--not ``if'' but ``when.''\n  I believe the debate should be broadened. Let us broaden it to \nconsider lowering interest rates.\n  A number of economic experts believe that unemployment could possibly \ngo as low as 4.5 percent, maybe\n\n[[Page S11223]]\n\neven lower, and economic growth increased beyond current levels without \ntriggering any inflationary threat.\n  Defenders of Fed policy constantly point to the inflation we \nexperienced in the 1970's as the No. 1 reason why it is better to \nsacrifice higher unemployment for lower inflation.\n  Let us take a look at the causes behind the inflation of the 1970's.\n  We had massive Government spending, both on the Vietnam war and the \nwar on poverty; there was a serious energy crisis; and American \ncompanies and their workers were no longer as productive as their \nforeign counterparts.\n  Today, all that has changed. Congress and the President recently \nreached an agreement to balance the Government's budget by 2002. I \nmight also point out that it was the 103d Congress--and I am very proud \nto say I was one of those who helped to cast the deciding vote in the \nSenate on the budget of 1993--that enacted President Clinton's budget \npackage that helped put our Government's finances on the road to \nbalance. However, we heard from the other side of the aisle saying, \n``If this budget passes, disaster is going to happen. We're going to \nhave recessions and people will be out of work.'' And on and on.\n  Well, we passed that budget. What happened? The size of the budget \ndeficit began to shrink dramatically. That, coupled with the Clinton \nadministration's goal of downsizing Government and reorganizing \nGovernment, with the Clinton program of reorganizing welfare and \nrestructuring welfare and making welfare-to-work, with the other \nconstraints put on the Government side of the ledger, that budget, plus \nthat, has led us through about 4 straight years of reducing the deficit \nto the point now where it is at the lowest point, I think, since the \nearly 1970's, in fact, it might even be balanced as early as next year \nrather than the year 2002.\n  So the Government's finances are getting in good order, thanks again \nto that budget we passed in 1993 and further actions taken by the \nClinton administration.\n  Also, oil and gas prices have been stable for quite some time. There \nseems to be no danger of any acceleration there. Our workers now are \nthe most productive in the world. I will have more to say about that. \nIn other words, our economy is much more able to ward off inflation and \ncontrol its harmful effects than it was in the 1970's.\n  Perhaps before I go any further, I want to explain how the Federal \nReserve experts have tremendous influence on the economy. Some people \nsay it is not the Federal Reserve; there are really a lot of other \nthings going on. Simply put, the Fed sets the interest rates charged to \nbanks for the banks' loans. In turn, that rate determines how much the \nbank charges to their consumers for auto loans, credit cards, home \nmortgages, and everything else --business expansion, new plants, and \nnew equipment.\n  By increasing the costs of borrowing money, the Federal Reserve is \nable to limit the number of new loans that are used to expand or start \na business, buy a new car, finance the purchase of a home. If consumers \ncannot afford to purchase these items, demand will decline and the \neconomy will slow down. So the Fed must realize that the gains from \nencouraging economic growth far outweigh the gains from needlessly \nincreasing interest rates in order to fight the ghost of inflation.\n  That is exactly what they are fighting--a ghost. They cannot point to \nany inflation. They cannot point to any accelerating inflation. Again, \nI will have more to say about that.\n  Unnecessarily high interest rates that ensure a stagnant economy or \nan economy that is growing at less than its full capacity virtually \nassures that hard-working Americans will not get ahead. You cannot give \neveryone a pay raise simply by redistributing dollars within a stagnant \neconomy. To increase incomes for everyone, you need a strong, growing \neconomy.\n  Last year, we enacted a very ambitious welfare-to-work program. If \nthat is to succeed, we must have an economy that is creating new jobs \nthat pay real well and provide benefits such as health insurance and \nretirement savings--most important, health insurance.\n  The unemployment rate measures the number of people who are looking \nfor work compared to the number of people who have jobs. That is the \nbasic formula. Many of the persons counted as unemployed are actually \nunderemployed and would jump at the chance for a better paying job. \nAgain, I will later read from many articles around the country where \njob openings have shown up and, even in areas where we have low rates \nof unemployment, hundreds, thousands of people have shown up for these \njobs because they are better paying jobs.\n  Many unemployed are discouraged--the recently retired or those who \nare not now thinking of working but will start to do so should the \nopportunity arise. A growing economy and tight job market are the \nsurest way to bring these people into the work force.\n  We also have a reservoir of women that I will be talking about very \nshortly in terms of their coming into the market and what that might \nmean.\n  In fact, referring to an article that appeared in the September 8 \nissue of Forbes magazine, I thought it was very good. It was written by \nPeter Huber. The title is ``Wage inflation? Where?'' I will read some \nparts of this. I do not know if I need to read the whole thing. I think \nit was very crucial and right on point in terms of what we are talking \nabout here. There are reservoirs and things happening in our economy in \nthe employment and work sector that were not there in the 1970's.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Chair informs the Senator \nthat the time allocated to the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak in morning business for at least another 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the Senator from Iowa is recognized to speak for \nup to 30 minutes in morning business.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. Huber, in his article in Forbes said:\n\n       Here's why stock prices are really supposed to \n     fall. Employment rates rise above some critical flash \n     point. So wages rise sharply. So prices of goods rise--\n     just as rising wages are boosting demand. Inflation soars. \n     So interest rates go up. Stock prices crash.\n       This is a perfectly sound theory, but it requires some \n     facts. Where's the critical flash point? Do the employment \n     statistics mean what they used to mean? Do they mean anything \n     at all?\n       Officially speaking, America hasn't yet discovered \n     microwave ovens or women's lib. Bone-weary though she may be, \n     the stay-at-home mother doesn't labor at all in the eyes of \n     employment statisticians. But she could, easily enough.

Where? (Labor Statistics Lose Predictive Value)\n\n                            (By Peter Huber)\n\n       Here's why stock prices are really supposed to fall. \n     Employment rates rise above some critical flash point. So \n     wages rise sharply. So prices of goods rise--just as rising \n     wages are boosting demand. Inflation soars. So interest rates \n     go up. Stock prices crash.\n       This is a perfectly sound theory, but it requires some \n     facts. Where's the critical flash point? Do the employment \n     statistics mean what they used to mean? Do they mean anything \n     at all?\n       Officially speaking, America hasn't yet discovered \n     microwave ovens or women's lib. Bone-weary though she may be, \n     the stay-at-home mother doesn't labor at all in the eyes of \n     employment statisticians. But she could, easily enough. With \n     one new mom working at a day care center, three other moms \n     can enter the official work force when they choose. So long \n     as many women remain ambivalent about where to work, in the \n     home or out, the supply of labor will remain far more elastic \n     then the statistics suggest. Memo to Alan Greenspan: Wire \n     roses to Gloria Steinem.\n       Labor markets have stretched into the home; they have also \n     spilled out of the country. A U.S. multinational doesn't \n     raise wages in Maine if it can shift production to a more \n     elastic labor market in Mexico. Even the all-American \n     producer in Kansas can't raise wages or prices much if it \n     competes against imports from a wage-stable Korea. Labor \n     statistics, in short, don't mean much unless they track where \n     goods are produced and consumed. The more transnational \n     economies become, the worse the tracking gets.\n       Then there's silicon. It takes a mix of capital and labor \n     to manufacture a mousetrap, and economists have always \n     allowed that the mix can change.

Three new working \n     moms with computers produce as much as four old working dads \n     without. Add newly minted Pentiums to the ranks of those in \n     search of useful work, and unemployment statistics look very \n     different.\n       None of this will tell you whether to go long or short on \n     General Motors next week. It's just that the next release of \n     official labor statistics probably won't, either. Like a \n     drunk searching for his keys under the lamppost rather than \n     in the shadows where he lost them, the government \n     statistician counts where the counting is easy. But the three \n     great economic stories of our times--women in the work force, \n     global trade and information technology--offer no easy \n     counting at all. The counters are good with things that sit \n     still. Women, foreigners and chips keep moving.\n       This much we do know for sure. If the officially audited \n     supply of labor keeps falling and the price doesn't rise, \n     then we must either give up on economics completely or \n     conclude that there's more to the supply side of labor \n     markets than meets the official eye. Perhaps it's simply that \n     American women, Mexican men and Intel's progeny have all \n     become good substitutes for what the official statisticians \n     call U.S. labor. Maybe welfare reform is effectively \n     expanding labor pools, too. In any event, running out of old \n     bread creates neither famine nor inflation when there's a \n     glut of new cake.\n       According to official statistics and economic models, a \n     supply-side crisis in labor markets should have reignited \n     inflation some time ago. Investors may indeed be crazy to \n     ignore this indubitable, though theoretical, truth. But if \n     so, wage earners are crazier still--so crazy they don't raise \n     the price of their labor when they can. Then again, maybe \n     they can't.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, Mr. President, because of the new labor pool that \nis there and because of the international marketplace, because of \nincreasing technology and productivity, I believe the economy can \ncontinue to expand for some period of time, at least at its current \npace, without causing a significant rise in inflation.\n  Second, we need to do more to increase the wages and incomes of \naverage Americans. This should be one of our Nation's very top \npriorities. So we have an economy growing 3.3 percent. That is good, \nbut who is taking part in it?\n  The Federal Government should complete a very good year from a \nbudgetary perspective, as I said. In February, the White House said \nthere would be a $125 billion deficit. CBO, our budget estimator for \nCongress, said it would be $115 billion in March of this year. In fact, \nit looks like it will only be a $23 billion deficit this year.\n  So why do we have the good news? Because the economy grew faster than \nthe traditional economists perceived likely. I am pleased with the \ngrowth. I am pleased with that growth and the lower deficit level and \nthe fact that prices are not rising. But I am disappointed that a \nfairly small share of the gain went to average Americans.\n  Look at this chart which says it all. Look what has been happening in \nthe last several years in the recent economic boom in this country. If \nyou look at the corporate profit rates, they are really going up. \nEspecially since 1992 and 1993 they have gone up tremendously. Look at \nthe median weekly earnings during the same period of time. They keep \ngoing down. Corporate profits are going up and median weekly earnings \nare going down.\n  The reality is that the incomes of average Americans are not rising \nvery much. Median household income remains lower than in 1989, before \nthe last recession. The poverty rate is still higher than in 1989, and \nthe number of persons considered very poor, earning less than half the \npoverty threshold, actually increased. The poverty rate is still higher \nthan in 1989, and the number of persons considered very poor--that is, \nearning less than half of the threshold poverty rate, actually \nincreased. At the same time, corporate profits are soaring.\n  If the Fed clamps down and the economy ceases to grow at a reasonable \nrate, there will be no real chance that wages will grow at anything \nmore than a minimal rate. This line will continue to go down even more. \nIf we allow the economy to move forward, then, workers may achieve some \nreal income growth. That means a higher standard of living for all \nAmericans. That really should be our bottom economic line, a higher \nstandard of living for all Americans, including those at the bottom who \nare falling further and further behind.\n  If someone asked me what I would want, I would say I just want \naverage Americans to be able to buy a home with decent mortgage rates, \nlow monthly payments, to go on a nice vacation every year with the \nfamily, treat their kids to a ball game, go out and have a nice dinner \nat a restaurant with their spouse on their anniversaries or birthdays, \nbe able to save some money for a rainy day or for their kids' \neducation. In other words, to improve their quality of life. This \nshould be our fundamental goal.\n  To not allow a chance of an improved standard of living because of an \ninnate fear of a possible rising inflation is not only unfair to \nAmericans, it flies in the face of economic reality and it fails to \nrecognize basic changes that have taken place in the global economy.\n  A little history. Back in 1933 the Congress set the Federal Reserve \npolicy goals as ``the maintenance of sound credit conditions, and \naccommodation of commerce, industry and agriculture.'' In 1946, the \nCongress passed the Employment Act of 1946 which set out a shared \nFederal Reserve responsibility, the goal being ``responsibility of the \nFederal Government to use all practical means * * * to promote maximum \nemployment, production and purchasing power.'' It was only in 1978\n\n[[Page S11225]]\n\nthat the law was modified to add the goal of containing inflation, \ninterestingly. Not until 1978--we had some pretty good years before \n1978, but it was in 1978 that the law was modified to add the goal to \nthe Federal Reserve's policy of containing inflation. That goal did not \nreplace maximizing employment and production. It didn't say in lieu of \nmaximizing employment and production, but in addition to maximizing \nemployment and production.\n\n  In the last Congress, Senator Mack, my good friend from Florida, \nintroduced a bill to make fighting inflation the sole principal goal of \nFederal Reserve policy, to undo everything it has been doing since \n1933, to take what was done and added in 1978 as another goal, and make \nthat the only goal of Fed policy.\n  Alan Greenspan supports this proposal and said in open testimony that \nhe supported taking out of the Federal Reserve's consideration \n``promoting maximum employment, production and purchasing power, the \nmaintenance of sound credit conditions to accommodate commerce, \nindustrial and agriculture,'' all of which has been in there at least \nsince 1933 and 1946--do away with all that and have only one goal for \nthe Federal Reserve--to fight inflation. Mr. Greenspan supports \nformally shifting the focus of the Fed to controlling inflation and \nachieving price stability.\n  Well, I do not think this policy is a wise course of action. Alan \nGreenspan may want to change the Fed's mandate, but that does not \nrelieve the Federal Reserve of its responsibility to carry out the law \nand its mandate which is not just inflation but ``to promote maximum \nemployment, production and purchasing power.''\n  Unfortunately, under the leadership of Mr. Greenspan, the focus has \nbecome only oriented toward a fear of fighting the ghost of inflation. \nI say ``a fear of fighting the ghost of inflation'' because there is no \ninflation. But out there sometime around Halloween the ghost of \ninflation that might actually appear, and we need to be worried about \nthat, according to Mr. Greenspan.\n  I recently met with the two nominees for the Federal Reserve board \nthat will shortly be before the Senate, Mr. Gramlich and Mr. Ferguson. \nWe had two very productive and informative meetings. I found them both \nvery learned individuals and fine individuals. They also have good \ncareer backgrounds. But what American families need at the Federal \nReserve are Board members who will not simply follow the prevailing \nwind at the Fed but follow what is set out in law, and that is \nbalancing the goals of sustaining rates of growth from employment, \nproduction and purchasing power as well as minimizing inflation.\n  Unfortunately, our two nominees before us still adhere to that \noutdated consent of NAIRU, nonaccelerating rate of unemployment, and I \nam afraid that they will fail to aggressively challenge many of the \ncurrent assumptions at the Fed.\n  We need a good healthy debate at the Fed and we need a good healthy \ndebate outside of the Fed about economic policies. I also believe that \nthe nominees are just not likely to push for this kind of debate prior \nto risking the upward movement of the economy with an interest rate \nincrease. That, in my view, is unfortunate.\n  The Federal Reserve seems to look at the economy solely through the \neyes of lenders. They need to look at the needs of manufacturers and \nbuilders, entrepreneurs and hard-working families, as the law requires. \nThese are the people that move the economy, the people that make \nthings, that take the risks, that sell things for whom the Federal \nReserve policy should aim to benefit. The nominees before us, \nunfortunately, I believe share that view of just simply looking at the \neconomy through the eyes of the lenders and the bankers.\n  Lastly, and while this is not being talked about very much, I believe \nwe are facing an increasing risk of deflation--deflation. While the Fed \nfocuses on getting inflation down to zero, I think and fear they may \novershoot it and send the economy into a deflationary spiral.\n  Inflation as measured by the CPI for the past year has been 2.2 \npercent. Unemployment is below 5 percent, and the economy is moving at \na GDP rate of around 3.3 percent. Most of the members of the Federal \nReserve seem to feel the CPI overestimates inflation by a percentage \npoint or more. If that is the case, then inflation is somewhere down \naround 1 percent, maybe less. Maybe inflation is really somewhere \nbetween zero and 1 percent.\n\n  These people at the Fed fear inflation might rise because the \nunemployment rate is so low, 4.9 percent. If it does, we can react, but \nthere is nothing in our history that points to our inability to slow \ndown and reverse inflation due to an overheated economy. But the \npreemptive strikes launched by the Fed do not restrain inflation. \nInstead, this reaction to the remote possibility of accelerating \ninflation has tremendous costs to our nation.\n  A preemptive strike blocks the chance of people to be more employed; \nit blocks the chance of people, on average, to see their incomes truly \nrise; and it increases the risk of recession. A recession in the \ncurrent economic environment creates a real possibility of deflation. I \nbelieve that right now we are very close to zero inflation, but if we \ngo into recession, that could slip down below zero, and indeed we would \nhave inflation. That would deepen the recession and make it even harder \nto come out.\n  Because of this excessive fear of inflation at the Fed, we now live \nin a world where good economic news for working families is bad news on \nWall Street and at the Fed. I don't know how many times I have seen \nthat if there is some good news out there for working families, they \nsay stocks will fall, the Fed is going to have to raise interest rates.\n  I will read from an article written by Mr. Robert Reno earlier this \nyear, entitled ``Economic Prosperity Not Fully Shared,'' to underscore \nthis point. Mr. Reno said in his article of March 14, 1997, talking \nabout the unemployment rate falling to 5.3 percent and below.\n\n       Wall Street held its breath recently, fearful that one of \n     the greatest bull markets in history was about to be handed \n     the excuse it was looking for to crash.\n\n  He said that was because early in March the U.S. Bureau of Labor \nStatistics was ready to release the report on unemployment.\n\n       It could have been another Black Friday. But closer \n     inspection of the employment report showed things weren't all \n     that dreadful. Average earnings rose just 3 cents an hour.\n       No sign there that wage inflation was any threat except in \n     the minds of those who use a Hubble telescope to see \n     inflationary signs invisible to everyone else. Moreover, \n     there were ``healthy'' signs that American workers are still \n     scared witless.\n       The percentage of workers holding down two jobs, seen as a \n     barometer of job insecurity, was 6.2 percent, about the same \n     as it was a year ago. And the percentage of job quitters--\n     those who felt confident enough to strike out in search of \n     new employment--fell significantly. . . .\n       It says something weird about the economic culture of the \n     1990s that the docility of the American labor force has come \n     to be regarded as the chief barometer of the Nation's \n     economic health, the indicator that causes the largest \n     holders of wealth to prosper even as wage-earner incomes \n     stagnate.\n\n  Again we see it here, wage earners going down, corporate profits \ngoing up.\n\n       Still, the alarmists continue to talk about a ``tight'' \n     labor market. This is not the same labor market viewed by \n     most American wage earners.\n       They see an economic landscape littered with the victims of \n     downsizing, a corporate strategy that has institutionalized \n     the process of maximizing short-term share values by \n     minimizing worker security. They also see a system in which \n     health-care coverage, especially the fear of losing it, is \n     increasingly a factor in workers' decisions to change jobs or \n     to hang on for dear life to the one that they have.\n       These and other factors, including the weakening of the \n     labor movement, combine to make workers less likely to demand \n     higher wages even as they see their CEO's taking home grossly \n     swollen compensation packages that are an embarrassment to \n     capitalism.\n\n  I think that paragraph needs repeating.\n\n       These and other factors, including the weakening of the \n     labor movement, combine to make workers less likely to demand \n     higher wages, even as they see their CEO's taking home \n     grossly swollen compensation packages that are an \n     embarrassment to capitalism.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of Mr. Reno's article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S11226]]\n\n              [From the Salt Lake Tribune, Mar. 14, 1997]\n\n                  Economic Prosperity Not Fully Shared\n\n                            (By Robert Reno)\n\n       New York.--Wall Street held its breath recently, fearful \n     that one of the greatest bull markets in history was about to \n     be handed the excuse it was looking for to crash.\n       This was because early March 7, the U.S. Bureau of Labor \n     Statistics was scheduled to release its monthly report on \n     employment, an event that could provide the Federal Reserve \n     with a reason to raise interest rates, to punish the economy \n     for growing too fast and the stock market for its \n     ``irrational exuberance.''\n       At first, the news looked terrible. Not only did the \n     unemployment rate fall during February to 5.3 percent, we \n     below the 6 percent level that some inflation hawks view as \n     dangerously inflationary, but non-farm payrolls expanded by a \n     brisk 339,000 jobs, a much higher figure than most economists \n     had expected. Yes, things looked bleak.\n       It could have been another Black Friday. But closer \n     inspection of the employment report showed things weren't all \n     that dreadful. Average earnings rose just 3 cents an hour.\n       No sign there that wage inflation was any threat except in \n     the minds of those who use a Hubble telescope to see \n     inflationary signs invisible to everybody else.

And the percentage of job quitters--\n     those who felt confident enough to strike out in search of \n     new employment--fell significantly.\n       So the market heaved with relief, shook itself, and the Dow \n     Jones industrial average proceeded to rise 50.19 points. \n     Monday, it hit a new all-time high in a day of exuberant \n     trading, then peaked again Tuesday.\n       It says something weird about the economic culture of the \n     1990's that the docility of the American labor force has come \n     to be regarded as the chief barometer of the nation's \n     economic health, the indicator that causes the largest \n     holders of wealth to prosper even as wage-earner income \n     stagnates.\n       Still, the alarmists continue to talk about a ``tight'' \n     labor market.

February's figures are further evidence that it \n     will continue. But until the policy-makers and the economists \n     discover a way to more fairly distribute its good fortune, it \n     is an unfinished job.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to point out that just 2 weeks \nafter this article appeared, the Fed launched one of its preemptive \nstrikes, despite admitting the fact that there was no accelerated \ninflation, and raised interest rates again.\n  The issues that are before us are much more important than just two \nnominees to the Federal Reserve system. It is about strengthening our \nNation's economy and ensuring that all Americans have a better standard \nof living than their parents and their grandparents. It is about \neveryday Americans making everyday decisions, families trying to make a \npayment on their House, pay for their kids' college education, Main \nStreet merchants paying for a loan for inventory to run their small \nbusiness, and farmers making decisions on borrowing to put in next \nyear's crop.\n  The Federal Reserve policies affect families budgets and national \nbudgets. The Federal Reserve policies shape the course of America's \nfuture. If we hope to reach and maintain a balanced budget and move \npeople from welfare to work and ensure the solvency of Medicare and \nSocial Security, we must have a vigorous, growing economy.\n  Unfortunately, the Federal Reserve is standing in the way. As I have \nsaid many times, the Fed has kept its key interest rates, such as the \nFederal Funds rate, unnecessarily high and, as a result, sacrificed job \ngrowth and the living standard of hard-working Americans in the blind \npursuit of fighting the ghost of inflation.\n  The reason the Fed is willing to pay any price and bear any burden to \nfight the ghost of inflation is that the Fed's prime constituency is \nthe Nation's largest banks. Bill Wolman, an economist for Business Week \nmagazine and CNBC News, wrote in the Judas Economy:\n\n       The Federal Reserve's anti-inflation hysteria is, pure and \n     simple, special interest politics, practiced by an \n     institution almost totally free of effective oversight.\n\n  I will continue the quote by Mr. Wolman:\n\n       As a class, Bankers are creditors who have a strong \n     interest in making sure that the money they lend out--ranging \n     from revolving credit, such as Visa or MasterCard, to thirty-\n     year mortgages--is paid back in money that does not lose \n     value through time. The central bank is most concerned to \n     limit inflation because inflation depreciates the value of \n     the assets held by commercial banks. When prices are rising \n     (inflation), debtors can repay their loans to creditors in \n     cheaper currency; for this reason creditors hate inflation. \n     But when prices are falling, debtors are forced to repay \n     their debts with expensive (harder to earn) currency. Thus, \n     creditors benefit at the expense of workers. . . .\n\n  As I previously noted, this mindset that we are confronting is \nlargely based on this outdated and faulty concept called NAIRU, the \nNonaccelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment.\n  As Robert Eisner wrote in his book, ``The Misunderstood Economy,'' \nwhich I recommend to all, the NAIRU concept is the purest example of \nthe old saying, ``Statistics are the straightest line from an \nunreasonable assumption to a foregone conclusion.''\n  Again, NAIRU basically says that if unemployment goes below a certain \nlevel--once and for many years thought to be 6 percent--inflation will \naccelerate at such a pace that it will take excessively high interest \nrates and subsequent levels of unemployment in order to bring inflation \nunder control. Describing NAIRU, Robert Eisner wrote:\n\n       It tells us that if we persist in trying to get and keep \n     unemployment (below its natural level) [whatever that is], we \n     will have, not merely inflation, but accelerating inflation. \n     Literally that might mean a very slowly accelerating \n     inflation like one-tenth of one percent per year. But somehow \n     the term is used to imply that inflation will accelerate \n     rapidly, conjuring up visions of the Germans in the 1920's \n     carrying marks in wheelbarrows and using money as wallpaper.\n  The strongest and most unabashed supporter of NAIRU at the Federal \nReserve is Fed Governor Meyer, an appointee of the Clinton \nadministration. He said:\n\n       I am a strong and unapologetic proponent of the Phillips \n     Curve and the NAIRU concept. Fundamentally, the NAIRU \n     framework involves two principles. First, the proximate \n     source of an increase in inflation is excess demand in labor \n     and/or product markets. In the labor market, this excess \n     demand gap is often expressed in this model as the difference \n     between the prevailing unemployment rate and NAIRU, the \n     nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment.\n\n  Mr. Mire goes on to say:\n\n       Second, once excess demand gap opens up, inflation \n     increases indefinitely and progressively until the excess \n     demand gap is closed, and then stabilizes at the higher level \n     until cumulative excess supply gaps reverse the process.\n\n  Visions of Germany in the 1920's. Why, my goodness, if the \nunemployment rate goes a little lower, you will be taking your dollars \nto the banks in wheelbarrows. They will be worthless. We will have this \nhuge inflation. That is the kind of fear-mongering done by those who \nadhere to this concept of NAIRU.\n  Now, Mr. Greenspan has recently made some public statements kind of \ndistancing the Fed from NAIRU. I guess, after 3 years, it has finally \nkind of come home to him that maybe a 5-percent rate of unemployment is \nnot going to accelerate unemployment, maybe not 4.9 percent, and maybe \nnot even 4.5 percent. In his July 22 Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, Mr. \nGreenspan said:\n\n       The rise in the average workweek since early 1996 suggests \n     employers are having a greater difficulty fitting the \n     millions who want a job into available job slots. If the pace \n     of job creation continues, the pressures on wages and other \n     costs of hiring increasing numbers of such individuals could \n     escalate more rapidly.\n\n  Furthermore, the prospect of adding more employees to the workforce \nis equally unappealing to Mr. Greenspan who believes this will ignite \ninflation. He said this in July:\n\n       Presumably, some of these early retiree, students, or \n     homemakers might be attracted to the job market if it became \n     sufficiently rewarding. However, making it attractive enough \n     could also involve upward pressures in real wages that would \n     trigger renewed price pressures, undermining expansion.\n\n\n[[Page S11227]]\n\n\n  To that, I say: Not true. Turn again to this chart. Median weekly \nearnings are going down and corporate profits are going up. All I am \nsaying, and others are saying, is that more of the growth in our \neconomy needs to go to those who are working and making weekly wages. \nMore should be going to the bottom part of our economy who are falling \nfurther and further behind and who rely more than anyone else on \ninterest rates.\n  Well, again, Mr. Greenspan linked wage pressures, no matter how \nlittle to the specter of accelerating inflation in his October 8 \ntestimony earlier this month before the House Budget Committee. He \nadmitted, ``There is still little evidence of wage acceleration.'' But \nhe said, ``If labor demand continues to outpace sustainable increases \nin supply, the question is surely when, not whether, labor costs will \nescalate more rapidly.''\n  I know Mr. Greenspan is a skilled economist, but I would like to \npoint out a few things to him. First, you have increasing technology \nwith the silicon chip; second, you have a lot of women who are in the \npool that can come into the work force because they are homemakers, and \nas we develop more and more safe, affordable daycare in America, more \nof those women can come into the work force. Third, we have a global \neconomy, Mr. Greenspan.\n  Now, some may say it's odd for me, for this Senator, to be talking \nabout this global economy as part of an element that contributes to \neconomic growth in our country and the keeping down of wage demands. \nBut it is true and it's a fact. All I am saying is that as long as it \nis a fact, then don't further penalize the workers in our economy by \nkeeping unnecessarily high interest rates, which penalizes them in \nbuying a home, or buying a car, or taking a vacation, or saving some \nmoney for a rainy day, or for their kids' college education. We can use \nthe global economy as it is with increasing technology, with a vast \npool of women, early retirees, and the underemployed, to move into that \nwork pool and hope at least to get some increase in the wages of those \nthat are on the bottom, and at least give them a better ability to be \nable to increase their standard of living by not paying so much in \ninterest rates.\n\n  Mr. Greenspan, as recently as October 8, is warning us that if the \nlabor demand--once again, that old NAIRU concept--out there continues a \nlittle bit further, then inflation is going to accelerate and take off.\n  Another simple component of the NAIRU concept is, of course, the \npreemptive strike. It's when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates \nto fight inflation, despite seeing no signs of accelerating inflation. \nThe justification behind a preemptive strike is the possibility of \ninflation increasing at some point in the future. Again, Mr. Greenspan \nsaid, in his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony this year:\n\n       Given the lags in which monetary policy affects the \n     economy, however, we cannot rule out a situation in which a \n     preemptive policy tightening may become appropriate before \n     any sign of actual inflation becomes evidence.\n\n  That leads me to another change in Fed policy that I think we ought \nto enact and enact rapidly.\n  There is no reason why the minutes of the Federal Reserve Board \nmeetings need to be kept secret for 5 years. That's right. When the \nFederal Reserve meets and sets their policy, it's sealed for 5 years. \nWe don't do that in Congress. We don't do that in the Supreme Court. \nThere is no reason why the Fed has to have that capability to withhold \nimportant information. I grant that there may be some economic \nreasons--in terms of market stability--why their minutes may be kept \nsealed for a short period of time, but certainly no longer than a year.\n  We ought to know from year to year why the Fed is making the \ndecisions it is making. People ought to go back and read the minutes of \nthe Fed meetings back in 1990 and 1991 when it was making some of its \ndecisions. Then you will begin to see that their crystal ball is pretty \ncloudy indeed.\n  Mr. Greenspan, as I have pointed out on many occasions, raised \ninterest rates seven consecutive times in 1994 and 1995. Think about \nthat--seven consecutive times. I say he doubled interest rates. The Fed \nfund rates went from 3 percent to 6 percent in less than 2 years--about \n18 months. He did this despite seeing no signs of accelerating \ninflation. There never were any signs of accelerating inflation.\n  For example, in his February 22, 1994, testimony given shortly after \nthe first of the rate hikes, Mr. Greenspan said the current economic \nstatistics ``do not suggest that the financial tender needed to support \nthe ongoing inflation process is in place.''\n  Yet, they kept raising interest rates. So during a period of time \nwhen we had great economic growth in this country, the raising of those \ninterest rates pushed a lot of our people on the bottom further down on \nthe bottom and let the people at the top get more of the growth that we \nhave had.\n  Since the last of the seven rate hikes, Mr. Greenspan lowered the \nrate slightly and then put them back up again a quarter of a point--at \nabout 5.5 percent right now.\n  In July, Business Week published a cover story entitled ``Alan \nGreenspan's Brave New World.'' He said Greenspan has moved the Fed into \n``uncharted territory * * * by allowing faster growth and lower \nunemployment than the Fed would have permitted in the past.''\n  I think we should continue on that track. But I am concerned about \nthe recent testimony given by Mr. Greenspan just earlier this month. \nThe pervasive fear of inflation still holds true to that. This is best \nshown as the preemptive strike launched by the Fed in March of this \nyear, despite minimal signs of inflation and Greenspan's February \nHumphrey-Hawkins testimony, in which he said, ``This year overall \ninflation is anticipated to stay restrained.'' Mind you, in February, \nMr. Greenspan said: ``This year overall inflation is anticipated to \nstay restrained.'' One month later the Fed increased its Fed funds \nrates by a quarter of a point. On April 24, Governor Meyer--again, the \nbiggest proponent of NAIRU--gave a speech in which he said, ``The \nrecent Federal Reserve policy action was clearly a preemptive one. This \nmeans that it was undertaken not in response to where the economy and \ninflation were at the time of the policy change, but in response to \nwhere the economy and inflation were projected to be in the future \nabsent a policy change.''\n  Again, I would like to know exactly what the Fed is looking at when \nit makes these decisions. What is that future? What is the long run? \nOne economist once said, ``In the long run we are all dead.'' What are \nwe talking about in the future? One month the head of the Fed says \ninflation is going to stay restrained, and the next month they raise \nthe Federal funds rate. The next month Mr. Meyer says it was preemptive \nbecause we projected that in the future sometime we would have \ninflation. Obviously, not this year, because just a month before, they \nsaid it was going to be restrained. And, yet, over the last several \nmonths, our consumers, our small businesses, our farmers, our \nhomeowners, our manufacturers have had to pay a quarter point more \ninterest rate. That hits everyone. It is just like a hidden tax; just \nlike a nice little hidden tax on everyone.\n  A lot of people believe that preemptive rate hike in March was \ntotally unnecessary. In the April 14, 1997, edition of Barron's, David \nRanson wrote an article entitled ``The Federal Reserve's Pointless \nQuarter Point: A Preemptive Strike Against a Non-Threat.''\n  Mr. Ranson said first:\n\n       There isn't any inflation around to curb. Everyone, \n     including Alan Greenspan, concedes that inflation is absent. \n     Thus, the traditional pretext for Fed action is nowhere to be \n     found. I am reminded of the two buzzards sitting on a tree \n     limb. One turns to the other and announces: ``Patience, my \n     foot. I'm going to kill someone.''\n\n  We have all seen that cartoon before. So it is like the old Fed \nsitting there. ``Well, patience my foot. We are going to raise interest \nrates. Inflation isn't there. By gosh, we are going to raise it \nanyway.''\n  According to the official story by Mr. Ranson, the Fed's action was a \nnecessary preemptive strike against inflation before it becomes \nevident.\n  If it is not evident, how do they know it? If it is not evident to a \nlot of preeminent economists in this country, how is it evident to the \nFed? What is their basis for it? Again, we will not know for 5 years. \nWe ought to know a lot sooner than that.\n\n[[Page S11228]]\n\n  Mr. Ranson said,\n\n       The real enemy for now is not inflation itself but \n     unwarranted angst about inflation brought on by stubborn \n     adherence to basic misconceptions. Inflation is certainly \n     detrimental to growth, but it is not true that growth must \n     lead to inflation. This principle is observable worldwide. \n     Low-inflation countries have tended to be economically \n     successful while high-inflation countries have tended to \n     stagnate.\n       Fourth, increased interest rates do little to curb \n     inflation; mostly they just ratify it. There is powerful \n     evidence that an increase in interest rates slows the \n     economy, but we find surprisingly little evidence that it \n     curbs inflation. Inflation does not decline perceptively \n     following a rate rise. Nor does inflation increase noticeably \n     following a rate cut.\n\n  Mr. Ranson concludes the article by saying:\n\n       The notion that inflation is generated by economic success \n     belies history and perpetuates the ``good news is bad news'' \n     syndrome that bedevils government policy and the financial \n     markets.\n       The assumption that we need the Fed to tinker endlessly \n     with interest rates needs to be challenged. Policymakers are \n     prone to assume that the Nation needs them to take vigorous \n     action . . . even when the pretext for action is elusive.\n       It is unclear whether those clamoring for higher interest \n     rates will be mollified by the Fed's token action. It is only \n     more likely they will be encouraged to demand more. One \n     policy mistaken facilitates another.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Ranson's article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Barron's, Apr. 14, 1997]\n\n  The Federal Reserve's Pointless Quarter-Point: A Preemptive Strike \n                          Against a Non-Threat\n\n                           (By David Ranson)\n\n       The recent quarter-point increase in the federal-funds rate \n     was unwarranted and potentially harmful. Government \n     policymakers, impatient with the absence of a pretext for \n     action, have once again chosen to act anyway. There are a \n     number of reasons why the Federal Reserve's recent action was \n     pointless at best.\n       First, there isn't any inflation around to curb. Everyone, \n     including Alan Greenspan, concedes that inflation is absent. \n     Thus the traditional pretext for Fed action is nowhere to be \n     found! I am reminded of the two buzzards sitting on a tree \n     limb. One turns to the other and announces: ``Patience, my \n     foot. I'm going to kill something.''\n       Second, there is no valid indication of inflation around \n     the corner for the Fed to pre-empt. The current acceleration \n     in the economy is cited as the primary indication that \n     inflation might lie ahead. According to the official story, \n     the Fed's action was a necessary ``pre-emptive strike'' \n     against inflation before it becomes evident.\n       The good news is that low unemployment and healthy economic \n     growth have been achieved in an environment of very low \n     inflation. Tragically, the most prevalent response to this \n     positive scenario is to worry even more loudly and to suggest \n     that this excellent state of affairs can't last. Supply-\n     siders correctly point out that such conventional wisdom is \n     contradicted by historical fact. While many observers express \n     surprise at the economy's success, it is exactly as real-life \n     experience suggests: Low inflation goes hand-in-hand with low \n     unemployment--and high inflation with high unemployment.\n       The real enemy for now is not inflation itself, but \n     unwarranted angst about inflation brought on by stubborn \n     adherence to basic misconceptions. Inflation is certainly \n     detrimental to growth, but it is not true that growth must \n     lead to inflation. This principle is observable worldwide. \n     Low-inflation countries have tended to be economically \n     successful while high-inflation countries have tended to \n     stagnate.\n       H.C. Wainwright Economics tracks in detail \n     interrelationships among U.S. interest rates, economic growth \n     and inflation. Statistical analysis confirms that inflation \n     precedes periods of weak economic growth rather than follows \n     periods of strong growth.\n       Fourth, increased interest rates do little to curb \n     inflation; mostly, they just ratify it. There is powerful \n     evidence that an increase in interest rates slows the \n     economy, but we find surprisingly little evidence that it \n     curbs inflation. Inflation does not decline perceptively \n     following a rate rise. Nor does inflation increase noticeably \n     following a rate cut.\n       Consider, for example, the half-dozen occasions when there \n     has been a year-to-year increase of more than two percentage \n     points in the federal-fund rate. These Fed moves were \n     followed after a year by an average decline of nearly 5 \n     points in the rate of industrial production growth, a \n     dramatic impact.\n       But whatever the counter-inflationary result, it was highly \n     unimpressive. In terms of producer prices (which are a more \n     sensitive indicator than consumer prices), the reduction in \n     inflation one year following these large rate hikes averaged \n     an insignificant one-tenth of a percentage point. Inflation \n     as measured by the consumer price index actually continued to \n     accelerate.\n       A skillful newspaper editor, faced with a peaceful day of \n     no news, makes a bigger fuss over what little he has to work \n     with. He knows how easy it is to fuel public anxiety. Wall \n     Street strategists have been playing this game for at least \n     the past year. Faced with a benign economy and virtually no \n     inflation, they have pursued a vociferous debate about the \n     mere possibility of increased inflation and the Fed's \n     potential reactions.\n       The Fed has succumbed to this pessimism. Far from pre-\n     emptively curbing inflation, its latest action tends to \n     endorse inflation that does not exist. Surely this is an \n     absurdity. It makes no sense for the government to respond to \n     fears of inflation by heightening them. Why would anyone want \n     to hamper a strengthening economy just to obviate the harm \n     than a purely speculative bout of inflation might cause? \n     While a quarter of a percentage point will not cause material \n     damage to the economy, additional moves in the same direction \n     will.\n       The notion that inflation is generated by economic success \n     belies history and perpetuates the ``good news is bad news'' \n     syndrome that bedevils government policy and the financial \n     markets. Granted, inflation has harmful effects, but the \n     damage done by unsubstantiated fears of inflation is worse \n     precisely because it is so unnecessary. The recent sag in the \n     bond market is just one of the symptoms of the less-visible \n     damage we are inflicting upon ourselves.\n       The assumption that we need the Fed to tinker endlessly \n     with interest rates needs to be challenged. Policymakers are \n     prone to assume that the nation needs them to take vigorous \n     action--even when the pretext for action is elusive.\n       It is unclear whether those clamoring for higher interest \n     rates will be mollified by the Fed's token action. It is more \n     likely that they will be encouraged only to demand more, \n     especially as the economy continues to accelerate. One policy \n     mistake facilitates another.\n       But it is also possible that Alan Greenspan understands \n     what his critics do not: that the Fed's true role is to keep \n     both interest rates and the dollar's purchasing power as \n     stable as possible. Perhaps in a histrionic Washington where \n     inaction is death he dare not say this too loudly.\n       In a recent commentary on National Public Radio, economist \n     Robert Kuttner suggests that Greenspan succumbed to pressure \n     from inflation hawks out of fear of being on the losing side \n     of the Open Market Committee vote. Whether that's true or \n     not, the Fed's decision to raise interest rates was more a \n     political act than an economic one.\n       But I remain optimistic that the longer inflation remains \n     absent, the less influence the inflation hawks will wield. In \n     such a environment the Fed will be able to justify smaller \n     and less frequent changes in interest rates.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, I am also concerned that the \nnominees that will be shortly before us to the Board of Governors seem \nequally frightened by this ghost of inflation. For example, nominee \nRoger Ferguson said in his testimony before the Senate Banking \nCommittee, ``Therefore, I agree with the Fed's historic approach''--I \nwould challenge that word ``historic approach''--``to reduce monetary \nstimulus before the emergence of obvious and strong inflationary \npressure. Unfortunately, the timing and appropriate amount of change in \nmonetary policy involves some guesswork and some risk taking.''\n  He agrees with the Fed's historic approach. It seems to me the \nhistoric approach of the Fed back in 1933 was to facilitate commerce \nand keep employment high. Only in 1978 was it added to keep inflation \nin check.\n  Mr. Ferguson's view is not a comforting thought given that we have a \nchairman of the Federal Reserve System who has echoed that comment when \nhe said, ``economic understanding is imperfect and measurement is \nimprecise.''\n  That is interesting. Mr. President, if measurements are not perfect, \ncan we assume the Fed knows what it is doing when it launches one of \nits preemptive strikes? Maybe all it is doing again is simply raising \nthe corporate profit rate and cutting down median weekly earnings.\n  This is what is happening. Change in the share of income received by \neach quintile from--look what is happening. The lowest quintile, the \nlowest 20 percent of our population, their share of income received is \ngoing down. All of it is going down. But in the top 20 percent it is \ngoing up--their share of the income.\n  So I suggest that what the Federal Reserve is doing is not stopping \ninflation at all. What they are doing is shifting who gets the money; \nwho gets the biggest share of this great growth that our country is now \nengaged in.\n  Furthermore, I submit that their policy inhibits that rate of growth \nand keeps it from being even greater than it is.\n  So we have a Fed that has used a method to fight inflation when we \nmay not even be sure if inflation actually exists in the economy.\n\n[[Page S11229]]\n\n  Well, Mr. President, I believe I have used up my 30 minutes. I see \nothers who are on the floor who want to speak. But I will have more to \nsay about this as the week progresses if the nominations are put before \nthe Senate for consideration. I have a number of other charts that I am \ngoing to use to illustrate how the Federal Reserve policies, I believe, \nare hurting the working families in America, how their policies are \nmistaken in bending this country toward higher interest rates when \nthose higher interest rates are not needed, when they are not \nlegitimate, and when those higher interest rates benefit the top 20 \npercent of the people of this country and hurt everyone else.\n  The Fed's policies, in short, are keeping growth restrained more than \nshould be.\n  Second, the Fed's policies, I believe, are keeping wages from keeping \nup with productivity in this country.\n  Third, the Fed's policies are skewing who gets whatever the growth is \nin our economic pie. In other words, we know and all of the figures \nshow--and I will release those later on this week--that in our country \nthe richer are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. We know \nthat. All we have to do is look at this chart.\n  So the Fed's policies are destroying the broad middle class in \nAmerica, that middle class that has always been the ladder of \nopportunity for those who ascend. I fear that if we do not stop the \npolicies of the Fed, that rather than accelerating inflation, what we \nwill have is an accelerating spread between the rich and the poor in \nour country, an acceleration of depressing wages, an acceleration of \npushing people in the middle class down further on the economic scale, \nand that I submit will be harder to turn around and more dangerous for \nour country, more fraught with the possibilities of deflation and \nsevere recession than any fear of a small increase in inflation that \nmight come about if the Fed were to actually reduce interest rates.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wanted to be here today just to make some \nbrief comments in support of the Medicare Freedom To Contract Act, S. \n1194.\n  During my first term in the 103d Congress, I witnessed President \nClinton attempt a Federal takeover of fully one-seventh of our Nation's \neconomy through a nationalized health care system. I was opposed to it \nthen and I remain adamantly opposed to it today.\n  Over the past 2 years we have seen a step-by-step encroachment by the \nFederal Government into the health care system.\n  Despite overwhelming public opposition to his attempt to take over \nthe health care system, President Clinton still seems to be intent on \nimposing his vision of socialized medicine on the American people.\n  In fact, on September 15 of this year, the President admitted that he \nhas not abandoned his goal of forcing a nationalized health care \nsystem. He stated, ``Now what I tried to do before won't work. Maybe we \ncan do it in another way. That's what we've tried to do, a step at a \ntime, until we finish this.''\n  I am sorry to say that the Republican-led Congress has been a great \nservice to the President by incrementally adopting and implementing \nmore and more of his 1994 health care scheme. While I supported the \nheralded Kassebaum-Kennedy Health Insurance Reform Act, which did \naccomplish some needed reforms, I have concerns about how this law has \nsince been implemented.\n  In addition to its original mandate, we have a host of so-called \n``body part'' protections and coverage mandates which will create a \nprecedent for total Federal control over health insurance packages and \nthereby ultimately a Federal health system. I have always believed that \nthe American people should have the fundamental right to choose where, \nwhen and how they receive their health care services. If individuals \nchoose to enroll in health maintenance organizations, let them. If they \nwant to join a preferred provider organization, let them. If they would \nlike to opt out of health insurance altogether or to pay for the \nservices as they are received, then let them. Clearly, I am not in a \nposition to determine what their needs are or what plan would best suit \ntheir family and their budget, nor is any bureaucrat in Washington able \nto determine the coverage best suited for each individual in the United \nStates.\n  Now, that brings us to the recently enacted Children's Health \nInitiative. I opposed the Balanced Budget Act in large part because of \nthis grossly overfunded, new Federal entitlement. Again, another ``step \nat a time'' that the President says we need to take until we have a \ntotal Government-run health care system.\n  Let me be very clear. I am very fully in support of ensuring access \nto health insurance for children. However, I have never believed that \nthis was a Federal issue. As a Minnesotan, I witnessed the creation of \na State program in 1992 which has provided access to health insurance \nto thousands of children in my State of Minnesota. It is called \nMinnesotaCare.\n  Now, this State program gives access to State subsidized private \nhealth insurance to families up to 285 percent of the Federal poverty \nlevel. The Federal Children's Health Initiative provided no \nconsideration to the States which have made a commitment to providing \naccess to health insurance to children or their families. In effect, \nthe Federal Government has now spent $24 billion on a program which \nclearly will not work in every State. In fact, it will penalize States \nlike mine which have already made significant progress in covering \nchildren, and this illustrates my point very well. Washington cannot \nmake the health care insurance decisions for everyone.\n  One of the most important corrections needed in the Balanced Budget \nAct is the Medicare Freedom to Contract Act. This was introduced by \nSenator Kyl which I have cosponsored. This act tries to correct what is \nprobably the most egregious example of what President Clinton's vision \nof Federal Government as provider and protector has in store for us.\n  While the Balanced Budget Act included a provision which allows a \nMedicare beneficiary to contract for health care services privately \nwith a physician, it effectively prohibits this from happening by \nforcing that physician to opt out of treating any other Medicare \npatients for 2 years. What the President has done is to blackmail \ndoctors and to deny senior citizens the basic right of spending their \nmoney as they see fit.\n  Even in the United Kingdom, which has had socialized national health \nservice since 1948, it allows its citizens to pay for services outside \nthe national system. Clearly, Americans can do better than that and at \nleast Americans deserve the same option. This is unfair to seniors. It \nis unfair to physicians. And it must be corrected quickly.\n  Opponents of the Medicare Freedom to Contract Act claim that it will \nforce seniors to pay 100 percent of a physician's charge for their \nservices, and it would mean an immediate and dramatic increase in out-\nof-pocket costs for physician services.\n  This is simply untrue. No Medicare beneficiary is required, nor \nimplicitly encouraged, to contract privately with a physician. This act \nmerely makes it possible for seniors to do so if they choose to do so. \nBut the opponents are ready to come to the floor to filibuster any \nopportunity to discuss this issue or to get a vote on it. And President \nClinton has also threatened to veto the bill should it pass.\n  Now, he put the provision in the BBA in the middle of the night \nwithout debate, another step again toward the President's desire for a \nnationally run health care program. And he says he will veto any \nefforts to stop it. Is this what Americans want? The American people \nstrongly rejected it in 1994, and they don't want it now.\n  Mr. President, I find it completely amazing that there are \nindividuals who believe it is wrong to allow seniors more options and \nmore choices in how\n\n[[Page S11230]]\n\nthey receive their health care services. Indeed, as the Balanced Budget \nAct aimed to provide more choices to seniors through the Medicare Plus \nChoice Program, the Medicare Freedom to Contract Act is the logical \nextension of the Medicare Plus Choice Program. It creates yet another \noption for our seniors.\n  In fact, a case can be made that if seniors contract privately with \ntheir physician for services and do not bill Medicare, it will save \nmoney. It will extend the life of the Medicare Program beyond the 10 \nyears the Balanced Budget Act supposedly will do.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we have many lessons to learn about the \neffects of health care mandates. However, denying seniors the option of \nusing their own money to pay for their own health care is a lesson in \nGovernment that's gone mad, and that is a lesson we have all learned \ntoo well already. I urge my colleagues to support this needed \ncorrection.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nimmediately proceed to executive session to consider the following \nFederal Reserve nominations on the Executive Calendar: Calendar No. 305 \nand Calendar No. 306.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I might \ninquire of the distinguished majority leader, what were the Executive \nCalendar numbers?\n  Mr. LOTT. I asked unanimous consent that we proceed to executive \nsession to consider the Federal Reserve nominations on the Executive \nCalendar. I know the Senator from Iowa has been discussing these \nnominees already this afternoon, and I am advised that he is going to \noppose a time agreement to get a vote on these nominations, so I was \ngoing to make note of the fact that my intention is to set the votes on \nthese nominations for later today.\n  If it is not possible, if there is objection to that, then I would \nhave to say it would appear to me that these nominees could not get \nconfirmed this session. We have a number of nominations we are trying \nto get cleared on both sides of the aisle.\n  I had indicated to Senator Daschle we would try to move these \nnominees. We also have similar holds on the FCC nominees. But if we \ncan't get those cleared in the next couple of days, it would be my \nintent to try to move those to a vote in the same manner tomorrow. So I \nam trying to emphasize that. I think these are important nominees. It \nwould seem to me we need to have nominees to the Federal Reserve Board \nconfirmed. These are the President's choices and his recommendations. \nThis is, obviously, a very critical board. While I might agree with the \nSenator about some of his reservations and disagree with some of the \nactions they take and a number of things that have occurred over the \nyears, I do think that unless there is a major objection to one or both \nof these nominees on the qualifications basis or experience or \nsomething of that nature, I feel an obligation to try to move them \nforward.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the majority leader will yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. Sure.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I respond by saying I appreciate the position the \nmajority leader is in. Quite frankly, I think that the occasion of \nconsidering a couple of nominees to the Federal Reserve Board of \nGovernors should be a time of some debate and some discussion on the \nSenate floor as to the Fed policy and to the direction the Fed has \ntaken.\n  Again, I do not need to remind the majority leader of this. He knows \nfull well there seems to be so many people who think the Federal \nReserve is some great Federal agency that is not beholding to the \nCongress. I keep pointing out it is a creature of Congress. It is not a \nconstitutional entity. It is a creature of Congress and by law we have \nthe right and I think the constitutional obligation to oversee the \nFederal Reserve, obviously to pass judgment, to advise and consent on \nnominations but also to give guidance and direction as to what their \npolicy ought to be. And I think that these nominees deserve to have \nsome discussion and debate.\n  I would say in all honesty to my friend from Mississippi, there are \non this side other Senators who I know want to engage in this \ndiscussion and debate who cannot be here today. I am here. And I am \nwilling to talk--well, I have my notebook here, if the majority leader \nwould like to see it. I have a few hours I could talk.\n  Mr. LOTT. It doesn't look very thick.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is pretty thick. I have a lot that I can say about \nthem.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I know he could talk at great length on this and other \nsubjects, and there may be other Senators who would like to talk on \nthem who are not here today. Quite frankly, I am not impressed that \nthey are not here. We are in the final 2 or 3 weeks of the session, and \nwhen Senators say they can't be here on Monday and they can't be here \non Friday, it sure makes it awful hard to do the people's business. But \nthe Senator is within his right; certainly these are important \nnominees, but I believe that on these nominees as well as the FCC \nnominees and hopefully maybe even others, if the holds are continued on \nthem, I need to call them up.\n\n  If there is objection, as apparently the Senator from Iowa intends, I \njust want to make it clear why they are being objected to and who is \nobjecting to them and we will move on. But I do want to make it clear \nto one and all that in view of the lateness of the hour in the session, \nthe odds of being able to spend a great deal of time or to get these \nnominees called up again is not very likely because we have a number of \nurgent matters that are pending that we are going to have to take up \nthis week and next week.\n  And so I just wanted to put that on the Record so that the Senators \nhere will know this is probably not a temporary delay; this is probably \na delay until next year.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the leader will yield further, if last week is any \nprelude to this week, I think we are going to have large gaps of time \nthis week on the Senate floor. There will be time for people to come \nout and discuss extraneous and various things. As I said, I know there \nare some other Senators who have expressed to me a desire to engage in \nsome discussion. I do not know how long but some discussion. And I \nthink the leader would agree this is important enough that we ought to \ndiscuss it anyway. I know he is not impressed that they are not here \ntoday. I understand that. But I am hopefully operating within my right \nto engage in a discussion on these nominees. I would, of course, object \nto them being brought up en bloc. I do not desire to thwart these \nnominations. However, I do want them brought up separately and singly \nas individual nominees and to be able to use some time this week to \ntalk about them.\n  I would be prepared to do that at great length today. I am here, and \nI am in pretty good physical shape so I am ready to discuss them at \nlength today, if he would like to do that, as is his right, but I would \nalso be willing to see what we could do during the remainder of the \nweek to engage in some discussion, and I will do that. If there are \ngaps this week, I will come to the floor and talk about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield further on his \nreservation, if there are some gaps, we could have more talk about \nthese nominees or other nominees later on this week. There may not be \nthe large gaps that there might appear because we do have a number of \nappropriations conference reports that we think are going to be ready \nthis week, plus the DC appropriations issue we believe we can resolve, \nalthough it will take a little time, 2 or 3 hours on that, plus Senator \nByrd and Senator Stevens have indicated they would like to have the \nline-item veto disapproval which could take 10 hours.\n  And that does not count regular bills. We have to do something about \nthe Amtrak strike this week, one way or the other. So I think we are \ngoing to have a good bit of time that will be used. But I know the \nSenator will be glad to talk when the time comes, and I appreciate his \ncomments.\n\n[[Page S11231]]\n\n  I renew my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today, on the eve of Chinese \nPresident Jiang Zemin's official state visit to the United States. I \nrise today because I believe that, while it is important to continue \nrelations with a country that contains one-fourth of the world's \npopulation, it is also important for us to remember that this one-\nfourth of the world's population--these 1.2 billion people--suffer \ntoday under an oppressive regime committed to a violent suppression of \ndissent, a regime which steadfastly refuses to recognize inalienable \nhuman rights, a regime which uses imprisonment, torture, and execution \nas tools to forge a society that is void of individual liberty.\n  It is a regime that has a government program to market human organs \nand body parts, using the execution of prisoners as a profit method for \nthe Government of China; a regime that systematically jams Radio Free \nAsia. While coming to the United States and professing their belief in \nliberty, they systematically jam the expression of freedom that this \ncountry subsidizes, underscoring its importance by broadcasting \nthroughout Asia.\n  Yet, with all of these facts, all of this evidence, the United States \nrolls out the red carpet for President Jiang Zemin of China, the same \nleader who was named General Secretary of the Communist Party 3 weeks \nafter the protests were quelled with violence and bloodshed in \nTiananmen Square. This is the same leader who is the hand-chosen \nsuccessor to Deng Xiaoping, the so-called Butcher of Beijing. He is the \nsame Communist leader who, in a 1990 interview, only a few weeks after \nthe Tiananmen Square massacre, in an interview with Barbara Walters \ndescribed the Tiananmen killings as, and I am quoting President Jiang \nZemin, ``much ado about nothing.'' This is the Communist leader who, in \nan interview published in the Washington Post just last Sunday, \ncontinued to defend the Tiananmen Square massacre and suggested the \nviolent crackdown on peaceful demonstrators was the price of allowing \neconomic reform in China. Madam President, this is the Communist leader \nwho is traveling throughout the country like a king.\n  Nothing underscores the differences we have with President Zemin more \nthan his recent comments on the subject of human rights. Earlier this \nmonth, as he prepared to come to the United States, President Zemin \nsaid, ``Both democracy and human rights are relative concepts and not \nabsolute and general.'' That bears repeating. President Jiang Zemin \nsaid about democracy and human rights, they are not absolutes, they are \nnot something that is essential, something that is God given, something \nthat is basic to being human beings. But, he says, they are relative \nconcepts.\n  As citizens of the United States, the great foundation on which our \ncountry was built is the undeniable and unchanging principle that all \nmankind is created equal, and that we are endowed by the Creator with \ncertain unalienable rights. Those rights attend to us as human beings, \nwhether we live in China or whether we live in the United States. \nNothing is more central to our understanding of the role of government. \nPresident Zemin and the Chinese leadership flagrantly reject this and \nover 1 billion Chinese know oppression and fear and violence as part \nand parcel of their daily lives. I would say to President Zemin that \nhuman rights are not the possession of governments, to be dispensed at \nthe will or the discretion of those who wield power. Human rights is \nnot, as he has insisted, a relative concept. It is a transcending value \nthat crosses cultures, societies, and forms of government. Liberty is \nnot the province of America, and to my colleagues and to this \nadministration I would say that our defense of freedom must not stop at \nour own shores.\n  The values which we cherish as Americans we must defend for people \neverywhere. We always have. The Great Wall that separates our \ngovernments today is the great wall of human rights violations. I hope \nthe President and the leadership of Congress in their meetings with \nPresident Zemin this week will, frankly and forcefully, communicate the \ndeep sense of anger and the deep sense of outrage that is stirred in \nthis country by the ongoing human rights abuses in China.\n  It is time for straight talk with the Chinese leadership. It is time \nfor an American foreign policy guided by a commitment to the cause of \nfreedom. I urge the President to remember the words that he spoke in \nDecember 1991 as he campaigned for the office which he now occupies. \nCandidate Clinton in 1991 said, in reference to the Bush \nadministration:\n\n       The administration continues to coddle China, despite its \n     continuing crackdown on democratic reforms, its brutal \n     subjugation of Tibet, its irresponsible export of nuclear and \n     missile technology, and its abusive trade practices.\n\n  He accused the Bush administration of coddling China because of these \ncircumstances within China--brutal subjugation of Tibet, irresponsible \nexport of nuclear missile technology, and crackdown on Democratic \nreforms. He said, because of that, the Bush administration is doing too \nlittle. They are coddling China. I ask the President, what has changed? \nThe only thing that has changed is the condition of the Chinese people \nand the oppression under which they live every day. Conditions are \nworse by every measure and by every standard. Things have gotten worse \nin China. Yet the administration has totally changed its position. The \nposition of the President has changed. The condition of the Chinese \npeople has changed also, but only for the worse.\n  I believe that China's flagrant disregard for human rights should be \nenough. But, since our policies toward China have not changed, the \nhuman rights abuses continue to take a back seat to a foreign policy \nthat seems to be driven by profit projections. The administration now, \ninstead of sanctioning China, wants to sign an all-encompassing new \nnuclear pact with China; in effect, to reward them.\n  The logic in all of this new policy, called constructive engagement, \nis that if we will engage China and we will trade with China and we \nwill see economic expansion in China--and their\n\n[[Page S11232]]\n\neconomy is growing in double digits every year--that human rights \nconditions will improve, that the rights of the Chinese people will be \nenhanced. Such has not been the case. And if such a policy were one \nthat we consistently enforced around the world, it would result in the \nlifting of sanctions on Cuba, the lifting of sanctions on North Korea, \nbecause if we believe that increased trade is going to bring the \ndownfall of totalitarianism, it ought to work not only in China but \nNorth Korea and Cuba, too. But we hear no mention we ought to change \nour trade policies toward North Korea or Cuba; all the time saying if \nwe just continue to trade with China, things will get better there. \nNow, in the midst of all of this, the administration admits to signing \nan all-encompassing nuclear pact with China. Lets look at the facts, \nbecause I think they speak for themselves.\n\n  In December 1992, the Government of the People's Republic of China \nviolated the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Administration Act \nof 1979 with the transfer by the Ministry of Aerospace Industry of \napproximately 24 M-11 missiles to Pakistan.\n  Let's look at the facts. From September 1994 to June 1996, the \nGovernment of the People's Republic of China again violated the Arms \nExport Control Act and the Export Administration Act of 1996, with the \ntransfer by the Ministry of Aerospace Industry of as many as 30 M-11 \nballistic missiles to Pakistan.\n  In August 1996, the Government of the Peoples Republic of China again \nviolated the Arms Export Control Act, the Export Administration Act of \n1979, and the Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act of 1992, with the \ntransfer by the China Precision Engineering Institute to Iran's defense \nindustries of gyroscopes, accelerometers, and test equipment for the \nconstruction and test of ballistic missile guidance systems.\n  While looking at the facts, it was reported in August of this year \nthat the United States Central Intelligence Agency discovered a \nshipment by the People's Republic of China to the Syrian Scientific \nStudies and Research Center, a Syria Government agency that oversees \nmissile development, of guidance equipment for M-11 ballistic missiles. \nThis alleged system would be a violation of the Missile Technology \nControl Regime. This alleged shipment would have taken place after the \nlimited sanctions imposed by the United States on China for shipments \nof M-11 missiles and components to Pakistan had been lifted following \nthe assurances by China that it would comply with the Missile \nTechnology Control Regime.\n  So we see these ongoing violations. After each of these violations, \nand there are many more, our administration either failed to take \nappropriate actions to deter future violations of such acts, took the \nleast onerous action against the Government of the People's Republic of \nChina that was possible under such acts, or rescinded previous actions, \nthereby diluting or eliminating the deterrent effect of sanctions under \nsuch acts with respect to China.\n  This inaction has forced three important results. First, this \nCongress renewed MFN to China. Second, we are now honoring the \nCommunist leader in our country. Third, the public has been convinced \nthat through such nearsighted ill-advised strategies like constructive \nengagement, China would change.\n  Yes, Madam President, China has changed--for the worse. And this \nCongress and this President, I believe, has done too little. If you \nwill, we have stood idly by. We have said too little. We have done \nvirtually nothing.\n  What is truly unprecedented is the administration's recent campaign \nto draw a bright and attractive picture of Communist China. I ask the \nPresident and I ask this Congress, and I have turned to this before and \nI will turn to it again, have you not read the 1996 United States State \nDepartment's China Country Report on Human Rights Practices? Because I \nhave read it. The information in it is horrific. Once again, allow me \nto quote from this report:\n\n       China has continued to commit widespread and well-\n     documented human rights abuses, in violation of \n     internationally accepted norms stemming from the authorities' \n     intolerance of dissent, fear of unrest, and the abuse of laws \n     protecting basic freedoms. Abuses include torture and \n     mistreatment of prisoners, forced confessions, and arbitrary \n     and lengthy incommunicado detention. The government continued \n     severe restrictions on freedom of speech, the press, \n     assembly, religion, privacy and workers' rights.\n\n  That's from our own State Department 1996 country report on China.\n  In 1989 we watched with amazement as courageous Chinese students \nmarched in Tiananmen Square. Today, they are all gone. They are all \ngone. During their struggle they defied the tanks, they looked to the \nUnited States for inspiration, they quoted our Declaration of \nIndependence, they built replicas of our Statue of Liberty, and \nthroughout it all United States policymakers have answered that \neconomic engagement would stop China's abuses of human rights. As far \nas I can tell, not only are profit projections driving our foreign \npolicy, not only is our current policy with China appeasement rather \nthan engagement, not only does this Congress continue to turn a blind \neye to the oppressed in the interests of trade opportunities, but, \nPresident Jiang Zemin's visit is a clear sign to the world, our \nenemies, and our friends that not only did the United States tacitly \napprove of everything that was going on, I think, from forced \nsterilization to the breaking of ballistic missile treaties, but even \nmore important it's a clear message that we can and will tolerate \nanything and everything without repercussion and without a price.\n  I am reminded of President Ronald Reagan. I think few have served our \ncountry more nobly. And I am reminded of my good friend Senator John \nAshcroft who has spoken so forcefully on the issue of China, especially \neven during this last month. In President Ronald Reagan's second \ninaugural address, he spoke of the danger of simple-minded appeasement. \nHe spoke of accommodating countries at their lowest and least. This is \nwhat former President Reagan said:\n\n       History teaches us that wars begin when governments believe \n     the price of aggression is cheap.\n\n  There have been no repercussions to the egregious human rights abuses \nongoing in China. There have been no repercussions. There has been no \nprice to pay for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction that \nthe Government of China has carried out. There have been no \nrepercussions for the incomprehensible toleration by the Chinese \nGovernment of laogai camps, the slave labor camps that exist in which \nthere are hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, incarcerated.\n  Madam President, President Jiang Zemin's visit proves that China \nbelieves that the price of aggression and the price of these abuses is \ncheap. It proves that we in this country accept this, and I can \nremember when we did not. It proves that, just as President Clinton \nstated last Friday that China is at a crossroads, well, Madam \nPresident, we in the United States are at a crossroads as well. \nPresident Jiang Zemin and his enjoyment of a state visit, a visit that \nhas been elevated to the highest level, the red carpet treatment that \nhe has been accorded, the 21-gun salute, I believe this is truly a slap \nin the face to every Chinese political dissident that languishes today \nin a Chinese prison. It is time that we as public policymakers, those \nconcerned about the welfare of our fellow human beings wherever they \nmay live in this world, who are the recipients by their creator, as we \nAmericans are, of certain unchangeable, undeniable human rights, it is \ntime that we, once again, not only spoke out, but move from debate and \ndiscussion and outrage to action.\n  During the course of this state visit, while I disagree with much \nthat has been planned and the royal treatment that he is being given, \nit is an opportunity for us as Americans to show President Zemin what \nfreedom really is. It is an opportunity for us, through our protests, \nthrough our debates, through our congressional oversight hearings that \nare going on, through every means possible, to raise these most serious \nissues to the attention of President Zemin and to show him not only \nwhat free expression really is, but to show him the true intensity of \nthe feeling of the American people, if not our Government, the American \npeople at what has been tolerated and what continues to go on in China \ntoday.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/27/senate-section/article/S11231-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11233]]\n                         RECESS UNTIL 4:30 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

MARBLEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the majority leader has \ndecided to take up this nomination. Mr. Marbley and his family deserve \na great deal of praise for this accomplishment.\n  Algenon Marbley is currently a partner in the law firm of Vorys, \nSater, Seymour & Pease in Columbus, OH. He has served as an instructor \nfor the National Institute of Trial Advocacy and is the chairman of the \nTrial Advocacy Committee of the Columbus Bar Association. He is an \nactive volunteer for several organizations, including the Big Brothers/\nBig Sisters Association of Columbus.\n  I sincerely congratulate Mr. Marbley and his family on this \naccomplishment and look forward to his service as a U.S. district judge \nfor the Southern District of Ohio.\n  The U.S. Senate, however, does not deserve an enormous amount of \ncredit in this area. This is only the 22d judicial confirmation in a \nyear in which we have seen 115 judicial vacancies. Just think of that, \nMr. President, 115 judicial vacancies and the Senate has only seen fit \nto confirm 22 judicial nominees sent by the President. More than 50 \nadditional nominees remain somehow hidden before the Senate and before \nthe Judiciary Committee with no action.\n  Six outstanding nominees remain pending on the Senate calendar, ready \nfor Senate approval. Margaret Morrow has been awaiting Senate action \nsince June 12. Christina Snyder has been ready for the Senate to \nexercise its advise and consent function since September. They are \nbeing passed over, again.\n  The Senate is not even keeping pace with attrition. Since the \nadjournment of Congress last October, judicial vacancies have actually \nincreased by almost 50 percent and currently number more than 93.\n  Forty-six judicial nominees remain pending before the Judiciary \nCommittee. Although the committee has yet to hold a judicial \nconfirmation hearing this month, I am pleased to see that Senator Hatch \nhas noticed a hearing for tomorrow and another for Wednesday afternoon \nto try to reduce the backlog of nominees awaiting action by the \ncommittee. I hope that the committee will move promptly after those \nhearings to report those nominees to the Senate and that the Senate \nwill proceed to confirm them before adjournment this year.\n  From the first day of this session of Congress, the Judiciary \nCommittee has never worked through its backlog of nominees and has \nnever had fewer than 20 judicial nominees awaiting hearings. Two \nhearings in September combined with those planned for this week will \nnot eliminate the backlog, but represent movement in the right \ndirection.\n  Mr. President, I want Senators to know about another development \nthat, unfortunately, is not intended to help end the partisan stall on \njudicial confirmations. I have just learned recently that a $1.4 \nmillion fundraising and lobbying effort is underway to try to \nperpetuate the judicial vacancy crisis and continue the partisan and \nideological stall of Senate consideration of much-needed judges. I \nunderstand this solicitation for big bucks includes the solicitation of \nbig donors with promises of ``intimate dinners'' with ``leading \nconservative elected and public figures closely involved with the \njudicial confirmation process'' and that Senators--incumbent Senators--\nappear on videotape being used as an integral part of this fundraising \neffort. This is apparently a solicitation for money to help block the \nSenate from doing its duty to vote on confirmations, in part by \npromising access for people who send in big money.\n  Those pressing this effort complain about what they see as ``the \nfailure of the U.S. Senate to block'' the appointment of judges to the \nFederal bench. The American people, litigants, prosecutors, and judges, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, have just the opposite complaint--that \nthe perpetuation of judicial vacancies is affecting the administration \nof justice and rendering our laws empty promises.\n\n  It is sad that this effort is premised on the slanted portrayal of \ndecisions, many of which were decided by judges appointed by President \nBush. I have spoken before about the dangers of characterizing isolated \ndecisions to stir up anger against the judiciary just so that somebody \ncan get short-term monetary and political gain. It is not worth the \nprice to try to destroy one of our independent branches of Government \nand the most independent and effective judiciary in the world.\n  This fundraising campaign seems to extend back over the course of the \nyear, but it has only become public with reports in the Los Angeles \nTimes and New York Times over the weekend.\n  Those who delight in taking credit for having killed judicial \nnominees last year continue their misguided efforts to the detriment of \neffective law enforcement and civil justice.\n  Now, any Senator can vote against any judicial nominee. They have \nthat right. But I urge them to stand up on the floor of the Senate, \nwhere the public knows who they are and where they are, and either vote \nfor or against people. It is not only disingenuous, but I think it is \ndetrimental to our system of justice, and it is a true distortion of \nwhat we pledge to do in upholding the Constitution when some block \njudges by anonymous holds. And then we find that the reason for doing \nthat is in connection with a fundraising and lobbying campaign in which \nletters were sent out by some group saying, in effect, that if you send \nthis money, we will block judges and we will arrange for you to meet \nprivately with leading elected officials.\n  That is wrong. That is wrong, Mr. President. It is unprecedented in \nthe 23 years that I have been in the Senate. Nothing like this has ever \nbeen allowed by any of the leaders of the Senate--not by Senator \nMansfield, not by Senator Byrd, not by Senator Baker, not by Senator \nDole, and not by Senator Mitchell. It should not be allowed now. It is \nwrong, and it undermines the very credibility of the U.S. Senate, and \nit demeans the U.S. Senate; but, even more importantly, it is \ndestructive of the independence of the judiciary.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/27/senate-section/article/S11233-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11233-S11234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNITED STATES-JAPAN TRADE AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, in light of the disturbing news in the \nstock market this afternoon, I thought it was appropriate to the bring \nto the attention of my colleagues that there is good news out there. \nThe United States and Japan have concluded a trade agreement opening up \nthe ports of Japan, ending a longstanding dispute between the United \nStates and Japan. This agreement, when it is signed--and it is agreed \nto--will bring about changes that will benefit ocean-borne trade of \nboth countries, the United States and Japan. The agreements will reform \npractices in the Japanese ports, to the benefit of importers, \nexporters, the ports, the workers, and the consumers both in the United \nStates and Japan.\n  This is good for trade relations between our two countries. The \nJapanese had for a long period of time prevented our ships from having \nthe same rights to their ports, in terms of bringing our goods to that \ncountry, as we have afforded them when they came calling on ports in \nthe United States. Therefore, this is good news for people who are \nengaged in trade relations and exports and import trade relations with \nJapan and the United States.\n  I am very optimistic that this will bring about continued growth in \nthose\n\n[[Page S11234]]\n\nmarkets, and I want to commend the Federal Maritime Commission, its \nChairman, Hal Creel, and members of the administration, particularly \nStu Eizenstat, for the good work they have done in bringing this to a \nconclusion.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the regular order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/27/senate-section/article/S11233-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FOLEY\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is a personal pleasure and an honor \nfor me to be here this afternoon as one of Washington's U.S. Senators. \nMy State--my entire State--is immensely proud today as Tom Foley's \nnomination to be our Ambassador to Japan comes to the Senate floor.\n  Most of my Senate colleagues know Tom Foley personally as a result of \nworking with him on legislation and on maintaining the integrity and \nauthority of the legislative branch.\n\n[[Page S11235]]\n\n  Important for those of us in the Senate, the man who eventually \nbecame Speaker began his congressional career in the U.S. Senate as \nspecial counsel to the late and revered Washington State Senator Henry \nM. ``Scoop'' Jackson. Despite his distinguished service in the other \nbody, Tom Foley is really one of our own.\n  Tom was born and raised in Spokane, WA. The son of Superior Court \nJudge Ralph and Helen Foley, he is the descendent of a pioneering \nfamily that settled in Washington's big bend country. He also learned \nfirsthand the importance of public service from his father, Judge \nFoley. In addition, he learned firsthand about the crop that has become \none of our most successful export commodities, wheat, by working in his \nuncle's grain elevator business.\n  It was that early introduction to the export dominated economy of our \nState that led to his unstinting advocacy of American agricultural \nexports to Japan, most of Asia, and throughout the world.\n  Throughout his long service as a Washington State Representative to \nCongress and as its Speaker, he was a tireless advocate for American \ncompetitiveness in the world market and for its peerless agricultural \nproductivity. As a champion of America's family farmers throughout his \nservice as a member and then chairman of the House Agriculture \nCommittee, he took every opportunity to press, usually successfully, \nthe opening of markets throughout the world to the production of \nAmerica's farmers.\n  But Speaker Foley always understood that America's national interest \nwould be best served by ensuring that all of its products would have a \nlevel playing field with all our trading partners. It is my belief that \nthe reason Speaker Foley enjoys such great respect in Japan today is \nhis consistent and candid portrayal of critical issues that have arisen \nbetween this country and Japan. The Japanese, like many of my Senate \ncolleagues who have served here longer than I, also know him as a \nskilled and tireless negotiator.\n  In my opinion, no recent Member of Congress surpasses Speaker Foley \nin the depth and breadth of his understanding of Japan. It is no \nexaggeration to say that during the more than 25 years he has traveled \nregularly to Japan, he has made the acquaintance of virtually every \nsingle political and economic leader of note in that country. On those \ntrips, and the many occasions when he received Japanese political and \nbusiness leaders in this country, he pressed the full range of American \ntrade and vital mutual security concerns. Throughout this period, \nSpeaker Foley also provided counsel and sage advice to Presidents of \nboth parties.\n  This record of understanding, great knowledge, and policy expertise \nis unparalleled in either Tokyo or Washington. It makes Speaker Foley \nthe natural choice to be our Ambassador to Japan, representing our \nNation, its people, and its vital interests. The residents of my State \nare so proud of Tom Foley's record of public service.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is time once again, to draw from the \nillustrious alumni ranks of the Senate to fill what is perhaps our most \nimportant diplomatic post as we did when we sent Majority Leader \nMansfield and Vice President Walter Mondale to Tokyo.\n  Tom Foley will be a fabulous ambassador. I urge all of my colleagues \nto join me in supporting this nomination.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield back all time for debate on these \nnominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, too often the media reports about a terrible \nmistake made or a crime committed by one of America's young people. But \nthere are millions and millions of young people who we never hear \nabout--young people who are doing the right things, young people \navoiding the mistakes often made by their peers, young people working \nhard in school, young people participating in the civic activities of \ntheir town or city, and, sometimes, young people doing remarkable \nthings.\n  Mr. President, I want to tell my Senate colleagues about one special \nyoung person, Andrew Montgomery, from Crystal Springs, MS.\n  On August 19, 1995, when he was only eleven years old, Andrew first \nproved himself. He came upon a crowd of people who had surrounded an \nunconscious woman near the seawall in Galveston, TX. No one in the \ncrowd was taking action, so Andrew stepped forward and administered CPR \nand treatment for shock. Eventually, an emergency medical team arrived \nand transported the woman to a local hospital, where she recovered.\n  Mr. President, 2 years later, Andrew Montgomery was again confronted \nwith an emergency situation. On August 10 of this year, Andrew was \nriding with his family near Lafayette, LA, when they came upon a \nmultivehicle wreck. A car and a pickup had collided, and the car came \nto rest in a ditch, with a heavy metal sign collapsed upon it. Andrew \nquickly rushed to the scene. The car was smashed and on fire. The \ndriver of the car was dead, and a baby in the back seat, covered with \nblood, was in danger. Unable to immediately pull the baby out of the \nwrecked car, Andrew wrapped the infant in a beach towel, and protected \nthe baby from the smoke and flames of the car fire. Andrew was then \njoined by his parents, Ann and Bill, Kenneth Puckett, a truckdriver, \nand Dr. Thomas Dewey. The group rescued the child and lifted the baby \nhand-over-hand out of the ditch in which the car settled following the \ncollision.\n  Mr. President, how many of us would have had the presence to do the \nsame? Mind you, we're talking about a young boy.\n  Andrew, I might add, knew what to do because he received training \nfrom both the American Red Cross and the Boy Scouts. Andrew's reactions \nwere a direct result of this training. It saved two lives, and speaks \nvolumes about how important organizations like the Red Cross and the \nBoy Scouts are to all Americans.\n  Mr. President, as I said, too often we hear about the ``bad eggs'' \namong America's youth. And, we worry about America's future. But the \nstory of Andrew Montgomery should remind us all how many of our youth \nare out there doing the right thing.\n  We too often also hear about the broken families in America. But \nAndrew's story should remind us how many of our families are still out \nthere doing the right thing. His parents, Ann and Bill Montgomery have \ngood reason to be proud of their son. They raised a boy who is willing \nto make sacrifices, willing to work hard, and willing to act \ncourageously. I want to also recognize his parents for setting a good \nexample for their son, by being active in their community--as Scout \nleaders.\n  Mr. President, I personally want to recognize Andrew Montgomery for \nbeing an outstanding example of America's youth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/27/senate-section/article/S11236-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CONGRATULATIONS TO ARTHUR E.

Con. Res. 57\n\n       Whereas at the invitation of President Clinton, President \n     Jiang Zemin of the People's Republic of China is beginning a \n     state visit to the United States which will culminate in a \n     summit meeting with President Clinton on October 29, 1997;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China, \n     as detailed in successive annual reports on human rights by \n     the Department of State, routinely, systematically, and \n     massively violates the human rights of its citizens, \n     including but not limited to freedom of speech, assembly, \n     worship, and peaceful political dissent;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     routinely, systematically, and massively restricts the \n     ability of religious adherents, including Christians, \n     Buddhists, Muslims, and others, to practice outside of state-\n     approved religious organizations, and detains worshipers and \n     clergy who participate in religious services conducted \n     outside state-approved religious organizations, as well as \n     those who refuse to register with the authorities as \n     required;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     routinely, systematically, and massively continues to commit \n     widespread human rights abuses in Tibet, including instances \n     of death in detention, torture, arbitrary arrest, detention \n     without public trial, long detention of Tibetan nationalists \n     for peacefully expressing their religious and political \n     views, and intensified controls on religion and on freedom of \n     speech and the press, particularly for ethnic Tibetans;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     routinely, systematically, and massively engages in \n     reprehensible, brutal, and coercive family planning \n     practices, including forced abortion and forced \n     sterilization, resulting in widespread infanticide, \n     particularly of female infants;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     systematically engages in the proliferation of weapons of \n     mass destruction and advanced ballistic missile technology;\n       Whereas the regional and bilateral national security \n     relationships of the United States and the current level of \n     United States military forces in east Asia and the western \n     Pacific region are integral to the maintenance of peace and \n     security in the Asian Pacific region;\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China employs mercantilist \n     and protectionist trade practices, including the imposition \n     of tariffs and nontariff barriers with respect to United \n     States imports to that country, which result in a market \n     distortion between the United States and the People's \n     Republic of China; and\n       Whereas there are credible and specific reports that the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China has been \n     involved in calculated efforts to subvert the American \n     political process, and that persons believed to have \n     information about such efforts have fled to the People's \n     Republic of China to avoid cooperating with official \n     inquiries into these efforts: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (The House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) declares that it is the policy of the United States \n     with respect to the People's Republic of China--\n       (A) to encourage freedom and democracy in the People's \n     Republic of China and to deter the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China from engaging in activities that are \n     contrary to the national security interests of the United \n     States and the peace and security of the Asian Pacific \n     region;\n       (B) to encourage the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China to make progress towards improving overall human rights \n     conditions in China and Tibet, including taking concrete \n     steps to assure freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and \n     freedom of association in compliance with international \n     standards on human rights;\n       (C) to encourage the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China to channel its emerging power and influence along paths \n     that are conducive to peace, stability, and development in \n     the Asian Pacific region; and\n       (D) to support integration of the People's Republic of \n     China into the community of nations;\n       (2) urges President Clinton to communicate the policy of \n     the United States, in the strongest possible terms, to \n     President Jiang during their summit meeting and to demand \n     that the People's Republic of China immediately--\n       (A) cease persecuting Chinese Christians, as well as \n     members of other religious faiths, and release all persons \n     incarcerated because of religious beliefs, or democracy-\n     related activities, in particular Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan;\n       (B) cease coercive population control practices, including \n     forced abortion, forced sterilization, and infanticide;\n       (C) cease efforts to subvert the American political process \n     and return to the United States persons involved in such \n     efforts;\n       (D) cease nonreciprocal tariff and nontariff barriers \n     relating to United States imports to the People's Republic of \n     China;\n       (E) cease resistance to transparency in its trade \n     practices;\n       (F) cease exports to the United States of products made \n     with prison labor;\n       (G) cease activities leading to proliferation of weapons of \n     mass destruction and advanced ballistic missile technology \n     (such as C-801 and C-802 cruise missiles); and\n       (H) cease evasion of United States export controls and \n     other laws; and\n       (3) reaffirms the policy promulgated in the Taiwan \n     Relations Act (Public Law 96-8) and insists that the Taiwan \n     Relations Act be fully implemented by the President.\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a concurrent \nresolution on the Clinton-Jiang United States-People's Republic of \nChina summit with my colleagues Senators Abraham, Nickles, and Craig. I \nam compelled to do this for two reasons.\n  First, let me provide some context for my comments. I traveled to \nChina this past March to address Hong Kong reversion issues, and \nreturned concerned about United States-China relations. My concern grew \nfrom what I perceived as the distance between the shared humanity of \nAmerican and Chinese people, and the distrust of people expressed by \nthe autocratic Government of the People's Republic of China.\n  My two issues with this summit are these:\n  First, we know what President Jiang gets from this visit; we do not \nknow what President Clinton will receive in return for the American \npeople.\n  Second, unfortunately, it seems that the bar has been lowered--the \nadministration has lowered expectations for the summit--in order to \nmore easily achieve the appearance of a successful summit. If the \nUnited States abandons realistic and important summit deliverables \nuntil a possible 1998 Clinton visit to Beijing, United States values \ntoday will be sacrificed for political gain tomorrow.\n  Let me elaborate on these points. What does Jiang get? He gets more \npower in Beijing.\n  He is the leader of the largest authoritarian government in the \nworld. His top priority, as a Communist leader, is consolidation of \npower and longevity in office.\n  His overriding goal for the summit, therefore, is to demonstrate that \nhe can deal effectively with the United States. He wants to bring home \nsymbolic proof that the United States views the People's Republic of \nChina, with Jiang at the helm, as a respected global power.\n  This state visit will deliver the symbolism President Jiang so \nstrongly seeks.\n  What do we get? We do not yet know because there is not an \narticulated United States-China policy.\n  President Clinton has no articulated China policy and will not likely \nproduce one during this summit. This may be the single most dangerous \naspect of our relationship with China.\n  President Clinton this week must deliver a milestone in a clearly \narticulated policy which supports a coherent and well defined strategy. \nAnd he must bring the Congress and American people with him.\n  To do this, he should attain specific deliverables on human rights, \nweapons proliferation, and trade.\n  Therefore, Mr President, today we are introducing this resolution to \narticulate our specific expectations. During this summit, the United \nStates should do the following: State United States support for the \ndemocratization of China; call for progress on human rights, and the \nimmediate release of prisoners of conscience, including Wei Jingsheng \nand Wang Dan; call for concrete steps to prevent the proliferation of \nweapons and weapons technology, including nuclear technology and cruise \nmissiles; call for concrete progress to cease unfair market practices; \nstate United States commitment to maintaining regional peace and \nsecurity by working with our regional allies; and reaffirm United \nStates policy promulgated in the Taiwan Relations Act.\n  Mr President, I hope that President Clinton will not lose this \nopportunity to gain concrete progress on the vitally important United \nStates-China relationship.\n  If we solidify Jiang's hold on political power in Beijing, and in \nreturn\n\n[[Page S11238]]\n\nmust wait until a possible Beijing summit next year before the American \npeople get what they desire--trade, human rights, and national security \nprogress--the failure of the summit will not be lost on the Congress or \nthe American people.\n  Nonaction represents an opportunity cost, Mr. President. My question \nto President Clinton is this, ``What price would you have the people of \nthe United States and China pay for this week's headlines.''\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues Senator Mack \nand Senator Nickles in cosponsoring Senate Concurrent Resolution 57.\n  This resolution concerns the imminent state visit of President Jiang \nZemin of the People's Republic of China and his summit meeting with \nPresident Clinton. It expresses the sense of the Senate that that \nmeeting should address critical human rights and national security \nissues.\n  Mr. President, I have come to the floor several times in recent days \nto express my belief that it would be inappropriate and \ncounterproductive for our President to welcome the Chinese Communist \nleader at a state visit without insisting on significant progress on \nthe part of the Chinese Government in areas of great concern to our \ncountry.\n  The ceremonial niceties and diplomatic prestige of a state visit in \nmy opinion may, particularly if unaccompanied by substantive action, \ngive the unfortunate impression that the United States approves of the \nnumerous human rights abuses and instances of weapons proliferation \nundertaken by the current Chinese Government. I joined with Senator \nFeingold and Senator Helms in sponsoring a resolution calling on the \nadministration to make this a working rather than a state visit so that \nthe administration might work on the many issues of concern to both our \ncountries without providing undue legitimacy to current Chinese \npractice.\n  Let there be no mistake, Mr. President. China is an important player \non the world scene. We cannot and should not attempt to avoid dealings \nwith this nation of a billion people. That is why I supported \nmaintaining most favored nation trading status with China. In my view \nit is critical that we remain engaged with the people of China through \ngreater trade, private investment and openness. But I also am convinced \nthat this administration must do more to add substance to our \nrelationship with the Chinese Government.\n  Twenty-one gun salutes and red carpets, both used to welcome \nPresident Jiang on his landing in Hawaii, are inappropriate, given our \nserious disagreements on critical issues affecting American national \nsecurity, human rights, and international peace and stability.\n  Amidst the champagne toasts of a state visit, we cannot ignore \nChinese sales of weapons of mass destruction and nuclear technology to \ncountries like Iran, Iraq, and Pakistan.\n  We cannot ignore Chinese Government restrictions on the ability of \nChristians, Buddhists, Muslims, and others to practice their religions \noutside of state-controlled organizations and the common practice of \ndetaining worshipers and clergy who practice their religion through \ntheir own organizations.\n  We cannot ignore the People's Republic of China's massive, routine, \nand systematic human rights abuses in Tibet, including arbitrary \narrest, torture and even death for those who seek to peacefully \npractice their religion and/or work for expanded political and human \nrights.\n  We cannot ignore the Chinese Government's routine, systematic, and \nmassive program of coercive family planning practices, including forced \nabortion, forced sterilization and even infanticide.\n  We must forcefully raise these issues with President Jiang. We must \ninsist that they be addressed, and that progress be made toward greater \nrespect for human rights and the requirements of international peace \nand stability.\n  Toward that end, Mr. President, I believe it is crucial that this be \nmade a substantive, rather than merely a ceremonial visit. That is why \nI am happy to join Senator Mack and Senator Nickles in introducing this \nSense-of-the-Senate Resolution, outlining a concrete agenda for the \nJiang-Clinton summit.\n  Specifically, this resolution declares that it is the policy of the \nUnited States to uphold the Taiwan Relations Act, and insist that \nPresident Clinton fully implement that important agreement. This act \nprovides the framework for strong economic and security relations \nbetween the United States and the democratic Government of Taiwan. Full \nimplementation will protect an important ally and show our commitment \nto freedom in the Asian-Pacific region.\n  Further, this resolution declares our policy to encourage freedom and \ndemocracy in the People's Republic of China and to deter the Government \nof that country from engaging in activities contrary to the national \nsecurity interests of the United States, and the peace and security of \nthe Asian Pacific region.\n  The resolution encourages the Chinese Government to take concrete \nsteps to assure freedom of speech, freedom of religion and freedom of \nassociation in compliance with international standards of human rights. \nIt also declares that United States policy should encourage the \nGovernment of the People's Republic of China to channel its emerging \npower and prestige along paths conducive to peace, stability and \ndevelopment in the Asian Pacific region.\n  Mr. President, this resolution is intended to move President Clinton \nto communicate this country's resolve to defend freedom, democracy, and \ninternational stability, as well as our commitment to encouraging the \nPeople's Republic of China to integrate itself peacefully into the \ncommunity of nations.\n  It also calls on President Clinton to make a number of specific \ndemands, including:\n  First, that the Chinese Government dismantle tariff and nontariff \nbarriers to American exports to China and stop its export to the United \nStates of products made with prison labor;\n  Second, that the Chinese Government cease persecuting Chinese \nChristians, as well as members of other religious faiths, and release \nall persons incarcerated for their religious or other human rights \nrelated activities, in particular Wei Jeng Sheng and Wang Dan.\n  Third, that it end its coercive population control practices, \nincluding its practice of forced abortion, forced sterilization, and \ninfanticide;\n  Fourth, that the Chinese Government stop its activities leading to \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and advanced ballistic \nmissile technology, and\n  Fifth, that the Chinese Government stop its evasion of United States \nexport control and other laws.\n  Mr. President, by making these demands on the Chinese regime, the \nPresident would put in place the structure needed for a coherent China \npolicy; a policy aimed at protecting our national interests and \nimproving human rights conditions in China. I firmly believe that it is \nAmerica's duty as well as our interest to make the extra effort \nnecessary to improve overall human rights conditions in China and to \nintegrate her into the community of nations. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this resolution and I call on the President to demand that the \nChinese Government bring itself into compliance with international \nstandards of human rights and put itself on the side of international \npeace and stability.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President I rise today to \nhonor Bob Hill of Bow, NH. Mr. Hill was recently named Citizen of the \nYear by the Greater Concord Chamber of Commerce.\n  Each year the Greater Concord Chamber of Commerce selects a man or \nwoman who has made significant contributions to the standard of living \nin the community of Concord and its surrounding towns. The chamber of \ncommerce looks for an individual who displays a commitment to others, \ndemonstrates leadership, concern and dedication. Bob Hill, the winner \nthis year, was surprised he was recognized. However, Bob's modesty \nunderestimates the honorable and admirable characteristics he has \nclearly shown.\n  Bob was honored for his numerous contributions to community \norganizations. He serves on the boards of the YMCA, the Capitol Center \nfor the Arts, and the Concord Boys and Young People Club. Bob has also \nraised funds for Camp Spaulding in New Hampshire, allowing low- and \nmoderate-income families the opportunity to send their children to \ncamp. This cause is especially dear to Bob's heart because he attended \nCamp Spaulding as a young boy and has first-hand knowledge of the \nbenefits. Bob is also known to lend a helping hand in any area. He is \nnot afraid to give his time and energies to a cause of which he has \nlimited knowledge, but a great interest. For example, Bob was \ninstrumental in taking the Capitol Center for the Arts from an idea and \nmaking it a reality. Friends and colleagues refer to him as a warm and \nstraightforward man, known for passionately tackling tasks and one who \nadamantly believes in giving back to the community.\n  As a testament to Bob's unselfish nature, in his acceptance speech he \nspent little time talking about his achievements, but rather recalled \nthe achievements and memories of others. Bob commented that law \nenforcement officials do not receive the daily recognition they \ndeserve. He asked the audience of over 300 for a moment of silence for \nthese men and women. In addition, Bob recognized the other people in \nthe community whose accomplishments are similar to his own and who \nraise the standard of life in the community.\n  This type of commitment to one's community is extremely worthy of \nhomage. Bob is an asset to his town as well as to the State of New \nHampshire. I admire, appreciate, and commend Bob's devotion to his \nbeliefs and to the people. He is an invaluable citizen who has set an \nexample for others to follow. I commend Bob for his contributions, and \nI congratulate him for receiving the distinguished honor of Citizen of \nthe Year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/27/senate-section/article/S11240-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FIREFIGHTER ANTHONY GLOVER\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President. It is not everyday that we hear \nabout the heroic pursuits of firefighters across the Nation even though \nmany risk their lives daily to protect our communities and homes. \nFirefighter Anthony Glover is one of those heros and his efforts to \nsave the life of a fellow firefighter certainly deserve special \nrecognition.\n  Last May, the Nashville Fire Department's Engine Company No. 9 \nresponded to a multi-alarm fire. Upon arrival it was very clear that \nthe conditions of the blaze were advanced, quickly deteriorating the \nburning building. There to do their job, Firefighter Glover and Capt. \nTerry Secrest entered the building to better access the source of the \nfire. Little did the firemen know that the building was slowly \ncollapsing around them.\n  Before reaching the source of the fire, Captain Secrest's face piece \nbecame disconnected from his oxygen source, leaving the captain exposed \nto severe conditions that would surely end his life. Without \nhesitation, Firefighter Anthony Glover removed his face piece; exposing \nhimself to the unbearable conditions, in order to share his oxygen with \nCaptain Secrest. This act of courage was just the beginning in a series \nof life threatening events.\n  As the two firefighters were sharing the lone source of oxygen, \nsuper-heated gases ignited a blaze of fire, cutting the men off from \ntheir destination. A nearby exit from the flame engulfed building was \nalso blocked. Captain Secrest, overcome by the extreme conditions, was \nunable to continue. Glover, at the end of his oxygen supply, proceeded \nto drag the captain 90 feet to safety with nothing to guide him in zero \nvisibility and intense heat. Firefighter Glover navigated a maze of \nburning materials and blocked doorways before breaking through a \ncharred wall and dragging the captain and himself to safety.\n  Mr. President, Anthony Glover is a true hero. Firefighter Glover \novercame panic, fear, and the instinct to save one's own self in order \nto save the life of a fellow firefighter, regardless of putting his own \nlife in danger. Due to Firefighter Glover's heroic efforts, Captain \nSecrest survived the life threatening ordeal. Had it not been for \nGlovers selfless deed Captain Secrest would have suffered fatal \ninjuries resulting in certain death. It is only fitting that he receive \nthe Departmental Medal of Honor for this act of extraordinary heroism. \nI admire Firefighter Anthony Glover's courage and determination and \nwish him the best of luck.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/27/senate-section/article/S11240-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BOB CARTER\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ncareer of Bob Carter, an outstanding newsman, who is retiring after \nmore than four decades in the news business. Bob served for the last 28 \nyears as president and general manager of the Kentucky New Era in \nHopkinsville, KY. Bob is a great Kentuckian who has worked hard for the \npeople of his community. He is a great friend, and he truly will be \nmissed.\n  Bob was 19 years old when he started working for the Kentucky New \nEra. He took the job so he could save enough money to go to college to \nstudy architecture. But along the way, he met his future wife Ann and \ndecided to call Hopkinsville his home. His first job at the paper was \nselling ads, but after 5 years, he was named manager of the advertising \ndepartment. In 1969, Bob became president and general manager of the \npaper. At that time, the newspaper had about 30 employees and a daily \ncirculation of 7,000 readers. Today the newspaper has 82 employees, a \ncirculation of 15,500, and several holdings, including the local \ntelevision station.\n  At the beginning of his career, Bob was primarily interested in the \nbusiness aspect of the newspaper. He fought to get the newspaper \nheadquartered in its current home, and to invest heavily in new \nequipment. It's an investment that paid off. In the early 1970's, \nHopkinsville's economy began to grow and so did the Kentucky New Era. \nAnd what better way to sum it up than to quote Bob from his own \nnewspaper, ``We grabbed onto that whirlwind and rode with it.'' He went \non to add, ``We became a cheerleader for the community. We were a \nsupporter and a critic. We challenged some people to do things that \nweren't being done.''\n  Retirement in Bob's case doesn't mean that he will slow down. He will \ncontinue to serve as chairman of the Kentucky New Era Board of \nDirectors, and will work in an advisory capacity to assist his \nreplacements through the end of the year. Bob will remain active in his \ncommunity, as a member of the Association of the U.S. Army, the Chamber \nof Commerce's Military Affairs Committee, and as the newspaper's \n``ambassador'' at Fort Campbell. He will also be able to spend more \ntime with his wife, Ann, and his two daughters, Beth and Jini.\n  Mr. President, I commend Bob Carter for his outstanding service to \nthe people of Hopkinsville, KY. I ask that you and my fellow colleagues \njoin me in recognizing the career of this outstanding Kentuckian, and \nwishing him well in all his future pursuits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/27/senate-section/article/S11240-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11240-S11241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                JENNIFER HORAN OF GIRL SCOUT TROOP 3032\n\n Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. Kozo's increasingly important achievements \ninclude the last 25 years as executive director. Currently, the Boys \nand Girls Clubs of Southeastern Michigan serve more than 10,000 \nchildren in 8 area centers, with activities designed to help them \nmature into productive, responsible adults. During Mr. Kozo's tenure an \nestimated 200,000 children have benefited from his leadership, \ndetermination, and commitment.\n  Joe Kozo has been a very active member and leader since first joining \nhis local Boys and Girls Club. Mr. Kozo had always promoted the goals \nof the Boys and Girls Club of Southeastern Michigan: to build \nchildren's self-esteem, confidence, and respect for others, as well as \ndevelop healthy attitudes about life and morality.\n  Joe Kozo remains dedicated to the goals of the Boys and Girls Club of \nSoutheastern Michigan, and proved his leadership capabilities in 55 \nyears of unblemished tenure as chief operating officer. I congratulate \nMr. Kozo on his fine work, and fully support his continued efforts to \nprovide the youth of southeastern Michigan with a fun, safe, and \nnurturing environment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/27/senate-section/article/S11241-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PROTECT AMERICA'S EDUCATORS\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support \nas an original sponsor of legislation to restore the tax exemption for \nthe Teacher's Insurance Annuity Association and College Retirement \nEquities Fund's (TIAA-CREF) pension business.\n  Hidden in the depths of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, a provision \nwas included to strip TIAA-CREF of its original tax status. Repealing \nTIAA-CREF's tax exemption, which extended back almost 80 years, clearly \nconflicted with other provisions in the bill that recognize the need to \nencourage both education and retirement savings. TIAA-CREF supports \nnearly 2 million participants and over 6,000 educational and research \ninstitutions and has historically served as a model of pension \nportability and coverage.\n  In the teaching profession, pension portability is particularly \nvital. To the benefit of students, policy makers and the general \npublic, pension portability under TIAA-CREF allows professors and \neducators to share their expertise at multiple institutions without \nlosing their retirement security. TIAA-CREF's market share is limited \nby its charter to colleges, universities, independent schools and other \nnon-profit educational and research organizations.\n  In July, during debate on the Taxpayer Relief Act, 43 of my \ncolleagues in the Senate joined me in sending a letter to tax \nnegotiators urging them to reject this direct assault against America's \neducators. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the months \nahead to restore TIAA-CREF's original tax status.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/27/senate-section/article/S11241-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11241-S11242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Max Frankel, sometime head of the \nWashington Bureau of the New York Times and a wise and seasoned \nobserver of American politics, wrote about campaign finance reform in \nhis column in yesterday's New York Times magazine. I commend it to all \nSenators. We all know the one issue in campaign finance is money for \ntelevision. Ease that by providing free television time--those are \npublic airways--and as much about the problem goes away as will ever be \nmanaged in this vale of toil and sin.\n  I ask that the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                      Money: Hard, Soft and Dirty\n\n\na sure-fire solution to the campaign finance mess would be to wipe out \n                    the big bucks of tv advertising\n\n       The movement to clean up campaign financing is going \n     nowhere for the simple reason that the reformers are aiming \n     at the wrong target. They are laboring to limit the flow of \n     money into politics when they should be looking to limit the \n     candidates' need for money to pay for television time. It is \n     the staggering price of addressing the voters that drives the \n     unseemly money chase.\n       You cannot run for major office nowadays without spending \n     millions for television commercials that spread your fame, \n     shout your slogans, denounce your opponents and counteract \n     television attacks. A campaign costing $10 million for a \n     governorship or seat in the Senate is a bargain in many \n     states. Even with the priceless advantages of the White House \n     at his command, President Clinton seems to have spent more \n     than $250 million on television ads promoting his re-election \n     last year. And he and his opponents invented breathtaking \n     strategies to evade the post-Watergate laws against \n     collecting and spending that kind of money.\n       Not even the most determined investigators have uncovered \n     the cost to taxpayers of the favors done for the donors of \n     these vast sums. Surely no honest business, union or interest \n     group would sanction large contributions if the investment \n     did not pay off. Senators gathering $6 million for a re-\n     election campaign must solicit $3,000 every day of their six \n     years in office; just imagine how grateful they become when a \n     single donor offers to cover a whole week of such beggary.\n       It would be cheaper by far if Federal and state treasuries \n     paid directly for the television time that candidates need to \n     define themselves to the public--provided they purchased no \n     commercial time of their own. Democracy would be further \n     enhanced if television stations that sold time to special \n     interest groups in election years were required, in return \n     for the use of the public spectrum, to give equal time to \n     opposing views. But so long as expensive television \n     commercials are our society's main campaign weapons, \n     politicians will not abandon the demeaning and often corrupt \n     quest for ever more money from ever more suspect sources.\n       That is why President Clinton gave only lip service to \n     campaign finance reform during his first term. And though \n     he claims to favor it now, he has dropped the essential \n     element of free television time. Does anyone really \n     believe that Al Gore wants to be held to the spending \n     limits envisioned by the Watergate reforms of 20 years \n     ago--a TV budget of a mere $100 million when he runs for \n     President in two years? Would any rational Republican want \n     such a limit for a campaign against an already widely \n     known Vice President? Money flows toward power like water \n     downhill, and so long as they need money, politicians will \n     contrive to get it. All efforts to restrict the flow will \n     only force it deeper underground.\n       In the parlance of campaign finance, candidates are \n     supposed to traffic only in ``hard'' money--money gathered \n     and spent in amounts that are strictly limited and monitored. \n     Responding to the high cost of television, however, both \n     parties have conspired to greatly exceed the limits with \n     ``soft'' money--contributions that national, state, county \n     and local party organizations may collect and spend freely \n     provided only that the television messages they produce are \n     disguised to appear ``uncoordinated'' with any candidate's \n     campaign.\n       Reforms, led by Senators John McCain and Russell Feingold, \n     thought they could restore restraint by simply outlawing soft \n     money. But they soon realized that banning soft money would \n     put a premium on ``slimy'' money--the money that candidates \n     steer to like-minded interest groups, which then produce \n     ``independent'' commercials and use them in support of \n     favored candidates. So the reformers decided that the \n     Government would have to police commercials to prevent the \n     subterfuge, and they have convinced themselves that the \n     Supreme Court would countenance such censorship. Fat chance.\n       Yet even if the soft and slimy variants were prohibited, \n     political money would reappear in liquid or vaporous form. \n     The Annenberg Public Policy Center has compiled a catalogue \n     of two dozen ``issue groups''--from the Americans for Limited \n     Terms to Women for Tax Reform--that spent about $150 million \n     for political ads in 1995-95, most of them targeted for or \n     against specific candidates. These groups call themselves \n     ``educational'' rather than political and are effectively \n     beyond Government regulation. Most are also able to reward \n     their donors with tax exemptions. Thus the ads for shrewdly \n     positioned candidates who ``support the police'' or \n     ``counteract global warming'' could tap into taxpayer \n     subsidies of up to 40 percent. Similarly subsidized are the \n     ``foundations'' that both parties have learned to create in \n     election seasons to ``teach'' a certain kind of history or to \n     ``register'' voters of a certain persuasion.\n       Senators McCain and Feingold were once well aware of the \n     folly of trying to dam up this flow of money without \n     simultaneously reducing the politicians' need for it. Their \n     original proposal called for television stations to \n     compensate the public for the use of the airways by giving \n     candidates a generous supply of free air time. But they were \n     forced to drop that idea to get their bill to the Senate \n     floor, a compromise that left them sponsoring a measure bound \n     to make a bad situation even worse.\n       When campaigning for a seat in Congress costs 10 or more \n     times the amount earned by\n\n[[Page S11242]]\n\n     its occupant and when it takes half a billion to run for \n     President, who can compete? Mainly the wealthy or those \n     beholden to the wealthy. There is no point dreaming of a law \n     that says ``you may not'' so long as the political system \n     daily teaches the participants ``you must.'' Until the \n     candidates for office in America are relieved of the costly \n     burden of buying television time, the scandals will \n     grow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/27/senate-section/article/S11241-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LIBRARY OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise to commemorate the \nstaff and governing board of the Ann Arbor District Library for earning \ndistinction as the 1997 Library of the Year. Through their hard work \nand commitment to the Ann Arbor community, they turned a series of \ndifficult circumstances into a winning outcome, and have recently been \nrecognized by the Library Journal and Gale Research, Inc., for their \naccomplishments.\n  The hallmark of their success came through the reorganization of the \nlibrary's administrative structure while continuing and expanding the \nlibrary's community service. Through high-speed communications lines, \ncomputer training, and expanded programming, the Ann Arbor District \nLibrary has served its patrons well by using new technology to give the \ncommunity greater access to the world.\n  Although worthy of praise for its past accomplishments, the \nlibrarians and staff are committed to continuing this record of \nimprovement. Expansion of staff development programs and a maintained \ncommitment to improving service, the Ann Arbor District Library is one \nof Michigan's finest examples of the success which can be achieved when \nlocal residents band together in pursuit of a common goal. On behalf of \nthe U.S. Senate, I would like to give a special thanks for their \nefforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/27/senate-section/article/S11242-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SUPPORTING THE PRESIDENT'S ACTION TO ELIMINATE DISCRIMINATORY TRADE \n         PRACTICES BY JAPAN RELATING TO INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING\n\n  Mr. ENZI.
